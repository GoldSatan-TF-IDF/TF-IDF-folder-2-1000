john matthews the last witness prologue april th montreal canada there are times when all hope seems lost when every precept and foundation previously held as true seems to have been torn down or to have faded into insignificance and all that surrounds and lies ahead is grey desolation and while those feelings may not last long perhaps only moments when they hit they are allconsuming they form a high impenetrable wall beyond which nothing else can be seen elena waldren was gripped by such dark contemplation darker than shed ever known before as she sat parked in montreals rue sturbain thousands of miles from her home in dorset on probably the most important quest of her fortyfive years her passenger a ten yearold romanian girl who at one time had been as close as her own daughter though had become practically a stranger the past two years she shook her head that was part of the problem right there but she couldnt keep them all under her wings forever shed pulled in hurriedly to the side and the afternoon traffic flowed past becoming heavier now towards the rush hour rain pattered against her windscreen slanting slightly with a fresh breeze off the st lawrence elena remained oblivious to everything beyond her own thoughts her head buried in the crook of her right arm braced against the steering wheel how could she have been so wrong about everything shed always thought shed seen so much lived so many rollercoaster troughs and peaks that there could be few surprises left the one advantage of the overforties and now in only two days half of her past had been completely rewritten are you okay lorena asked yes i just need a minute ill be fine fine the police wire had been out for a while now probably since their trail through france and no doubt soon her face would be on tv news bulletins and for what her own quest now at a deadend and the danger that had led her to take such drastic action and drag young lorena on this odyssey as so many people kept telling her all along was probably imagined for the first time elena woke up to just how much she was out of her depth she was just an aid worker from a backwater dorset village home shared with her pipesmoking unassuming husband and two children running the gauntlet with police across two continents was far removed from any past experience she could draw upon but at least she now knew his name georges donatiens twentynine years and shed missed him by only days never to be seen again cruel fate all she had or would ever have was his name on a scrap of paper and the few brief reminiscent stories from the donatiens georges georges donatiens she whispered the name almost as an incantation as if that might suddenly bring a clearer image to mind beyond the few stark smiling photos shed scanned at the donatiens something to help fill that twentynine year void she felt nothing now but cold and empty and she braced her head firmer into her arm to quell her bodys trembling tears were close but she swallowed hard biting them back lorena had been through enough half of it imagined or not to see her now so distressed she took a fresh breath and sighed it out it would probably have been just as bad if she had met him started to sow the first seeds of attachment only for him then to be taken brutally away either way the pain now would have been the same she started to shake off her dark mood lift her head but lorenas muttered ele and her suddenly aware of a figure by the car made her look up sharper brown uniform one hand by the gun holster the other reaching out the rcmp officer tapped at her window signalling for her to wind it down one february th montreal canada two minutes over now hes late dont worry hell show michel chenouda sounded confident but inside it was just one more worry to stack with the mountain of others that had built excruciatingly over the last hour of the setup four of his rcmp team were with him in the floor of the warehouse overlooking the st lawrence dockside the other three in an unmarked car around the corner and dead centre in their nightsight binoculars frame was their mark tony savard waiting on roman lacaille and his men it was c that night and savards breath showed heavy on the air three years tracking in the shadows of the lacailles montreals leading crime family and now hopefully finally michel would nail them the lacailles had put up a strong legitimate business front over recent years but chenouda was convinced they were secretly behind eastern canadas largest drugs supply network then eleven months ago with the murder of eric leduc one of the networks key men he had the confirmation he wanted roman lacaille was responsible for the murder had pulled the trigger himself in a fit of rage they heard it first from the cars driver when pressured over a vice bust but he refused to officially testify and finger roman lacaille and five months later he was dead a boating accident that left only two other witnesses tony savard and georges donatiens but donatiens was too much family for them to hope hed testify so theyd piled on the pressure with savard if he didnt come forward hed be next to go the same way finally savard cut a deal the only problem was that unlike donatiens who was in the back of the car when leduc was shot savard was standing outside the car on watch he hadnt seen roman lacaille actually pull the trigger there was also the problem of roman lacailles likely plea of selfdefence the plan now was therefore a meeting with roman lacaille to discuss general business and almost jokingly bytheway savard would comment about the mess of cleaning up after leduc couldnt you have shot him out of the car we were still finding bits of him there two days later once roman lacaille opened up about the shooting savard would then press a bit about the gun on the floor not being leducs normal piece to try and break his selfdefence story and theyd get it all on tape enough hopefully to attends somethings happening vehicle approaching fast but its not lacailles beamer its a black van stopping back doors opening two men getting out somethings wrong theyre wearing ski masks chac his closest aide in the rcmp was main lookout chac moved quickly aside and let michel chenouda look through the binoculars michel watched as a startled tony savard was bundled into the back of the van looking sharply over his shoulder a silent plea for help michel reached for the radio mike move now two men have just grabbed savard black chevy venture no sign of lacaille and were not even sure its his men so get close so that youre ready to cut in on them when i say michel had switched to english for the command the driver mark was only three years up from ottawa and michel liked to use english with those for whom like him french was a second language now more than ever he couldnt risk even a splitsecond delay for the driver to understand as the backup car swung into view a faint night mist swirling opaque in its beam the van was already heading off a gap of maybe eighty yards between them michel estimated but closing quickly with the car having gained momentum sixty yards fifty but as they came to the end of the warehouse block and the first intersection michel watched in horror a large double trailer cut suddenly across just after the van had passed the squad car braked hard and slued to an angle stopping just yards short they beeped flashed their lights and shouted furiously but the truck driver simply lifted his palms and shouted back in defensive protest only when badges were frantically waved and their cherry siren was put on the roof and fired up did he start moving though even then only slowly the van was long gone at that moment savards voice came over clearly on sound jesus whats happening whats going on only silence returned nobody answered michel watched the screenfinder dot recede rapidly out of the dockside continuing straight for a moment before bleeping and flashing at a tangent theyve turned off either at lafontaine or ontario heading east he hissed into the radiomike looks like theyre headed downtown were going to cut across and back you up michel grabbed the screenfinder and directed two of his men to come with him the other to stay with chac they took the stairs at a flying run two and three at a time michels heart pounded hard and heavy almost in time with the screen dot his breath rasped short he was heavier than hed have liked and at moments like this it told michel took the passenger seat and the youngest of them a lanky twentynine year old montreal anglophile named phil reeves drove his heavier twelve years older bulldogexpressioned quebecois partner maury legault sat in the back in age build and countenance michel was practically a hybrid between them except that in certain lights and at certain angles his high cheekbones and the slight almond slope of his dark brown eyes gave away his part mohawk ancestry but now as they sped off and he caught his own reflection briefly in the side window he looked as hangdog as maury defeated three years work funnelled now into only frantic minutes and it was all fast slipping away michel watched the dot bleep deeper as they approached lafontaine he could tell now that the van was on ontario the next cross street he raised chac on the radiophone anything on sound nothing significant some rustling and movement traffic sounds in the background but no voices nothing since savard asked whats happ even over the radio mike michel heard what had stopped chac midsentence a faint background crunching and a strangled guttural maird followed by some indiscernible mumbling from savard at that same instant the screenfinder dot disappeared no no please no michel closed his eyes for a second as he made the breathless plea he swallowed hard fearing the worst with his next question have you still got sound chac yeah still there heavier rustling now and savards breathings more laboured now hes coughing or sounds like him the others wouldnt come over that clearly michel slowly let out his breath and opened his eyes again thank god at least they still had that the directional signal had been in savards watch the wire because they knew savard would likely be searched vigorously by lacaille was sewn discreetly into his coat lapel theyve obviously only smashed his watch lets just pray they dont find the sound bug but he knew it was practically worthless unless savards captors actually spoke gave some clue of where they were headed link me in directly to the wire chac were running blind here maybe ill be able to pick up something from background traffic and city sounds as soon as the wire feed came over the radio michel turned it up the hiss of static and faint rustling filled the car michel immersed himself in it blotting out completely the surrounding traffic noise as phil sped along rue ontario after a moment he could pick out the rise and fall of tony savards breathing a faint cough a swallow then a few seconds later tony savards voice came over loud and distorted where are we going i cant see nothing with this hood on michel clenched a fist tight savard was trying to tell them what he could no answer returned michel honed in on background sounds beyond savards breathing traffic drone a horn beeping faint distant siren wail michel turned the radio down he couldnt hear the siren himself from outside which worried him it meant that they werent anywhere close to savard michel patched in to the other car mark can you hear a siren from where you are moments pause then no nothing here weve lost directional but weve still got wire sound any fix on where theyre headed from where you are we followed what you last gave us east on ontario but no sign of them they gained a good half mile when the truck blocked us they could be anywhere okay ill let you know if we pick up anything useful on the wire back to savards breathing the siren had now faded from the background then after a moment in gruff quebecois the first comment from savards captors wheres our drugs money tony quoi what drugs money i dont know nothing about that i was there for a meet with roman lacaille dont know the man personally now again wheres our money tony i dont know dont know what youre chacs voice crashed in more action here roman lacailles beamers just rolled up hes getting out with another man bold as you like looking around michels stomach fell whatever was going to happen with savard in the van lacaille was distancing himself from it i turned up as arranged but hed already gone and half a dozen rcmps know it couldnt have been me because they were watching me through binoculars now hes lifting his arms in a where is he gesture michel could picture lacaille gloating as he made the gesture he closed his eyes and solemnly nodded okay nothing we can do with him though and he knows it put me back to the wire staying with lacaille wasnt productive last time where is it tony i told you i dont even know what youre talking about a heavy pause background traffic drone returning savards breathing laboured expectant then finally well if hes not going to talk michel tried to discern what was happening from the next sounds heavier rustling movement closer to savard then a guttural espece dencoule what the fu uuugh receding quickly into two more grunts and heavier breathing from savard now raspier more nasal michel guessed that savards mouth had been bound the rustling and movement receded then after a second a fresh voice came from the front bon so where are we going to do this i thought saint norbert no not good the car park theres only five storeys he might survive the drop could still be alive and talking when he hits the deck michels hopes leapt some fix on where they were headed at last but at the same time the reason for the binding became clear and he felt for savard they knew hed start shouting and screaming at their new turn in conversation michel could hear savard hyperventilating with fear muffled grunts mixed with rapid nasal wheezing so where would you suggest place philips car park eight floors straight down he wont survive that savards grunting and wheezing was almost out of control combined now with some heavy rustling and thudding he was obviously writhing around in protest the only movement he was left with michel wished that he could reach out and hug and reassure savard dont worry we know where theyre headed now well get to them before they can throw you phil turned and dropped two blocks down to rene levesque to make better time heading into the city centre and michel alerted mark on the radio phone we just got it on the wire that thats where theyre headed saint catherine entrance or philips we dont know you take saint catherine well take philips silence again only the sound over the wire of savards muffled laboured breathing as phil floored it through the nighttime streets touching seventy within the cocoon of darkness of the hood savards terror had reached a peak hed found breathing difficult with the restriction of the hood as it was had felt his own hot breath bouncing back at him but now with something bound tight around his mouth over the outside pushing the cloth in it was practically impossible with each breath the cloth felt as if it was sucking in gagging him and the binding had also pulled the hood tight against his nose upon hearing hed be thrown hed writhed and banged about partly in fear partly in vain hope of catching the attention of cars or people they passed but as the blood pounding through his head hit a hot white crescendo and he felt nauseous and almost blacked out he stopped he reminded himself of the wire theyd handled him roughly bundling him into the van and tying his hands and feet but he was pretty sure it was still there michel had no doubt heard where they were headed but with two entrances and five sections to the car park what were the chances of michel and his men getting to him in time they could already be two minutes behind as it was and could easily lose another couple of minutes finding the right section of car park it did him little good if michel caught up with his captors after he was thrown the nighttime streets flashed by michels window with most cars pulling hurriedly over with the sound of their approaching siren but half the time michel kept his eyes closed immersing himself deeper into the sounds on the wire savards fractured muffled breathing falling almost in time with his own rapid pulse feeling himself almost there alongside savard to will home the message well be there dont worry well be there to stop them it took only just over three minutes before they hit the place philips entrance and started up mark had radioed in twenty seconds before as he entered on saint catherine street and was now winding furiously up towards the third floor at michels instruction theyd both killed their sirens for the last few hundred yards of approach michel didnt want savards captors suddenly taking fright and shifting him somewhere else as phil swung into the fifth floor michel heard over the wire the van stopping a door opening closing then the vans back doors opening okay should be good here yeah savards breathing again started to become more rapid frantic brief writhing and thudding and then some rustling and short muffled grunts from savard michel pictured him being lifted out michel clutched tight at the radio mike mark should be near the top now weve just heard the van stop theyre taking savard out see anything from where you are were just coming onto the eight now brief background squeal of tyres then no nothing on this first stretch michel drummed the flat of his left hand against the dashboard as they sped along the sixth and swung into the ramp for the seventh come on savard felt himself being carried away from the van heard his carriers short shuffling footsteps but they were crunching slightly as if they had crepe soles then after a few yards they paused and his back was partly rested on the thighs of the man behind okay one last chance tony savard felt the binding around his mouth being untied and pulled free his frantic breathing eased a bit without the constriction wheres our money i told you i dont you i dont know he gasped please youve got to believe me phil squealed up the last part of the ramp to the eighth michels eyes darted rapidly around as the car straightened and sped along he couldnt see anything immediately no sign of the van or savard being carried he pointed maybe in the next section then into the mike anything where you are no nothing weve already checked two sections one more to go michels hand drummed the dashboard more frantically as phil swung into the next section from the voices over the wire he knew there were probably only seconds left we havent got to believe anything tony last chance fucks sake guys i really dont know savard spluttered if i did dont you think id tell you a seconds silence then the other mans voice lets get him closer to the edge hes not going to talk faint rustling and movement repeated mumbled protests from savard then well not clear this rail unless we swing him yeah savard lost it then his protests and shouts of no hit screaming pitch as michel imagined him being swung marks voice came over the radiophone nothing here weve searched every corner okay phil had just turned into the last section and michels eyes swung wildly around savards screaming filled his head he had to be somewhere here somewhere suddenly his rapid dashboard drumming changed to a sharp slap stop stop the car now stop phil screeched to a halt and michel immediately swung his door open listening two on the count of three the words were all but drowned out by savards raucous screaming michel could hear everything clearly over the wire but from the surrounding car park sounds there was nothing yet savard was screaming loud enough to be heard two blocks away he didnt even trouble to check with mark hed have heard it from marks section from where he was michels stomach fell a chill running through him savard was nowhere nearby hed been taken somewhere else there was nothing they could do to save him three savard had already pictured clearly in his mind the eightfloor drop and his final scream as he was swung high for the last time rattled his throat raw and then he was sailing free his mind spinning fastreel frames within the hoods darkness to match his sensation of falling his scream echoing down through the floors praying that mercifully hed black out halfway down gaining momentum ever faster faster until but the ground hit earlier than he expected maybe no more than a few yards and it felt soft his fall dampened by a cushioning of snow his screaming faltered into nervous staccato exhalations he hardly dared believe that he was still alive thats just a practice run tony if you dont tell us where the money is were going to do it for real savard swallowed hard the terror was quickly back he wished now they had killed him he couldnt face going through the knifeedge fear and anticipation a second time he was shaking uncontrollably his voice quavering jesus guys jesusss i told you i dont know no more chances tony this is it savard felt himself being lifted again no no no michel could hardly bear to listen any more knowing with certainty that there was nothing they could do to help but the voices gripped him in almost morbid fascination though now he was honing in more on background sounds stillness virtual silence no traffic or background city drone they should have picked up on that earlier when savard was lifted from the van if they had they might have known they were wasting their time at place philips might have been able to we havent got time to move him somewhere else to do this i reckon we should finish it here i dont know brief hesitation from the other man then resignedly on a faint sigh daccord i suppose youre right no point in dragging it out hes not going to talk savard felt himself being put back down on the ground he was confused werent they at a high building somewhere but then there wouldnt be snow on the ground at place philips car park which also explained why michel and his men hadnt caught up with him for the first time savard also tuned in to the virtual silence around where was he michel could almost feel savards surprise coming across in waves with his screaming having subsided into rapid fractured breathing from background sounds michel judged they were outside the city by at least a few miles a deserted field or some wasteground perhaps lacaille had duped them at every turn had probably known about the wire and had set up a cassette in the van with the drone of city traffic to throw them but then how had they replicated the ramps for savard not to realize he wasnt winding up through the levels of a car park michel could picture the guns being taken out the silencers attached and he closed his eyes of all the moments savard had protested and screamed in fear now it would be justified yet savard merely continued to breathe heavily like some confused trapped animal it seemed both ironic and unfair that his last moment should end like this and as the gun shots finally came two in quick succession and another seconds later michel did savards screaming for him no nooo his eyes scrunched tight his bellowing plea reverberated through the cavernous car park and as its echo died all that was left was the sound over the wire of footsteps crunching on snow receding quickly away from savards body two elena flicked through the report in her lap as nadine moore wended through the dorset lanes a weak sun threw dappled light through the trees and at points nadine glanced across and pointed at the file prompting thats the last interview with the ryalls there eleven months ago two months later the official adoption order was made and we were out of the picture and no alerts since elena asked nothing to raise concern that would normally only come up through lorenas school or gp but no nothing nadine forced a tight smile after a second but anyway it seems youre the one she first turns to for help seems so elena nodded and mirrored nadines smile she looked again at the file flicking back a page the call had come through at almost am lorenas voice had been hushed and elena got a picture of her sneaking in the call while the rest of the house was asleep sorry to disturb you elena but something troubles me here and i didnt know who else to phone lorenas english had improved tenfold in the fifteen months since shed last seen her its no trouble at all now tell me whats the problem its mr ryall he comes to my bedroom late at night and i i dont feel comfortable in what way im not sure a heavy swallow from lorena her breath coming short perhaps i shouldnt have called im sorry elena reassured her that shed done the right thing then pressed if ryall was actually touching or interfering with her a long silence too long before lorenas uncertain no then i dont know and something incoherent in romanian lorenas voice quavering heavily before she finally lapsed into muted sobbing seconds later she hung up elena didnt sleep well afterwards contemplated phoning back or actually jumping in the car and heading to the ryalls but lorenas obvious fear of disturbing the house and her own concern that breaking procedure could upset progress if anything was happening held her in check she phoned social services first thing in the morning she received the call back from nadine moore forty minutes later that lorena had requested she also be at the interview she says shell feel more comfortable talking about it with you there elena had only met nadine moore once before when nadine first took over lorenas case halfway through the final adoption assessment year nadine was a brighteyed twentyeight year old with crinkly brown hair framing round wireframe glasses strong contrast to her older more matronly predecessor who often spoke in tired condescending tones as if long ago shed adopted the style to deal with errant parents and found it difficult to switch off maybe in another ten years all the verve and optimism would be knocked out of nadine as well elena herself might at one time have been described as matronly but her hectic schedule the last five years with the aid agency jumping aboard last minute flights or supply trucks headed for bucharest or bosnia had rapidly burned off the pounds now she looked more like a trim midforties jackieo the first touches of pepper showing in her dark hair in looks though decidedly not in temperament or in her outlook on life shed taken more after her cypriot father than her english mother elena buried herself back in the report the final assessment findings told her little beyond what she already knew about the ryalls from when theyd started the whole process in bucharest cameron thomas ryall founder and head of ctr microtech married to nicola anne ryall housewife by occupation for the past fourteen years his second marriage no children of their own though mr ryall has a son michael now from his first marriage one previously adopted daughter mikaya originally from cambodia mikaya is now and at university wellestablished businessman comfortable and secure home environment onecareer household prospective mother always at home previous successful history with adoption ryall had collected star points at every turn and perhaps elena reflected hed known that all along lorenas adoption planned with the same skilled precision as his last takeover bid the only thing which might have gone against ryall was the highflying nature of his business but his main plant and hq was only eight miles away by far the areas largest greenfield industrial enterprise and nearby chelbornes largest employer not only had ryall avoided the absentee father label of so many highpowered executives hed also gained the final cream topping of local champion of the people you still feel quite close to her dont you nadine was looking across with a slightly pained quizzical expression shed purposely sidestepped feel responsible for it might make it sound like a forced obligation how long did you know her in bucharest there was a gap in the middle but twenty months altogether elena nodded and yes i suppose i do they were all special to her in some way all children between the three orphanages in romania now all settled in new homes hopefully safe and secure around britain but how to explain that lorena had stood out touched an even more poignant chord above the rest a natural closeness and affinity you feel with a particular child yet cant pinpoint exactly why or perhaps part of it was due to what lorena had suffered after the first orphanage closed and her eleven months rough on the streets one of bucharests sewer children before reemerging elena still partly blamed herself for that elena looked up as nadine swung into the ryalls driveway an impenetrable rhododendron hedge ten foot high spread out each side of double wroughtiron black gates almost as high local champion of the people any move against ryall wouldnt be popular if anything was happening but elena prayed that it was all a false alarm first and foremost for lorenas benefit she pushed away the contemplation that it was also partly for herself as abruptly as it had struck possible failure with one of the eighteen just wasnt an option nadine got out of the car and buzzed the security intercom by the gate elena felt the walls and barriers go up as they went deeper into the ryall house they were ushered into a large open entrance hallway then on through a narrow walnutpanelled passage by the ryalls maid who according to nadines report also doubled as a cook and was at the house daytimes four days a week cameron ryall maintained it was important not only that they should have time together privately as a family but also that they shouldnt become reliant on a housekeeper to the extent that she might become viewed as a surrogate mother by lorena shell have enough trouble adapting to one new mother without any such confusion ryall certainly knew how to score the points elena bit at her lip she should avoid slipping into prior judgement it wouldnt help her have a clear view now ryall might have been being sincere through halfopen doors as they went along elena got a glimpse of a large oak kitchen and another room with a piano and some books games and toys stacked to one side the centrepiece though was the room they were led into a highceilinged drawing room some thirtyfive foot square overlooking was a booklined gallery and the walnutpanelled theme had been continued with a painting centrepiece on each panel elena recognized two originals by thornhill the dorset landscape artist but on the far wall to their left were more modern works slightly out of keeping with the edwardian house two abstracts elena didnt recognize then a chagall and a seurat they werent close enough for her to tell if they were original or not the maid asked if they wanted tea or coffee they both took coffee nadine white elena black the few minutes with her out of the room preparing the only sound the remote clink and clatter of china were tense they didnt speak there was only one thing now on their minds and it wasnt a conversation they could risk being overheard their eyes were naturally drawn to the oversized picture window at the end of the room at least twelvefoot high and aspshaped it provided a dramatic view over the pool and the gardens beyond flower beds and linking paths flanked one side and the lawn tabled steadily down so that they could see clearly over the bordering rhododendron hedge towards the sweep of swanagebay the wind was steady and a succession of distant whitecaps were just discernible dancing through the sea haze approaching the house from the car theyd clearly heard the ebb and surge of the sea but now it was deathly silent muted through eighteeninch thick stone walls and doubleglazing as if on cue the ryalls walked in just before the coffees were brought through eager smiles and handshakes all round cameron ryall looked keenly at elena as he held her hand a second longer nice to see you again last time we met was cerneit orphanage bucharest elena filled the gap yes yes of course must be almost two years now they sat down the awkward silence settled again for a second and as nadine opened by explaining the reason for her visit now that lorena had confided in a schoolfriend about some worries and concerns at home the ryalls expressions quickly became solemn this had been the final gameplan agreed with lorena lorena hadnt wanted it known that shed phoned directly about any worries elena was watching cameron ryalls expression closely no visible flinching just his eyes darkening a shade heavier concern as explained we do have to follow these things up nadine took a quick sip of coffee so after speaking to you i would like ten or fifteen minutes alone with lorena if thats okay yes of course cameron ryall said he sat forward forearms rested on his thighs a picture of eager compliance nicola ryall nodded her concurrence eyes quickly downcast who would be taking the lead became painfully clear standard role positioning between them or had she been coached this could be delicate leave it to me when nadine had phoned and made the appointment with nicola ryall nicola hadnt made it clear whether mr ryall would also be present the meeting had been arranged for pm just after lorena returned from school cameron ryall obviously considered it important enough to leave early and let his global conglomerate run itself for a couple of hours or perhaps he had deeper reasons for concern elena pushed the thought back again cameron ryall was stocky his darkbrown hair heavily greying at the sides and apart from a few extra pounds looked very much the same as when shed last seen him his most startling feature was his dark blue eyes which in certain lights depending on their dilation appeared almost black he was dressed casually in dark green rugby shirt and jeans the softedged caring foster parent when shed first met him at the orphanage he was wearing an oversized parka as if he was a warzone journalist then later at the bucharest adoption agency a dark grey suit and tie man for all seasons nicola was a slim attractive blonde but her hair was cut short and she was wearing a smallcheck plaid skirt and plain cream blouse as if she was trying to appear more prim reserved and countrysetish or perhaps this was more of her husbands stagemanagement less glamour will give the impression of less selfinterest youll come across as more motherly nadine opened up her folder on her knees pen poised she glanced down briefly at some typewritten notes before turning to a blank page and looking back at the ryalls now has lorena mentioned anything to you recently about something troubling her the ryalls looked at each other briefly cameron ryall answered with a slight shrug no not that we can think of anything at all nadine pressed however small and irrelevant it might have seemed at the time nicola ryalls expression lifted as if a fresh thought had suddenly struck well she did complain not long ago about problems with some schoolwork history i think it was yes yes cameron ryall quickly picked up her spoken english is quite good now but she still has problems with written english and for history she has to do a fair few essays he forced a weak smile she finds them something of a struggle nadine started in on the rest of her check list progress with other subjects friends at school and how was lorena settling in generally outside friends and interests lorena was settling in fairly well no problems with other subjects that the ryalls could think of a few friends made at school only one from outside that they knew of after a moment elena partly faded it out nadine had prewarned that with much of it routine questioning shed be largely redundant until they talked to lorena she was there to comfort and reassure lorena nothing more cameron ryall answered politely and methodically with his wife providing only sporadic input eagerness to satisfy any concern was the general tone no hint of defensiveness or agitation that elena could pick up on elena got up and walked towards the picture window it wasnt so much her redundancy but frustration that suddenly settled hard left to her shed have bulldozed in with a chain of direct awkward questions and by now had the ryalls pinned in the corner but that wasnt as she knew from past often tedious experience how the social services worked procedure questions had to be open devoid of angle subjects must have the opportunity to volunteer information without undue prompt or influence elena looked out over the gardens and pool with the winter light fast dying and a chill wind it looked inhospitable she recalled two photos lorena had sent with a short note five months back one of her in the pool with an oversized beach ball in bright sunshine the other of her blowing out the candles at her april birthday party with a few friends probably taken in the breakfast or dining room happy days with her new family few signs now of a childs joyful activity thought elena the atmosphere in the house was flat and sterile pretty much like nadines interview technique the softlysoftly approach might work with some but elena doubted it would with cameron ryall she remembered from the first adoption report that hed been a practising barrister for three years before going into business with now almost thirty years of hardedged trading under his belt he could run rings round the nadines of this world but then nadine had told her that probably little would be revealed until they spoke to lorena directly and then if anything looked suspicious she would hit the ryalls with bigger guns at a second interview perhaps her attachment to lorena was making her too anxious for a quick solution which was no doubt why nadine had reminded her so pointedly to stay in the background with the ryalls however angry and indignant you might feel and after the initial introductions with lorena and putting her at ease leave everything to me her husband gordon too had tried to calm her crusading spirit when shed told him about the meeting with the ryalls it may all come to nothing you dont know yet and even if something is happening its not your problem anymore its the social services you did your bit by caring for those children until they found homes you cant be expected to stay responsible for them all forever but that was the problem she did still feel responsible for them all and in that moment she felt a strong pang of guilt that in twelve years of marriage shed never told gordon why perhaps he was right it would all come to nothing and she would never have to tell him it would stay her secret as it had done already for half her life no no theres no problems are you sure nadine let out a slow breath this is quite important its why were here a moments hesitation from lorena but it was quickly brushed aside no really everythings fine i was worrying for nothing they were in the music and playroom theyd passed earlier lorena had been ushered in from her room by the maid then theyd been left alone the door closed there had been a tense moment towards the end of interviewing the ryalls when nadine had asked a similar question moving closer to home is there anything here troubling lorena that you can think of elena had turned from the window and moved a few paces back towards the ryalls focusing intensely and staring almost straight through them not sure whether she was still looking for telltale signs or was hoping to unnerve them cameron ryall had answered the same as lorena though without any hesitation lorena appeared to have grown almost two inches since elena had last seen her was now close to five foot her hair was long and straight and somewhere between lightbrown and corn with just a hint of red in certain lights her eyes were a large and expressive bluegrey with a sprinkling of pale green flecks in a few years she could no doubt pass for a stunning prepubescent catwalk model and perhaps that had partly contributed because she was so pretty it was easy to believe the worst about cameron ryall elena tried to detach herself from that thought but it was difficult lorenas english was nearperfect though still with a distinct easterneuropean accent its edges now smoothed by a gentle dorset lilt the combination was quite cute and endearing theyd hugged enthusiastically on greeting and elena felt reluctant to part clinging on to lorenas hands a moment longer as lorena asked if she got the photos and she in turn commented that lorena had grown and asked how she was but it became quickly painfully obvious that there were few safe footholds without getting to the business at hand so elena made the introductions and offered some encouragement nadines here to help you just tell her everything in your own words in your own time then let nadine take over nadine started with the softer ground covered earlier with the ryalls friends at school or from outside how she was settling in generally problems with her history essays before zeroing in with questions about problems at home but it seemed to have served little purpose lorena was still edgy ill at ease nadine was uncertain whether to ease back and circle slowly in again or to be more direct she glanced at elena whose frustration and impatience was painfully evident the risk with a direct blast was that lorena could clamup completely but there was probably little to lose she certainly wasnt getting anywhere with the soft approach when you phoned elena you mentioned that mr ryall was coming to your bedside late at night and that this disturbed you why did this disturb you it just did thats all lorena looked down for a second he used to come to read me bedtime stories but i told him i was too old for that now but has he still continued to come yes but less now now its more for when i have the dreams than to read me stories the dreams yes i lorena glanced towards elena i used to have bad dreams that i was underground trapped couldnt breathe she put one hand up dramatically to her throat they stopped finally but not long ago maybe six or seven months they come back again elena could see that nadine was still grappling for a full picture and cut in lorena lived rough on the streets of bucharest for almost a year after the first orphanage closed in the winter to keep warm this often meant them making their beds and sleeping underground in the sewers for a while afterwards at the second orphanage before she came to england she was plagued by nightmares about that i see nadine nodded and when mr ryall comes to your bedside over those dreams does anything else happen anything that might disturb you lorenas brow knitted in what way nadine swallowed imperceptibly and stayed staring steadily at lorena has there ever been any physical contact lorena blinked slowly absorbing the weight of the question no well only him soothing me stroking my head you know to calm me nothing else lorena shook her head no nothing elena remembered many a night soothing lorenas brow at the cerneit orphanage and now cameron ryall had taken her place elena noticed the dark fearful shadows return to lorenas eyes with talk about the dreams but did something else lay behind those shadows natural discomfort of a young woman fast growingup with a man visiting her bedroom late at night or was something more worrying going on was this a safe and secure loving home everything lorena had always dreamed of and more or a gilded prison lorena would have grown up quicker than most elena reminded herself shed have had to think and act like an adult just to survive on the streets of bucharest shed had so little real childhood and perhaps as a result she just couldnt relate to the cinderella and pinkribbons images cameron ryall was trying to sell with his bedtime stories she was keen to embrace adulthood quicker so that she could blot out her childhood completely kid herself it never happened maybe the only way she felt she could be truly happy certainly it would explain a lot how often do you have these nightmares now nadine asked sometimes ill have none for two weeks or so then two or three might come only days apart and is it always mr ryall that comes to see to you or does mrs ryall sometimes come lorena shook her head its usually him she usually only comes to me when hes away somewhere on a trip and does mr ryall visit your room late for any other reason now apart from the dreams does he read you some stories still no no stories anymore but sometimes he comes to my room just to talk you know asking about schoolwork how im getting on things like that does that happen often lorena shrugged mainly when hes been away somewhere and hasnt seen me for a few days apart from that not much nadine asked a few more questions trying to get it clear just how often mr ryall visited her room late at night one way or another ryall managed to visit at least once a week sometimes twice a week how about when mr ryall is around you at other times do you feel comfortable then yes its its okay a flicker of uncertainty for a second then lorena shrugged nonchalantly no problems and mrs ryall you get on well with her yes you never feel uncomfortable around her at any time no lorena smiled faintly as if the question was slightly ridiculous elena watched lorena intently throughout the exchange the atmosphere in the room became tenser with each question and elenas emotions were seriously divided a chink of uncertainty in lorenas eyes and shed feel like screaming stop shying away covering up if you dont say something speak up we cant help you youll stay trapped here at ryalls mercy but when lorena appeared surefooted and confident it would hit that other part of her that wanted desperately to believe that nothing was happening though maybe she too was selectively erasing unwilling to accept any possible horrors after what lorena had suffered in romania nadine took a fresh breath so more or less all of your problems stem from your discomfort with mr ryall coming to your bed late at night now that youre older is that about it nadine tapped her pen on her folder as she waited on lorenas answer lorena merely nodded chewing lightly at her bottom lip so if and when you have these bad dreams if we ask that mrs ryall comes to you rather than mr ryall i suppose that would solve your problem i suppose it would lorena fluttered her eyes down in submission for a second before looking up again embarrassment at having wasted their time or still holding back on something it was difficult to tell well see what we can do though nadine didnt know where shed even start she could hardly reproach ryall for showing due care and concern for lorena and telling ryall that he couldnt tuck his favourite stepdaughter in bed after a few days away would be even more absurd she pressed one last time if nothing else to save later criticism from elena that she might not have been thorough and are you absolutely sure theres nothing else troubling you concerning mr ryall either connected with him coming to your room late at night or otherwise lorenas eyes flickered as if she was searching for something that was finally just out of reach no no theres nothing thats it but by the way lorena looked fleetingly back towards the closed door as if towards the ryalls in the drawing room beyond elena knew in that instant that something was wrong cameron ryall had coached lorena or for some reason she was covering up for him savards body was found at am only yards from the taxiway of an old abandoned airfield two miles south of longueuil an area used by the man who discovered the body for early morning training of his greyhound the first police arrived at am and within twenty minutes had been joined by two more squad cars forensics and a meatwagon the call to michel came through just after am disturbing him from barely two hours sleep hed spent till am with his team backtracking and trawling some likely spots for savard and sleep had been difficult in coming savards voice on tape and the images that went with it had kept him turning uneasily michel arrived minutes after the meatwagon the first dusk light had only just started to break so michel took a torch with him the photos being snapped of savards body cut starkly through the near darkness competing with the flashing beacon on a nearby squad car the only other light was from torchlight playing and the headlamps of two vehicles left on one pulled close to savards body three of the police squad and everyone from forensics michel knew one of the homicide sergeants lucien feutres looked up as he approached michel brief smile that fell into a shrug and stern grimace rough break im sorry yeah i know michel nodded dolefully looking around thanks savards body was heavily illuminated by the headlamps blue spray body outline markings already made in the snow so michel played his torchlight mainly to each side who found him first feutres glanced back and pointed with one thumb guy over there he was walking his dog want to speak with him michel looked at the figure at the back of the milling activity probably finished his questioning a while ago and wishing now he hadnt found the body and subjected himself to fifty minutes of standing around in the cold his greyhound looked equally as bored tongue lolling as it looked to one side no no its okay normally he would have had a chain of questions and a hundred more for forensics how many shots time of attack how did he get here but he knew practically everything from the wire tape he played his torchlight around again as feutres went over to tell the man he could go he picked out quickly the repetitive circles of tyre tracks but it took a moment more to find the main thing he was looking for a ramp made up of packed snow thirty yards away sharp slope one side gradual almost imperceptible decline the other they hit the sharp side on each loop and savard gets the sensation theyre rising up through the car park his gaze swung back to the main circle of light and savards body it was curled almost in foetal position a light dusting of snow covering it from a fresh fall overnight the hood pulled back to the crown for photoidentification was dark blue and savards hands had been tied in front by rope there were a number of other small things he could have clarified at this point but he also knew now why he was shying from asking the questions each answer would bring back savards screams too vividly when already they were still ringing in his ears he would read the reports later and make a few calls some distance at least an arctic wind whipped across the flat expanse of grass and overgrown taxiways michel felt it cut through him like an icy hatchet taking his breath away his eyes watered michel took one last lingering look at savards body and slowly closed his eyes theyd obviously headed due south straight over the jaquescartierbridge rather than downtown roman and jeanpaul lacaille had played them for mugs at every turn the finder smashed the wire left in place and traffic sounds played the snow ramp savard was already practically dead as theyd watched through binoculars him waiting on roman lacaille only they hadnt known it youll be safe well be watching every moment guarding your back weeks of meetings before savard was finally confident enough to go ahead dont worry nothing will happen to you theyd assured yet savard had died like a trussed chicken his final moments filled with terror michel was now doubly determined to nail the lacailles but now only one witness remained georges donatiens and donatiens was practically family engaged to marry jeanpaul lacailles only daughter simone the apple of his eye michel opened his eyes again taking in the horror of what had happened to savard in an effort to will himself on but already he knew it was an almost hopeless quest theyd have to move mountains to get georges donatiens to testify three this was georges donatiens favourite time of day that hushed suspended moment just as the first morning rays broke through especially given who lay beside him and what theyd been doing simone he admired her for a moment in the soft first light the long sweep of her olivebrown back her wavy black hair slightly in disarray and spilling over one shoulder he gently traced down her spine with two fingers the trick as always was to touch her so lightly that she wouldnt awaken he pulled the sheets lower to give his hand freer range then continued tracing down down until he reached the cleft of her buttocks he felt a subtle tremor run through her body her subconscious registering that it liked what he was doing but hopefully not enough to make her stir not yet he held his hand motionless and held his breath too suddenly conscious of his own heartbeat in the lull until her tremoring subsided then he started tracing slowly back up the ridge of her spine if he was really careful sometimes he could spin it out for a few minutes tracing delicately as light as spiders feet up and down each time being more daring going lower deeper between the cleft of her buttocks feeling the heat there and her slightly damp from the night before or was that just from now revelling in her light trembling almost seeing the goose bumps raise as the first light hit her body pausing again breathlessly like a frightened schoolboy each time she looked close to she groaned throatily and moved one leg he waited a few seconds beyond the groan dying but with one leg now pushed wide he felt drawn to go still lower rather than higher her heat and moisture pulled him in like a magnet and he couldnt resist pushing his luck that extra inch by probing gently with one finger she groaned again he froze and was about to pull his hand away when her leg shifted back again trapping him and the groan became a soft purr uuhhhm cest bon she rolled towards him bringing her left leg up so that it rested on his thigh she smiled at him and blinked good morning good morning georges smiled back tightly one of her hands traced deftly down his stomach and she watched his expression closely as she gripped him and started gently stroking a short hiss of pleasure his eyes closed for a second before shaking it quickly off and glancing towards the alarm clock am georges started mentally totting up the time for coffee shower dressing and driving the six miles to cartierville look simone i dont have time for this now ive got an eightthirty breakfast meeting with your father i wont make it if we fool around if you cant handle the beast you shouldnt wake the beast she pouted challengingly still stroking who said that i dont know she shrugged voltaire maybe rabelais sounds more like cousteau to me another small shrug then she quickly ducked down and started kissing down his stomach he tensed no simone no its nice too nice but i really dont have time now she paid no attention kept kissing down and a light shudder ran up from his calves and through his body as he felt her take him into her mouth he surrendered to it for a moment before starting to protest again pleasssse simone not now i just dont the ringing phone startled them both she broke off looking at it accusingly georges squinted at the callmonitor display its your father he pulled away from her and lunged for the phone yes georges jeanpaul sorry to disturb you but i forgot to ask when we last spoke did everything go okay with the revised plans from the architect yes they did and ive got them with me the main reason for their urgent meeting now georges had been away five days in puerto vallarta to oversee jeanpauls new investments there twentyseven hole golf course with integral development of two hotels a casino and greenside bungalows and villas the roundingoff of jeanpauls mexican portfolio which already included three hotels a marina development another casino and four clubs between cancun and puerto vallarta but delays had threatened on this latest project when one of the hotels hit a survey problem no problems now jeanpaul confirmed no everythings fine now i eerrr georges bit his lip simone had reached out and was stroking him again he shook his head and frowned heavily at her she smiled back challengingly and continued stroking moving her mouth so teasingly close that he could feel her hot breath on him her tongue snaked out and he shook his head wilder silently mouthing no he hastily cleared his throat err i made sure i was there this time for the survey theres nothing now to stop it being passed thats good a seconds silence from jeanpaul as he absorbed this or perhaps he was distracted with something else his end then are you okay yes fine fine beads of sweat popped on his forehead he watched in horror simones mouth move closer lips pouting touch of bad throat thats all brief wry smile he spoke in quick bursts still fearful of what was coming probably the sudden change in temperature she held him in limbo a second longer mouth poised but finally at just an inch away she blew a kiss smiled lasciviously and pulled back again simone was enjoying this he thought pretty much a continuation of the rest of their relationship her fighting for his attention over and above her father at times she was impossible but perhaps at six years his junior she was still allowed to be being born into one of montreals wealthiest families hadnt helped especially with a father so keen to indulge her not only to compensate for her losing her mother clair when she was only eight but also no doubt for the many unseen horrors being played out behind the scenes while she was growingup jeanpaul lacaille had made sure that his only daughters childhood was sugarcoated id better go georges said as he watched simone straddle him panicking what she might do next while her father was still on the phone get everything ready for our meeting yeah okay jeanpaul mumbled distractedly then his voice came back sharply sudden afterthought oh one more thing have you seen this mornings news yet no not yet ive been too busy in bed with your daughter he could feel simones heat pressing hard against him she reached for him started stroking again he could tell from her sly smile what she was about to do he prayed that jeanpaul signed off quickly there was an item on about tony savard jeanpaul sighed heavily he was killed last night his body was found in the early hours this morning oh i see that killed it instantly simone wouldnt be able to do much with him now regardless of effort now i know this falls outside what i originally brought you in to be concerned with but given the background with savard i think its something we should discuss i agree georges felt numb cold and found it hard to free either clear thoughts or speech simone rolled off and curled to one side frowning but it wasnt a look of spoilt petulance more of concern warmth compassion joiedevivre sharp wit all the traits that over the sixteen months of their relationship had drawn him more in love with her when hed finally dug beneath the preconception guided as much by his own staunch work ethic and views about her cosseted life than reality that she was spoilt but for a moment he wished that spoilt simone was back he could kid himself that life was still just a playful tug of war between her and her father he could forget what jeanpaul had just said about savard and could ignore simones look of heavy concern mirroring the panic that must have swept across his own face as he contemplated the chain of nightmare problems that savards death could ignite he just hoped his first assumption was wrong the fat man took the first photo as the couple came out of the apartment they leaned into each other a few paces from the building a quick parting kiss and the girl ran just ahead he followed their movements with a quick burst on the cameras motordrive they were an attractive young couple the girl with long wavy black hair the man close to six foot and athletic looking with darkbrown hair cut short in a spiky crewcut and dressed well in light grey suit and black crombie though the fat man knew from old photos hed spied in the mans apartment that when his hair was longer it also waved slightly and that the suit from the many hed flicked through in his wardrobe was no doubt armani or yves stlaurent they say that people are attracted to those with similar features and certainly there were some similarities between the two large brown eyes his perhaps slightly heavierhooded than hers but both with the same olive skin tones hinting of a mediterranean or latin background she got into a bright turquoise fiat sports coupe parked just in front while he went through a side door towards the garage the fat man took another few snaps as she looked around and pulled out then a minute later some of the man as the automatic garage doors opened and his grey lexus edged out simone lacaille and georges donatiens montreals golden couple seen at all the right parties and openings and a few of the wrong ones and regularly photographed his own snapshots aside the apartment building was in the fashionable westmount district and its penthouses of which donatiens was one had luxurious splitlevel atrium living rooms affording breathtaking views over the city and the st lawrence after thoroughly searching the apartment eight months back the fat man had stood for a moment admiring the view breath misting the atrium glass contemplating ruefully just how far out of reach such an apartment was on his rcmp policemans salary the fat man by now knew everything about them their every last move she stayed over at donatiens two or three times a week but always the first night after hed been away on a business trip she would head to lachaine amp roy on rue st jaques one of montreals leading advertising agencies where she was an accounts manager her father didnt have shares in the company he was careful not to be overt with his influence over her career she would rebel but he did have interests in two of its major accounts donatiens first day back would head downtown to the lacaille company office on cote du beaver hall or to the lacaille residence in cartierville the one and only apartment search all those months back had been at the request of michel chenouda his immediate boss and closest rcmp confidante theyd worked together as partners when michel had first arrived from toronto but within the year the fat man left the rcmp after a bungled vice bust led to an attempted hit on one of his key drugs informants and went into private investigation technically he was still private when hed let himself into donatiens apartment michel had already smoothed the way for him rejoining the rcmp and all the papers were rubberstamped but the breakin was ten days before he was handed his badge and gun no doubt michel would have loved to have the apartment searched again now but for the risk michel wouldnt involve a badged officer and there were no other private gumshoes michel would trust with something like that hed been a keen amateur photographer in his late teens and private work had given him the opportunity to hone his skills the mountain of photos hed taken of the lacailles over the past eighteen months michel would rigorously scan for telltale signs simone lacailles engagement ring when it first appeared new contacts of roman or jeanpaul lacaille not recognized from past file photos and hed meanwhile be looking at artistic merit light angle composition now with michels wake up call at am more photos theyve just found savards body im here with forensics donatiens is the only one left now well need to shadow him closer than ever michel was on his mobile and sounded slightly out of breath the fat man was worried that it was becoming an obsession the reason for the obsession he understood but still it worried him a dozen or so more photos to add to a file of hundreds and probably now enough box files of paperwork to fill a truck he let out a heavy exhalation as he started up checked his mirror and pulled out perhaps it was the familiarity of the routine or perhaps his preoccupation with getting back to the station in time to develop the photos before his meeting with michel but he didnt notice the man parked fifty yards behind who had pulled up just as he was taking his second stream of photos chac chac good stuff good stuff michel hailed as he watched the fat man pin five fresh photos from his mornings effort on the corkboard the c was soft so the uninformed often made the mistake that the nickname had an english derivation from the fact that the man was built like a shack but it had come from his habit of saying chacun son gout hed originally been known as chacun then finally just chac eighteen photos already covered the corkboard providing a quickglance photo profile of the lacailles and anyone vital connected with them michel stood studying the photos from two yards back then threw a quick eye over the others and back again as if measuring how they slotted into the whole picture so still very much in love he said looks that way michel leant in closer studying finer detail in the photos what had he been hoping for some small sign of cracks in their relationship so it might be easier to get donatiens to testify against the lacailles after all she was only in her early twenties impetuous strongwilled and probably wasnt yet settled emotionally before donatiens shed had a chain of different boyfriends seemed to change them every other month michel shook his head as he studied the look on simones face kissing donatiens goodbye wishful thinking their relationship had held solid for sixteen months and looked stronger now than ever but the photo he was finally drawn to most was of donatiens just as simone headed away perhaps business hadnt gone smoothly in mexico but michel doubted that was it the expression of concern suddenly gripping donatiens looked too heavy severe donatiens knew about savard whens the wedding planned michel asked early july the eighth michel nodded thoughtfully still scanning the photos he already knew the date off by heart but a changed date might hint of some cooling off he was getting desperate theyd all be there michel reflected slim dapper jeanpaul his midbrown hair greying heavily in sweeps at each side but still looking younger than his fiftyone years his mother lillian who now spent more time at the familys holiday residence in martinique than in montreal deeply religious her permanent tan designer clothes and hennatinted grey hair at times seemed vain superficial affectations at odds with her firmrooted nature with all revolving around the church and family but she looked well and her age showed only with her slightly matronly bulk and resultantly slowed gait simones younger brother raphael now in grade at montreals top catholic school st francis where he shone at art and literature but to his fathers concern he was poor at math showed little future promise for business and spent his every spare moment rollerblading or in the winter snowboarding they looked like any other newmoneyed montreal family probably more uppermiddle than top drawer until you got to the photos of roman and the lacaille familys key enforcer frank massenat so often in romans shadow then the underlying menace of the lacaille family became evident roman was four years younger than jeanpaul and while only two inches smaller at fiveeight looked shorter still due to his broadness and bulk while jeanpaul had been on the tennis court or jogging roman had been in the gym pumping iron or pummelling a punchbag until he was ready to drop he was known as the bull not just through his build but because of his habit of keeping his head low and looking up at people swaying it slightly as he weighed their words a motion that would become more pronounced if he started to doubt or didnt like what they were saying he reminded people of a bull measuring a matador for attack and there had been many horror stories of roman striking out swiftly and unpredictably head first ending any potential argument or fight by caving in his opponents face head and shoulders above roman frank massenat was a giant seven years ago when he first joined the lacailles he was at the peak of physical condition but a diet of salami and pastrami rolls beer and rich creamsauce meals had steadily mounted on the pounds so that now he looked like a big lumbering bear with a beer pot with his eyes heavilybagged and jowls he looked almost ten years older than his thirtyfour years in contrast jon larsen the familys consiglieri and adviser for almost twenty years would fit in well in a family wedding snap close to sixty slim now mostly bald with only a ring of grey hair he could easily have passed for a family uncle or perhaps jeanpauls older brother michels gaze swung back to the photos of jeanpaul in the end jeanpaul always absorbed him most not only because as the head of the organization thats where his main focus should be but because he never could quite work him out at least with roman and frank what you saw you got michel was a keen modern jazz fan and he remembered once being surprised at seeing jeanpaul lacaille at the citys main jazz club biddles on rue aylmer he later learnt that indeed jeanpaul was a strong jazz aficionado particularly of the new latin jazz michel found it hard to separate in his mind this urbane charming persona now also presumably with good music tastes from what he knew to be the coldhearted brutal reality that here was a man who as easily as he smiled and nodded along with his guests in the jazz club could with the same curt nod signal that a man be brutalised or his life taken the two just didnt sit comfortably together though charming smiling socialite jeanpaul was the image being pushed more and more these past few years trying to convince everyone that hed turned his back on crime and had become legit michel didnt believe it for a minute three photos michel had purposely pinned to one side of the main spread the three main losses of the lacaille family pascal jeanpaul and romans younger brother shot dead five years ago at the age of thirtyeight the tragic end result of a battle with the rival cacchione family their father jeanpierre dead fourteen months later many said of a broken rather than failed heart pascal had been his favourite then just three years ago jeanpauls second wife stephanie after a long battle with breast cancer the lacailles had seen their fair share of tragedy these past years reflected michel but even that jeanpaul had sought to turn to advantage hed held up pascals death like a banner as the main reason behind his decision to move the family away from crime jeanpaul was a consummate audience player would have made a good politician michel rubbed his eyes when do you hope to hear from arnaiz within a few hours certainly before lunch chac forced a tight smile hopefully he might have something interesting this time michel nodded but he doubted it chac was just trying to lift his spirits after the calamity with savard on the last five trips by donatiens to mexico the trips to cuba they hadnt monitored enrique arnaiz had turned up nothing arnaiz was a private investigator chac had dug up from his old card file the federalis wouldnt get involved unless or until donatiens was seen with known drug associates or other criminals so each time arnaiz would have donatiens followed and those he met with photographed for comparison with federali files michel wasnt hopeful of anything turning up this time either that was the other conundrum was donatiens a cleancut moneyman only dealing with the lacailles legitimate enterprises or one of the sharpest and most efficient moneylaunderers theyd ever encountered what do you think chac is donatiens what jeanpaul keeps selling him as the golden boy making good on his shiny new leaf as a legitimate businessman or are his hands dirty along with the rest of them though the question had been posed before with savard gone chac knew that it was now far more significant he weighed his answer carefully on the surface at least he looks clean however much that goes against the grain with the lacailles past form but from our point of view i suppose its best if he is clean if hes in with the rest of them all the way well never get him to testify thats true michel voice was flat nonchalant he took a fresh breath now all weve got to do is get him to turn his back on the love of his life and betray her entire family yeah thats all chac agreed drolly then after a few seconds uneasy silence one thing we never did work out was what donatiens was doing in the car the night leduc was shot the only time it looked like he might be getting his hands dirty no that we never did michel stayed staring contemplatively at the spread of photos ahead as if they might magically provide the answer and after a moment chac left him alone with the lacaille family and his thoughts he worked quickly and efficiently through the penthouse he found a ventilation grill in the main ensuite bathroom to take one bug the hollow base of a table lamp in the dining room another then he paused hard pushed for good places for the others a lot of flat smooth surfaces minimalist furniture and decor in the end he cut a tiny hole in the fabric beneath the main sofa and tucked a bug far to one side with one finger did the same under the beds in all three bedrooms then removed and clipped back a kitchen cabinet plinth to conceal the final room bug the phone bugs one in the drawing room and one in the bedroom he put in place last carlo funicelli stood for a moment in the middle of the apartment looking from one extremity to the other contemplating whether hed left any dead sound areas the guest bathroom and maybe the first yard of entrance corridor hopefully not too many vital meaningful conversations would take place there funicelli headed out and down the five floors in the elevator the doorman gave him the same curt disinterested nod as when hed walked in as he did with anyone who had a key and seemed to know where they were going from his prebreakin briefing the keys had come courtesy of simone lacaille donatiens was too careful with his set but she had a spare set to let herself in for when he was working late of a night she was due to come over she might start preparing dinner for them or if hed been away for a few days often shed restock the fridge love but she was careless with her set often left them laying around she regularly spent weekends at the lacaille family home particularly when her father arranged gettogethers and it had been easy for roman to grab the keys for a few hours to have them copied an hour and a half till the predesignated time for him to call funicelli headed downtown and killed it having coffee and windowbrowsing in the underground place villemarie complex it was too cold in the city to spend any length of time above ground he called from a phone booth there rather than on his mobile as instructed yeah city desk roman lacailles voice answering had a slight echo to it he was leaning on the bar in their sherbrooke club a cavernous basement thirty metres square spread before him the bar staff had all left long before the first twilight the bar manager azy after helping him go through the nights till receipts and the cleaners had just twenty minutes ago shut the door behind them he was on his own its done the place is live and kicking funicelli said when when can we listen in romans tone was pushy impatient now its already rolling the receiving monitors set up only a few blocks away anything more than ten decibels sound and itll kick in the tape will start rolling great work give the indian a cigar roman smiled his pet names for chenouda sitting bull or last of the mohicans he knew the last thing chenouda would be getting right now was a cigar unless he was bending over to receive it with the savard fiasco maybe he should rename him sitting duck id like to go see the setup some time listen in probably best one evening more action roman chuckled yeah sure when they arranged it for two evenings time when simone was next due to stay over and signed off roman looked thoughtfully at the club ahead after hanging up at night it would be a sea of lithe writhing naked bodies under wildly rotating crimson and blue penlight spots heavy male hands eagerly reaching out to slip ten and twenty dollar bills into tangas or garters upmarket lapdancing club the last bastion of the lacaille familys past criminal empire five years back theyd had associations with a chain of downtown and lavalle clip joints and massage parlours rolling in big bucks this now was the furthest jeanpaul had decreed they should go with the flesh trade but it was less drastic at least than his moves away from every other area drugs racketeering loansharking fencing in those he hadnt even kept a foot in the door so after a decade and a half of making sure all of that ran and ran smoothly this is what he was left with counting the takings in a pussy club oh sure they were opening another in six months and then there were the two night clubs and the restaurant but it hardly compensated this squeakyclean crusade might suit jeanpaul but little thought had been given to anyone else especially him but then jeanpaul never had given him much thought a tradition no doubt passed down from their father jeanpierre pascal and jeanpaul had always been his favourites now with jeanpaul it was always raphael simone john larsen roughly in that order or more recently donatiens the new golden boy they all no doubt looked upon him as just a dumb ox a muscleheaded oldschool moustache pete and becoming more of a dinosaur by the day with jeanpauls new business direction redundant most of his life hed spent in jeanpauls shadow but no more he had more streetsmarts than the lot of them put together and the time to make his play couldnt be riper though everything with savard had gone well half of it had been laid in his lap by the rcmp the next stage with donatiens wouldnt be so easy the pressure mounted steadily through the day just before lunch maury legault put his head round michels door with the news that theyd found the van used with savard left abandoned in a saint hubert sidestreet maury was tentative hesitant as he passed on the information even though michel had made it clear first thing to the entire squad room that it should be the prime focus of their efforts no let up until we see a breakthrough but then interruptions had been few throughout the morning as if people were apprehensive about entering the inner sanctum of his office with its photomontage homage to the lacailles and when he did venture out the normal frantic hubbub of the squad room would noticeably subside and a few eyes would avert and look down suddenly absorbed with desk paperwork it was as if hed had a close relative die not an informant was it the original registration he asked maury no the plates had been switched the original to match the chassis number was reported stolen in the early hours yesterday morning we pulled it up just minutes ago on the bulletin board pretty much as michel had expected maury informed him that forensics and two mechanics were going over the van with a fine tooth comb but michel wasnt holding his breath one of the lacailles past enterprises had been an autochop shop they knew how to make sure a vehicle was left clean three hours later maury came back with the news that it looked like it had been steam and chemically cleaned michel simply nodded and cast his eyes down numbed more by a pervading lethargy that this would be the pattern at every turn than his lack of surprise and partly lack of sleep he hadnt slept well the night before the savard sting operation turning over in his mind all manner of possible scenarios now only two hours last night he felt ragged trying desperately to avoid his department head chiefinspector pelletier hadnt helped he already knew what was coming pelletier had left him alone the first few hours of the day respect for savard or the dead case but then pelletier obviously thought sufficient mourning time had passed so that michel could explain clearly and succinctly how everything could have fallen apart so disastrously the calls one just before lunch and another early afternoon came from maggie laberge pelletiers pa through christine hebert one of two constables on the open squadroom message desk always protocol and distance with pelletier michel parried the first call by passing the message through hebert that he knew what it was about but he was still busy gaining vital information to be able to give pelletier the full picture with the second call he spoke directly to laberge and sold her more of the same were close to breakthrough on a couple of key things each extra second i spend close on top of everything right now is vital hopefully things should free up in an hour or two soon after chac informed him that yet again arnaiz in mexico hadnt turned up anything suspicious on donatiens then maury came in with the news about the steamcleaning each extra hour he delayed only made the picture worse not better screwup of the year and any hope of redemption was fast disappearing with each extra head that appeared at his door or fresh file slapped on his desk early forensic findings had been the biggest body blow some blood had been found under the fingernails of savards right hand the hope had been that savard might have clawed the neck or face of one of his abductors or even through their clothing as he frantically grappled at their arms when they swung him but the report concluded that it was savards own blood the first shot had struck his chest and hed put his hand up defensively to the wound before the final two shots came one to the neck one to his head the report made chilling reading brought savards screams back too vividly just before signing off almost as a bytheway laberge informed him that they had to liaise on time because pelletier wanted tom maitland crown attorney to also be present at the meeting michel knew what that meant while pelletier might justifiably reach the conclusion that a potentially prosecutable case now looked out of reach it would carry more weight with maitlands legaleagle viewpoint at his right arm michel knew then why he was delaying not so much for a fresh lead to salvage something from last nights disaster the past track record with the lacailles had long ago made him cynical but because he was desperately seeking an angle to convince them and himself there was still mileage left in the case if he presented donatiens soon to become part of the lacaille family as his only remaining hope theyd kill the case straightaway he took a hasty sip of his sixth coffee of the day trying to clear his thoughts and focus but no ready answers came the only light relief of the day came when chac responded gruffly well they can suck my dick when hed explained the pending dilemma with facing pelletier and maitland fearing that theyd now want to hastily close the lacaille file is that because youve already asked everyone else and theyve said no chac beamed broadly despite the barb and michel realized then how impossibly intense hed been all morning the pall hovering over the squad room each time he opened the door was not just in respect of savards death but also for the possibly dead case and his feared reaction chac was simply glad to see a chink of his old self resurface but the mood died quickly as chac reminded him that even if he convinced pelletier to keep the case open at best it would only give him a few months grace once donatiens is married its game over and roman lacaille knows it his desk phone started ringing he looked through his glass screen towards the squad room christine hebert was looking over at him pointing to the receiver no doubt laberge chasing for pelletier again a film of sweat broke on his forehead he couldnt delay any more what would he say maybe bluff for now say that they had reliable inside information that donatiens would soon aboutturn and testify that at least might give him a week or twos grace to either make good on that claim or come up with something else the seed of the idea was still only halfformed as he picked up the receiver at the end of the third ring yes its your wife sandra hebert said he was caught off guard for a second oh right put her through she rarely phoned him hebert never termed her ex despite it now being four years theyd been parted then with her first words michel you said four oclock and its already fourtwenty he pushed back sharply from his chair suddenly remembering oh jesus yeah im right there basketball championship with a rival school with his son benjamin now nine years old if you couldnt make it or it was somehow awkward you should have said so earlier hes been looking forward so much to i know i know im there i tell you ill be with you in under ten its not often that he has things like this what happened something came up thats all he didnt want to be specific or shield behind the dramatics of the past eighteen hours the biggest case of my career has just gone down in flames besides shed heard it all before the stakeouts that ran hours over the last minute suspects and late night emergencies the steady stream of late nights crawling into bed and so little quality time with her and the children that had finally led to the collapse of their marriage shed moved to montreal so that she could have her mothers help with babysitting while she went back out to work he followed ten months later so that he could be nearer his children but history was repeating itself chac had always claimed that his absorption with the lacailles was partly to fill the void from losing his family and perhaps he was right he looked thoughtfully at his desk photo of benjamin and young angelle only six against the overbearing backdrop montage of the lacailles certainly in the last twentyfour hours his family hadnt got a lookin its completely my fault im sorry but im leaving right now he hung up swiftly before sandra could draw breath to grill him more he grabbed his coat and was halfway across the squad room as hebert waved frantically at him its maggie laberge again wondering whether he held one hand up ill call her back from my car ten minutes no more a bit more time to refine what he was going to say he thought of little else as he sped through the traffic how would he know if donatiens was likely to turn turtle and testify their only feed from within the lacaille camp was azy menard bar manager at their night club on rue sherbrooke was it likely donatiens would confide directly in him no hed have to think of a credible gobetween to be able to sell the story he tapped his fingers on the wheel as he hit a small tailback of traffic at the first stop light on saint catherine the early rush hour was starting it was going to take him a little longer snow flecked with darkgrey slush was banked over the kerbs each side and the exhaust outflows of the cars ahead showed heavy in the freezing air chacs words spun back a few months the same was true for roman lacaille what would he do just bide his time knowing that soon hed be home dry anyway or was he determined to rid himself of every last witness to that night with leduc four is there nothing else we can do elena pressed not at this stage im afraid nadine moore let out a tired breath at the other end of the phone ive been in touch with lorenas school and gp told them to let me know if anything appears untoward with lorena physical indications obviously from her doctor but from the school all they can look out for are mood swings or problems with her work and they didnt tell you of anything theyd noticed already no id have phoned you straightaway if there was any news i know how anxious you are with the silence from the other end nadine added as you said it was just a momentary look you could well be wrong it could be nothing shy shy no elena shook her head i know lorena too well theres something wrong maybe it was just concern about the fuss caused by our visit she started to think about what might be said to her after we left i dont know elena felt herself swaying but only for a second she reminded herself that shed only seen that look on lorenas face twice before once recalling some nights in the sewer waking up with rats crawling over her then the threat of the second orphanage closing and her dread of possibly having to go back to the streets again elena knew the difference between fear and concern with lorena she was aware of a presence behind her and glanced back gordon hovered by the door to his study with a taut half smile he turned back in and she pulled her attention back to nadine more emphatically no its more than that i know nadine exhaled heavily practically a replay of their conversation after leaving the ryalls yesterday and now painfully evident that she wasnt easily going to dispel elenas worries imagined or otherwise but there was little else she could do as it was shed stretched as far as she dare go telling ryall that he should avoid visits to lorenas room late at night had been like tiptoeing through broken glass cushioning the reproach its just one of those things with girls at her age they become very secretive and selfconscious you werent to know had done little to ease ryalls pained incredulous expression with ryall not visiting her room any more hopefully that should put pay to any problems if there were problems yes hopefully elena didnt sound convinced doubt still nagged heavily at her but she sensed that nadines position was starting to become entrenched little would be gained by pressing she elicited a promise from nadine to let her know the moment anything knew came up and signed off yet it wasnt just nadine that was doubtful when shed recounted everything to gordon the night before hed questioned whether she might be reading too much into it all now that tight smile when hed heard her pressing nadine she pondered whether to broach the issue shed hoped at least for support from gordon if nothing else so as to not feel so isolated with her concerns but from his voice trailing through from his office she could tell that he was on the phone she went back to her upstairs studio to do more painting time to allow her mood to settle her thoughts to focus her painting helped with that brushstroke therapy shed spent much of the last month painting version three of the chine the steep wooded ravine leading to the sea which their house overlooked version one had been a standard landscape view which she wasnt happy with gordon had prompted her what is it that you most like about the chine that you find magical shed admitted that it was the feeling of secrecy and being protected once deep inside it with the open sea at its end representing freedom yet as she would move closer to the sea and hear its rushing surge that also came to represent all the volatility and madness out there what she was perhaps hiding away from in the chine i feel safe as if its a haven then paint that gordon had suggested good solid dependable gordon sometimes infuriatingly laidback with his slow pedantic deliberations but always intuitive the voice of reason in a storm probably why now his support was so important to her her second attempt had too much contrast between the darkness of the chine and the harsh light of the sea horizon beyond this time she was trying to capture some warmth and texture some detail and depth to the trees and foliage the faint chinks of light reflecting off the brook trickling through shed taken three photos in the summer as a guide but she knew the chine so well she could practically paint it blindfold her style of painting was conventional landscape with a hint of impressionist but became unconventional through its use of layering the habit of building the oils in layers employed by the old masters it had derived originally due to the expense of canvass so therefore the need to repaint over old paintings or the false starts of works in progress for elena she enjoyed the luxury of being able to paint over her errors until she reached perfection she considered herself not that good an artist despite now two local exhibitions and one at a small notting hill gallery when they were in london and so for her the layering became in part a device behind which she could shield her lack of ability nobody would ever know the one thing she shared with the old masters was the rich texture and depth gained through the many layers but as now she carefully dabbed and stroked she found herself becoming increasingly agitated rather than relaxed her hand started to shake on the brush the therapy this time wasnt working elena could only catch a glimpse of sea beyond the far ridge of the chine a heavy greyblue almost merging with the mist and cloud far different to the ryalls broad sea panorama seven miles up the coast but elena couldnt help contemplating if lorena was looking from her bedroom window at the same dull brooding sea wondering if anything was happening or whether shed been left alone and forgotten you dont think i should pursue it do you elena looked at gordon directly as she toyed with the last of her dessert shed tried to broach the subject twice earlier the first time shelley mcgurran her boss at the agency had phoned the second time her daughter katine walked into the kitchen halfway through them talking while preparing dinner theyd let the children leave the table early to watch tv with their desserts they were now out of earshot in the adjoining lounge its not that i think youre wrong your suspicions may very well be right something is happening gordon gave a small shrug after all you know lorena better than most its just that from your position theres little you can do youre out of the loop now and if as you say social services cant do anything youre just going to get frustrated trying to pursue it elena held gordons gaze for a second obviously her two false starts earlier had given him time to prepare hed chosen the route of lesser confrontation not wanting a heated debate over whether or not her suspicions might be right but if social services cant or wont help her who else is there to help her who else does she know in this town i know i know gordon held one hand up sighing as if exasperated that despite his efforts hed still hit a confrontational wall i think youre right to try but unless you budge social services to your way of thinking how far are you going to get even if you convince them something is happening regardless that its based only on a hunch over a worried look from lorena theyll still need something concrete to be able to pursue it as always the voice of reason but as much as she knew that annoyingly gordon was probably right what hit her strongest like the many times hed been right before was his smug knowitall overtone which would usually draw out her instinctive rebelliousness though through twelve years of marriage shed learnt to curb her worst traits so all that resulted now was her lightly chewing her bottom lip as she looked back down at her dessert sudden awkwardness with the silence when she lifted her head she glanced through the open archway to the lounge christos twelve their eldest by four years was pointing to something on the tv and making a comment to katine who was just out of view elena shook her head i mean my god shes only eighteen months older than our katine if anything is happening she must feel so so helpless and vulnerable gordon reached across the table and clasped her hand maybe theyll hit on something through her school or gp elena smiled back tightly gordon had aimed to reassure but it had backfired as a sharp reminder that those were their only hopes if nothing came to light lorena would be quickly forgotten consigned to some social services deadfile cabinet no doubt larger than any others after a second gordon asked what was it with shelley elena faltered slightly with the shift in topic before refocusing oh it was about the next supply consignment its almost ready five or six days ill ride with it to bucharest stay maybe a week between the two orphanages then catch a flight to sarajevo gordon nodded europes childneglect hotspots that had been elenas roster the past four years romania bosnia chechenya where theyd adopted katine eighteen months before elena joined the agency in fact the main driving force behind her joining we were able to help katine but shes just one child out of thousands in the same position if i can id like to be able to help more children like katine anything from two to four weeks away on each roundtrip tour then two or three weeks back in the uk helping shelley mcgurran organize the next aid consignment how are things now at the cerneit gordon asked he knew from elenas recent conversations that the cerneit was one of their most troubled orphanages weve managed to cut down on the two or three to a bed sharing but now every inch of floor space is littered with mattresses you can hardly get a foot between and just when we got the hepatitis under control there was an outbreak of scurvy what from we sent over a large consignment of oats porridge last time but they went mad with it gave it to the children for breakfast lunch and dinner werent sensible enough to balance it out with fresh fruit and veg she shook her head half smiling in disbelief the said they didnt realize and besides they claimed to be short the last couple of months on cash for food a problem with the heating boiler had forced them to spend more on building maintenance and take it out of the food budget gordon looked down for a second the point hed been circling towards was now within grasp before looking back up meaningfully thats the other thing with this now if there is a problem with lorena what do you do just turn your back on all those hundreds of other children who need your help thats unfair and you know it elena protested this is just a oneoff its not as if its the sort of thing that happens every day the point im trying to make elena is where do you draw the line youve become a surrogate mother to a lot of these children and its great that youve become so close to so many of them but you cant be a mother to the world at some stage youve got to let go let someone else take the responsibility you can only stretch yourself so far this is different and as i said unlikely to happen again elena flickered her eyes to one side towards the children in the next room gordon was right but she didnt want him to see hed hit a painful raw nerve feeling his eyes still on her she added this isnt just about my past closeness to lorena or perhaps me reading too much into the worried look in her eyes its also the atmosphere in the house and with the ryalls that tells me something is wrong in what way well she grappled for the right words tense to say the least which perhaps youd expect given the nature of our visit but i couldnt help feeling that something was being hidden and cameron ryall came across as a complete control guru isnt that also what youd expect from someone in his position cameron ryalls status warranted only sidebars in the financial pages of the national press but locally he was big news chelbornes bill gates elena shook her head no it went beyond that nicola ryall had obviously been primed but i got the strong feeling that she was actually afraid of him as she sat there hardly daring to answer or interject all i got was a picture of my mother sat there in a similar position oh right gordon exhaled a slightly defeated sigh so now finally they were getting to the root of the problem her father gordon looked down awkwardly toying with the rim of his wine glass just when he thought that finally her fathers shadow had gone from her life inevitably it would rise again like a phantom the allcontrolling figurehead who had guided or would a better word be destroyed so much of her life whose hand could be seen in practically every major step or decision shed ever made forcing her to have an abortion when she became pregnant at sixteen and then the growing gap between them finally leading to years of rebellion leaving home early the bedsits and hippie communes the protest marches and discovery trips to india and marrakech where shed ended up living for two years days where the edges became increasingly blurred in a euphoric haze of dope and dabbling with lsd before she woke up to the fact that she wasnt just rebelling against everything her father stood for she was also punishing herself eleven years shed spent pursuing alternative lifestyles theyd met three years after her return from marrakech when she was working in her uncle christoss import business and theyd married ten months later their adopted boy theyd named after her uncle who though elena would be reluctant to admit it everyone else saw as partly filling her need for a father figure but one that understood her loved her christos was also what she would have named her aborted child had it been a boy then later her desire for another adopted child a girl and the resultant urge for her to do more for other orphaned children but hers wasnt the only life shed felt had been scarred by her fathers overdominance she blamed him also for the suicide of her younger brother andreos who had knuckled under her fathers influence yet in the end felt hed not only betrayed what he truly wanted to do but regardless would never have been able to live up to his fathers demanding expectations andreos opted out in the most dramatic way possible her father had died five years ago but the scars still ran so deep that shed refused to attend the funeral but more than anyone else in her family gordon felt that shed kept her fathers memory alive with her every action through the years and now his ghost was back again in the shape of cameron ryalls dominance over nicola ryall and lorena certainly on the surface at least there were similarities with ryall her father had parlayed a s cypriotgreek trading company into britains ninth largest merchant bank but any link between them real or imagined only returned gordon full circle to one of his first concerns has it struck you that the reminder of your father might be making you read too much into it all seeing demons where they dont exist you see the surface signs with ryall then fill in the gaps to suit elena shook her head vigorously no no its more than that with ryall like what elena stared back levelly as much as shed carefully skirted around the issue it was back squarely in her lap but she could never tell gordon what had really happened with her father too many years now shed spent not only telling the lie but living it she reached across and touched gordons hand there were a lot of things i never talked about with my father nothing significant just small things which is probably why they hardly seemed worth mentioning you know its like you when know someones unbalanced way before they start wildly swinging an axe she looked down briefly at the table for inspiration you see it first in the tense way they grip a coffee cup or their reaction to someone saying something out of place or wearing something they dont like small things and its things like that i see now between ryall and his wife its its hard to put my finger on maybe no more than a hunch and maybe youre right that hunch could well be wrong gordon held her gaze for a moment before she glanced away he could tell that she was deeply troubled and while the analogy made sense her finishing on the note of so casually casting off her previous concerns made him suspicious he took a fresh sip of wine and suddenly the uneasy thought hit him like a thunderbolt my god dont tell me your father was molesting you elena threw he head back and laughed out loud at the suggestion she subdued it quickly no no my father might have been a monster in every other way but he wasnt molesting me gordon raised his glass and smiled now youve got me at it seeing demons where they dont exist elena was glad of the light relief to suddenly deadend their conversation but her half smile as she raised her glass to clink with gordons also conveniently shielded the bitter irony what in fact had happened with her father was in many ways far far worse elena became increasingly agitated as the days counted down to her going away clinging to the hope that nadine would call with fresh news from lorenas school or gp or that lorena herself would phone again but as gordon had pointed out when hed picked up on her agitation surely best if she doesnt call at least one sign that ryall is doing what hes been told and is keeping away from her room or that her first call was a false alarm but the comment only made her focus more on why she remained uneasy the abject fear shed read in lorenas face in that brief moment she was concerned that even if the problem with ryall resurfaced lorena might be too frightened to raise the alarm again also she was lorenas only possible ally yet now she was heading off deserting her the last day was particularly tense she thought of putting in a last minute call to nadine then wavered against the idea before finally going ahead only to discover that nadine was out on calls and unavailable then work and final arrangements took over checking rosters and schedules last second calls to synchronise their travel over and she was headed for a midnight shuttle in a van loaded to the brim leading the way for the main ton supply truck behind the long drive over gave her some moments to think again about lorena probably too many and at one point her diver nick twentyeight squarejawed who looked like hed stepped from a jeans advert despite his years of wild debauchery as a roadie asked her what was wrong one of the kids i placed with an english family a couple of years back im worried about her is she ill or just a bad family elena smiled tautly at the just as if it was a far lesser worry than illness she didnt want to go into detail with nick thats what we dont know yet were hoping shes mistaken nick halfshrugged sensing elenas reluctance to elaborate hope it works out thanks me too she looked to one side losing herself momentarily in the darkness of the endless line of fir trees bordering the autobahn one of nicks favourite ry cooder tracks was playing on the cd and he turned it up a notch elena found herself slipping into catnaps with the repetitive scenery and their small talk didnt return for a while with nick by then alternating with some of elenas favourites santana and peter green era fleetwood mac when they arrived in bucharest the hectic turn of events pushed all thoughts of lorena into the background a seven year old boy at the cerneit orphanage with a prolonged headache and eye strain was finally diagnosed as having meningitis two more suspected cases were discovered over the next few hours and elena was caught up in a maelstrom of activity treatment for the three cases and organizing vaccines for the remaining children with frantic calls back to london for wired funds to cover it all the boys condition worsened on the third night and she kept up a bedside vigil for five hours holding his hand and praying that they didnt lose him it struck her then gordon was right these children needed her this is where her main focus had to be she didnt have time nor the mental or emotional space to be divided on two fronts the boy rallied well the next morning and elena headed off with nick a day behind schedule to the orphanage in brasov approaching the carpathian mountains dusk was falling they looked dark and foreboding at the best of times often shrouded with mist ideal fodder for the shadowy myths and legends surrounding them but staring into the rising wall of darkness with the last dusk light as a pale trim elena was suddenly gripped by recall of the chine the one and only time shed taken lorena there on a day out to introduce her to the area before she settled in with the ryalls shed taken lorena to see her home then theyd gone down the steep wooded bank into the chine as theyd reached the bottom of the chine and the darkness of the steep wooded ravine and the dense foliage above enshrouded them shed gripped lorenas arm tight and asked her to listen listen it was eerily silent and cool and after a moment of them standing stock still they could pick out the sound of the brook running gently through the bottom of the chine towards the sea you hear that she prompted its magical down here isnt it like some secret hideaway from the rest of the world lorena hadnt answered and at first elena thought the trembling where she gripped lorenas arm was because of the coolness of the chine but the shaking became rapidly worse and lorena muttered tremulously i dont like it down here please lets go the darkness the water it lorena lurched forward practically dragging elena and within a few paces theyd hit a run they followed the bottom of the chine close to the running brook bursting through the branches and foliage as they ran frantically breathlessly towards the light of the sea horizon ahead lorenas increasingly laboured breath started lapsing into strangled sobs their legs pumped hard and their lungs ached with their rasping breath but the light never seemed to get closer the dark dense foliage remained allenveloping suffocating the light at the end still distant out of reach except for a single shaft which seemed to burn through intensify as if trying to what elena sat up startled are you okay nick repeated elena shielded her eyes from the searing headlamps of an oncoming truck shed fallen asleep it was now pitch dark catching up after her vigil with the boy last night it took her a second to adjust back to her surroundings theyd in fact burst through to the light of the open beach quite quickly their breathlessness lost on the fresh sea breeze and elena had hugged lorena tight and kissed the tears from her cheek muttering im sorry im sorry she hadnt realized that the chine might remind lorena of her sewer days suddenly the image was back of lorena standing alone at her bedroom window deserted despite gordons wise words and her own rationalising of the past fortyeight hours she couldnt help wondering if that was what lorena wanted from her now to once again help her out of the darkness towards the light but when eleven days later gordon called to tell her that lorena had phoned again it threw her into turmoil whether through once again becoming absorbed in the plight of the orphaned children or clinging to rationalisation that nothing was happening or even if it was it was no longer her problem elena wasnt sure but part of her wasnt surprised at the call and she wondered why she hadnt stayed with trusting her instincts why shed allowed herself to so easily get pulled with the flow she said that ryall stayed away from her room for a while but now hed started coming back and that she needed help no doubt your help slightly numbed elena said simply i suppose id better call nadine moore again a few seconds silence with only the faint static line hiss then gordon asked when are you heading back im not sure yet ill call you later today when i know shed decide after shed spoken to nadine moore whether to fly back straightaway or wait out the five days left of her trip and gordon i yes its okay she bit lightly at her bottom lip it doesnt matter ill see you soon anyway it just didnt feel right pouring out her heart over this faint static charged line even though the distance not having to face him might have made it easier and perhaps when she got home having harboured the secret now for so many years it still wouldnt feel right signing off elena found that she was trembling she knew now why shed so readily clung to rationalisation and it had little to do with refusing to accept the worst after everything lorena had already been through in her troubled past it had to do with her own past the wall of lies shed so carefully constructed throughout her life to gordon and everyone else but most importantly to herself what lay at the core of their adopting christos and katine and her decision to work with strifetorn orphaned children shed feared from the outset the gap in her psyche that this incident with lorena threatened to open up and part of her despite her raw instincts had tried to push it away now having to face it square on meant admitting that the founding principals of half her life had been wrong there was nothing left to stop the wall crumbling five one single incident now threatening so much practically everything hed planned and worked towards these past five years it hardly seemed believable jeanpaul lacaille shook his head as her looked through the long french windows towards the courtyard the windows were almost twice his height in keeping with the spacious highceilinged room one of four sets along its thirtyeight foot length at the rooms centre was a long refractory table with fourteen louis xiv chairs surrounding the power room where practically every key decision of the lacaille family had been made over the past three decades when his father had bought the house in the courtyard had been enclosed only on three sides with views over a formal italianate garden on the fourth but with their growing family three generations of lacailles under one roof at the same time increasing workload at home and finally the addition of a stableblock and gym his and romans respective play areas ten years ago theyd built on the fourth wing in the same style to enclose the courtyard as roman keenly pointed out the addition had also done much to improve security there was no longer open access to the power room and at the time of their battles with the cacchiones six years ago jeanpaul had moved his bedroom to the back of the house but none of their precautions were to help save pascal hed been the last theyd thought cacchione would target the house had originally been built in the s by a timber and minerals baron a small scale versailles palace to properly reflect his newfound wealth and status his fathers route to its grand portals had started with cigarette and contraband smuggling during the world war off the tyrrhenian coast of corsica a rival union corse member gained territorial advantage by paying heavier bribes to his local bastia mayor and his father felt it was time to move on he arrived in montreal in march the city was wide open then ripe for docks and construction union racketeering numbers clubs loansharking and prostitution followed with hedged construction bids his father had earned millions out of the olympics alone then soon after came narcotics like so many oldschool mafioso and union corse his father initially tried to steer clear of narcotics considering it a dirty dishonourable enterprise but in the end the profits were too large to ignore by the early s the lacaille family were one of canadas largest drug suppliers second only to the torontobased cacchione family relationships with oldman arnaldo cacchione were reasonable at least not too strained violence was minimal usually metered out to those who broke the rules from within their respective camps or the rising number of small outside gangs trying to muscle in on their territory but when young gianni cacchione took over the reins things changed he was ambitious territorially aggressive and a showdown with the cacchiones became inevitable a couple of minor soldiers were lost on each side then a cacchione family cousin before finally the retaliatory hit on pascal quiet unassuming pascal always playing backgammon or playing jazz guitar or with his nose in a book if not the companys accounts then anything from a victor hugo classic to the latest american hot seller his tastes were wide and eclectic if it werent for the family business maybe hed have had more time to establish his music career his first and main passion and of all of them hed had the least to do with the business never got involved in the muscle or enforcement side only its balance sheet that was why probably cacchione had targeted him himself roman and his father the most obvious targets were guarded to the hilt so theyd picked off pascal on the side as a message the message worked nothing was ever the same from that day his father lacked the stomach to fight on pascal had been his favourite the baby of the family and worse still he blamed roman for the hit on the cacchione cousin that had led to the retaliation with pascal internal family wrangling was intense watching his fathers clawing sorrow and increasing frailty over the following months was what finally steered jeanpaul towards his momentous decision to try and move the family away from crime in the lull theyd lost the main advantage and the best territories to cacchione in any case they could make as much by being enterprising in other ways the stock market construction more casinos and clubs roman was against the idea but with still the shadow of a finger pointing at him over pascals death his protests werent forceful jeanpaul gained the main support from family consiglieri jon larsen who pointed out that to achieve their aim theyd need a keen financial eye on board two months of headhunting by larsen and the name georges donatiens was proposed one of the youngest and hottest rising investment portfolio managers with banque du quebec donatiens had just turned in the best past year performance on pension fund portfolios an impressive but it took ten months of catandmouse courting to finally get donatiens aboard by which time it was too late for his father jeanpauls quest had by then become a burning ambition with the final seal by default of it being practically a deathbed promise to his father ill clean this business from top to bottom youll see what happened with pascal will never be allowed to happen again but it had come from the heart all he could picture in that moment was himself twenty years on mourning the death of his own son raphael then only eleven they had all the money in the world yet so much of their lives was spent looking over their shoulders and worrying about the safety and welfare of family it was no way to live his father had smiled indulgently a noble quest and one that hasnt been achieved before as far as i know but you seem determined im sure you will succeed marked contrast to his fathers previously aired doubts and concerns that as much as you might wish to escape the past the past will never allow you that escape his father had become increasingly morose and maudlin in his fading months contemplating that a sins of the father retribution had been visited on pascal due to his own dark past jeanpaul couldnt help reflecting on the messy chain of events with leduc now bouncing back solidly in their laps with tony savards murder jeanpaul took a deep breath and looked up to where two pigeons tried to nestle into the roof gables an early morning winter mist hung low obscuring half of the green copper versailles roof vapoured body heat and breath rising up from the stables towards it how much of this grand edifice had been built on spilled blood and shattered lives over the years the room where raphael had been born or where theyd celebrated simones holy communion and clinked glasses over numerous birthdays weddings and anniversaries or the rooms where his father or stephanie had been laid to rest or raphaels bedroom covered with pop and rollerblading posters like any other normal fifteenyear olds or this room now where counsel had been held on lives to be spared or lost perhaps his father had been right however hard they tried they never would be able to escape the past and maybe they simply didnt deserve to ever be able to so how would you read it georges jeanpaul asked they were sat at one end of the long dining table georges with jon larsen either side of jeanpaul at the head and the mood was tense i would go more or less with jons view georges said more or less jeanpaul raised one hand as if whisking air have we missed something how might you differ theyd spent the first twenty minutes of the meeting discussing business his round trip to mexico and cuba building schedules there shares and investment portfolio performance last quarters figures for the clubs and casinos before turning to the subject of tony savards murder georges chose his words carefully the lacaille familys past battles with the cacchiones had made this a brittle subject i agree with jon that most likely the cacchiones are behind it but we shouldnt overlook the possibility of a rising group of independents or bikers trying to play us and the cacchiones off against each other not only do they divert attention meanwhile they take advantage of the resulting vacuum jean paul nodded sagely for a second then shrugged but were no longer involved in crime we dont pose a threat no but since the incident with leduc the police for one believe that were still heavily involved and if thats a clear advantage for the cacchiones then its an advantage for others too except for one thing jon larsen offered gianni cacchione would have to lay off blame in any case because of his situation with medeiros and this whole drama with the rcmp probably came about as a byproduct of that a happy accident around in circles theyd tossed this same subject around probably more than any other at this table the past few years just when they were making good progress with their new direction it would rise up again to drag them back the most likely scenario theyd hit upon was that gianni cacchione had put leduc in the frame to divert suspicion from his own continued drugs dealing with the lacailles pulling back from drugs dealing and crime in general cacchione had eagerly filled the void but fourteen months later he had a runin with his supplier carlos medeiros head of colombias leading drugs cartel medeiros accused cacchione of shafting him out of million over the last seven shipments and promptly cut off supplies cacchione tried other suppliers in colombia but medeiros had either coterritorial or distribution arrangements with them and word had already spread cacchione was widely blackballed he found a supplier in mexico for a few months until medeiros sent a message by killing two of his key men after that nobody would touch cacchione a number of independents sprung up some of them no doubt legitimate but medeiros began to suspect that cacchione was still behind the biggest new player and supplies were threatened again at that point magically eric leduc a lacaille family lieutenant who helped roman out with security for their local clubs and casinos came into the frame as linked with this rising lead drugs network worse still they heard on the grapevine that leduc had become the subject of an rcmp investigation the police believed that the lacailles new legitimate business only direction was just a front that secretly they were still heavily involved in crime and running drugs with leduc now as the link to prove that theory jeanpaul was horrified he was certain that cacchione was behind setting up leduc primarily to throw medeiros off the scent but now it had also resulted in putting the lacailles under the spotlight with the rcmp cacchione must have been laughing up his sleeve they decided to get to leducs bank accounts before the rcmp the accounts movements were complex and so purely through necessity their original setinstone ground rules were that georges would never be involved in anything linked to their past criminal activity georges was called on to quiz leduc roman rode shotgun purely to provide psychological pressure with the silent threat of muscle should leduc decide not to be cooperative and leduc was allowed to nominate one batsman of his own he chose tony savard the only other person present that fateful night was the driver steve tremblay a doorman from one of their downtown clubs who was outside the car smoking and swapping stories with tony savard when leduc was shot the police saw leducs death as confirmation of their involvement in drugs that it was a result of their desperation to bury the traces now with savard further confirmation the spotlight would be on them stronger weve invested so much time thinking gianni cacchione is behind it all georges commented and while thats still the most likely option we shouldnt shut out all other options we could find ourselves blindsided if something else suddenly comes up i know i know jeanpaul rubbed his forehead truth to tell i should never have sent you along to confront leduc in the first place their ten month cat and mouse game to finally get georges aboard had been mainly laying strong reassurance that hed only be involved in clean business georges even stipulated that he would never get involved in any laundering the money has to be cleaned before i get to it if im meant to be a clean trader then lets start how we mean to continue yet despite all their determination that georges should never get roped into the past crime side of their business by default it had now become the topic du jour at every other meeting you werent to know it would end so badly georges said and besides who else could you have trusted to pick through leducs accounts i suppose so jeanpaul smiled tightly the reassurance offered little consolation hearing georges even talk about it was a sour reminder of just how far theyd been dragged off course dragged back to the past jeanpaul turned to jon larsen what are the police saying three shots the final one to the head professional hit probably connected with savards criminal activities and that he was under investigation no doubt part of their purge against us though that part im assuming larsen glanced at the notepad before him oh and theyre looking for a black van a chevy venture that they suspect might be connected apart from that nothing ill do some digging but we might not get much more than that jeanpaul nodded theyd pushed hard the last six months to get a stronger inside track at the rcmp but their only contact was in vice and chenoudas group handling the investigation against them was tightknit and secretive little of any value leaked out and whats romans view larsen asked i only spoke to him briefly on the phone but hes pretty sure cacchiones behind it jeanpaul tilted his head and shrugged apparently after the mess with leduc savard confided in him that he was concerned that as a friend of leducs cacchione might worry that savard had been privy to secrets about cacchiones drugs network that wasnt the case but savard feared that cacchione might believe it to be so larsen asked do you think cacchione might have been also responsible for steve tremblays death maybe jeanpaul conceded until now theyd had no reason to believe that the death of the car driver that night was anything other than what it appeared a boating accident now he was beginning to wonder georges looked down for a second was it just family allegiances and respect for jeanpaul that stopped anyone airing the other possible option that with the increasing rcmp investigation roman might be keen to bury all traces to that fateful night or was it simply because of what he knew about that night that nobody else at this table knew he could hardly scorn those allegiances when it was exactly that which had made him shy away from telling all to jeanpaul in the first place yet now that one lie or at least not telling all the truth was becoming dangerously compounded jeanpaul misread his look of concern if its cacchiones intention to target others from that night you and roman will have to be extra vigilant ill talk to roman about stepping up security great thought georges so now his future health would rest in romans hands yet hed cut himself off from being able to tell anyone why he didnt feel entirely comfortable about that okay he said meekly this whole affair with leduc has been messy and unfortunately could get messier still jeanpaul said with resignation but im determined that it not be allowed to drag us back or in any way affect our new direction i think the two of you appreciate more than most how important that is to me as jeanpaul came onto discussing with jon larsen their most recent problem of fresh licensing pressure with two clubs which they feared was all part of the general rcmp lacaillefamily purge georges suddenly felt strangely remote cutoff from their conversation the stranger perhaps hed always been the weight and grandeur of the room pressed in as it had done at that first meeting with jeanpaul and jon larsen the rococoedged ceilings and pillars the rich red drapes tied with gold brocade the highbacked louis xiv chairs the collection of family photos on a long side table with priceless ormolu clocks interspersed an altar to timefamily continuum the ornate cherub houdon statue at the far end who apparently had also made statues of voltaire and george washington struck as hed first walked in the room with the feeling that jeanpaul might see himself as a modernday napoleon but over those first few meetings georges started to see the other side of jeanpaul a warm caring family man with noble if venturesome and foolish hopes and aims an image that was keenly massaged by jon larsen in hearttohearts straight after those meetings no doubt youve read and heard all the dark stories rumoured or otherwise but dont worry ill be first to make sure that jeanpaul keeps to his promise that all that side of the lacaille family is now history jeanpauls one of the fairest men ive worked for and ive worked for a few in my time otherwise i just wouldnt have stayed around this long a hardbitten corporate lawyer for thirteen years before joining jeanpaul jon larsen perhaps saw in georges a kindred spirit a fellow exile from the business world but whether through that or not he did find himself bonding closer with larsen than anyone else in the extended lacaille family now latefifties with a strong resemblance to mr magoo except that what little ring of hair larsen had left was kept brushcut short all too often georges found they shared the same thoughts and views over the past three years theyd swapped many truths and confidences except one but it wasnt larsens pep talks that had finally convinced him to join the fold nor jeanpauls firm compliance with his request that all the money be cleaned before he started work with it nor their offer of almost double his existing pa earnings with banque du quebec with additional share bonuses in the lacailles many businesses what finally decided him was that jeanpauls quest touched his heart after their fifth or sixth meeting georges didnt remember now jeanpaul sat him down with a large brandy and told him the family background that had finally forged in his heart and soul this new direction of how pascals death had destroyed their father of him and pascal playing together as children and pascal in his teenage years talking about becoming a musician or writer of how jeanpaul himself had strongly related to that because secretly hed dreamed of becoming an architect or designer before the family business sucked him in jeanpaul had then pointed to the picture of his son raphael on the side table hes only twelve now and perhaps his dreams arent fully formed yet and hes still talking about being a train driver or an astronaut but i dont want him to end up the same as pascal in that moment georges hadnt seen a crime don but the frightened teenager whod buried his dreams then later his younger brother both in the name of familial duty yet now was frantically grappling with whether hed be able to turn back the tide before it claimed another generation georges phoned back within the week to tell jeanpaul that hed join him and from that point the quest rapidly became a crusade not just for jeanpaul to prove to himself that it could be done nor the challenge to georges as a moneyman to be able to match the sort of high returns previously notched up from crime but because their aims had started to attract keen outside interest four other leading crime families most notable among them jeanpauls close friends and past crime allies the giacomelli family of chicago were eager to see jeanpaul fair well after all if he succeeded it could provide a useful blueprint for them to follow others were more sceptical saying that it had never been done before simply because it couldnt be done lacaille was trying for the impossible suddenly their quest had become a cause celebre bets were being taken each side on whether they won or lost and it hit georges then just how monumental the stakes were succeed and he not only provided the salvation jeanpaul so badly craved but they also might show the path for countless crime families to follow fail and it was back to the dark ages and now romans rash action that one night compounded by his own lie could bring down the whole deck of cards the crushing weight of it all was almost too much to bear georges laid his right hand flat and firm on the refractory table to stop it from trembling his attention was pulled sharply back by the mention of roman we could go around in circles speculating how this whole mess might have been avoided if roman had just grappled leducs gun away or pushed his gun arm to one side but it could just as easily have backfired jeanpaul turned one palm towards georges his eyes softening either yourself or roman could have been shot regardless of the unfortunate repercussions now it was selfdefence so we have to stick together on this yes we do jon larsen agreed a tone of resigned compliance but georges noted that jon larsens eyes stayed fixed mostly on him perhaps picking up on his consternation or his slight flinch at the mention of selfdefence georges wondered how much longer he could hold out alone bearing the burden of his knowledge or whether simply too much had flowed beneath the bridge for him now to be able to tell anyone michel chenouda knew that he shouldnt have risked the lie practically as soon as the words were out how long before they have firm identification chief inspector pelletier asked nine or ten hours is their best estimate but it could take as long as twentyfour hours michel fought to keep any hesitancy out of his voice the quality on cctv photos is low so theres a lot of gaps for them to fill in ill check with them as soon as were finished and theyre pretty confident of being able to lift something positive maitland confirmed yes yes michel doodled absently on a pad so they told me at last count the truth was far removed the department dealing with photo enhancement t adjoining forensics had told him the shadows looked too heavy for a decent identity lift theyd do their best but dont hold your breath but with every other lead dead and pelletier and maitland not in the least enlivened by his hopes of getting georges donatiens to testify despite his efforts to play up the option he felt as if everything was rapidly closing in on him that pelletier and maitland had practically decided beforehand that theyd be presiding over the cases funeral and michels explanations and defences were treated merely as eulogies there was much head shaking from pelletier about the manpower and cost of the case so far with maitland throwing in his bit about the difficulty of resurrecting any workable legal structure even if donatiens might be as hopeful an option as you make out dont forget hes your last possible witness theres no possibility of his testimony being corroborated with savard at least there was the hope that donatiens facing a likely heavy sentence for being an accomplice to murder might well have turned crown evidence and corroborated savards story michel sensed that if he didnt come up with something dramatic fast they might close the file there and then although late last night hed come up with the idea of checking cctv cameras on likely routes from the dockside they hadnt hit on any possible matches until just an hour before the meeting michel painted it as brightly as he could and threw it into the impatient jaws of pelletier and maitland to hopefully stop them in their tracks it appeared to be working so far which camera did you catch them on pelletier asked heading south over jaques cartier bridge theyd fooled us that theyd headed downtown in which case we might have caught them on some of the larger building cameras but we suspected theyd headed straight over jaques cartier the camera picks up them practically flat on when theyre about fifty yards away any possibles that spring to mind from what you can see now on the photo pelletier asked no nothing yet the shadows are too heavy but hopefully when theyre lifted features will become clearer the room fell silent again michel felt the same tension return as when hed first realized everything was fast slipping away and pelletier was ready to close the case but everything was still hanging by a thread pelletier looked only partially swayed the table they sat around accommodated eight and had been carved from one single piece of teak according to pelletier the chopping board as it was known in the squad room casual day to day progress meetings took place in pelletiers adjoining office but if you were asked into the meeting room annexe inevitably it was for something serious a reprimand an internal enquiry a suspension and a badge that had to be handed over a case file to be closed the conference table became necessary because pelletier was never alone for such meetings he would always have a witness or supporter to his executions sometimes two depending on its nature as crown attorney maitland was usually present when a final nod was needed on the legal guillotine and the two made a strange contrast pelletier was heavy set and bullish with a ruddy complexion as if his blood pressure was threatening to erupt maitland was slim tall and angular and with his long nose and thinning hair had a hawkish air with the final dash of contrast from his pale wan complexion combined with his reputation for killing cases on often annoyingly small points of law this had given him the nickname the undertaker pelletier was at the head of the table with maitland in the next place down with then a seat gap between him and michel suitable distance the muted drone of traffic from twelve floors down on boulevard dorchester strained to rise through the thick plate windows and be heard above the faint swish from the air vents and the flicking of papers the only sounds at that moment pelletier was distracted for a moment by maitland looking back through his file for something so either late tonight or at the latest by midday tomorrow before we know for sure if weve got something that will give us a positive id pelletier confirmed glancing towards maitland as if his approval was also needed for any delay but maitland was still head down in his file yes michel said looking expectantly between the two of them he tapped one finger lightly on the table to ease tension as maitland continued flicking through until he realized the tapping was almost in time with his pulse and stopped maitland kept one finger in place as a marker in the file as he finally looked up pronounced freckles or the early onset of liver spots showed on the back of maitlands hands i see from your notes that donatiens marriage to simone lacaille is planned for early july yes the weekend after canada day three and a half months maitland glanced at his file again and pouted thoughtfully so if we get an id what happens to your plans with donatiens michel was thrown he thought his suggestions about donatiens had been killed he held one hand out towards maitland i didnt think you saw donatiens as a possibility before no but if we can get a positive id on the van passenger and as you suspect this in turn leads back to roman lacaille weve got the same situation we had before with savard corroborated testimony you dont think donatiens testimony would be good enough on its own michel realized he might be hinting at his doubts about getting an id match and added or the van passenger theyre mutually exclusive maitland forced a tired expression as if he was explaining to an errant child with donatiens we get lacaille on murdering leduc with the van passenger we get lacaille on arranging savards murder its just that from what youve said i dont see much hope of us getting donatiens forward to testify hes already practically family and about to become even more so with his impending marriage unless we can somehow bring extra pressure to bear the possibility of something else against roman lacaille which might bring out the whole business with leduc could be what we need to tip the balance on donatiens testifying i see michel nodded thoughtfully except with hopes of id slimmer than hed made out it would likely all fold back in on him and hed lose the possibility of donatiens at the same time at most he might have earned himself a days grace on them closing the file pelletier sensing that michel seemed more morose than he should offered sounds like something of a plan at least if we get an id yes michel agreed hastily snapping himself out of it it does be thankful he told himself when hed walked hed been fighting for minutes now he had a full day hed come out of the execution room still alive practically a first something in what maitland had said played at the back of his mind but any clear focus was out of reach all his thoughts were on how he might turn his one day reprieve into two or even three days michels nerves rose to panic level within minutes of leaving the conference room a fleeting look in maitlands eye as pelletier wrapped up the proceedings that warned him that maitland might have picked up on his own uncertainty and discomfort perhaps he should have come across as bolder and more enthusiastic when hed confirmed with pelletier that indeed hed let them know the minute there was news from t on the image enhancement and the reminder of t quickened his step now as he made his way along the corridor he punched the elevator call button brusquely then twice more after a few seconds it was vital he got down to t before maitland decided to put in a progress call otherwise the game was up straightaway the elevator to his right finally pinged he tapped his fingers impatiently against its side wall as he rode the four floors down and by the time he hit the first floor corridor he was practically breaking into a run the rapid clip of his step echoing on the tiled floor he deflected a couple of greetings with brief nods and his before reaching t two doors from the end of the corridor he spotted yves denault head of t a few desks down leaning over a computer with one of his assistants on a wallchart behind denaults desk were computerprinted insignias of every known hells angel and rock machine chapter in the province drugs distribution in quebec invariably followed the same set pattern the colombians made the main shipment deals with the local mafia who then organized distribution with the bikers from there it hit quebecs bars clubs and cafes the lacailles were the only union corse based family operating in canada their counterparts invariably had sicilian or neapolitan mafia roots michel explained the dilemma to denault that hed played things up a bit with pelletier and maitland so if they call either be noncommittal or if you can play it up the same we can always let them down later michel shook his head and gave his best harried look at denaults raised eyebrow sorry yves i just need that extra time right now its okay no problem a slow blink of acceptance i understand it might come up better than i thought anyway its too early to tell michel gently patted yves shoulder in thanks and made his way back up to his office the lacailles photos stared down defiantly at him as he sat at his desk and eased out his breath and he yanked his attention to his familys photos young benjamin had looked over and smiled radiantly at him from the basketball court within a minute of him arriving he wondered if the boy noticed how late he was or whether sandra would make sure to let him know that his father had almost forgotten that if it wasnt for her call he might not have shown at all it still seemed important for her to score points off of him with the kids perhaps because shed been the one to push for the split and so she seized on every opportunity to support why see you father shows either late or never no time left for us after his work same as always on the only occasion benjamin had asked how he felt now about his mother at christmas a few months back hed been caught off guard and answered i loved her of course and now hed only had time to think about it for a minute i still do and the spontaneous rush of feeling that flooded back brought a lump to his throat if hed had more time to think about it he might have answered more diplomatically im still very fond of her of course and suddenly seeing young benjamins eyes grappling to comprehend hed added hastily but i made some silly mistakes maybe shell forgive me one day benjamins awkward turn away to stare vacantly at the floor told him that she probably wouldnt she was still too busy using his back as a dart board while all he could do was make a chump of himself by saying he still loved her michels desk light blinked he picked it up and within minutes was immersed back in the hectic cycle of the other cases du jour demanding his attention a leading drug distribution biker up for his preliminary hearing on attempted murder the next day a truckload of smuggled winstons pulled up going through the kahnawake indian reservation but none of it really sparked his interest only one thing he wanted to know now he checked through computer files and fended the calls numbly mechanically until yves call forty minutes later he felt a momentary lift at the sound of yves voice maybe something had broken how goes it nothing yet weve filled in two strong areas of shadow but working at these sizes its going to take a while its still too early to tell michel knew the process well from numerous previous photo lifts they worked at fifteen to twenty times magnification filled in the dots and patches then pulled it back down to see how much definition had improved fresh breath from yves but i thought id let you know that you were right about maitland checking up or rather it was that asshole campion who phoned through keen to know how close we were i said that we were hopeful but would know more by late morning early afternoon tomorrow thanks yves so his twentyfour hour reprieve was secure for now assistant crown attorney campions eagerness to step into maitlands shoes sooner rather than later had made him something of a departmental joke pathetically fawning with maitland and trying to adopt an air of ruthless efficiency and pontification with everyone else and failing miserably he was known either as asskiss or le petite napoleon at just over five foot and with maitland towering over a foot above the popular jibe was that campion didnt have to stoop that low to hit his target did he ask many questions michel asked a couple but nothing significant dont worry i covered it well he went off satisfied satisfied and campion didnt sit well together michel could hardly remember him smiling just a nervous tic which passed as the trace of a grimace and faded quickly yves signed off with the promise of phoning through as soon as he knew something though that call didnt come through till the evening almost three hours after michel had headed for home hed dozed off in front of the tv and the ringing phone woke him abruptly yves voice at the other end was excitable slightly breathless we changed directions slightly and we hit on something we werent getting anywhere fast with that first frame wed pulled it up and down four times and the shadows still obscured too much so we started looking at other frames yves paused slightly as if allowing michel to catch up michel blinked absently at the tv images ahead but he was awake and sharply tuned from yves first sentence he gave an encouraging right at first we thought the frames further away would be too far for anything clear and on those closer the angle of vision would be too sharp but we decided to run through them anyway and on part of the more distant sequence we suddenly hit gold the passenger leans forward only for a second to get something off the dashboard but its enough to lift his face clear of any shadows its a more distant shot a bit more grain but with virtually no shadows i think weve got chances of an id from it when will you know for sure an hour two max on the tv an all day quebec news channel was playing with the next three days regional weather in a bottom band of sun cloud and snow symbols the building had cable and between the english and french channels the total was channels and nothing on michel had flicked through practically them all before leaving it on news and weather michel felt excited by yves words but for some reason the images still numbed him in the same way that theyd pushed him towards sleep shortly after dinner or maybe it was now forced conditioning each time hed become wrapped up in the thrall of a possible breakthrough hed been let down neutral positioning was safer the freefall if it all came to nothing was less yves promised to call back when there was more news and michel prompted that if it took longer than yves expected he should still call no matter what the time the silence after hanging up brought home the tension of expectancy all the harder an hour or two more to know if the case lived or died the image light changes from the tv flickered across the subdued lighting of his apartment pushed the photo snaps through his mind donatiens jeanpaul roman then tony savards terrified face pleading for his life an image to match the screams on tape michel stood up abruptly started pacing to ease his tension at least here at home he was surrounded by only family photos angelle blowing out the candles on her fourth birthday cake benjamin with his first bike the whole family together in st lucia photographed by an obliging hotel waiter five years ago now a year before the split michel grimaced tightly happier times it seemed remarkable how suddenly his life had changed he lifted his gaze from the photo and looked through the window onto the street a twobedroom loft apartment on st sepulce street in the old town the extra bedroom had squeezed him with the mortgage and taxes his original intention with buying in the area shortly after the divorce decree nisi was to enjoy a town bachelor pad and the life that went with it but then he realized that opting for only one bedroom would mean that benjamin and angelle would have to sleep on putup beds in the lounge on the alternate weekends they stayed over it would be viewed as an entirely selfish move by sandra an extra dart in his back so he pushed himself for the extra room for the kids sake outside a light dusting of snow lay on the street which was quiet almost deserted only the brake lights of a single car edging slowly down towards the riverside in the summer the area would be a frenzy of activity tourists ambling at all times of the day or night among the narrow cobblestone streets rollerbladers and cyclists along the riverside promenades the cafes of place jaques cartier where hed treat the children to dinner and ice cream while they watched the changing scenes of musicians mimes and milling street activity summer in old montreal with their father some fond memories at least michel liked this old part of town in architecture the surrounding streets could be turnofthecentury paris a surviving enclave against the skyscraper canyons of downtown one small spot of europe amongst squareblock architecture that defined practically every city for thousands of miles to the pacific and it all started here thought michel looking across the street to the floodlit stonewall flank of the basilica de notre dame montreals first church michel shook his head in a few months as the surrounding streets were humming with summer life georges donatiens and simone lacaille would be married there not the wedding chapel behind where most wellplaced montrealites got married and was good enough for pelletiers own daughter two years back no simone and georges were montreals golden couple theyd be married where celine dione was married or not at all and the rcmp as with every major crime family wedding would be mingling with the crowds on the sidewalk and in place des armes taking snaps more photos for his wall except that by then thered be no reason for any more photos for his wall all chances of getting donatiens to testify would have been long lost in fact in only an hour or two he might know it was all over if michel stopped himself looking keenly towards notre dame maitlands words suddenly spun back i dont see much hope of getting donatiens to testify hes already practically family and about to become even more so with his impending marriage unless we can somehow bring extra pressure to bear michel became aware that his hands were balled tight in fists at his side he willed himself to relax eased out his breath slowly unclenched his hands with yves fresh hopes of a photo id it suddenly hit him that he now had an opportunity to pressure donatiens which might not arise again even if yves finally came up with nothing he could probably milk it to good effect for twentyfour or even fortyeight hours michel turned to the phone he needed to share this with someone and if he remembered right chac was on duty roster until midnight he smiled to himself as it rang out chac would comment that he must be crazy pulling in donatiens for questioning and then hed calmly explain six cameron ryall looked from the diningroom window as their car approached up the drive much the same position hed stood in when theyd first visited except that now he was angry angry at himself angry at young lorena or at this new social worker and the save all the worlds children aid worker who had no doubt wound her up into action in the first place lorenas friend ryalls anger spun and bounced wildly in his head without firm direction he wasnt anywhere near calm enough to focus it on any one thing classical music played softly in the background vivaldis allegro from spring but it did little to introduce an air of calm the blood still rushed through his head a beat too fast and his hands trembled slightly and so he had to forcibly will that calm close his eyes and take deep breaths selfprompting you mustnt let them see that youre troubled take control control he felt strangely giddy as if through that lack of control as on the few occasions he could recall it happening before if only for seconds or minutes that passed like laboured hours in which hed bounce lightning speed every possible angle hed been cut adrift from all good sense and purpose he rallied every nerve and fibre of his body hard against it now his wife nicola was even more agitated though through fear rather than anger she hadnt wanted to face them a second time shed barely weathered the ordeal of their first visit and had asked him to beg off her presence now with the excuse of a crushing migraine or flu at least that might tie in with the reason why hed again visited lorenas room sorry my wifes still sleeping off the bug but that might skirt too close to the truth and invite the questions is she ill often is she regularly under prescription from the doctor for anything does she suffer from depression her secret drawers of valium prozac amphetamines and sleeping tablets prescription or otherwise or the hidden bottles of gin which so often pushed her into a stupored haze to take her to her bed early and besides it was more vital now that they put on a united front hed told nicola that shed just have to compose herself she had to be there beside him ryall took a deep breath but his salvation would be with lorena he was angry that now shed called them twice but in the end shed never betray him betray their secret because in the end there was no secret that she could recall no memory of bad things happening just wild imaginings and once those imaginings were finally put to the test and brushed aside the abiding image left was that he was a good father a trusting responsible caring father who had raised two children not his own and done it well a prominent wellrespected local citizen who gave generously to local charities particularly those involved with childrens welfare he could almost imagine the heads shaking in local village shops if heaven forbid news of this outrage ever leaked out surely not mr ryalls such a nice caring generous man god they had some nerve to put him through this the car was beyond his angle of vision now but he heard it stop and its doors open close a steady breeze swayed the trees and rhododendron hedge and white caps danced in the bay ahead he was guilty only of loving lorena more than he should but was that wrong and hed protected her from the rest her mind was blanked to it no lorena would never betray him but he had to ensure that it all ended here now because with repeated visits nicola would surely crack he closed his eyes tight for a second never betray him never and had just started to feel the first waves of calm descend as the door bell rang he turned off the vivaldi and went to answer it so the nights that mr ryall came again to your room were last thursday and nadine moores pen poised over her pad when was the other three or four days before that lorenas eyes flickered slightly trying for precise recall or troubled at the memory it was difficult to tell i cant remember exactly they were in the same musicplay room as before and between nadines questions the pauses were long the silences heavy nadines pen could be clearly heard scratching across her pad she seemed to be making more notes than before elena sat to one side and slightly behind nadine and after the initial hellos had said nothing throughout again nadine settled lorena into the mood with general questions about how school and home life had been since their last visit before circling around to the key point of her stepfathers repeated visits to her room and why did he come to your room on those occasions nadine looked up at lorena pointedly each time her scribbling ended was it because you had more bad dreams no not on the first occasion lorena shook her head he noticed that i was troubled about something at school he was worried that i might be being bullied but it was nothing just a bit of an argument with a couple of other girls we only talked about it a bit at supper so he came to my room later to talk some more and on the second occasion lorena cast her eyes down yes that time it was a bad dream it was very late too i she looked as if she might continue but then the thought went or she decided against it nadine took the opportunity to make another note then asked on either occasion did mr ryall offer any explanation of why hed come to your room rather than mrs ryall the first time no we were talking about the school problem earlier so perhaps he just thought it normal that we continue talking later she shrugged he didnt need to explain lorena paused as if allowing for nadine to make another note but nadine stayed looking at her expectantly she continued the second time he mentioned that nicola wasnt well shed gone to bed early you see and it was very late then what sort of time one or two oclock im not sure id lost track a bit with sleeping and then the nightmare elena noticed lorenas hands clutching and playing with the hem of her tshirt kikambala beach club mombasa from a beach holiday last easter after a lifetime of uncertainty the girl now with supposedly everything but elena could read the underlying signs shed seen the same shadows in lorenas eyes before lorena was as uncertain and fearful now as she was back in those dark orphanage days and on that first visit to your room nadine pressed the point though nothing was mentioned directly by your stepfather how was mrs ryall that night lorena had to think for a moment i dont think she was very well then either shed had a bad cold for four or five days maybe even a week and one night she went to bed even before me and what time do you go to bed nine to ninethirty in the week ten at the weekend elenas hand clenched tight in her lap so far everything was tying in with what cameron ryall had said in their twenty minute presession with the ryalls i wouldnt have gone to lorenas room at all if my wife hadnt been incapacitated on both occasions she was down with the flu and took to her bed early for most of the week but maybe something would come out now elena thought as nadine came on to what had actually happened with ryall on those visits lorena looked troubled her eyelids flickering heavily as if she were trying to focus on an indefinable object slightly to one side on the floor nadine prompted its okay take your time starting with the first visit what happened then finally that first time not much really she took a deep breath we talked about the problem at school and i kept telling him it was nothing i was eager for him to go you see but it took a while before he was finally convinced and then he reached out and stroked my brow saying youd tell me if something was wrong or if this happens again wouldnt you lorena looked directly at nadine and then quickly down again i answered yes of course but i think he sensed i was nervous about him touching me and he quickly took the hand away now and this you should think carefully about lorena did mr ryall touch you anywhere else on the body that night no lorena answered quickly though hesitantly nadine stayed looking at her directly for a moment before the next question even though lorena engaged eye contact only briefly and did mr ryall stay in your room for long after that no he left almost straightaway then i see nadine looked down finally and made some notes elena shared the disappointment she felt hit nadine in that moment but she also sensed a deft purposeful circling in by nadine and unconsciously she found herself sitting forward expectant as nadine came on to ryalls second room visit more had apparently happened then did he soothe your brow again on that occasion no he shook me gently out of the dream by my shoulder lorena crossed her chest with her right hand to her left shoulder then he held me by the hand or maybe the wrist i cant remember exactly and told me its okay its okay the room fell deathly silent both of them wrapped up in the explanation anticipating the revelation of what ryall did next but lorena trailed off then and nadine had to prompt then what everything wasnt too clear then lorena shook her head helplessly except in the dream the dream nadine asked incredulously what another dream yes yes but it was different this time lorena grappled to explain sensing mounting doubt from nadine this time it wasnt like before with me trapped in the sewers in the darkness this time mr ryall was touching me his hand going lower down my body with him still saying its okay its okay trying to comfort me elena noticed that nadine seemed caught aback by the plea in lorenas voice that the dream was somehow significant when very obviously nadine was thinking just the opposite nadine held up one hand a stop sign let me get this clear did mr ryall at any time touch you like this outside of the dream were you at any point if only for a minute awake when any of this happened i dont know i lorena was flustered by nadines freshly assertive tone elena felt for lorena she was only a child and bad dreams had been associated with so much of the sorting and filing of her troubled past it was probably difficult for her to grasp how anyone else wouldnt attach the same importance to them she was clutching again at the hem of her tshirt though this time elena noticed her hands were shaking finally no i i cant remember being awake when this happened nadine looked round briefly to elena a we wont get anywhere with this expression she pressed again with lorena this is important think hard lorenas eyes flickered again searching for illusive clarity but again nothing slotted into place im sorry im sorry i dont think i was awake then dont think lorena closed her eyes for a second as she reluctantly let loose the last strand im pretty sure i wasnt she swallowed hard im sorry the furthest lorena was likely to go towards denial but it was enough there was simply no niche left from which they could claw back elena could see it all slipping away nadines shoulders sagged her pen suddenly frozen from continued notes after all there was only one thing left to write case closed elena felt suddenly desperate that it might all end here she decided to intervene lorena this is twice now youve called us but if all of this is happening only in your dreams we just cant help you but sometimes it seems so so real lorena protested as if it is actually happening and it frightens me i told you i dont want him to come to my room anymore she shook her head in annoyance as if throwing the blame back to them we told mr ryall to stay away from your room nadine offered but on these two occasions your stepmother was ill im sure hed stay away otherwise so it shouldnt be a big problem nadine bit at her bottom lip and elena read the unspoken thought that could have been added but what to do when mrs ryall was ill again elena felt a twinge of panic it seemed wrong for it to all end like this now as if theyd hardly tried at all she pictured nicola ryall sat with her hands clasped tight together saying less than even last time her mood nervous agitated everything had tied in so neatly his wifes illness then ryall mentioning that he was sure it was all just in lorenas imagination possibly linked to her continuing problem with nightmares its probably all just a call for attention i assure you nothing untoward is actually happening now both statements had been supported nadine sighed concurring elena is right in that we cant do much with what we have nadine forced a reassuring smile that came across more thinly than shed have probably liked but at least if all of this is only in your mind we have the comfort that nothing is really happening youre not at risk elena bit at her bottom lip her own mother sat there saying nothing afraid to go against her father the same obdurate dogmatic grip in which hed held nearly all the family and had guided so many of their lives so real elena wondered if lorena was trying to tell them without really telling them the dreams were a safe midground if somethings happening youve got to tell us elena implored has mr ryall been talking to you telling you not to say anything lorenas brow knitted and her lips parted as if she were about to speak nadine wheeled around on elena staring daggers a thats strictly offlimits look you dont have to answer that she prompted lorena sharply but lorena had already lost whatever thread was there her eyes flickering uncomfortably for a moment before looking down im sorry elena said she just seems so confused and i suppose im scrambling for reasons why a fresh breath and nadine continued winding things down asking lorena calmly if while they were still there there was anything else she wanted to mention a seconds thought and lorena shook her head but elena could still see the uncertain shadows in her eyes and she thought how troubled lorena must have been to call her now twice the intense concern that had made her race back early from bosnia for this meeting now running breathlessly through the chine with lorena trying desperately to get her out of the darkness and into the light into the light only in her mind confused she leapt for the only remaining door she could see still partly open if this is all only in lorenas mind perhaps as mr ryall suggests even linked to her continuing problem with nightmares surely at least we should request psychiatric assessment thats true nadine contemplated elena levelly but we just dont have enough for such an order on what we have now we could only make the request it would be left up to the ryalls to decide this was said as if nadine doubted strongly that the ryalls would comply i understand elena nodded indulgently but if we sold the psychiatric assessment to the ryalls on the grounds of it being linked to lorenas continuing problem with bad dreams hed have little reason to object after all its the dreams that he keeps complaining are dragging him to her room late at night elena smiled slyly if he does object its going to look highly suspicious nadine held her gaze a second longer nadine resisted matching her smile but elena caught a faint telltale glimmer in nadines eyes nadine turned back to lorena who looked vaguely perplexed at their exchange nadines eyes softened her voice dropping a note mildly grave would you like that lorena to see someone professional who could help you if your stepparents agree to it lorenas eyes jumped between nadine and elena as if seeking consent elena smiled tightly with a faint nod yes yes i suppose so lorena said finally if you think it will help yes i do nadine made a brief final note on her pad and drew a hasty slanted line across lets just hope your stepparents share that view lorena blinked slowly with a barely audible thank you but she was looking more at elena than nadine elena acknowledged with a brief nod and smile but it was small consolation that they were giving ryall a run for his money he wasnt getting it all his own way if ryall said no to the psychiatric assessment theyd be back to square one worse still theyd know then that almost certainly ryall was keen to keep something hidden yet theyd be powerless to do any more about it seven in the dream the same as georges recalled it happening in real life everything was in slow motion he was firing question after question at eric leduc mostly relating to a list of bank deposits and withdrawals from an account in a false name theyd traced back to leduc funds that jeanpaul suspected were derived from cocaine trafficking leduc was directly to his right in the back seat roman the other side fifteen yards away from the car out of earshot tony savard and the cars driver steve tremblay paced and shuffled around smoking and swapping small talk and glanced back occasionally towards the car to keep tabs on progress leduc was nervous his eyes darting from georges to roman with each question fear of romans intervention should he answer wrong but there was almost an acquiescence there as if he was asking silent permission for each answer although generally leduc was stumbling evasive answers of any real substance were few and with each duck and manoeuvre from leduc romans fury raised another notch though georges was turned away from roman for most of the time he could sense that silent fury building through romans right leg shaking increasingly one hand gripped tight on his knee to try and quell it unsuccessfully romans glare in the fleeting moments georges did look round spoke volumes his jaw set tight his teeth grinding together with each i dont know or that part of it wasnt anything to do with me from leduc the tension was building steadily like a powder keg in the back of the car romans agitation leducs panic with his eyes shifting increasingly his own swallowing hard for saliva for each fresh question georges should have known that it would blow at any second at one point roman reached across and grabbed leduc brusquely by the lapel come on you fuck give you know a lot more than youre telling i know i know leduc held his hands up defensively his eyes were darting almost out of control he smiled hesitantly but ive got something that will hopefully clarify everything roman held leducs gaze steadily for a second he let go of leducs lapel slowly reluctantly a tiny pulse pumped repeatedly at leducs left temple a trickle of sweat ran down his neck from behind his ear a brief relief in tension and then it happened everything slipped the images tilted and seemed suddenly more distant hazy suspended almost frozen flickerframes that would stay with them forever leduc reached down for something they caught a quick glimpse of it a black object tucked into his ankle sock though not quite clear what it was but roman was already reaching for his gun inside his jacket it was out practically in the same motion pointing the two shots were fired both through leducs heart before hed hardly lifted the object clear from his sock then as leduc flew back against the side glass blood erupting from his chest the object fell from his hand and they saw what it was a black notebook romans eyes were raw panic i thought it was a gun i thought it was a gun leducs blood was everywhere splattered against the window behind some splashes on the roof on the windscreen a heavy gout on georges chest and lap and sticky and warm on the seat where he gripped tight for some reality with one hand romans expression quickly changed his eyebrows knitted together pleading christs sake dont tell jeanpaul how i mucked up its gotta be our secret believe me i thought romans next actions were quick almost a card sharps sleight of hand because savard and tremblay were heading frantically towards the car roman flipped a gun from a strap by his right ankle onto the floor by leduc grabbed the notebook and tucked it into his inside pocket roman stared hard again at georges you with me on this do i have much choice georges looked between the newly placed gun on the floor and roman savard and tremblay were only yards away almost upon the car georges eased out a long breath and closed his eyes momentarily in submission nodding hastily yeah yeah im with you then everything suddenly slipped another notch part of it was more hazy surreal yet his senses seemed more finely tuned he felt every small motion every tic of expression from roman like a ponderous heavy heartbeat savard and tremblay were no longer there it was just roman and him alone with leducs body romans eyes were piercing straight through him i dont believe you i dont trust you youre gonna betray me no no i wont its okay im with you on it romans gun rose to point at him his eyes burnt with intent if not now then at some stage youll betray me i know it leducs blood was already congealing sticky everywhere he touched the stench from his body waste overpowering in the confined space no no i wont betray you i swear georges georges are you okay the gun levelled at his face a sardonic smile creasing one corner of romans mouth as he started to pull the trigger one day and i just cant risk that he could feel romans hand on his shoulder even though romans free arm appeared to be at his side no no i promise i he jolted sharply upright a second before the bullet hit bathed in sweat simones face above him blurring slowly into vision her hand gently stroking his shoulder you okay she watched his eyes focus on her and leant forward and kissed him lightly on one cheek you were shaking the bed a lot calling out i know i know im sorry he cradled his forehead for a second and then ruffled his hand through his hair orientating they were at his place and it was still dark outside he glanced at the bedside clock am just a dream he stated the obvious as if that might brush it all quickly away anything interesting terri hatcher got your head trapped between her thighs or maybe roseanne if it was a nightmare nothing so exciting he sniggered lightly which subsided into a shiver that ran through his body that night with leduc coming back to haunt me he shook his head wearily and its not the first time oh i see simone glanced down awkwardly she looked up slowly after a second met his eyes steadily you know papa never really talks about business with me but hes mentioned that incident to me now twice i know that he feels badly about it feels that he should never have sent you along i know he nodded and gently clasped her hand now it was his turn to feel a stab of guilt her father still shouldering the blame and meanwhile he was continuing to shield the truth from him it was jeanpaul he was betraying not roman a betrayal of the trust jeanpaul had long placed in him he owed roman little or nothing he ran his hand up her arm and lightly stroked her shoulder he bit at his bottom lip as he met her gaze look there was something that happened that night with roman and leduc something that i never and then he was reminded of why hed gone along with roman and said nothing the newcomer to the fold driving a wedge between two brothers whod worked the family business together harmoniously for so many years his allegiance to jeanpaul balanced against the family code of silence and not ratting he didnt want to be the messenger of bad tidings the reason for any rift on the one occasion since that roman had broached the subject hed commented i wont tell jeanpaul but you should you owe it to him simone was staring at his expectantly and he stumbled into i never obviously have come to terms with so maybe thats why it keeps replaying in my dreams the gun firing leducs body tossed back like a rag dummy his blood was everywhere everywhere i can still feel it sticky against my skin sometimes when i sweat at night you poor thing simone lightly stroked his brow then ran one finger lightly down one cheek and across his top lip he closed his eyes and she leant forward and kissed where her fingers had been her tongue gently probing it became a long deep sensuous kiss that made his mind flee all else for a moment and as she finally broke away she said teasingly with a faint smile theres only one thing you should feel sticky against your skin and started planting butterfly kisses slowly down his body she pushed him back under the gentle but firm press of her fingertips after a second and he surrendered to her soft kisses and caresses as he lay flat on his back his eyes gradually adjusting to the dark and forming images in the faint citystreetlight that filtered up to play across his ceiling savard had brusquely swung open the car door only seconds after hed finally submitted to roman yeah yeah im with you leducs body slumped back with the opening door and was half supported by savards thigh savards eyes shifted haphazardly trying to extract some sense from the scene beyond the carnage he had a gun a gun roman protested waving his own weapon towards the offending object on the floor savard had his own gun out but it was held loosely didnt pose a threat savards eyes jumped between roman and the gun on the floor i thought you searched him i did but it was in his ankle sock savards eyes rested finally on georges as if for confirmation and after a second georges nodded numbly and cast his eyes down from that moment on the dye was cast immovable and now that hed kept up the same pretence the same lie for so long an extra impenetrable layer of concrete had been added georges blinked heavily to shift the ceiling images a slow tear welling in the corner of one eye as simone started to make love to him she trusted him as did jeanpaul but georges just couldnt see any way out of it the tape operator carlo funicelli sat up as fresh sounds started the tape rolling again a calabrian italian who ran an audio and electronics shop in st leonard his income was supplemented by fencing stolen goods and the occasional specialist bugging jobs like this the tape was on sound activation and as he glanced at the clock am he realized he must have dozed for over four hours georges are you okay no no i promise i you okay some faint rustling you were shaking the bed a lot calling out i know i know im sorry more rustling and movement just a dream funicelli sat back relaxing nothing exciting no dramatics he thought at first they might be shouting or arguing with each other something of a first some chink in their relationship that roman would have been happy to hear about roman had told him what to listen out for any tension or arguments any sign of cracks on which he could build and any calls from donatiens to other girls which might be suspect but donatiens had made only three calls to women all work related no underlying sexual signals and overall his relationship with simone lacaille appeared rock solid in fact all they seemed to do when simone came over was cook eat dinner and screw some inconsequential small talk interspersed before and during dinner then within halfanhour you could almost set your watch buy it the small talk would peter out and theyd head for the shower and bed that part had made it fun listening funicelli found himself unconsciously rubbing his crotch during their last heated session five hours ago he wished now that theyd set up video as well he might have been able to sell the tapes to some porn hack to put on the internet along with pamela and tommy lee funicelli bristled sitting up a bit sharper at donatiens mention of a gun firing and leducs blood being everywhere then gradually settled back scuttlebutt was thick and fast with the increased rcmp heat but roman had given him the main bones of the incident leduc got frisky pulled a gun so had to be taken out and unfortunately donatiens was there at the time too much for his delicate banker sensitivities no fresh startling revelations now that funicelli could discern donatiens even paused at one point as if undecided about talking about it at all but still not the sort of tape to have fall into rcmp hands hed give it to roman in the morning he reached out to the recorder deciding to replay the section in case hed missed something then paused his finger hovering over the stop button as the next sounds came over simone lacaille gently kissing down donatiens body funicelli knew what was coming next he pulled the hand back and braced it on his thigh a faint film of perspiration glowed on his brow in the yellow light from a sidelamp hed wait out them finishing then replay the section michel hovered over the computer screen as the images came up one face on two side profiles one full length showing height against a calibrated measuring strip not sure michel said go back to venegas lets have another look the same format of four shots scrolled down for enrique venegas yves denault had phoned through finally just after pm that he had a reasonable lift but give him till early morning and it would be in far better shape michel got in at am and within an hour theyd raised five possible matches now theyd worked it down to just two steve turcotte and enrique venegas michels money was on venegas turcottes hair colour and the shape of his eyes more or less matched but there was a broadness to the bridge of turcottes nose that didnt quite fit with the cctv frame lift unless yves had somehow narrowed the nose in filling in the grain and shadow michel held up the x cctv frame enlargement next to venegas computer mug shots his eyes jumping rapidly between the two comparing i think its venegas he said on the back of an exhalation that carried finality the nose the hairline the eyes only the mouth and part of the jawline where it starts losing definition we cant be sure of yves nodded i would concur i myself thought it was venegas and we took a quick poll between us and forensics five out of six thought it was venegas too the other reserved judgement didnt want to swear between the two okay okay michel lightly shook the x and flicked its top corner with the back of one finger enrique venegas it is he thanked yves and went back up to his office he accessed the full file for venegas from his computer and checked the date of last update almost two years he buzzed through to christine hebert gave her venegass file reference and social security number and asked her to come back to him pronto with venegass current address he drummed his fingers lightly on his desk top as he hung up as if trying to catch the flow and rhythm with which everything should happen timing would be essential theyd have to pull in donatiens at practically the same time as venegas for the plan to work he picked up the phone again and buzzed chac to prime him that theyd come up with an id match enrique venegas when do we roll soon im waiting on current address confirmation for venegas then were all set michel checked his watch as long as venegas hasnt moved too far out of town we should be on his doorstep not long after eight whats the team split chac enquired you take phil reeves and three armed constables for backup for venegas he could be armed and well need reasonable show ill just go with maury for donatiens we dont expect any resistance or trouble there will you go to donatiens apartment no well head to the lacaille offices on cote du beaver hall flash our badges as he approaches the door he might already be there a lot of mornings he makes an early start through his glass screen christine was deep into a phone conversation with one finger pointed towards her computer screen as if checking a specific detail she didnt look towards him or acknowledge ill let you know the second weve got a green light on venegass current address in the lull after hanging up michel felt the tension of expectancy grip him again so decided to kill time by scrolling down through the rest of venegass file while keeping half an eye on christine in the backfield of his vision one truck hijacking eleven years ago crown failed to prosecute attempted murder eight years ago five years served by venegas in orsainville prison at least two other hits attributed to venegas neither of them pursued due to lack of evidence michel scrolled down through the attempted murder case and doubleclicked on the hypertext heading trial transcript eightyfour pages of it between the english and the french michel found himself rolling rapidly through the pages skimming sentences only half paying attention until one paragraph caught his eye four months before the alleged final shooting in which you attempted to take gerard fortins life mr fortin claims that you and another man michael trapani abducted him that you pulled up in a van with blackedout windows put a sack over his head and drove off thats baloney you deny it certainly a conversation then ensued between yourself and mr trapani as to which high building you intended to throw mr fortin from clearly designed to frighten mr fortin in the extreme except that in the end after you swung him several times and mr fortin was convinced he was about to die you dropped him unharmed in a farmers field dont recall it sorry mr fortin was then told that was a practice run if mr cacchione doesnt have his money by the end of the month we do it for real sorry sorry still dont strike no chord and this apparently is a popular method used by the cacchiones and others to enforce payment from those who might have welched on drug or other debts it leaves absolutely no marks on the body no sign that theyve been threatened or intimidated sounds good to me and ill try to remember it for future reference but you got the wrong man the transcript simply related what was said and michel had to imagine the rest the muted chuckle from the jury and gallery at venegass jibes and protests and the crown attorney holding firm to his ground as he steamrollered over them and because fortin was finally unable to pay that is why you returned four months later with another accomplice anthony orozco to complete what you had previously threatened to carry out michels blood ran cold the method was well known to him popular four or five years back more than now but seeing venegass name linked directly to such an abduction completed the circle if there was any remaining doubt that venegas was involved with savard now it had gone two minutes later christine came through with venegass current address and michel noted it down rue messier one block south of st joseph while still scanning through the final salient details of the fortin case two shots to the chest one to the head but the head shot had deflected off fortins cheekbone and through the front of his face just below his right eye fortin had been lucky he lasted six years before another bullet probably summoned by cacchione succeeded where the other had failed and removed half of his skull this time case unproven roman was with frank massenat at santoriellos his favourite cafe just off of rue st catherine for his money they served the best espresso in town and had fourteen choices of pancake toppings he was diving into a stack of five with maple syrup crushed walnuts and cream with a sprinkling of nutmeg for his breakfast when carlo funicelli walked in a halfdrunk cup of espresso was at his right hand in a cup almost large enough to be a soup bowl his second refill massenat was making good progress of demolishing a large french stick sandwich of pastrami and brie all these two seemed to do was eat thought funicelli or was it just that their meeting places were inevitably cafes and restaurants funicelli passed the cassette tape across last nights offering roman dabbed at the corner of his mouth with his napkin anything interesting no she came over again last night but it was pretty much as usual cook eat talk screw so no signs of trouble between them no complaints from him that his goodytwo shoes suburban family might not be too keen on him marrying into a highprofile crime family or from her that his dicks too small and shes concerned about them having a longlasting satisfying relationship roman smiled and nudged massenat it was like johnny carson and ed mcmahon except that massenat was a beat slow in responding with a laugh romans style of humour was brash and gauche but sometimes it hit the mark because in part it became selfparody and also a welcome relief from the other side of his character the stormy mood swings and violent temper funicelli risked only a tentative smile you never knew when that mood might change as he shook his head no such luck romans smile slowly subsided to a quizzical frown and no calls to or from any other girls no roman looked between funicelli and massenat you know this guy aint human he thought of his own hectic lovelife marie his main girlfriend a thirtytwo year old from the right side of outremont whose husband had died in a car smash four years ago he dated primarily to keep up appearances and please his mother marie was classy wellbred and most importantly for his mother her family were deeply religious and hailed from the corsican village only thirty miles from that of his mothers family marie he took to all family engagements and highprofile functions but for sex excitement and wild nights he had two club girls in tow one of them viana from their rue sherbrooke club partly due to him feeding her increasingly expensive cocaine habit and then there was that beautiful malaysian girl with a body like a fourteenyear old russian gymnast at a lavalle massage parlour he visited now and then not of this world not of this world roman took a scoop of pancakes and washed it down with a slurp of coffee hes got tossed salad instead of testosterone i dont believe in all this perfect ninetiesman shit hes gotta have a dark secret somewhere the words were slightly muffled and slurred with his mouthful of food he dabbed again with his napkin and pointed at funicelli youll see youll see mark my words its just his mobile started ringing in his inside pocket he took it out looking down at some invisible object just beyond his plate as if funicelli and massenat had suddenly ceased to be present a matter of time yeah roman recognized the voice at the other end straightaway but he caught only brief bursts from the garbled breathless sentences in the van that night theyre moving in now you should warn him whoa whoa slow down which van whose moving in i dont want to use names on a mobile line all i can say is the guy in the front passenger seat that night they picked him up from a security camera and idd him theyre moving in on him any minute venegas an icy claw gripped romans stomach any minute how long has he got exactly theyre checking for his current address right now they could be on his doorstep in anything from fifteen to twenty minutes less if they trust it to a local squad car roman doubted that they would but hed still have to step lively okay thanks he picked up his napkin and threw it over his halffinished plate in disgust it was also a signal that hed finished he waved and called out to the waitress hey hey laddition lets settle here the waitress came over and flicked back through her pad romans face became a study in battling muscle contortions as she summarised what they had and did your friend have anything she looked at funicelli no he didnt roman slapped down a note and stood up in the same motion keep the change which raised only a meek smile from the waitress unsure whether the tip compensated for the attitude massenat looked at the third of a stick roll in his hand then decided finally to take it with him funicelli too lagged a few paces behind as roman hustled quickly towards his bmw parked down the street a sleek black series the air outside was fresh but for one of the first times that year it was above zero the first hint that spring might not be far away at eight paces from the car roman pressed the remote key and the bmw briefly beeped and flashed its accord the rush and panic of romans departure reminded funicelli that there was one thing hed forgotten to mention about the tape theres one thing on it roman wheeled around on him impatiently what theres one point where donatiens mentions that night with leduc roman looked agitated his eyes darting uncomfortably though funicelli wasnt sure how much of that was due to the call just past why didnt you tell me before i was about to but then you had that call funicelli swallowed hard romans eyes burnt straight through him he wished now he hadnt mentioned anything just let roman hear it for himself but it was nothing just a stupid dream from donatiens and him mentioning how the incident still troubled him sometimes but apart from that nothing funicelli reached out to put a reassuring hand on romans shoulder then decided against it romans powderkeg eyes warned that one touch might set him off there was nothing beyond what you already told me believe me nothing to worry about romans eyes continued to dart frantically and search his and looked finally about to settle when another voice came from behind got some change roman turned sharply confronting him was a tramp with wild hair and a grizzly adams beard though it was difficult to tell if the beard was white streaked from frost and sunbleaching or from dried food and vomit roman sneered and leaned back from the tramp catching the first mingled stench of cheap wine stale body odour and vomit he felt suddenly as if his brains were frying too many random signals hitting him at once maybe only minutes to save venegas from the clutches of the police donatiens mentioning leduc and funicelli trying to tell him it was nothing and now this bum in his face enveloping his best camel hair in streetstench and vomit breath it was like some fucking conspiracy a dime or a dollar it dont matter whatever you can spare roman suddenly saw red a fireburst burning through the back of his skull get away from me you fuckin bum he swung out hard against the tramps left shoulder a halfpush half rabbit punch the tramp flew back and hit the building wall behind solidly his head flung back and connecting with a thud he looked dazed startled and his knees started crumpling roman moved in and cocked his right arm to hit him again massenat was quickly behind roman grappling one arm firmly around his chest come on roman come on an elderly couple whod just come out of the depanneur across the street were looking over curiously at the commotion romans chest rose and fell heavily against massenats restraining arm his eyes still glaring at the tramp you fuckin asshole didnt nobody tell you its still winter in summer they were out in force along rue st catherine they seemed to be hitting the streets earlier each year perhaps this one had even staked out his car smelling money go back to your fucking cave for another month its too fuckin early to be out begging yer hear massenat clutched his arm firmer around him come on come on roman finally reluctantly shifted his eyes from the tramp and massenat lifted his arm free massenat was right the tramp wasnt the problem it was the situation now with donatiens and venegas a sense of everything at the click of a finger fast closing in on him jesus he probably wouldnt even have time now to get to venegas before the rcmp hed pull up in his beamer only to find a police welcoming committee ready to pull him in as well roman glanced towards his car then at funicelli what you driving these days funicelli shrugged what was this not content with working out his frustrations on the tramp now it was time for unsubtle putdowns chevy cavalier why its okay nothing roman shook his head just a thought he just couldnt risk driving out to venegass house now regardless his only hope was to phone venegas to warn him he took his address book from his inside pocket and started looking through his hands trembled as he turned the pages aftermath of the runin with the tramp or the fact that within minutes his fate could be sealed if they had venegas on camera they had enough to put venegas away for life the temptation to do a deal would be intense roman leafed through the pages more frantically starting to wonder now if hed ever put venegass number in his book eight to just crossing du parc we should be on st denis any minute read you were on st denis already heading south towards the st joseph junction only about nine or ten blocks away were to wait at the st joseph junction is that correct yeah copy dont proceed into st joseph until were there michel listened to the waveband progress of the cars heading towards enrique venegas he was in his rcmp standard issue ford taurus with maury legault as they waited on georges donatiens arriving at his cote du beaver hall office maury was busy making the point that his own divorce was worse than michels or indeed anyone elses in the squad room that the knives still out for him from his wife were longer and sharper you know what she told the children last week that i used to beat her i never hit her even once once when she threw a saucepan at me i grabbed her arm to stop her throwing another but that was it i never hit her maury shook his head morosely michel nodded and sympathised at the right moments but along with most male members of his squad hed heard it all from maury before and by extension it struck him as a sad reflection on the high failure rate of department marriages if this was all it now came down to bittersweet trumping my divorce was worse than yours and so hearing some movement at last over the network came as a welcome relief where is he michel looked at his watch am when normally donatiens was in sharply at am hed found himself becoming increasingly agitated as maury spoke not sure if it was the worn topic the wait for things to start happening over the radio or donatiens not showing yet surely he hadnt gone out again to the cartierville mansion hed been there for a morning meeting only two days ago maybe he had a breakfast meeting somewhere else this guy shes with now is a minor league hockey player st laurent icebreakers or some such shit maury sneered in disbelief she tells the kids i hit her and meanwhile shes hooked up with a fucking hockey player i think shes lost the plot somewheres been watching too many of his maury michel held one hand up sharply he was about to add i need to concentrate a while but at that moment the radio came alive again so he just made a chopping motion with his raised hand were at junction of st joseph now and waiting as instructed copy were just crossing the rue rachel junction should be with you in under two minutes the voices over the radio reminded michel of the night chasing savard he closed his eyes for a second please god let us keep safe grip on this one he knew hed been lucky to even get this second chance there wouldnt be another there he is maury commented and michel opened his eyes to see donatiens lexus swing into the underground car park okay showtime michel put on a headset with a small receiver and earpiece one side so that he could still monitor progress with donatiens a mouthpiece snaked around and he could patch in and speak by pressing a button on the receiver but the arrangement was that hed just listen in unless something pressing called for his input hed be too busy with donatiens they flashed their badges at the foyer reception guard and michel announced well be going up to the sixteenth floor santoine international it was a statement not a request the guard held up his hands the normal signingin procedure immediately waived sure sure he swivelled one palm towards the elevator and forced a smile beyond his concern they grabbed one within seconds no others had passed them meanwhile so theyd wait on donatiens coming out at the floor we see you now well turn here into st joseph and wait for you to pull behind before proceeding copy brief static pause then just one perp huh yeah but hell be armed and he knows how to use it so due caution and follow my lead to the letter michel closed his eyes and let out a slow breath as the elevator rose trying to ease the tension always the way hours with nothing happening then too much happening all at once but there had been no choice but to move on both of them at the same time once venegas was in custody news would travel fast and the lacaille ranks close tight chacs voice was on with phil reeves driving theyd have had to wait twenty minutes to assemble an armed backup squad at dorchester boulevard the quickest option had been to pull a patrol in from mount royal and them meet up at the st joseph junction turning in to st joseph they were only three hundred yards from venegass front door michel felt his pulse racing with anticipation the elevator doors opened the corridor was quiet as they stepped out only faint strains of activity from an office at the far end they both looked back expectantly at the elevator light indicators here we are rue messier as i say follow my lead should be about a hundred yards down apartment block on the left well stop about thirty yards short so your cars not visible copy okay chacs car was unmarked the back up a blue and white no point in forewarning venegas the elevator to their far right pinged two women in their thirties conversing got off first followed by donatiens the women gave michel and maury a brief glance no doubt in response to their acute attention to the elevators occupants then headed swiftly and primly in the opposite direction from santoine international donatiens paused after two paces looking them over assessing but michel waited another second for the women to have faded from earshot monsieur donatiens georges donatiens staffsergeant michel chenouda rcmp criminal intelligence he flashed his badge there are some matters wed like to discuss with you concerning the lacailles a slight flinch from donatiens then his eyes darted past them to his office and quickly back again through michels earpiece the sound of car doors opening closing footsteps picking up pace on concrete quickly joined by two or three more sets michel pulled his attention sharply back ah i dont think this is something we could do here some of its quite sensitive information that i dont think youd like your staff overhearing and it also involves me playing a tape for you which is all set up back at the station michel held one arm out towards the elevators donatiens eyebrows knitted am i under arrest no no not at all michel assured the hum of an elevator rising faint shuffling chacs voice ill knock and me and phil will stand to one side our guns with safetys off but still holstered you three stand a yard behind but faceon with guns drawn and pointed with a clear bead on the opening door its just some information that we need to pass on but we believe it could be vitally important michel paused looking down for a second as if to add suitable gravity to his next words were concerned about your future welfare and safety we believe you could be in danger concerned about my safety donatiens shook his head and smiled crookedly but michel picked up the underlying strain in donatiens voice the tone slightly higher hed hit a nerve thats very gratifying inspect staffsergeant staffsergeant chenouda but i think you know the rules before i can even think of speaking to you id have to have my lawyer present elevator door opening muted rapid footsteps along a carpeted corridor chacs breathing heavier expectant but the only thing michel had control over now was donatiens and it was fast slipping away his mouth was suddenly dry he moistened his lips with his tongue thats your prerogative sir but i only have clearance to play the tape concerned to you its considered privileged information and wed have to seriously review how playing it to a lawyer particularly an organization lawyer might later effect our case doorbell ringing then three sharp raps michels palms were sweating his nerves as taut as piano wire handling the two at the same time was a nightmare you might also consider how letting an organization lawyer overhear the tape might effect your own position and safety it was all there between the lines thought georges and this tape concerns roman lacaille you say yes thats correct brief pause and then another buzz and sharp rapping michel bit at his bottom lip but at least donatiens was starting to sway georges weighed his options if he called perreault the lacaille family lawyer roman would know about it in seconds flat if he called an independent lawyer that in itself would look suspicious as if he had something to hide the lacaille family tentacles reached too far for comfort with city law firms he couldnt be sure of using one that would go undiscovered he could just say no to chenouda but then hed never find out about the tape or the supposed danger he was in chenouda had played him well he had his interest piqued about both and knew it the only thing that struck a strange chord was chenoudas radio headset complete with earpiece it was obvious from chenoudas eye contact flickering away at moments and his splitsecond delay with some responses that he was at the same time listening in to something georges chuckled lightly partly a release of tension what is this he pointed to the headset you auditioning as one of madonnas backing singers michel forced a wry smile something like that he had donatiens hooked and they both knew it he didnt feel inclined to ease off the pressure by slipping into weak banter door opening chac announcing himself and asking for enrique venegas i have a warrant here for his arrest hes not here a womans voice you just missed him how long ago did he leave ten or twelve minutes ago georges watched chenoudas eyes flicker as he listened in what was it was somebody at hq instructing him if he mentions a lawyer say this if hes obstructive say that he noticed chenoudas eyes cloud after a moment look worried i dont know georges said i think if im going to come in with you its something ive got to think over for a while michel was gripped with panic his stomach had sunk upon hearing that theyd missed venegas and now it was skydiving again shit now he could lose donatiens as well but he knew that pressing harder would be the wrong play nothing left but to ease off take a step back michel shrugged thats up to you our information has it that roman wants to move fast on this but if you want to delay and run the risk fine you probably know roman better than me michel turned to look at the elevator lights maury who had stayed silent throughout forced an apologetic smile and shrugged as donatiens eyes fell on him we still have to check and see you understand yeah okay okay the woman sounded hesitant uncertain for a second then the jostling and rustling of them moving around the apartment michels heart pounded hard please god find venegas hidden in a back room and now he was playing russian roulette with donatiens as well his legs felt weak unsteady he could feel donatiens eyes on him almost feel his mind frantically hammering savard dead but just how far was roman prepared to go and what exactly was on that tape whats that sound from behind the door at the end thats nothing nothing but the woman sounded nervous her voice tremulous and michels heart pounded almost in time with chacs laboured breathing as chac moved towards the door opening it only my daughter sound of a radio playing yeah i see okay a young girls mumbled response which michel couldnt discern michels nerves eased back the elevator to the far left was the first to arrive four people got out gave the assembled group a cursory glance then moved off three in one direction one in the other the back of michels neck ached with tension come on donatiens dont slip away from me as well and he was about to turn and add something to try and retrieve the situation when donatiens finally spoke if i come down to you without a lawyer you appreciate im not going to answer any questions you dont have to michel assured well simply play you the tape and tell you why we think youre in danger if you have any comment on that fine maury leapt across as the elevator doors started closing and they sprang quickly open again they stood as an awkward tableau for a moment with maury halfin halfout of the elevator then finally donatiens nodded okay okay how long will we be an hour or so no more michel held donatiens gaze steady trying to keep any flinch from his eyes he knew it was a lie once donatiens was in his grasp hed be lucky to get out this side of nightfall after a moment a resigned nod and another okay from donatiens and michel held one arm out like a bellboy shes telling the truth michel hes not here it was the first time chac had addressed him directly michel felt any last vestiges of hope slip away his stomach sinking again this time in tune with the elevators fall michel pressed the receivers button how long does she think hes gone for chac asked and michel heard the woman reply that he hadnt said but he packed and took with him a large kit bag if thats any clue you hear that chac confirmed yeah any suggestions probably but let me come back to you in a couple of minutes he had an idea forming but hed prefer to air it out of earshot of donatiens hed wait for maury to put donatiens inside the car and hold back outside a moment to talk with chac with the silent lull following and michels expression thoughtful almost morose as the elevator doors opened donatiens asked something wrong michel smiled wanly yeah i just heard madonna gave the spot to someone else within ten minutes of michel calling chac back with his thoughts about venegas chac called dorchester blvd hq to put out a general alert for roman lacailles black series bmw the alert hit first all squad cars on montreal island monteregie laval laurentides and lanaudiere then minutes later was spread to upprovince quebec venegass sudden departure might have been purely coincidence but if he had somehow got warning that he was being moved in on michel was betting good money that roman lacaille was involved check his usual haunts and if theres no luck put out an alert for his beamer its distinctive cant be too difficult to track down no news had fed back by the time michel led donatiens into a private room setting up the tape and having donatiens brought a coffee killed another eight minutes but still nothing michels unease returned it promised to be a tense session but knowing that venegas was loose out there somewhere added an extra edge if anything broke he was going to be excusing himself a fair few times from the interview room part of the key was not letting donatiens know the state of play with venegas the other thing pressing hard now on michel an increasing leaden cloak of suspicion that seeped like cold rain through every muscle making him shudder was that if venegas had received a warning which then might also explain how roman lacaille knew that savard was in with them then just who in his department could be the leak roman lacaille held his speed steady at mph on highway towards trois riveres and quebec city where is this cabin venegas asked glancing briefly across from retuning the radio as the montreal easylistening fm station theyd been listening to began to crackle and fade about eighty miles north lake shawinigan just beyond trois riveres in the summer it gets busy but this time of year itll be deserted its ideal is it a family cabin venegas raised an eyebrow i mean is it going to be an option they might easily jump for what you think im stupid roman waved one hand off the wheel as if with another quick flip he might just slap venegas its a friend of a friends they aint going to trace it in a hurry venegas had always unsettled roman the product of a sicilian mother and venezuelan father he had tightknit curls and thick lips which might have been sensuous if they werent so out of place with his buttonbead dark eyes and hardly any eyelids but then he hadnt chosen venegas for his social companionship it had been his reputation as an iceveined hit man which made roman all the more unsettled now thinking of what lay ahead venegas had put on a baseball cap to hide his trademark curls and shield part of his face obviously he was concerned that photos might already be out on the wire venegas looked across hopefully from beneath the caps peak as stevie wonders i just called came across is that okay roman shrugged yeah itll do the other brief flash choices had been waylon jennings some hiphop and a religious programme but most of all the repetitive soundburst changing grated on romans nerves given everything else swimming around in his mind getting venegas away had been frantic his warning phone call then venegas packing a bag and getting clear with probably only minutes to spare before the rcmp arrived at his door at romans instruction venegas had walked two blocks from his apartment and grabbed a cab to a boulevard st laurent cafe where roman caught up with him ten minutes later venegas threw his kit bag in the back seat and they sped north the first few miles particularly crossing the anuntsic bridge had been the worst the tension tightened his nerves until the pulse throbbing at his temples ached still now he was tense and watchful for patrol cars and his speed several cars passed doing mph or more but just as many were going slower he wanted to be as faceless and nondescript as possible among the traffic flow venegas was looking out thoughtfully over the snowbound landscape is the cabin heated yeah theres a woodburning stove and apparently there should be plenty of chopped logs at the side roman looked across but anyways youre not going to be stopping there long ten days two weeks for the heat to die down time too to get a fake passport and then youll be gone do you know where to yet martinique i know a few places there or maybe yucatan or cuba weve been doing some business there recently roman shrugged i havent completely decided yet he was making it up as he went along he knew that venegas wasnt going to make it any further than eighty miles north but he was becoming increasingly anxious as the miles rolled by knowing that venegas was armed to the teeth a semiautomatic in his kitbag and a mm in his inside pocket roman had asked what venegas was carrying bytheway as if he might make up any shortfall roman had two guns with him a in his inside pocket and a in his glove compartment martinique sounds nice venegas said absently yeah roman agreed he welcomed the light conversation to ease his nerves it might also help venegas chill out venegas had noticeably calmed form the first frantic halfhour of their drive but at moments his gun hand was still skitterish clenching and unclenching on his knee or starting a move towards his jacket with the occasional car passing close roman could do with relaxing that hand a notch more our mom goes down there regularly she gets any browner and picks up any more patois shell be a native how long would i have to stay away could be a while eighteen months maybe more for something like this to blow over beaches good down there venegas asked thinking ahead to swaying palms and white sand when nothing but snow rolled past their window yeah real good mom stays in the south of the island le diamant and theres a beach there that roman broke off at the moment noticing for the first time the squad car hanging four cars back something wrong venegas asked as romans eyes flickered repeatedly to his rearview mirror blue and white but whatever you do dont look round roman noticed venegass gun hand which had slowly relaxed with the tropicisle talk clench tight and tense again on his thigh hopefully wont be a problem i thought you said your plan would work venegas stared stonily ahead i thought it would but as the squad car moved up closer to only two cars behind roman had his doubts he could picture them checking the registration then theyd pull up just behind and the siren would wind up for them to pull over venegass gun hand sneaked inside his jacket for fucks sake roman fired venegas a warning glare theyll have a pumpaction pointed at the back of our heads before they even step out he glanced back in his mirror to see the squad car ease up just behind weve got to do something venegass eyes shifted frantically at one point towards his kitbag in the back with the semiautomatic cant just let them take me like this romans brow sweated trying to weigh up the squad car and what venegas might do next still no siren as yet dont even think about it roman hissed under his breath as if the car behind might hear why do you think theyre hanging back theyre radioing for backup even if they decide to pull us over on their own the cavalry will be here before your guns even stopped smoking romans jaw tensed as the squad car pulled out from behind and started edging up alongside roman wasnt sure whether to keep staring straight ahead or glance over as you might with any car that passed close venegass face too was a tense frozen study now turned slightly away but at least his gun hand had eased away from his jacket and was rested back on his thigh the squad car pulled directly level and roman finally went inbetween and cast a brief sideways glance without hardly shifting his head but the passenger seat officer paid little notice to them he seemed wrapped up talking to the driver they eased by in only seconds though for roman it felt like torturous minutes expecting the siren to suddenly wind up or another officer to pop up from the back seat and point a pumpaction through the window at them and then they were past roman didnt speak again until they were thirty yards clear see told you he let out a long slow breath my plan with switching cars worked roman lacailles black bmw was stopped eighteen minutes earlier on boulevard viau en route to carlo funicellis shop in st leonard he wouldnt return to listen in to donatiens again until that night frank massenat was driving and three squad cars converged two following who raised the siren to push them over and another that arrived seconds later from the opposite direction five guns were trained on massenat and funicelli while they were summarily searched faced away hands on the roof of the car no guns were found massenat knew that even a simple carrying violation could get him six months and when their names were found not to match those of the alert the lead constable put a call back in to dorchester boulevard chac came on within a minute and fired a chain of questions relayed through the constable wheres roman lacaille now and why are you driving his car frank massenat answered that he didnt know where roman was and he only had the car because it had to go to a garage later its playing up ticking noises from the engine whats roman driving now i dont know he said he was going to hire a car where from pardon dont know that either chac didnt believe any of it for a minute but there was nothing he could do he instructed the constable to let them go then headed for the interview room to tell michel the bad news venegass photo came up on the small tv at the back of the counter by a display of sweets and roman tried not to look too interested as the cashier totted up the last of the groceries in his basket morning news on tqs one of the main quebec tv stations the sound was on low and roman could hardly pick out what was being said hed turned off the freeway for lac shawinigan and stopped at the first gas station with adjoining store to pick up groceries for venegass stay venegas wouldnt be needing any of it it would all end up in his own kitchen cupboards but it was important to keep up the illusion not give any reason for venegas to become suspicious or tense for the same reason hed made the journey alone frank massenat in the back seat might have sent the signal that it was a oneway trip fiftyeight dollars forty merci the news had moved on to a light plane crash near jonquiere as roman paid and got his change his breath showed heavy on the cold air making his way out to the car he wondered whether to say anything to venegas about the news flash but decided finally against it it would only make venegas edgy and tense again hed only in the last twenty minutes managed to get venegass nerves settled back to anything near normal after the patrol car edging past venegas was starting to think of two weeks quiet rest in a log cabin then off to martinique keep him thinking that way there roman dumped the bags in the back seat started up and pulled out should keep you going for a while he gave a brief glance in the rearview mirror before joining the road the front of the car and venegas had been faced away even if someone had paid heed to the news flash roman doubted theyd have noticed venegas what did you get venegas asked coffee bread some burgers tuna a few tins of salmon roman waved one hand theatrically and smiled you want fresh fish just cut a hole in the ice and put a line down youre kidding venegas fired back only a half sly smile and roman wasnt sure whether venegas was questioning that there were fish there or the fact that venegas the backwoodsman cut such an unlikely image he reminded himself not to get testy keep venegas relaxed sure plenty of fish down there winter and summer just cut a hole smile down at em and theyre leaping up out at you already roman chuckled yeah sure venegas sounded unconvinced as he looked away blandly surveying the passing scenery if thats what it took playing the oaf thought roman then fine venegas was more relaxed than hed seen him all journey a couple of summers ago even franky had a try and caught some fish one look from him you think would scare them away you know what we call him roman looked across a sign flashed past lac shawinigan miles venegas shrugged and smiled back weakly roman chuckled frankystein all he needs is a bolt through the neck roman kept the banter up on and off for the next few miles with venegas providing the occasional comment and smile and roman felt his jaw start to ache with the effort of forcing a smile beyond the tension drawing his nerves increasingly taut as they got closer to lake shawinigan roman felt as if his nervous system was plugged in directly to every minute detail the thrum of the wheels on the road venegass slow blink as he surveyed the snowbound landscape venegass left hand moving up past his jacket to rub his nose as he turned to roman youre going to a lot of trouble with all this for me venegas said with the silent lull after the chain of banter roman wondered whether venegas had picked up on his tension nooo no problem roman pushed an easy smile and waved one hand from the wheel the fix youre in is directly as a result of you doing something special for me its down to me to put right no question he stared the message home keen to reassure venegas but he couldnt discern any wariness in venegass eyes he looked back sharply to the road the turn off for lac shawinigan showed fifty yards ahead he slowed indicated though no traffic was approaching and only a single car was just visible a quarter of a mile behind and swung in gripping the wheel firm to stop his hands from visibly shaking a rough track in the summer is was bumpy but now thick snow had evened it out no visible tyre tracks nobody had been down here in recent hours which cabin is it venegas asked roman was thrown for a second the one and only time hed visited three years back it had been summer the tree foliage thick now foliage was sparse and the icebound lake and the cabins were visible through the trees oh uh the third on the right he made a guess he remembered only it was on the right but wasnt sure between the third and fourth cabin it hardly mattered venegas wouldnt be making it that far the cabin was a friend of frank massenats and his one visit had been to thrash out a drugs deal with the head of the bikers roubilliard he wouldnt have risked bringing venegas out to a lacaille family cabin but now following venegass gaze towards the lake and the cabins he saw something that worried him what looked like smoke rising from the fifth cabin along someone was out here then it was lost behind some fir trees as he came up to the car park spread out on their right no vehicles there roman swung in see told you nobody around this time of year you wont see anyone now till end of april may but roman was still wondering about that smoke eager to get another glimpse a line of fir trees bordered the edge of the car park and the first ten yards of pathway towards the lake hed have to wait until they walked past them roman got out and swung open the back door venegas opened the other side and took out his kit back but reaching in for the grocery bags roman paused with both hands full hed be at a distinct disadvantage especially if venegas carried his kit bag in his left hand with his gun hand free something wrong venegas asked uh yeah roman quickly thought of how to even the balance last time after a long break the padlock was all rusted we couldnt get the key in we might need something to break it hold that for me would yer he handed one grocery bag to venegas and put the other under his arm as he went around and opened the trunk he just hoped funicelli had a tyre lever and after a bit of rustling around he found the tool bag tucked in on the left he took out the lever and shut the trunk romans breath showed heavy on the air as they paced away his mouth was dry his nerves racing uncontrollably he could easily have pulled his gun on venegas before grabbing the tyre lever but still he needed to know about that smoke he couldnt risk it if someone was by the lake their feet crunched on fresh snow no previous footsteps either that roman could discern the path ran for about forty yards to the lakeside between the fir trees he caught flash glimpses of the cabins but he just couldnt tell if it was smoke or only mist rising venegas hunched and made a mock shiver colder than the city here yeah roman said blandly but not half as cold as where youre going for some reason venegas had fallen in half a step behind him perhaps venegas had picked up on his vibes was being wary or was he just letting him lead the way but the motion of dropping the tyre lever and swivelling around would give venegas too much of an advantage he needed to get venegas in front and somehow distracted romans heart thudded hard and fast marking almost a double time to his crunching footsteps they cleared the fir trees bordering the path and there was a clear view of the cabins again but still roman couldnt tell if it was smoke or mist which suddenly struck him could be turned to an opportunity he halted back slowing his step is that smoke i can see rising over there fifth cabin along or just mist i mean if someone else is down here you shouldnt be here venegas pulled a step ahead and peered through the trees no i i dont think so its not smoke looks like mist rising to me roman tensed himself to pull his gun are you sure venegas squinted his eyes more intensely towards the cabin yeah sure you can see where the suns coming through a gap in the trees and hitting the roof and venegas heard the tyre lever hit the snow and turned to see romans pulled and pointed at him romans grocery bag followed venegas let out a sneering half laugh of disbelief on a burst exhalation what is this roman waved with the gun drop the groceries and your bag and keep your hands above shoulder level venegas met his gaze steadily defiantly for a second as if he was measuring options of trying something roman waved again with his gun and venegas finally dropped the groceries and his kit bag roman moved in quickly and took venegass mm from his inside pocket and grabbed the kit bag thanks ill take the ak too he tucked the mm inside the kit bag and prodded the air with his gun now lets move on down to the lakeside with another sneering half snort and a resigned shrug venegas finally turned and started pacing ahead roman kept three paces behind after a moment venegas remarked what you getting me all the way out here was just to shoot me venegas said this as if all the small puzzle pieces of their journey out had finally slotted into place or did roman detect a faint note of hope and clinging disbelief in the voice no im not going to shoot you as it happens which was true he wasnt youre just going fishing silence only their footsteps crunching on snow as venegas grappled to make sense of this he decided finally to disregard it as a bluff come on roman what happened to martinique venegas half turned his eyes pleaded but his voice carried a partly joking tone as if he knew he was clutching at straws tickets were too expensive roman fired a trite half smile and my mother said she didnt want to see you there a few more paces and the inevitability dawned on venegas roman saw his shoulders visibly sag he started to get desperate for fucks sake roman come on his voice was shaky with mounting nerves the words spluttering slightly you know i wouldnt talk temptations are huge these days especially with the sort of plea deals going to nail people like me and jeanpaul sorry silence again both of them tuned into every small sound from the surrounding woodland and the lake faint scurrying fifty yards to their right as a bird alighted from a bush the cawing of a crow in the distance romans nerves had settled back a bit from their wild hammering just before pulling the gun but still he was tense lightningspeed reflexes was one of venegass traits roman reminded himself not to get too close they reached the edge of the lake and venegas turned he was noticeably trembling and roman wasnt sure whether from the cold or with what he knew was about to happen please roman you dont have to do this your secret with savards safe with me his voice was cracking almost on the edge of tears it sure is because the secrets staying here with you forever frozen roman smiled drolly and made a sharp prod with the gun now lets go for a walk on the lake venegas looked down and around apprehensively roman prompted dont worry the ices thick itll hold you and ill be walking right with you to keep you company another air stab with the gun and venegas finally reluctantly started heading out roman dropped venegass kit bag and followed keeping a clear four paces behind venegass eyes continued darting for options or perhaps he was unsure that the ice wouldnt give way at any second his gaze finally settled on the lakeshore cabins you know i think that is smoke coming from that cabin i dont think so roman didnt even trouble to look he wasnt going to risk taking his eyes from venegas for a second i think its just you blowing smoke the lake was only half a mile wide but its fourteenmile length snaked out of sight in both directions with a strong river runoff at one end which made its currents lethal they could feel the wind whip sharper as they went deeper out shifting the thin layer of snow on the ice in flurries at sixty yards from the shore roman announced thisll do venegas turned what now his breath was heavy on the air with the walk and his rising panic though his eyes were curiously dull as if part of him had accepted what was going to happen i thought you said you werent going to shoot me im not roman allowed himself a last second gloating that venegas still hadnt worked out what was planned for him then slowly lowered the gun and eased off a shot by venegass feet a burst of snow and ice sprayed up what the fuuuu venegas jumped a step to the right like an offbalance flamenco dancer roman fired the next shot the other side and this time heard the ice crack another quick shot a yard behind and with a louder crack roman watched in satisfaction as a four foot square block broke away venegas leapt back in horror from the shifting block his eyes registering only then what roman intended roman smiled easing off a quick shot just behind where venegas had leapt to another heavy icecrack and leap from venegas this was fun thought roman like riverdance with bullets he fired another shot two foot behind and the crack spread still further the iceblock venegas was standing on threatening to break away the panic on venegass face was absolute and he tried to leap clear but the sudden thrust of his pushoff snapped the last resistance and the block broke free venegas toppled and fell but with the inertia of his lunge he managed to grip onto the rim of the ice bordering the hole he was submerged only from the chest down the shock of the water hit venegas like an ice truck as he frantically scrambled to pull his body out roman fired another shot two foot beyond his fingers a crack but not enough so roman fired again just behind ice and snow erupted and the block fell away venegas slipped sideways and tumbled completely under his arms thrashing frantically at the water his head bobbed back up quickly and he managed finally to get a fingers grip on the next solid ice edge roman became frantic an eightchamber automatic he had only two bullets left it had seemed a good idea at first making it look like a straightforward drowning rather than a hit now he began to wonder but he could see that strong currents were dragging at venegas surely he couldnt last long he had trouble keeping grip and his face was purple from cold and the effort roman fired again spewing up an impressive spray of snow and ice but to his consternation the ice held firm romans heart pumped wildly hed have to get in close to make this last bullet count and venegass pleading frantic eyes lifted towards him as he moved in almost as if venegas knew this was the coupe de grace a large chunk of ice was blown clean away with the shot and venegas went with it his body dragged quickly under by the current a suspended moment with only flat water and no venegas the faint echo of the shot still reverberating and roman was about to turn away when he saw one hand clutch out and grip the ice edge he stared back desperately towards the shore and venegass kit bag too far venegas would have pulled himself back up by the time he got back with a fresh gun only one thing for it he would have to kick venegass hand away but he couldnt risk having all his weight close to the edge so he rushed in and scrambled out almost flat kicking out in the same motion venegass hand held firm so he kicked again it was knocked free but then in horror roman noticed venegass other hand rise up almost instantly to grip on and something else in that instant that took his breath away made his blood run cold a cracking noise as a yardlong split appeared to one side of where he was laying any sudden movement and the whole iceblock would split away he lay inert for a few seconds his chest rising and falling hard as fear and panic gripped him and in that moment appearing almost as a surreal apparition venegass face below him wild codeyes staring up then roman focused and realized that his shuffling around had cleared a patch of snow and he could see straight through the ice their eyes locked for a second venegas perhaps surprised at seeing roman there so close or wondering why roman looked as panicked and afraid as him but at least now he could fully measure venegass dilemma the current was tugging at him ruthlessly so that he was pushed up almost horizontal under the ice with one hand gripped on hard and trying to pull him back venegas surely couldnt last much longer like that and roman wondered whether to just lay still and watch the last bubbles leave venegass mouth or take the risk and kick out again to finish him straightaway venegas made the decision for him by making one last frantic pull back towards the hole his body shifted over a foot beneath the ice as roman kicked out once twice and venegass grip was finally jolted free roman smiled and waved as venegass body drifted back past him unsure whether venegass bewildered watery focus was able to fix on him or not and then romans smile quickly fell as another crack sounded in the ice he scrambled desperately only just managing to slither his torso onto the solid ice edge beyond as the block beneath him broke loose his legs from the thigh down dipping into the icy water for one terrible moment he thought that venegas might see his legs dangling in and grapple hold and he slithered forward breathlessly until his whole body was clear of the water and supported on the ice he rolled over his breath still rasping hard with exertion and the adrenalin rush and a laugh suddenly broke free not quite sure if it was venegass expression as hed drifted past or his own close escape that he found so amusing a steady raucous laugh that was faltered only by his fight to regain breath as the only sound to break the eerie silence of the desolate surroundings all the birds had alighted the nearby trees with the gunfire it sounded ominous and out of place a lone victory cry eight i know elena shielded her other ear from the drone and throb of the ferry engine as she spoke into her mobile but if this meeting goes well now theres no reason why i couldnt head out there anyway tomorrow or the day after she was on the short ferry hop between studland and sandbanks at the other end was shelley mcgurran in the aid agencys london office you dont have to shelley commented sarah was happy riding shotgun with the shipment and she should be quite capable by now theyre not going to be in bucharest in any case until late tomorrow night thats why i suggested leaving tomorrow or the day after to tie in shelley sighed faintly really elena it doesnt need two of you if it did id be the first to say besides with sarah not around i can do with your help here with a bit of pr and fundraising despite fourteen years in london shelley still had a warm dublin lilt almost tailor made for this task now reassurance elena fell silent for a second are you sure shes up to it shelley sighed again who knows hopefully yes but if not shes got to learn sometime dont forget youre first trip out you were thrown in the deep end too thats true a small agency of only fourteen including drivers their grand designs were driven more by ever shifting dramas and emergencies than by careful planning an endless cycle of fundraising shipments bureaucratic paperwork and organising goods with planned calendar dates constantly hopscotched according to which emergency suddenly screamed loudest that was part of elenas concern now that her own private drama with lorena was just one problem too many a feather to overtip their already precariously balanced applecart somebody was having to cover for her and so despite shelleys assurances she felt she just had to offer to make good everything had gone quiet for over a week and then came the call from nadine moore her supervisor barbara edelston had requested a meeting at which elenas presence was also required in order to make a full and accurate assessment nadine related this with questioning parody as if stung that her own presence at the meeting and her report requesting assessment filed straight after their last meeting with lorena werent on their own enough elena didnt want to get drawn into their interdepartmental sensitivities so merely asked why the delay possibly consultation with a relevant external party such as a psychiatrist nadine aired but she wasnt sure elena glanced at her watch shed missed the earlier ferry shed hoped to catch but she should still just make it on time perhaps a few minutes late at most you can catch up with viorel and the others next time shelley said yeah right viorel was the sevenyear old boy with meningitis whose brow shed mopped half the night before he pulled back from the brink elena knew that shelley meant well was only trying to put her mind at rest but it also served as a reminder they need us too desperately whether from the throbbing vibrations of the ferry or the fact that the coming meeting would likely decide lorenas fate make or break she felt suddenly nervous she shook off a faint shiver dont feel guilty shelley said as if picking up on the silent vibes look upon this with lorena as aftercare if were going to spend our lives in hope that these children will finally find safe secure homes only to find theyre still in danger then were all wasting our time shelley drew a laboured breath i mean it elena go for it and all the other worn cliches that apply give no quarter take no prisoners shelleys suddenly lighter tone trailed off as elena watched the ferry ramp ahead swing down thanks maybe shelley was just trying to make her feel good but there was no time left to debate car engines were starting in readiness to move off ill phone you straight afterwards let you know how it went barbara edelston was early fifties with light brown hair cut short and a matronly build she was less severe and stern than elena had feared and even smiled at reasonable intervals though this couldnt be construed as over friendliness it was a vaguely condescending smile as if she was merely humouring the less informed edelston also played an extremely closed hand elena couldnt get any indication which way it might swing from edelstons opening ten minutes in which she confirmed basic points of nadines report reasons for first alert times of their two visits parties present at each the only hopeful spark was edelston commenting that ms moores report indeed pushes a strong and convincing case for psychiatric assessment for lorena only a couple of questions so far had involved elena now edelston turned to her more fully when did you first meet lorena just over four years ago february ninetyfive she was at the orphanage at cimpeni a sea of children and distressed pleading faces but elena still vividly recalled lorenas large greygreen eyes cutting through the mass a strangely serene gaze given the surrounding mayhem and did she in any way show signs of being mentally disturbed then you mean was she having bad dreams elena felt it important to confine the definition when theyd first arrived at cimpeni some children had reached such depths of depravation chained to beds or kept in basement rooms without light for months that all they could do was rock back and forth and groan lorena had been one of the more hopeful cases elena shook her head no she was quite alert when i first met her given the appalling conditions shed coped well and there were no bad dreams then that i knew of edelston had nadines report open on the desk before her with her own notepad at the side she looked at them briefly as if for a prompt so when did the dreams first occur not long after the cimpeni orphanage closed and her eleven months rough on the streets of bucharest you see in the winter they slept mainly in the sewers to keep warm elena looked down for a second one hand clutched tight in anger at the memory we blamed ourselves a lot for that elena covered the details quickly their not reading the signs earlier that a local developer was after the building the hasty shipping out of the children to temporary shelter a run down hospital on the outskirts of bucharest but it was a clearing house for so many other orphanages and fresh children off the street that overcrowding was intense and food and care was nonexistent a single nurse used to act as daytime warden only and would just lock the children in and leave them to their own devices at night it took us ten days to mobilise to get out there but on one of those nights two days before we arrived almost forty of the children broke out believing and probably rightly so that their chances of fending for themselves on the street were better elena looked at edelston steadily taking the opportunity to drive home the silent plea look what shes already been through dont let her suffer any more now lorena was one of those children and i didnt see her again until she showed up at bucharests cerneit orphanage where were also heavily involved with aid provision it was shortly after then that her bad dreams started edelston made a one line note before looking up again did she have any psychiatric counselling at that time or indeed at any time before the ryalls made their adoption approach no she didnt it was hardly frazier country we elena stopped herself short the question struck her as somewhat ridiculous given the problems even keeping the children alive let alone delving into their psyches but she might come across as condescending which would then harm their chances she tempered her tone well there were nearly always more pressing medical emergencies and resources were tight i see edelston looked uncertain for a second where to head next so the implication is that given the resources lorena probably would have received psychiatric counselling at that stage edelston barely waited out the mute nod from elena and so when the ryalls first met her in bucharest to start the adoption process who without doubt would have had such resources and also had a strong vested interest in lorenas mental stability from the outset was psychiatric assessment recommended then no it wasnt elenas voice faded off submissively and she fired a brief sideways glance at nadine it was a valid point why request assessment only now when apparently the problems with lorenas dreams were even worse when she first met the ryalls just before walking in the meeting shed been hit with the first positive rush that surely there was strong hope why else would edelston ask her along if it was edelstons intention to dismiss the request out of hand then surely shed have just had the meeting with nadine alone and let her pass on the bad tidings less confrontation now as she felt the first serious assault on that hope edelstons every gesture began to grate but she reminded herself that this could be lorenas last chance and she was damned if she was going to let it be washed away with a few ingratiating smiles curt efficient pen strokes and now an annoying raised single eyebrow that looked more smugly challenging than questioning she could almost still feel lorena quaking in her grasp as they ran the light at the end of the chine remaining distant out of reach elena drew fresh breath i think with many an adopted child of lorenas age theres an acceptance that there will be some psychological scars from their past given what often leads to them being orphaned abuse by their real parents death of their parents or abandonment at birth with all those years to dwell on the fact that unlike other children they dont have parents arent part of a family with romanian children the terrible hardship and depravation of the orphanages has been so widely publicised that that acceptance becomes even stronger parents know and accept that they might be taking on emotionally damaged goods as long as the children are physically healthy and have easy big smiles they tend to look no further than that the eyebrow deflated and elena forced a slightly tired sigh i think the hope is always that with the child given a better life all of the emotional problems attached to their past will happily fade into the background and with lorena that indeed was the case for the first year or more its the fact that the dreams and memories of her troubled background have resurged after so long and the circumstances under which theyve come back mr ryall visiting her room thats now given cause for concern i know i know i understand that edelston nodded eagerly and turned her right palm towards them miss moores report has made a very clear and strong case for that as i mentioned but i think the background youve given me is also useful what i wanted to make sure of is that real opportunities for psychiatric assessment hadnt been ignored out of hand before and werent being brought up now merely as a ruse to dig deeper into this problem of mr ryall visiting lorenas room when on the surface it appears nothing is really happening there just a developing teenagers awkwardness with a an adult man visiting what she sees as her increasingly private space her bedroom with the rest manufactured purely in her dreams i think the main reason for the assessment is that we really need to separate the two nadine offered see where lorenas dreams end and reality begins probably nothing is happening but analysis would allow lorena to also see that she could lay her fears to rest and sleep easy i see is that what you feel edelston smiled primly remind me to dig out your psychiatric diploma it must have slipped out of your file as nadine look down submissively blushing edelston saw elenas rising outrage and held one hand up im sorry that was uncalled for but i think its important to steer clear of amateur analysis now im quite prepared to approve assessment if i think its warranted and as i said before theres no ulterior motive the question is are you both firmly of a mind without reservation that that is the case elena was caught off guard by the sharp turnaround a sudden glimmer of light back again yes uh of course this is all about lorenas welfare nothing else nadine regaining her feet from her putdown was slower to respond yes absolutely she proffered with one hand as i put in my report so this has absolutely nothing to do with trying to dig up something on mr ryall purely because of your failure to uncover anything through conventional methods edelston was looking between the two of them keenly and elena felt faint alarm bells obviously shed had contact with ryall and hed aired his concerns but if they simply stood their ground surely theyd still win the day no were interested only in lorena turning her back once and for all on her bad dreams elenas tone was firm resolute which is a psychiatrists territory not ours and hopefully any worries she has about mr ryall will evaporate at the same time nadine was more hesitant sensing that her supervisor had the scent of blood on something specific and gave only a mildly concurrent nod edelston continued looking at them pointedly and a thin smug smile appeared as if shed just corralled two errant children after a long chase im glad youre both so sure about the worthiness of your intentions edelston reached to a sidedrawer and took out a small cassette tape recorder because after hearing this im afraid im far from convinced with a momentary hover of her finger for emphasis she pressed play elena is right in that we cant do much with what we have but at least if all of this is only in your mind we have the comfort that nothing is really happening youre not at risk elena felt her stomach dip as if a trap door had opened ryall had taped their last session her legs weakened and she felt dizzy a misty cloud at the back of her eyes threatening blackout at this point you both appear to have given up the ghost edelston prompted and then comes the fight back her eyes settled steadfastly on elena if somethings happening youve got to tell us has mr ryall been talking to you telling you not to say anything you dont have to answer that im sorry she just seems so confused and i suppose im scrambling for reasons why marked pause and then a tired inhalation from nadine before we go is there anything else youd like to discuss with us lorena anything which you think might help us barely audible no its okay from lorena and edelston talked over the rest of nadines winding down noble early attempt but no severe rule lines broken so far and at this stage were back on track until we get to edelston held one hand up like a conductor even without the elaborate cue elena knew what was coming she closed her eyes surrendering the last faint light of the chine as the cloud washed deeper making her temples ache and lorena was no longer with her but back at her bedroom window looking out over a grey misty sea lost forlorn elenas legs were suddenly unsteady and she felt herself sway slightly in the selfimposed darkness nausea rising if this is all only in lorenas mind perhaps as mr ryall suggests even linked to her continuing problem with nightmares surely at least we should request psychiatric assessment thats true but we just dont have enough for such an order on what we have now we could only make the request it would be left up to the ryalls to decide i understand but if we sold the psychiatric assessment to the ryalls on the grounds of it being linked to lorenas continuing problem with bad dreams hed have little reason to object after all its the dreams that he keeps complaining are dragging him to her room late at night if he does object its going to look highly suspicious elena felt the last vestiges of hope fall away she wanted to reach out to lorena explain we tried to help you but in the end our own eagerness let you down im sorry but there wouldnt even be that chance after this theyd be barred from all contact with lorena edelstons expression was challenging one eyebrow sharply arched so no ulterior motive you claim elena didnt respond she just looked down embarrassed as on tape nadine pushed the idea of assessment to lorena their position was untenable no possible footholds from which they could bounce back ryall had won the day there was nothing more they could say that would save lorena from his grip and from now shed never even get close to knowing what went on beyond his high gates shed be lucky if she ever got to see lorena again roman slotted in the cassette tape he hadnt got a chance to play the tape earlier with all the panic with venegas and only remembered now as he hit the freeway fourteen miles south of lac shawinigan hed planned originally to dump venegass kit bag in a rubbish tip in lavalle but then became anxious about carrying it all the way back to the city what if the rcs had worked out the car switch and he was stopped on the way in the end he ran back from the shore and threw the kit bag through the ice hole his nerves were still racing now with it all his hand shaking as he fed in the cassette the voices were indistinct at first could barely be heard above the engine and the thrum of the wheels he turned it up a bit then realized it was just the rustling of the bedsheets and donatiens mumbling he picked out only no its okay im with you and the rest was lost then simones voice came crashing in loudly georges georges are you okay roman turned it back down a fraction no no i promise i you okay you were shaking the bed a lot calling out i know i know im sorry funicelli had told him that the worrying part came just after donatiens broke out of his dream nothing significant so far he started to get impatient listening through their banter about terri hatcher and roseanne and simones comments about her father and he was about to wind the tape further on when the words hit look there was something that happened that night with roman and leduc something that i never romans hand pulled back again his shake now more pronounced he realized that hed swayed slightly from his lane as an overtaking truck blasted its airhorn from behind he straightened up i never obviously have come to terms with so maybe thats why i keep replaying it in my dreams the gun firing leducs body tossed back like a rag dummy his blood was everywhere everywhere i can still feel it sticky against my skin sometimes at night you poor thing there only one thing you should feel sticky against your skin at night with the sound of rustling sheets and kissing roman stopped the tape and hastily rewound funicelli was right to have alerted him but it wasnt donatiens talking about that night with leduc that was most worrying it was what wasnt said roman found the section again and hit play that happened with roman and leduc something that i never it was all there in the silence between the words donatiens was about to tell simone then suddenly had a change of heart i never obviously have come to terms roman stopped rewound played it again honing in keener on the silence in between a siren wailed its way through the city in the background a faint rustle of sheets but roman was tuned in solely to what donatiens thoughts might have been in those few seconds he replayed the section again twice straightaway then once more just as he hit the outskirts of montreal there remained little doubt donatiens had been only a second away from telling all hed been lucky this time but what about next time and the time after that a weak hazy afternoon sun flickered through the stanchions of the anuntsic bridge as he crossed picking out a faint film of sweat on his forehead the burden of that night obviously weighed heavy on donatiens and at some stage he was bound to break the problem was that accidents had run their course and he couldnt get near making a move on donatiens without jeanpauls consent how in hell was he going to convince jeanpaul that his golden boy needed to be taken out no for gods sake noooo savards scream rattled the recorders small speaker three georges closed his eyes as he imagined savard being thrown from the building sailing free but hadnt newscasts said that savard was shot maybe it was one of those cases of the police withholding information so that they knew when they had the right suspect a soft thud came a second later followed by another voice thats just a practice run tony if you dont tell us where the money is were going to do it for real chenouda was staring at him keenly chenoudas eyes had hardly left him throughout but there were selected moments of the tape playing like now when he pressed home a special message its not just that they killed savard look at the mental torture they put him through theyd locked horns earlier when it came over on tape that romans bmw had pulled up only a moment after the van with savard had sped off and chenouda had pushed the significance see clever he shows up late knowing that it would already have gone down and has the cheek to hold his arms up in a where is he gesture he knows hes on camera so at the same time he gets an automatic alibi georges protested that just because roman was there didnt necessarily mean he had anything to do with savards murder then tell me who else knew about the meet to be able to set up a bushwhack like this georges didnt have any ready answers and fell silent again through the rest of the tape the sirens the tension of the chase the voices bouncing back and forth between savards abductors and the police network within minutes had georges nerves ragged he tried to keep a poker face throughout not let his emotions be too transparent but it was difficult the ruse of savard being thrown from a high building was frightening beyond belief and now the clawing tension towards the finale savards abductors discussing whether or not to move savard before finally deciding to do it there then the ominously expectant timefrozen silence with the guns being taken out with georges suddenly aware of every small sound of the squad room chenoudas shallow breathing his partner maury scratching a doodle lightly on a pad a clock ticking on the far wall as the two shots finally came with chenoudas scream of noooo georges physically jolted chenouda swallowed slowly though he waited a moment more for the footsteps crunching on snow to fully recede before he pressed stop his eyes were still fixed keenly on georges quite a boy your roman hes not my favourite person either georges voice was slightly hoarse as he struggled to regain composure his stomach was in knots and his hammering nerves seemed to have robbed his breath but that still doesnt mean he was involved with something like this it was a bluff his doubts about roman were rising hard and fast but the last person he wanted to share that with was chenouda all he wanted to do was get free and clear from this claustrophobic interview room so that he could marshal some clarity to his wildly churning thoughts look ive listened to your tape as promised can i go now michel didnt answer he just continued staring straight through donatiens a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth as if he could read the bluff after a second he stood up started pacing there was a specific reason why savard was there that night to meet with roman you see we could have gone with what we already had savard claiming that roman shot leduc with you there beside him at the time but savard wasnt actually in the car when it happened and then too wed have had the problem of winning over romans likely plea of selfdefence chances were we wouldnt have been able to nail him roman claimed that leduc had a gun you see it was there on the car floor by the time savard reached the car michel looked back hard at donatiens from the end of the table but then youd know all about that you were right there with him when it happened georges shook his head you know im not saying anything without a lawyer present that was our arrangement georges glanced towards maury for support maury had stopped doodling and started making notes not that thered be much to note georges had no intention of saying anything they were sat at a bare pine table with six chairs around minimalist ikea to match the modern spartan lines of dorchester boulevard an informal interview so it had been agreed at the outset that it wouldnt be taped georges was relieved also that there were no wall mirrors nobody was looking in from another room michel rested his hands on the end of the table the main purpose of the meeting that night was for savard to draw roman out on the issue of the gun try and break his selfdefence cover you see savard was pretty sure leduc didnt have a gun that night georges looked down hopefully shielding his flinch and the shadow that crossed his eyes in that second chenoudas gaze was penetrating unsettling he could feel it searing through probably reading volumes into his unsettled reaction then again youd probably know that too michel aired since you were right there beside him georges was on his feet his chair grating back abruptly lawyer lawyer chenouda or im walking michel ignored the protest barrelled on and you know why savard was sure leduc didnt have a gun because as leduc got into his car for them to go to the meeting savard saw what was in his ankle sock it was a notebook not a gun a black notebook georges wished now he hadnt stood his legs felt suddenly weak unsteady is that so he challenged but his tremulous undertone defeated any intended bravado chenouda wasnt fooled for a minute chenouda not only knew he seemed pretty sure of his ground that georges knew too it was unnerving the other thing is that gun on the floor michels tone rose questioningly smith and wesson savard never remembered leduc carrying a gun of that type but it was one of romans favourites for a compact second gun georges shook off a faint shudder as chenoudas glare burnt through him he should never have come along hed walked into a lions den a trap he sat back down and let out a tired worn sigh i want to leave this isnt what we agreed i came here for i was just to listen to your tape you apparently had some warning about the danger i was in and that was it oh yes your warning michel waved one hand in a dramatic sweep do you really think romans going to let you live after the trouble hes gone to getting rid of every other witness to that night and you pose far more of a threat than tremblay or savard they could only put roman there you were right beside him michel stared the message home youre the only one to know that it was coldblooded murder rather than selfdefence georges cradled his head in one hand massaging his temples there was a lot of merit in what chenouda said in fact too much merit adding ballast to the silent demons gripping him since that night with leduc but he didnt want chenouda to know that hed hit a nerve and risk falling deeper into his trap he wanted somewhere at least a few blocks away over fresh coffee or perhaps a shot of something stronger to be able to selfexamine alone what he really thought he didnt even trouble to look up this time youve played the tape youve issued your warning can i go now a worn flat tone can i go now can i go now michel parodied youre a fucking stuck record he waved a hand to one side sure be my guest go out there and let roman kill you georges looked between chenouda and maury hardly believing he was being let go so soon before getting uncertainly to his feet im not convinced roman had anything to do with savards death so im afraid i just dont see the danger the same way you do not convinced michel raised an acute eyebrow i thought you bankers were meant to be sharp guys oh and i forgot he put one hand up a stopping motion pretty soon were going to know for sure whether roman had anything to do with savard or not which was actually the other reason why i asked you in right now michel drew fresh breath and explained about venegas being idd from a jaques cartier bridge camera he was being sought as they spoke michel glanced at his watch almost an hour since theyd gone to venegass apartment twenty minutes since they pulled up massenat in romans bmw chac and his team were now parked within eyesight of venegass apartment entrance and a provincewide alert was out how much longer before he showed we expect him to be pulled in any minute georges sat slowly back down again so if youve got him what do you need with me what i need is for you to see this as your last opportunity with roman fingered by venegas hell likely go down for savard and leduc because without one there isnt motive for the other and weve got savard on record putting you right beside roman when it happened so the minute we cuff venegas youre just one beat away from going down for accomplice to murder michel stared the threat home seeing the alarm rise in donatiens eyes before donatiens became uncomfortable and averted his gaze unless that is you give us your account first nows your chance maybe your only chance georges ruffled his hair brusquely before looking back directly at chenouda were into lawyer territory again and we agreed at the outset i wouldnt be answering anything where i might need a lawyer michel ignored it he sensed that he was close to breaking donatiens just a turn more on the screw i might be wrong but i dont think youd have willingly gone along with roman knowing that he was about to murder leduc that isnt your role in the lacaille organization and witness to selfdefence is not even a misdemeanour but with you staying quiet its starting to look more and more like it was murder michel held one hand out an invitation if you come clean ill make sure you dont even see a cell door but if not michel waved the same hand towards more uncertain worrying alternatives georges felt the small room closing in on him tighter his pulse was racing and there was a constriction in his throat making swallowing difficult he couldnt believe how quickly everything had been turned around on him an hour ago hed been heading to his office now he was only a step away from a jail cell depending on what move he made next michel felt the conflicts tugging at donatiens like raw electricity in the air he was hovering close to the brink just one more push should do it you need to share this with someone for another reason georges every minute you keep this secret to yourself you pose a threat to roman while he cant breathe easy how much longer do you think hes going to let you breathe with the secret out that problem goes too you get rid of the death threat and the jail cell in one georges had to admit it was tempting no more double game with jeanpaul and wondering what roman might do next no more dreams in the middle of the night with leducs blood sticky against his skin no more georges suddenly stopped jeanpaul his main anxiety all along had been his guilt over not telling jeanpaul and this would just constitute further betrayal he owed chenouda the same as roman nothing georges shook his head if this was just about roman fine but i work for jeanpaul not roman georges felt the escape rope firmly in his grasp felt it pull back some of his clawing nerves i would do nothing to betray the trust jeanpaul has put in me and believe me its reciprocated even if i did have reason to fear roman he wouldnt be able to make a move on me without sanction from jeanpaul which wont be forthcoming now or at any time so while i appreciate your concern about my safety thank you but its misplaced georges forced a hesitant smile michels jaw tightened at times he could look upon donatiens as the business innocent caught up in the lacailles wolves den at others like now he was the smooth smug moneylaunderer hiding the lacailles dirty millions and laughing up his sleeve at the rcmp and when that view held sway it angered him all the more because unlike jeanpaul and roman donatiens had had a choice he was outside of their world and had a highlypaid respectable job with a bank he could have simply turned his back michel sneered thinly jeanpaul and roman have worked side by side now for over twenty years theyve been through hell and high water together buried both their father and their younger brother in the name of a crime empire thats survived now two generations if it comes to the crunch and thats threatened do you really think jeanpauls going to take your side over romans just because youve turned some good trade these past few years and youre shacked up with his daughter were to be married in case you havent heard georges tone was indignant but where all your theories fall apart is that theyre not even involved in crime anymore you expect me to believe that the bikers are still getting their supplies to distribute its business as usual and a lot of the old lacaille contact names like leduc keep cropping up its cacchione or a new independent maybe even more than one chenoudas sneer was back you and i both know that medeiros wont go near cacchione and he wouldnt trust these levels of transactions to some new kids on the block hes dealing with old friends and with cacchione out of the picture that leaves only the lacaille family you dont get it do you thats what me being brought in was all about to make money from legitimate enterprise so that they didnt need crime after pascal was shot everything georges faltered his voice trailing off he was getting drawn out by chenouda heading into areas he shouldnt be talking about look weve covered much more here than we agreed ive got to go georges stood up and smiled tightly earn some more legitimate money michel shrugged yeah sure cool your heels for a while in one of our cells while we pick up venegas then youre free to go what georges voice was strained with incredulity you said before i could go straightaway oh did i say that you know thats the problem with not running a tape you never can keep track from one moment to the next michels voice was heavy with sarcasm then his tone suddenly became low threatening you must be kidding you know now were onto venegas as soon as you walk out of here you could put a call through to roman and ruin our operation and if you want to call a lawyer fine hell only tell you the same that under section were allowed to hold someone up to twelve hours when an active operation might be threatened you bastard chenouda georges glared back hard you knew all the time you were going to do this you planned it michel moved in closer no i pulled you in to save your neck from roman which you dont seem to appreciate and also because this is your last chance to save yourself from a charge of accomplice to murder once weve pulled in venegas that chance has gone so now youve got some free time to contemplate the wiseness of talking or not georges met chenoudas hard stare evenly the nerves were back somersaulting in his stomach and tightening his throat and his first instinct was to continue fighting back but the rollercoaster ride of the last halfhour had drained him and the situation seemed almost too surreal for comment so that all that came out in the end was this is ridiculous huffed on a weak exhalation so when do you expect to be picking up venegas michel turned away slightly a half hour maybe an hour or two who knows georges shoulders slumped at the prospect of possibly hours in a jail cell you knew it all the time he hissed you knew that we dont have time for this now michel cut in brusquely holding one hand up ive got an operation in progress to get back to all i can say again is use the time wisely to rethink whether its worth taking an accomplice to murder rap for the lacailles he stared the weight of the message home one last time but still he couldnt tell if hed made any inroads he repeated donatiens right to a lawyer but donatiens merely fired back defiantly if im not going to talk whats the point before maury led him away michel sat down slowly in the silence of the interview room the exchange had exhausted him hopefully some time in the cells would weaken donatiens resolve hed get a taste of what the next few years might be like if the chips fell the wrong way for him and crumble the confrontation had given him more the measure of donatiens but still he wasnt sure the business innocent or the smooth moneylaunderer maybe the next few hours with donatiens within arms each in the cells below would help provide some clarity for both of them elena stared into the churning water over the side of the ferry rail a faint mist obscured landfall at the far end of poole harbour and the open sea at her back the short ferry hop had come to symbolise for them freedom escape from all the madness of the world outside but now it felt as if theyd merely been escaping reality and the veil had finally been lifted on just what a waste half her life had been elena had protested with edelston that surely the fact alone that ryall had taped their last meeting showed his guilt edelston didnt agree ryall suspected that lorena was being led and cajoled into admitting something that just hadnt happened was purely in her dreams and the tape had born out that concern elena had launched one last desperate assault thats what wed hoped for in recommending psychiatric assessment it would have separated the dreams from the reality and cleared up any doubt once and for all that as may be but due to your overeagerness and overstepping the line that chance im afraid has now gone she shook her head nothing more she could do for lorena unsure now whether the leaden weight sagging her shoulders was because she felt to blame or the sense of redundancy and helplessness but was it too late to save herself when shed first made the ferry hop shed been with her parents and younger brother shed been only eight years old and imagined that she was sailing away to a magical mystical land that the short strip of sea separated them from an entirely different world it became all the more magical when she discovered the chine theyd been on the beach and shed gone deep inside out of sight and shed lost track of time wrapped in its cool shaded embrace sitting by the gently running brook while a squirrel eating a berry on a nearby branch looked at her curiously shed been gone for over forty minutes her parents berated her when she emerged theyd been frantically looking for her worried that he might have drowned her fathers anger was strongest and finally it boiled over he landed an increasingly hard flurry of smacks on her backside before her mother intervened it was just one of many volcanic eruptions of her fathers constantly stern bubbling temperament and her and her brother spent half their lives in fear of ever provoking it the first time shed made the ferry journey with gordon had been fifteen years ago theyd been going out together for only three months then after that made the habit of coming down every spare weekend in the summer months gordon was working in the city at the time and for him the short ferry hop symbolised separation from the mad cut and thrust of the finance markets that consumed him all week a year after they were married they bought a weekend cottage in chelborne only two miles from where they now lived then six years ago came gordons heart attack and his decision to leave the city and them move to the area permanently they put out requests with local estate agents and details of the house overlooking the chine came through their letterbox four months later they stayed in the weekend cottage while improvements were made gordon started a small investment brokerage based from home handling a select few old clients to which were gradually added some local clients and she also shifted half her london workload to a home desk and computer when she wasnt on a plane or truck bound for eastern europe she spent most of her time on the phone so it hardly mattered whether she was in london or dorset gordons income was more than halved but their london house sale had left them with a healthy financial cushion most importantly gordon felt happier less stressed and they both had more quality time to spend with the children elena shook her head each stage in their lives appeared so carefully planned and mapped out except that half of it had been a lie throughout and shed lived that lie now for so long that she could never bring herself to tell gordon it would cut him to the quick summon another heart attack no this was a quest shed have to make alone in secret christos georgallis she muttered the name almost as an incantation under her breath quickly swallowed on the steady breeze swirling into poole harbour twentynine years she wondered where he was now she had so much to tell him that shed never stopped thinking about him that shed always loved him and that she was sorry sorry sorry she clenched her eyes tight as the tears welled oh my god she was sorry but she wondered first and foremost if shed ever be able to find him knowing how intent her father had been on burying him forever out of sight and reach probably not nine you called earlier roman hunched his collar up tight an icy wind outside seemed to still penetrate the glass of the telephone booth his callers usual booth two blocks from rcmp hq had come up on his call monitor at home yes i did the voice at the other end was flat bland he didnt make the point that it had been three times or give any hint now as to why it was so urgent as arranged at the outset he was only to be called at home in an emergency and nothing possibly incriminating should ever pass between them over the line you can call me back on this number roman read out the number on the phone yeah fine the line went dead and roman stamped his feet and blew in his hands as he waited on the call back it took a moment more than usual ive started using the booth a block further away from home just in case they might have cottoned on to me using the nearest booth his caller explained okay wheres the fire whats happened romans tone was impatient the wait in the cold and the cloak and dagger routine adding to his edginess its donatiens he was at our hq today being questioned by chenouda roman felt the cold grip him even deeper as the details came out what few he was able to extract with a chain of increasingly staccato questions what time how long for what was said minutes later he was speeding towards their lapdancing club on rue sherbrooke hed kept funicellis car not wanting the hassle of possibly being stopped and quizzed by the rcmp he swung in wildly as he approached screeching to a halt and slamming the car door so far hed taken out his anger and frustration on only inanimate objects slamming his palm against the kiosk glass after hanging up banging one fist repeatedly against the steering wheel as he drove but he swore that if the club doorman or any of the staff said the wrong thing hed lay them flat in one but it was all smiles nods and cordial greetings as he made his way through bonsoir monsieur lacaille ca va azy the head barman fired him a broad caribbean grin as he perched on a bar stool whatll it be bossman to azy everyone was man my man or bossman according to status roman leant both arms heavily on the counter and let out an exaggerated huffed sigh azys smile was hard to resist but all roman could muster was a weak grimace usual fucking poison a triple roman looked around no yves then tonight as a rotating manager between their three clubs and a restaurant yves was there at most two nights a week no he said hed come by about nine tomorrow night azy picked out the bottle without hardly looking and poured a third of a large balloon of hine celebrating something he enquired celebrating roman cocked a quizzical eyebrow he raised the glass took the first slug nah just something to break the ice he smirked to himself at the image of venegas sliding away beneath the ice the only thing to have gone right all day its assfreezing weather out there azy missed any hidden significance and held the same half smile as he put back the bottle the lights and mirrors behind picking out his blue eyes the product of a jamaican father and quebecois mother the joke among the staff was that hed got his mothers eyes and his fathers dick fuelled by dressingroom gossip from when hed dated one of the girls last year but azy had been hired for his good dress and customer sense and his familiarity with practically every known cocktail from maine to shanghai just turned thirty with pineapple dreadlocks dangling around his coffee tone broad cheekboned face like a dead spider his dress was always hip and stylish and he was popular with the girls he was usually their first choice to confide in if there were problems in or outside of the club roman swivelled round and surveyed the room amy chantelle janine lucy then a new girl roman didnt recognize though he was looking mainly for viana finally picking her out from the subdued lighting in the far corner dancing for a customer hed wait until she was finished then call her over just after ninethirty the club was almost half full not bad for a weekday celebration hed thought originally of coming down here for a quick victory drink after venegas the warm glow of a drink in his stomach and some warm pussy in his lap would have reminded him too how good it was to be alive after his own close escape but after the call just past it was just somewhere with loud music and writhing bodies to help drown the madness of the day three hours three fucking hours hed asked the question twice in disbelief when told how long donatiens had spent at rcmp hq his contact tried to placate him that he didnt think much dramatic had been said otherwise hed have probably heard about it by now but hed let him know more tomorrow three hours not much said huh who was he kidding in that time donatiens could have spilled every last detail about the lacaille family including all their shoe sizes and no doubt that night with leduc would have been the first topic in the frame roman eased his collar as he felt a sudden rush of heat to his face and neck they could be on their way for him in a squad car any time now or maybe they were still working on final strategy and backroom legal paperwork but if it involved checking with crown prosecution surely his contact would have heard by now he took a couple of hasty brandy slugs then knocked back the rest in one and ordered another triple the first hint of concern tempered azys smile as he poured realizing that roman was on overdrive normally hed nurse a single brandy for almost an hour roman hit the refill a bit slower he still had a third of it left to swirl around in the bottom after fifteen minutes his jaw working ever tighter as he watched viana continue dancing for the same man one song after the next the guy was hogging her half the night when was he going to get a look in roman raised an acknowledging hand and fired a brief smile at one point when he thought shed looked over but with the darkness of the club it was difficult to tell if shed seen him or not as the next song started princes kiss and she went into another routine of writhes and grinds roman sharply knocked back the last of his drink that was it he was going to tell the guy to move on and try some other pussy but two steps from the bar stool he noticed her wriggling back into her tanga next came her short tight black satin skirt pulled up her thighs excruciatingly slowly it was a reverse strip azys voice came from behind guy comes by twice a week same routine every time eight or nine songs finishing how it started and always with viana yeah whatever does it for you roman perched back on the bar stool hit me with another big one meanwhile and whatever viana wants azy was getting seriously worried now hed never seen roman drink so hard and fast but there was something bubbling beneath romans slightly glazed eyes that warned him not to say anything just pour smile what he was paid to do customers often took him for some sort of social counsellor but as long as he never got the roles confused viana pecked her client on the cheek as she took his money then made her way over firing a broad grin as she got closer sorry romy some of these guys just seem to want to take monopoly yeah yeah whatever roman didnt want to think about sharing her he held a hand to one side ive had one of those days i need some serious attention here they moved about six yards to the side of the bar the first subduedlit area viana took a quick sip of her coke as they sat the rule for the girls was soft drinks only except for the last hour when they could drink either vodka or champagne neither smelt on the breath viana moistened her lips as she set the glass down and spread her legs suggestively showing a yard of tan thigh leading to heaven so romy how you been since since last week dont ask dont fucking ask roman shook his head quickly but he found it hard to rip his eyes from the same spot her tanga barely covered her neatly trimmed vulva and he swore he could see a trace of moisture already there or maybe it was sweat from all the dancing you look tired real tired she stood up started swaying to the beat of constant ariba playing just relax relax roman felt the ice from the lake and the tightness in his chest from this new problem with donatiens start to melt and ease from his body vianas smile the tease on her lips and in her eyes her coffeecream skin glistening with a faint sheen of sweat seemed to radiate a heat from a yard away that seared straight through him and touched every nerve end she was gorgeous an exquisite cocktail of haitian lebanese french quebecois and italian with crinkly dark hair half way down her back and soft brown eyes like a bed of autumn leaves she was by far romans favourite of all the girls her cocaine habit which had helped forge their relationship aside hed have chosen her anyway she was streets ahead of the rest a natural next was the tanga she bent away from him as she slowly eased it down then swivelled around and perched herself back on the stool opposite leaning back she scissored her legs high and wide apart and slowly traced her hands from her ankles down she paused as her hands came within an inch of meeting as if to make sure romans attention was fully on what her hands were framing before slowly pulling her lips apart to give roman a glimpse of her pink moistness tantalisingly she slid a single finger inside roman shuddered and closed his eyes a natural but as he opened them again he noticed vianas previous customer looking over from the bar his steelrimmed glasses glinting with the mirrored lights he seemed vaguely perturbed that viana was giving someone else such a good show as if her nine dances with him somehow gave him proprietary rights he looked like a yuppie banker or accountant and suddenly roman was reminded of donatiens of how hed gained strong favour with jeanpaul so quickly leaving him on the sidelines of the main thrust and flow of business practically out in the cold he glared back at steelrimmed ill show you who is in control the track changed to im every woman and viana turned and leant away from him bending almost double and reaching back to spread her butt cheeks as she wriggled at him yeah thats it doll spread that smile for me but roman was smiling challengingly towards steelrimmed as he reached out and started stroking vianas thighs she didnt protest at first the club rule was no touching only a slight frown crossed her face but as romans stroking became more insistent with one hand raising to lazily trace a finger up the cleft of her butt she flinched and pulled away not here romy not here you got that right at my place you ride my dick like it was going out of style roman said it loud enough to be heard at the bar steelrimmed looked away uncomfortably towards the bottles ahead azy too looked perturbed hed long suspected they had something going on but viana looked distraught at it being broadcast so openly and gauchely though azy knew better than to intervene he kept his head down studiously cleaning and stacking glasses roman reached out and brusquely grabbed her thigh pulling her close come on stop being so prissy she wriggled and tried to break free no roman no not here this time her tone was firmer roman clutched tighter with both hands keeping his grip he shook her hard look i own this fucking club and i own you now just be a good girl and do what youre told bend for me like you did before roman glared icily at her a smile slowly easing as she hesitatingly complied he could feel her shaking in his grip which only added to his excitement the feeling of control vianas writhing was now more stilted staccato as the first clouds of worry crossed her face this was a different roman a fiery dangerously bubbling mood shed seen a couple of times before but never directed at her roman smiled contemptuously at steelrimmed who was looking over again see ill show you who is in control whos boss you donatiens the lot of you ill get back whats rightfully mine he felt the effects of the brandy washing through making his senses float pleasantly come on babe spread again he murmured dreamily wide viana slowly reluctantly moved her legs further apart and he ran one finger lazily along her cleft feeling the warmth and moistness there yeah hed be back where he should be soon with everything at his fingertips the sudden sensation that everything around moved in time to his touch vianas swaying body the room and lights around swirling gently the music pumping almost in rhythm with his own quickening pulse and vianas trembling he slipped one finger slowly inside her heat so feverish it almost burnt please romy please her eyes welled with tears of fear and humiliation but her tensing against his finger increasing the constriction only heightened his excitement he pushed more forcefully working the finger around roman glanced over at his audience steelrimmed had already looked away in disgust but azy was looking over more keenly and agitatedly though quickly averted his gaze come on doll you know you like it you the thought hit him suddenly caught him midbreath donatiens being taken into custody could be just what he was looking for to break golden boys favour with jeanpaul particularly if donatiens chose not to tell jeanpaul all trust would immediately go to the wind roman continued working the finger distractedly as his thoughts gelled please romy vianas body shuddered and quaked as her tears flowed freely azy threw down his bar towel and came over he shrugged and proffered one palm out towards viana a plea for reason come on bossman not like this the ladys getting upset what roman tried to rip his thoughts back if donatiens intended to tell jeanpaul the first sign would be with simone if he told her hed likely tell jeanpaul if not in private its okay azy held both hands out but if you do it here then the customers start to get ideas they think they can get away with that sort o thing with all the girls azy injected heavy reason into his voice but nerves and tension sweated from every pore his jaw jutting tight as he waited for romans fireball temper to spit back at him romans eyes jumped agitatedly between azy viana and the club around but then he merely nodded and pulled his hands away raising them in apology youre right youre absolutely right sorry he glanced hastily at his watch pm funicelli would have had the tape running for over two hours now there could be something on it already perhaps even some indication of what donatiens had spilled to chenouda gotta go now see a friend he stood up and slapped a fifty dollar note on the table for viana keep that pussy warm for me babe ill catch you later and left a bemused azy and viana staring at his back as he scurried out of the club viana dabbed at her tearstained makeup and thanked azy for stepping in and while she sat out the next few songs at the bar azy seized the opportunity with a doubleshot of vodka put in her coke to soothe her nerves and ease her tongue of finding out more about her relationship with roman azy couldnt make the call until he left the club at almost am from a phone booth halfway home im sorry to call so late but you said you wanted to know if i saw roman yeah sure quick throat clearing from the other end as michel chenouda sat up in bed suddenly more alert go ahead well he came by the club first of all just past ninethirty azy related romans disturbed mood the heavy drinking his roughhandling one of the girls in the end i had to intervene with the mood he was in i was expecting trouble i can tell you but then he suddenly does a turnturtle and rushes off saying he had to see a friend and would be back later a part of michel relaxed if roman was edgy and troubled when he walked in the club then very likely venegas still presented a problem if hed hid venegas away somewhere he wouldnt have been so troubled we know roman showed later because thats the one and only sighting we got of him thats right about an hour and a half ago and what was he like then all smiles relaxed happy completely different mood and drinking moderately this time he made up with the girl he gave a hard time to earlier and stayed on to do the take michel amended his thoughts perhaps romans earlier edginess was because he was waiting on news on venegas which only came in later into the night but it was all purely supposition the first sighting of roman had been just after twelvethirty when he arrived by cab to collect his car from frank massenats who had picked it up earlier from the garage then hed headed back to the club but for the rest of the day except for azy seeing him at the club hed been invisible which was obviously what he had intended he could have had venegas holed away practically anywhere by now theyd had a car constantly parked down the road from venegass apartment building but nothing all they could do was watch roman closely the next few days and keep an allpoints alert out for venegas and hope something broke and was roman alone each time or did he meet or talk to anyone else inside no he was alone both times and the only person he spoke to apart from me was the girl michel ran a hand through his hair and eased a shallow deflated sigh nothing of any real value except maybe the mood swing he thanked azy for the call anything new comes up let me know he felt tired and ragged from the days events after the news of romans sighting hed been slow getting to sleep and had grabbed barely forty minutes before azys call he hoped to fall back asleep quickly but with his mind now active it was almost another two hours rapid changing thoughts and images merging with the gentle thrum and hiss of the first streetsweeping trucks before he was finally able to get to sleep ten two days into her quest and finally elena felt she was getting somewhere i think we could get to the stage of seeing if theres a match on the name youre searching on the adoption contact register within three or four days a hoarse nasal female voice from the other end of the phone obviously a heavy smoker or suffering from laryngitis from spending her day talking she sounded like a croaky southern blues singer except that she was welsh megan ellis but the first stage will still be tracking down the birth registration well thats a lot better than the four to six weeks i was quoted by the acr themselves a faint sigh of relief muffled by a hasty sip of gin and tonic shed hit the bottle heavy through the first frustrating day of searching but she was doing better today pm and only her first shot of the day and this time more because of a possible breakthrough than to drown out the mounting sense of hopelessness of her quest shed been told about a small agency in wales who boasted tracing adoptionseperated parties in days rather than the normal weeks it warranted a minor celebration or was it just dutch courage in case it turned out to be another letdown im glad im ecstatic but why the big time difference first of all pure workload at the acr they probably wouldnt even get to your application for four or five weeks the match itself if there is one would only take days then they write to the child and simply make it known that contact has been made its up to the adopted child to say yes id like to make personal contact with my natural parents if the child says no or simply doesnt reply the doors pretty well closed im afraid the laws very strict on protecting the rights of children given up for adoption i know pretty much what she knew from her own work and heard the day before from the adoption contact register acr and norcap a hard bitter pill if he said at the end that he didnt want to see her that shed just have to swallow at least the first daunting obstacle of the long wait was now out of the way but if a child has listed with the register surely theres a high chance they would want contact true heavy nasal sigh from megan but dont hold your breath because that also limits the number of successful matches made the hit rate is no more than three or four percent it relies on both parties registering you see elenas stomach sank one thing nobody else so far had mentioned perhaps with her vented exasperation at a seven week wait theyd thought that telling her the dismal success rate would pile on the disappointment too much any chance of increasing those odds not with the acr its a fixed register and we go through exactly the same process as them what you save is the four or five week wait at the front end and we tell you within days if theres a match but its still left to them to notify the child we never get the actual name thats the straightforward official way megan took a quick pull of the cigarette shed left half forgotten in the ashtray the other ways not so straightforward itll take anything from two days to two weeks depending how lucky we are and it costs a bit of money but the odds are a lot higher fiftysix percent is our strike rate so far how much would it cost the money wasnt the concern just the worry of how to pay anything significant without gordon finding out hundred and sixty pounds a day but hes good one of the best searchers in the business i see her income from the aid agency was small and nearly all their main expenses ran through gordons account she could spare six or seven hundred without running short after that shed have to think of a crafty way of getting it from gordon what would he do for that first of all hed sit himself in the family records centre trawling birth certificates and then adoption records if were lucky hell find something in only a few days if not for instance if he finds the placement agency but theyve no longer got records or the final adopted family he traces have since moved from the address on record which is often the case his trawling starts to get more involved and time consuming electoral rolls and telephone directories deedpole registrations and death certificates the time can add up and the money but the compensation with this method is that if he finds a name and contact address we put it straight in your hand you dont have to wait on the child approving contact you can phone straightaway and say hello a chill ran through elena at the thought of a voice at the other end of the phone suddenly saying hello after twentynine years but in her minds eye it wasnt the adult voice that she knew it must now be it was that of a small child and tears welled with the sharp pang of all those lost years well i suppose itll have to be your search man her voice was tremulous and close to breaking and she cleared her throat forcing a nervous chuckle until i run out of money the other thing you should be aware of is that the large time gap tracing back to the late sixties will make things more difficult the law changed dramatically in until then all records relating to a childs placement for adoption were closed by the courts once the adoption order was made then too weve got the problem that pre a placement agency wasnt necessarily required and adoption could have been arranged by third parties such as doctors clergymen or even family members i understand her stomach sank a bit something else to worry about her father could easily have arranged everything without a placement agency or anywhere she might now find a record so the first stage would be tracking down the birth registration faint rustle of papers from the other end now you say that you dont know the actual registration place you only have the surname and likely christian name and of course the date of birth so if you can give those to me yes of course the elena was distracted faint sound of footsteps straining through the door of her studio when shed last checked on gordon hed been deep into a chain of business calls now it sounded like he was starting up the stairs towards her shed felt uneasy from the outset doing all this from home but where else could she have gone she couldnt realistically have done it either from the london agency office shelley too knew nothing nobody knew anything except her mother and uncle christos and someone whod given up their own child wasnt exactly the best qualified to deal with orphaned children the footsteps receded gordon was heading across the downstairs hallway towards the kitchen rather than up the stairs and her breathing relaxed sorry just someone i thought wanted me the surnames georgallis or possibly the anglicised version of our family name george and the original christian name chosen was christos though as i say i dont know if thats what was finally put on the birth certificate and he was born april fifteenth nineteensixtynine in which area the actual birthplace was kilburn north london though the family was living at the time in hampstead and do you know if it was a hospital or midwife birth no neither of those im afraid it was a backstreet clinic elena started trembling as she remembered the pale grey walls the stark implements and enamel kidney dishes a frightened schoolgirl being led in by the hand by her father birth registration wouldnt have been made there or possibly anywhere in the area and maybe not until some time later i see brief pause and then the sound of pen on paper continued now you said at the start that the childs mother was a close relative who exactly is that and what would this child be to you if its a sister for instance we would still need her approval to search unless shes since died elena had kept it at arms length with every call so far having to say it straight out repeatedly would have been too painful now crossing that final barrier of admittance a barrier shed avoided coming even close to the past almost thirty years made her trembling run deeper and seem to drain every ounce of spirit and energy she closed her eyes her voice barely a whisper its my son im looking for the son that i gave up twentynine years ago over the next few days elenas emotions seesawed wildly she cooked for the family that night after instructing megan a simple beef bourgignon but with katines seperated before she put in the red wine for the rest of them the taste was too rich for katine maybe in a few years but elena found herself uncoordinated throughout she let the meat boil down and catch at one point then she added too much red wine and overcooked the rice it wasnt her normal effort shed opened the red wine at the start of cooking and poured glasses for herself liberally too liberally by the look of silent reproach fired her by gordon as she shrieked and turned down the overboiling rice pot a bit of wine slopping out of her glass as she lunged she almost collided with christos while he was getting a drink from the fridge when she swivelled sharply to drain the pot then seconds later she was at screaming pitch when katine walked in with the latest mopatop doll to show her then it was a complete about turn hugging them both christos katine sorry so sorry her eyes welled as she straightened ruffling christoss hair new christos old christos replacements that had filled the void in her life but so quickly had become much more than that talk was light over dinner christos mentioned his school trying to arrange exchange trips to france for the coming easter and that hed like to go and gordon talked about a local client bitterly upset at the drop in his fareastern linked pep though gordon had recommended more of a spread at the outset elena said little and gordon could tell that she was caught up with her own thoughts at one point missing what christos had said and having to get him to repeat it though gordon waited until theyd finished dinner before he asked whats wrong oh i dont know i think this whole thing with lorena has hit me harder than i realized only a half lie since that had been the main catalyst they were in the kitchen and with the light hum of the dishwasher and the tv on for the kids in the lounge beyond they couldnt be overheard gordon shook his head and looked down bad business i know how you must feel but you did everything you could did i she wiped a countertop brusquely with a cloth looks to me like thanks to my overeagerness lorena is now trapped there without us ever being able to help her again fine help you tried thats the important thing gordon came up and hugged her from behind kissing her cheek you werent to know he was so machiavellian that hed go to the lengths of taping your conversation i know perhaps youre right she shivered and shrank under his touch with the duplicitous game she was playing the secret shed harboured all these years she could hardly bear him to touch her it brought it all too close gordon pulled away with a halfpained expression half smile and leant over to peck her cheek again she could tell that hed picked up on her discomfort but perhaps he put it down to her abhorrence with ryall out of all the children youve seen successfully placed what fifty or more you cant punish yourself so because just one gets lost on the way it doesnt make it any easier i know but youd almost expect those sort of odds her shivering ran through more intensely she closed her eyes just one lost youre right youre right she bit at her lip fighting back the tears for gods sake just go before i break down completely the next day was even harder with her starting to become expectant of a call back and she quickly became restless she tried to do some painting to occupy her mind but it was useless she found she couldnt focus on anything else for any length of time back once more to agitated pacing wondering whether megans search man would find anything or not god even if he did she could wait days or even weeks and the way she felt now was that she could hardly bare to wait minutes more another coffee her fifth of the morning and finally the build up of restfulness staring intermittently at the dormant phone made her feel trapped claustrophobic she put on her coat and headed out the house towards the chine the air was crisp heavy clouds moving rapidly on a stiff breeze with only brief breaks of sunshine bursting through their garden stretched for almost a hundred yards from the back of the house mostly gently sloping lawn with a steeper slope for the last ten yards as the descent towards the chine started the slope angled progressively sharper but foliage and trees also became denser there were regular handholds as elena wended her way down the worn path she knew so well the coordination of her steps and handgrips were automatic could have been done blindfold the trees became thicker taller spires reaching hungrily up towards the light at the top of the ridge that hit her in intermittent weak dapples through gaps in the foliage becoming less frequent as she went deeper and suddenly she was there her own private place her cocoon from the world outside as the path flattened out the darkness was almost total and she could hear the babble of the stream running through she closed her eyes and inhaled deeply enjoying the richly laden smell of damp moss and tree bark mingled with the salt breeze drifting from the sea beyond here everything remained timeless unchanged it was exactly as she remembered it when shed first ventured in at the age of eight eight fourteen now in his late twenties all those lost years she tried to picture what hed look like now but again it was the image of small boy in her mind running along the beach at the end of the chine the wind lightly ruffling his hair then as she focused tried to see him clearer she realized it was the christos she had now a chink of recall from a cyprus beach holiday when he was five she opened her eyes again her breath showing on the cool air with her heavy exhalation there was nothing there no image she could cling to hed been christened blown out his first birthday candle grazed his knee had his first day at school college had girlfriends maybe now was even married and had a family of his own and she hadnt been there for any of it even if the call came through with something and she could find him all of that would still be lost to her all she could do was try and fill in the gaps in her mind but even that small consolation seemed desperately out of reach there was nothing there nothing just an empty aching void her eyes filled and the tears flooded rapidly over she dabbed at them thinking she had it under control but suddenly her body was convulsed with racking sobs competing with the trickling of the nearby stream the tears felt cool against her skin with the breeze and she rocked gently muttering christos christos im sorry so sorry the wind in the treetops drowned out her voice which made her plea seem all the more lost insignificant she was alone alone with her secret in the one place that since childhood she felt she could be alone and secretive but for one of the first times she no longer felt cocooned and protected but adrift vulnerable the magic was fading shed kidded herself all along that shed chosen it as a sanctuary from the craziness of the world outside when in reality shed merely used it to bury the memories of what shed done and now she could almost feel them seeping back out of the trees and damp earth to haunt her your only son and you let him go how could you she shook her head bit hard at her lip trying to shake away the silent whispers of recrimination maybe as she searched she might get a clearer image of christos in her mind something to cling to that would help fill the crushing void inside and the magic would start to return she wiped at her tears and started her way slowly back up the steep slope of the chine her step was heavy her legs starting to ache only halfway up and she couldnt help dwelling on the task ahead making her way from a place of such longburied secrets into the open it wouldnt be easy eleven look jeanpaul ive got to speak with you i know you mentioned but cant it wait till later you can see how crazy everything is now jeanpaul turned away pointing over to the far side of the conference room nono the main flower arrangement should go in that corner then he addressed two men laying white cloths on long trestle tables to the side the gravlax should go in the centre with the canapes around then on the next table the side of lamb and the suckling pig i can see i can see roman felt awkward enough with the subject he had to broach but this army of flowerarrangers and caterers hovering around made it all the worse so many men in one room with female mannerisms and affectations it wasnt natural it made him feel uncomfortable out of place like a gorilla surrounded by a flock of dancing flamingos hed hoped to speak to jeanpaul directly upon his return from seeing art giacomelli in chicago there was a full day spare before preparations started for their mothers birthday party that evening but jeanpaul had at the last minute delayed a day so in the end the only opportunity was now in the midst of preparations once the party started there wouldnt be an opportunity and even if there was jeanpaul wouldnt thank him for taking the edge off the celebrations roman touched jeanpauls arm its urgent jeanpaul i dont think this can wait right i see jeanpauls eyes clouded as he registered for the first time the gravity of romans concern he held one arm out towards the adjoining office lets go in here then to the caterers ill be back with you shortly the atmosphere in the fifteenfoot square room was stuffy austere part powerbroker part intellectual directly behind jeanpauls desk was his diploma in maths and art from university of montreal and a framed thankyou letter from one of canadas most notable past prime ministers still a montreal resident for jeanpauls heavy campaign funds in the late s the far wall was lined with books flaubert dostoyevsky voltaire joyce orwell zola rand proust proulx jeanpaul the avid reader whereas roman had hardly got past the three musketeers roman had always felt uncomfortable in this room probably not intentional but everything seemed to shout down at him that he was the lightweight intellectual of the family jeanpaul pressed his fingertips together in a pyramid so tell me he opened them out for a second whats the problem as roman explained about donatiens being taken in for questioning jeanpauls expression darkened his eyes shifted uncomfortably to some papers at the side before coming back to roman are you sure your contacts reliable that he hasnt made a mistake no im sure hes been spoton every time before and he works in the same building at dorchester boulevard so its not the sort of thing he could make a mistake about roman let the information settle a little deeper enjoying watching jeanpaul squirm at the thought of golden boy possibly being tainted before he asked so he hasnt mentioned anything about it to you no no he hasnt jeanpaul was still distracted turning possibilities around in his mind but then ive only just got back and as you can see things have been more than a little hectic he gestured towards the adjoining room maybe its something hes planning to tell me about later maybe too nothing much happened so it wasnt worth raising the alarm straightaway and maybe the popes dating sharon stone roman leant forward raising a sharp eyebrow he was in there three hours jeanpaul three fucking hours the rcs could know every single financial transaction worth shit and what every one of us has for breakfast jeanpaul sighed heavily maybe roman was right but jeanpaul was also keenly aware of the growing animosity between roman and georges he needed to be sure this wasnt just roman axegrinding for the hell of it were not involved in crime anymore and georges wasnt involved either in any of the moneylaundering so whats to tell he waved a hand towards roman this is probably all about that night with leduc again roman flinched and sat back always the same these days when it came to the crunch jeanpaul invariably sided with goldenboy and threw it all back in his lap three hours jeanpaul what did he do show them his family snaps he shrugged helplessly even if it was all innocent youve got to admit he should have told you i know i know jeanpaul nodded solemnly roman could tell that he was starting to teeter and that leduc incident could easily unravel the wrong way if theyre not convinced it was selfdefence i could go down for twenty for ordering it youd get the same theyve probably been pressing donatiens that they know he was there but if he turns crown evidence theyll give him immunity against prosecution as an accomplice and then with the finances once theyve got the full picture of all the legitimate stuff how long do you think its going to take them to trace back to the jeanpaul held a hand up a priest dispensing blessing okay roman okay youve made your point his tone was worn tired all he could do was defer judgement there were just too many open interpretations to get out the way first before hed be convinced that he should mistrust georges ive pencilled in that id phone him about four oclock before he heads off to get ready for the party to catch up on business while i was away ill leave a few long gaps and pauses and lets see if he fills them if not then we can start worrying elena grabbed the phone at the start of the second ring he thinks hes found something at last megans voice at the other end excited slightly breathless where did he find it in the end westminster registry right thats great elena too found her breath caught slightly the first call two days ago only thirty hours after shed given megan the go ahead had been to say that terry her search man had found nothing in either the kilburn or hampstead registries theyd trawl through the other north london registries before spreading the net wider but before we get too carried away megan continued its not an exact match the name hes found is george georgallis and the birth date entered is not exactly the same either its four days later april with the registration itself entered on the april but the certificate is marked adopted which is what first made it leap out for terry elena was uncertain georgallis was a common name among the cypriot community and with the few days difference it could easily be someone else then the thought suddenly hit her choosing the name george would mean that the family name would continue on regardless of the final adopted family name and she seemed to remember her father having a greek doctor friend in pimlico which would come under westminster is it a doctor who made the registration is there a name and address given there yes uh megan struggled to decipher the scrawled writing looks like a doctor manatis or maniatis tatchbrooke place london sw yeah thats it im sure im sure tatchbrooke place was pimlico if she remembered her london geography the coincidences were too many where do we go from here well underneath adopted theres a note of a temporary care order made in the name of anthony georgallis yes thats my father he thrust a load of papers in front of me only a week after the birth i hardly even knew what i was signing i was still so distraught thats okay you dont need to appease yourself to us or explain its just the more we know the easier it is when it comes to tracing megans voice was cool soothing as if shed dealt a thousand times before with mothers who held back the harsher more painful details then weve got a note of a court order made some five months later at highgate court that would probably be the next most logical search point elena felt her trembling start to return i think i know what it says already she gripped hard at the edge of the telephone table trying to brace her shaking i suffered severe depression soon after signing my baby away and made an attempt to take my own life the images were still vivid the bathroom sliding sideways after shed taken the pills her face being slapped hard but as she tried to focus on her mother above the bright fluorescent light behind washed away any definition searing through her eyes like a hot lance when i recovered i decided that i just couldnt live with the same sense of loss and guilt for the rest of my life i wanted my baby back but my father said that hed fight me all the way and he used the attempted suicide to argue that i was unstable and unfit i didnt even bother to show up at court for the final ruling it was already a foregone conclusion i see despite megan being battlehardened and probably having heard every possible story elena could swear she heard a faint swallow from the other end from downstairs came the muffled tones of gordons voice speaking to another business client while on the other line she unravelled the secrets of the past shed long held from him at the local shops the day before shed suddenly panicked that megan might phone while she was out gordon would pick it up and if the wrong thing was said the secret would be out straightaway but if the trace was successful shed have to tell him anyway and the mounting dread of finally having to spill all to gordon hit her in full force when no call had come through the rest of that day she began almost to wish that there would be no trace found then at least she would never have to tell gordon their lives would continue as before happy albeit for her incomplete but thats not the only thing those court papers might show megans words were suddenly measured purposeful they might show the family who adopted your son elena felt a sudden tight constriction in her chest she swallowed hard as if she hadnt heard right and that might clear it shed been prepared for weeks or even months of searching and likely even then nothing at the end of it it was as if someone had casually told her she had a winning lottery ticket in her coat pocket it just seemed too easy to trust are you sure not a hundred percent but there are strong chances its registered there particularly if the adoption was arranged at the same time well know soon enough how long well normally it can take anything from a few weeks to a few months but terry has his way of speeding things urgent contact needed because of a serious congenital disorder rare blood group sharing things like that quite honestly its best not to ask i just leave it to him as to the best and quickest method to get what he wants any luck he should have something within five or six days certainly within a week in the end it was only four days before megan called back with some names nicholas and maria stephanou and an address in canterbury kent terry was checking it out as they spoke twentynine years so probably theyve moved but at least its a name and a start point for him to track from suddenly elena had a new name to mutter under her breath george stephanou still it didnt help no image came to mind for her to cling to but at least now she felt more alive full of hope marked contrast to the doldrums of the past week though later that afternoon she was back again in the doldrums shed just left her local corner store after being brought up to date on village goingson by mrs wickens its shopkeeper of twentyfive years in her normal shrugging and winking yar know what im saying style elenas step was lively brisk the air was fresh the sky bright she was still smiling from mrs wickens stories everything seemed to be going right at last then nicola ryalls dark blue range rover drifted by lorena was in the back and she saw elena straightaway their eyes locked and lorena swivelled quickly around so that she could continue staring back her small hand slowly reached out and touched the inside of the back glass as if she was trying to make invisible contact and elena felt a sharp stab of guilt this past week shed consumed herself with nothing but her own problems leaving lorena all but forgotten the girls last hope probably now gone of ever getting free from ryall and elena hadnt given her a second thought just before fading from view elena thought she saw lorena silently mouth something it looked like help me georges went back across with simones drink a campari and lemon as the man in the light grey suit with bright floral tied moved away whos he georges asked simone jaques delamarle local politician something to do with cultural affairs if i remember right my father deals with him now and then because of his heavy jazz festival contributions but hes known him for years hes an old family friend and also knows lillian thats why hes here no political advantage being sought then georges raised an eyebrow no i dont think my father would dare try it here simone smiled and took a sip of her drink theyd both noticed how over the past year jeanpaul had increasingly courted political favour if lillian got even a whiff that he was turning her birthday party into part of his image bolstering campaign shed have his head on a plate next to the suckling pig the threeman combo at the end of the room started up again launching into an upbeat latin version of besame mucho and simone had to raise her voice slightly he saves all of that for open house days or business and charity functions there were only about ten people dancing most people seemed keener on eating drinking and talking for the past hour or so though invariably lillian and her new friend max were among the first on the floor max was a retired grocer whose expansion plans had peaked at two small outremont stores and a downtown depanneur before he sold out jeanpaul looked on and smiled graciously but both simone and georges could still read the silent disapproval carefully shielded beneath one of jeanpauls few character flaws normally extremely broadminded with little regard for social or class divides when it came to his mother his classconsciousness was suddenly extreme nobody was good enough for her but georges was more concerned about reading something else beneath jeanpauls smile after their earlier conversation it had started out as a standard business update but then thered been a couple of questions as to whether everything was okay and did anything else happen while i was away that in retrospect struck him as odd not the questions themselves but the awkward moments silence straight after georges had assured that everything was fine probably he was just getting paranoid he was still rattled after the session with chenouda and perhaps it had come through in his voice hed sounded strained concerned if jeanpaul had an inside track with the rcmp then hed also know the theory chenouda was pushing about leduc and now savard hed have been grilling roman nonstop since he got back but things between them seemed to be fine the smiles and body language were easy and relaxed from the couple of times hed seen them talk so far the only thing he was still unsure of was whether the smiles were easy from jeanpaul to him whether what i said so here we are stuck in the middle simone repeated she looked back towards jaques delamarle then towards roman and frank massenat propped up against the back wall diving into refilled platefuls of canapes clowns to the left of us jokers to the right then her eyebrows knitted slightly are you okay yes fine fine georges smiled wanly jeanpauls oddly comical mix at functions the transition from crime boss to respectable businessman wasnt fully there yet the past was still mingling with what jeanpaul hoped was his future romans marie was halfway across the room from him talking to two other women while jeanpauls date of choice for the evening catherine was by his side hed met her just before christmas at the bays perfume counter while choosing a present for his then girlfriend in the three years since burying stephanie his second wife he hadnt settled emotionally hardly anyone was good enough to match up to her either though with each one jeanpaul initially had high hopes he was keen to enlighten that catherine was not just a platinum blonde perfumeselling wallflower she was also doing an evening course in sociology at mcgill as the song finished lillian and max came over big day for these two soon lillian said have you met max before lillian asked georges georges held a hand up in greeting at max and smiled yes but only once jeanpauls last boxing day open house obviously lillian had forgotten maybe we wont be too far behind on the church steps lillian nudged max anywhere planned for the honeymoon yet martinique was too hot and humid in july she informed them without hardly waiting for an answer so was mexico maybe you should head to europe cote dazurs nice then or maybe italy simone said that theyd talked about france but one of those loire valley picturepostcard chateaux for the first ten days then the med coast with maybe a quick look at tuscany for the rest of the time shed barely finished before lillian with a quick excuse us whisked max back to dance jon and cynthia larsen moved in from a few yards away picking up on the tail end with cynthia asking if they knew where theyd have the reception yet and would they use the same caterers as today impressive spread but for cynthias money no doubt gained from her current haute cuisine courses to raise the level of her already renowned dinner parties the rack of lamb was a bit dry and some of the canape pastry a touch overbaked jon quickly became disinterested and led georges a yard to one side by the arm what do you reckon on this cuban thing then well jeanpaul mentioned something but we never really got into it georges gestured towards the end table spreads preparations for this i think took over jeanpaul had mentioned at the start of their earlier call that he wanted to talk about increased cuban investments but then after them catching up on events and jeanpaul asking if everything was okay theyd never got around to it jeanpaul had abruptly signed off saying that he had two caterers and a party decorator hovering anxiously at his office door he had to go right jon looked fazed for only a second then explained arturo giacomelli was interested in funnelling funds into cuba he couldnt do it through the usa because of the trade embargo but he could do it through jeanpaul and canada georges sucked in his breath we cant handle money for giacomelli it would be back to what jeanpauls been fighting so hard to move away from laundering and trying to play clean with dirty money jon larsen held up his free hand we went through all that this would be totally clean money straight from the two vegas casinos right georges looked down pondering it quickly as he took a slug of his beer wed still have to be careful of not breaching the us embargo but that wouldnt be a problem if the money was channelled first through canada and jeanpauls side of the vegas partnerships jon nodded i think thats one of the options that came up when they discussed it but i still think it would be safer to run it all through say jeanpauls mexico companies first then on through cuba georges thoughts were running double time as he watched jon larsen consider the suggestion despite the frantic preparations obviously jeanpaul had found time to discuss this with jon in some depth georges began to wonder about jeanpauls abrupt signing off maybe he had heard something and was troubled larsen took a sip of his martini i suppose thats got merit but wed have to make sure it was in and out under three months to avoid any tax implications then too we should think about enough shop talk i think cynthia cut in simone smiled tightly alongside her jon nodded hastily yeah yeah youre right and they stood as an awkward circle for a second before cynthia commented no ice storms this year at least then launched into how theyd all coped and survived respectively through them last winter as simone explained that it hadnt been too bad when the power lines started going down theyd all simply headed here to her fathers house because he had a generator georges was hardly listening he was looking across and trying to catch jeanpauls eye and in return hopefully get that confident reassuring smile that he knew so well more vital to him now than ever because it would tell him that everything was okay it wasnt until some time later that he finally managed to elicit that return smile but by then georges had run through so many conflicting emotions he was almost past caring hed started to drink quicker slugging back two beers and two double southern comforts in an effort to lose his worries on the mood and flow of the party hed danced with simone a few times and in the middle of the bands passable rendition of the beatles and i love her whispered in simones ear how much he loved her hed thought a couple of times of going over and talking directly to jeanpaul maybe he could better discern eye to eye if something was wrong but jeanpaul seemed to be endlessly wrapped up talking to other people hed just finished a long session with delamarle when one of lillians bridge circle an elderly surgeon moved in then jeanpauls neighbours a leading realtor and his twenty years younger aerobics instructor wife at one point georges caught romans eye and could almost swear that roman had read his consternation a direct challenging look with a faint smile at the corner of romans mouth all georges could think of was savards screams on tape and he was first to look away the room felt suddenly as if it was closing in the beat of the music jeanpauls coldshoulder roman staring at him the rising cacophony of voices all around a woman just behind breaking into laughter all of it seemed to spin in his head make him dizzy sorry he excused himself to simone and headed to the bathroom splashing some water on his face as he stared hard in the mirror strange how quickly he could become an outcast to the extended lacaille family a stranger at this gathering marked contrast to the camaraderie when theyd all grouped together under this same roof during the ice storms playing cards and charades the lacaille family and their favoured inner circle against a hostile world outside now he too was practically out in the cold along with the ice sheets and it was in that moment with his frantic haunted eyes still fixed in the mirror as he dabbed dry with a towel that he finally decided he couldnt take the burden of this secret any longer hed have to tell the truth about that night with roman and leduc he didnt want to tell jeanpaul directly that was what hed been avoiding all along ratting one brother against the other but perhaps he could confide in someone in the middle simone or jon larsen which would be best the decision made he felt as if a sack had been lifted from his shoulders as he emerged and it was then too that jeanpauls smile finally came in return just after georges whispered in simones ear as frank massenat trod on lillians foot for the second time during his disastrous attempt at the bossanova he doesnt need to strongarm people he just needs to threaten to dance with them simone smiled broadly and as georges pecked her on the cheek and straightened up jeanpaul was smiling over at them but georges couldnt tell whether it was directed just at his daughter or whether it embraced both of them i know that you already had social services on to you asking about lorena dr tinsley but this was something entirely separate more to do with her condition when she first arrived in this country elena elaborated as one of the agency workers involved in her placing here that was more my neck of the woods i see well what sort of thing specifically elena could still sense tinsleys caution over the line she decided to backtrack a bit filling in some background about lorenas sewer days and the severe depravation of the orphanages she suffered bouts of disturbing dreams in the last orphanage in bucharest as a result and i just wondered what signs there might have been of them continuing in england surely this is more psychiatric or counselling territory than a physicians i know but they were never severe enough that she was recommended for treatment so this would really be just a general observation on your part well i uh she never actually complained directly about any dreams that i recall but she did at times seem a bit detached preoccupied elena could hear the flicking of some papers in the background she wasnt sure whether the hesitation was tinsley showing due caution or just that his attention was only half with her i mean did she seem troubled would you say that she might have been suffering from depression depression a bit of an extreme term for a nineyear old lightly humouring tone almost condescending but she was shall we say sometimes distant lost in her own world i often had to repeat questions though i must say i put this largely down to her getting to grips with the language and also getting used to her new environment right she sensed shed gone as far as she could about lorena but from nadines earlier paperwork shed noted tinsleys age and the other adopted girl mikaya were you her gp as well yes i was but i thought and was there any history of depression or upsets there elena barrelled in quickly with the question hoping to catch tinsley off guard but tinsley merely continued with his started objection i thought you were only concerned with lorena so i dont really see what that has to do with anything defensively questioning yes i know but were trying to isolate if this is just a problem with lorena because if theres been a similar problem with another child of mental detachment and depression it could be that unconsciously the ryalls are somehow alienating these children from abroad not fully embracing and accepting them as family elena listened to the shallow fall of tinsleys breath at the other end wondering if hed fall for it she felt as if she were treading on eggshells it was the only plausible story she could think of to get what she wanted as i say i dont think this is something the ryalls would knowingly have done its just that children can often be very sensitive particularly displaced children like this look there was something but it was absolutely nothing to do with the ryalls more to do with a boyfriend a brisk blustery tone as if tinsley thought elena might have heard something and he wanted to ensure she didnt fill in the gaps the wrong way what i can vouch for is that mr and mrs ryall supported mikaya wholeheartedly and unequivocally throughout the whole matter beyond that i think you should speak to the ryalls directly or the social services yes yes certainly i understand my my she had touched a nerve boyfriend youve been very helpful thank you she bowed out swiftly getting the distinct impression that if shed pushed an inch more tinsley would have hung up on her elena dialled nadine moores number straightaway she was out so elena left her number for a call back she tapped her fingers impatiently for a second by the phone then went downstairs to pour a fresh coffee the first few sips and the aroma made her feel a bit more alert she hadnt slept well the night before after seeing lorena pass by no call back had come by midmorning with more news from megan so after half an hour of thinking through tactics shed decided to start on trying to help lorena not sure how far shed get and feeling a bit like a frantic juggler given her own dilemma selfexamining for a moment if it was just because of the lull killing time so as not to dwell on her own uncertainty no shed have made time regardless she couldnt have lived with herself knowing shed simply deserted lorena at the first obstacle she had to at least give it one last try gordon was out for a few hours seeing some local clients so at least the pressure was gone of him lurking around megan and terrys bill was already up to beyond what she could manage from her own account shed made an excuse to gordon about problems with her car new disk brakes needed according to the garage but what about the next and the one after that shed either have to become inventive or bare all to gordon she shook her head such a momentous secret kept for so long how could their relationship survive it two hours later she was sat at the back of chelborne sands in nadine moores car the two of them like drug dealers or lovers on a clandestine meet more secrets its all there everything regarding mikaya ryall nadine passed the file across i can only let you read the file not take it anywhere or copy it make notes if you like but if anyone asks you where you got the information it wasnt me right yes of course elena was only half listening as she rifled hungrily through the file nadine had protested strongly about digging out and sharing the file and elena had to push hard if youre happy with what ryall did taping our conversation and if despite that youre satisfied he has nothing at all to hide and everythings alright with lorena then fine dont help me nadine had against her better judgement finally relented though was still muttering and complaining now that she shouldnt be doing this i must be crazy i could lose my job if this got out elenas eyes scanned frantically leapfrogging for relevant paragraphs after a moments strained silence as she read she slowly looked up staring blankly ahead the beach was deep and winter winds had blown the sand in banks and ridged eddies on the stronger wind flurries buffeting the car from the open bay loose sand was lifted and strewn across the windscreen nadine put on her wipers to clear it as elena exhaled slowly a note of winding down finality pregnant at fourteen signs of being sexually active for some months previous possibly longer mystery boyfriend it was almost a mirror image of her own background too close for comfort a faint involuntary shudder quickly shook away the awkwardness and the similarity in her own case there had been a boyfriend but with mikaya shed bet anything that he was invented a ruse to cover up for ryall she noted from the file that the boyfriend had never been named how convenient she felt suddenly burning with conviction and angry with herself that but for a chance sighting of lorena she might have left her forgotten at ryalls mercy she thanked nadine and headed off with the intention of going straight back home her fury making her drive faster than normal but as she was passing mrs wickens store she decided on impulse to stop if anyone could fill in the gaps mrs wickens could mrs wickens nodded sagely yes of course she remembered the whole affair no the boyfriend was never named a few boys were suggested that young mikaya was known to be friendly with but she swore it wasnt them she says first of all she couldnt say who it was then she says she just couldnt remember rarl mystery what does she look like elena asked on an afterthought about to turn and head off beautiful girl stunning one of the most beautiful oriental girls ive ever seen cameron ryall got the first call from dr tinsley late that afternoon the following two calls notifying him that mrs waldren had been asking questions around town came the next day the last prompting you know the aid worker who lives with her husband up above the chine as if for a moment he might not be able to place her hed thought of little else over the weeks spanning the two interviews with lorena and now it was all possibly springing back again just when over this past week after the tape and the intervention of edelston hed started finally to relax thinking it was all over his first thought was to contact edelston to warn her off but then waldren was a free agent out of their control and waldrens aid agency would likely take no notice he seethed and simmered for hours pondering what to do his attention to the pressing business matters of the day was sparse and often drifted before finally deciding that he just didnt know enough about waldren to be able to plan the best way to stop her in the same way that she was digging about his background he needed to dig about hers he contacted a chelmsford based private investigator he knew from his old barrister days des kershaw who hed used just a few years ago to dig into the private life of a plant manager he suspected of embezzlement kershaw was tenacious and thorough he wouldnt rest until hed stripped bare every facet of elena waldrens background the first couple of days kershaw uncovered nothing groundbreaking mostly filling in the shades of the last twelve years of her married life with gordon waldren her work with the aid agency and their two adopted children christos and katine one thing at least he had in common with the waldrens thought ryall adopted children kershaws call had disturbed him halfway through an inspection in their microchip section and he was still slightly breathless from stripping off the protective suit nothing juicy then yet no right right let me know as soon as youve got more if there is more ryall began to worry that nothing worthwhile would come up on waldren she was just as she appeared on the outside the goody twoshoes aid worker with her two adopted children and financebroker husband uppermiddle and pristine with her champion of downtrodden children halo and hed have to think of other ways of striking back at her stopping her before she got uncomfortably close but kershaws increasingly frequent and fervent calls over the next few days bit by bit quelled his mounting panic and when the whole picture became clear he realized that he had more than enough ammunition for his purpose enough to bury elena waldren twice over some of it seemed so unlikely and extreme that he found himself asking kershaw to repeat segments pressing if he was sure ryall was concerned that kershaw might have been overkeen to unearth some dirt and had tapped some unreliable sources but kershaw was sure of his ground some of it was hard to find buried in old articles from hampstead and highgate local papers where the george previously georgallis family used to live though a couple of incidents managed to warrant small sidebars in the national press the only word of mouth was an old police contact but ive used him before hes reliable and then the rest is pretty much down to court papers little room for error there but when youve got the file if theres anything youre unsure about and want me to check again just let me know id be happy to oblige there was no need for a call back kershaws report was thorough detailed and made sober reading two drug busts and a third for a greenham common antinuclear demo that went awry from the press clippings most of it appeared to be a rich wildchilds rebellion against her strongly establishment father the founder of what at one stage was britains th largest merchant bank overall among financial institutions ryall should have twigged when he first saw the original family name george anthony george whizkid financier of the s and s but it was the earlier problems the pregnancy at fifteen and giving the child up for adoption then the attempted suicide and the courts final ruling that she was too unstable unsuitable to be a mother that was the most damming especially given her current work ryall wondered just how much of her background shed come clean about with the aid agency or in the adoption applications for her two children giving up her own child convicted drug addict attempted suicide courtruled as unsuitable for motherhood not exactly the best commendations for work with a child aid agency or to adopt children ryall couldnt resist a wry smile as he penned his covering letters that night to go with copies of kershaws file one to barbara edelston one to elena waldrens aid agency but both to the same effect that he was still being privately harassed by waldren over lorena and given waldrens own history surely she was the last person to be questioning his rights and ethics as an adopted parent with an added paragraph to the aid agency venting his surprise that they hadnt more stringently vetted her background he paused for a moment wondering whether to send a copy as well to gordon waldren or whether that would be going too far just how much of her past had she told him before finally picking up another envelope shed been first to draw the battle lines had been prepared to destroy him alls fair in love and though this time he didnt bother with a covering note just slipped a copy of kershaws report inside on its own he sat back pleased with his efforts in the background prokofievs dance of the knights played fitting battle requiem music nicole had gone to bed over an hour ago shortly after lorena as usual zonked out on half a bottle of gin and prozac and suitably unimpressed when he said he had some business to attend to some letters to write outside a gusting wing buffeted against the high asp windows ahead and the muffled surge of the sea could be heard in the distance but inside the music filled every corner of the grand room bouncing back from the high windows and vaulted ceiling to the reaches of the gallery library behind a strongly resonant sound chamber with just the right balance of absorbent wood how such music was meant to be heard with only him at its centre to receive it he could feel its rhythm and cadences reverberate through his body rallying his senses his spirits rising soaring he started waving his hands elaborately to the strident staccato violin bursts drawing substance and power from what hed just done that made him feel suddenly master of all around master of this grand room and this house master of the village and its petty minions who dutifully passed information back to him and now master of all those who dared interfere in his life the elena waldrens and their kind he froze for a second lifting one hand to his right cheek he swore he could still feel where little lorena had kissed him the dutiful goodnight daddy ritual of every night and every night he could sense too her clinging anxiety as she came close and pressed her lips to his skin her eyes darting and her small heart hammering as furiously as a humming birds wings that in a way made the whole ritual all the more angelic endearing the sense that he had such power over her yet only a part of her knew how or why he looked up straining his ear to the house upstairs beyond the music wondering perhaps whether he should make sure lorena was okay soothe her brow for a moment a small victory visit but he decided in the end to wait a few days then he could be sure that that victory would be lasting nobody would ever trouble them again the tears hit elena as she rounded the bluff beyond chelborne it was one of her favourite views almost two hundred feet sheer elevation from the sea with the rolling contours of green hills and pastures ahead spilling gently into the yellow trimmed expanse of chelborne sands and the deep blue of the bay on days when the sea was wild like now she liked it all the more white caps could be seen stretching out towards the horizon more lines of conflict and contrast shed captured the view twice before on canvass but still felt shed missed the key that made her soul soar when she rounded the bluff on a stark clear day the day was clear now the wind brisk aftermath of the previous nights gale but elena felt nothing but empty desolate as she looked out across the sweep of the bay i think thats it im afraid weve hit a stone wall the chances of ever finding him again now are virtually nil in terrys view megans words of first thing that morning she hadnt cried then just the same empty gutvoided feeling as now terry had discovered that the stephanous had changed their name by deedpole to stevens some ten months later then simply disappeared off the face of the earth no forwarding address nothing on electoral registers or credit files like her father the name was now completely anglicised george stevens megan and terry were probably right with no link traceable to the stephanous shed never find him ill bury him out of sight and out of reach you wont find him her fathers words all these years later suddenly having crushing resonance still a part of her life despite her fighting so hard to be free from his shadow was in his grip and control though a few hours later she was far more concerned about cameron ryalls control his influence over much of chelborne shed quickly shook off her own disappointment if she couldnt help herself at least she could still help lorena mrs wickens words preyed heavily on her mind one of the most beautiful oriental girls ive ever seen perhaps ryall handpicked these girls for their sheer beauty god knows there were enough of them an endless sea of children with angelic faces and big eyes that the rest of the world had forgotten hed get them into his trust at first soothe their brow some seemingly innocent gentle stroking then would gradually build up until they were thirteen or fourteen the age mikaya had been when she became pregnant and then elena convulsed at the thought but why didnt they speak out against him with lorena she could understand she was too young too frightened and probably not too much had happened yet and what had shed blanked from her mind but mikaya had been old enough to speak out especially given the horror of her pregnancy yet still shed stayed quiet what hold was it ryall had over them she realized she couldnt possibly know without finding out more about mikaya so shed headed back into chelborne after seeing mrs wickens the day before shed filled in some gaps at the local dress shop and at the health store but it was all minor stuff the school mikaya went to what clothes she liked yes they knew about the whole messy business with the pregnancy but no there wasnt a particular boyfriend they could point to as a likely culprit we havent seen much of her these past couple of years mrs frolley at the dress shop finished thoughtfully now that shes away at university now visiting mrs frolley again to ask which university mrs frolley was a closed book im sorry i dont know becoming quickly flustered i think ive said more than i should in any case and im rather busy now redfaced mrs frolley scurried away to attend to a customer a shopgirl at the health store after going back and checking informed her that mrs boyle was busy stocktaking and couldnt see her so shed rested her hopes on the everreliable mrs wickens but the reaction with mrs wickens was much the same albeit handled with a more open folksy reprimand when i tell you things its in all trust and confidence i dont expect it to be used in all strange manners elena tried to appeal to mrs wickens maternal instinct with her having raised four children of her own this isnt about any personal clash i might have with mr ryall its about the welfare of a young girl who i believe could be under threat serious threat mrs wickens shook her head i dont believe any of it for a moment mr ryalls a good man he wouldnt dream of doing anything like that hes been very good to my rolly these past years it hit elena with a jolt in that moment mrs wickens husband roland worked at ryalls local plant with a business of that size in a small village like chelborne no doubt numerous relatives of other villagers and shopkeepers were employed there after all ryall was by far the areas largest employer a saving hero to fill the gap after the years of decline in the local fishing industry few locals wanted to think badly of him a spark of recognition reflected back through mrs wickens eyes and she turned away with a slight flush busying herself with rearranging her counter newspaper display well you know we each have our own to take care of and it was driving away from mrs wickens rounding the bluff that the build up of frustrations and obstacles finally became too much and the tears hit shed been working against the grain against the impossible for days and weeks for decades if she counted the lost forgotten time that shed blanked christos from her mind hadnt even troubled to search for him and only now was that realization hitting her faceon her fathers hand reaching across the years to still grip tight affect her life and now ryalls tentacles spreading across chelborne blocking strangling her progress the bay ahead became misty and blurred as her eyes swam and she had to pull over maybe that was the key with her painting that slightly blurred monet look but it barely raised a smile at the corner of her mouth her spirits couldnt be buoyed this time and she sank deeper down sobbing uncontrollably she cried more for the lost years with christos than for this dead end now after all shed only lost a week to discover that she would never make good on the twentynine years lost and for lorena it was more the sense of frustration and powerlessness than sorrow she thought shed shaken free of her fathers grip years ago but shed been fooling herself all along and now she was facing the same again another powerful man and she was unable to prise loose his grip to be able to help lorena she shook her head biting back the tears maybe gordon was right shed allowed the dividing lines between ryall and her father to become muddied confused it wasnt healthy would only get in the way of her being objective having a clear view clear view she wiped again at her eyes dabbing her cheeks with the back of one hand and once again the view of the bay ahead was clear she only wished her troubled thoughts could as easily have been cleared after a moment she swung the car out again and continued on down the slow decline towards chelborne bay clinging to the one consolation out of the whole mess at least now her secret would remain forever buried no reason for its exposure her life with gordon and the children like the view ahead would continue much as it had done bright untroubled with few worrying clouds twelve jeanpaul turned from georges as he poured the drink from a decanter on the side cabinet one thing my brother does have good taste in brandy jeanpaul brought the glass over to georges seated towards the end of the long table jeanpauls own glass was already in front of his position at its head he raised it and smiled sante yes cheers georges savoured its mellow burning as it sank down an aged ragnaudsabourin that roman had bought for jeanpaul at christmas just past georges glanced back towards the door isnt jon joining us no this is more family talk than business jeanpaul looked directly at georges for the first time oh right georges should have guessed from the late hour and the brandy a soft mellow glint to jeanpauls eyes no hostility but georges thought hed picked up a faint underlying concern it wasnt quite the uncompromising embrace hed been seeking i thought this might have been about giacomelli and cuba i talked briefly about it with jon at the party last night yes well we can discuss that maybe tomorrow jon didnt have much free time today jeanpaul glanced briefly past georges shoulder his train of though broken for a second then a faint smile creased the corner of his mouth old man vito giacomelli apparently lost a packet down there when castro took over and all the casinos closed art agrees with your assumption that when finally the trade embargoes lift property prices there are going to skyrocket and i think hes tickled by the idea of making back some of the money the old man lost there what weve got to do now is turn all of that nostalgic payback into a sound business proposition and a clean way of doing it if there is one jeanpaul took a swig of brandy and stood up started pacing as i say well talk more about it when jons here fresh breath and georges was unsure whether the pacing was jeanpaul getting his thoughts moving or nerves anxiety but it was in fact my recent visit with art giacomelli that prompted this meeting now you know that art has been following closely this bid of ours to change the nature of our business move away from crime and become totally legitimate clean yes i i know at least that youve confided in him about it more than anyone else and that hes the crime boss your family has maintained the closest ties with over the years jeanpaul clasped his brandy glass as if he were praying then waved one hand away expressively this isnt just about old man vito and my father running liquor and cigarettes across the border in the fifties or how close our families have been since or even at the power level with how that association helped us later with our problem with the cacchiones the hand groped emptily at the air for a moment and georges sensed something difficult coming jeanpaul was normally conversationally fluid no gaps between his thoughts and words and yet now he was struggling art was particularly helpful and supportive when pascal died georges just nodded and looked down sensing it was best not to interrupt the flow maybe that was the awkwardness pascals death all georges knew of the whole affair imparted from jon larsen jeanpaul had never broached the subject directly was that giacomelli had intervened to stop their war with the cacchiones after pascal was shot as reputedly americas most powerful crime boss he had that influence when arturo giacomelli said stop people stopped yes hes interested in how we progress how successful we are because if it works for us it can work for him and maybe others a sort of test case if you will the hand started in motion again but it goes deeper than that a lot of it tied in with arts thoughts hopes and ambitions for his own family probably you dont know too much about them well only that he has a son vincent who works closely with him in the business yes vincent dear vincent who has given his all to his father yet hardly gets a mention in praise jeanpaul looked sharply directly at georges but what you probably didnt know is that art has another son paul and a daughter mia okay mia has never really come into the frame shes now at some college doing a fashion photography course and theres no expectation in any case on women coming into the family business but what about paul hes never in the news like vincent because hes not involved in the family business hes at annapolis with the navy but listening to art youd think that paul was his only son paul this paul that paul could be a navy commander one day did you know he says it with such pride in his voice as if that was the only thing of real importance to him totally neglecting the fact that his other son will one day run a multimillion dollar crime empire and continue his legacy each and every day risking a bullet through the head for the privilege and why why jeanpaul threw his free hand towards georges as if he was flinging dice why is he so blinkered with eyes only for one son i dont know georges shrugged easier now that jeanpaul had found his flow but still unsure where it was all heading because hes the son thats managed to escape and make his own way find some success outside of the family business jeanpaul sat back down and looked thoughtfully into his brandy glass for a second oh sure everyone looks at people like vito and art as the tough guys the wise guys but it never gets any easier they start tough no question fronting longshoremen with billhooks and union strongarms wielding baseball bats getting their first blood then later more killings over turf or to rise up the ranks some of it handson with having to pull a wire through a mans neck but it never gets any easier jeanpaul relaxed open the hand hed clenched suddenly tight because as the money rolls in their private home lives become softer they move out of their old neighbourhood buy a house with a pool and a gardener their wives get their hair done each week and have private fitness and yoga instructors and their kids go to college and get an education suddenly the mean streets where it all started become but a distant dream and with all that when they sit back and look around them jeanpaul waved his hand in a halfcircle it starts to hit them as ludicrous why they should still fear getting the wrong side of a bullet still have to look over their shoulders the hand pulled back in and jeanpaul shrugged sure they themselves probably accept that fear of a bullet theyve lived with it from day one as part of the package the territory but they start to expect something better for their family for them they want that fear gone they dont want them to have to live the same way they have thats why art was so outraged with what happened to pascal because pascal was never really involved in the business he was just on the fringes doing some bookkeeping if his music career had been more successful he wouldnt even have done that so art saw him as someone on the edge who almost escaped but never quite made it still they got him art was outraged because he felt that if they could do that they were only a step away from yanking paul from annapolis and putting a bullet through his head and the golden rule has always been hands off family outside of the business thats why when art intervened with the cacchiones the white flag came up so quickly theyd broken the rules and knew it he swilled his brandy and took a quick slug though by then it was too late for pascal i understand georges cast his eyes down for a second though it was more the general ethos he understood he had no idea until now that giacomelli had taken such a personal interest in pascals death because of how it might relate to his own family jeanpaul forced a wan philosophical smile the only problem is its not so simple fate circumstance gets in the way sometimes the kids dont do so well at college or they show a natural leaning towards the business or like vincent they start getting into trouble with other things and the parents think if theyre going to go down that route anyway they might at least go down it professionally in an organized way but what starts to form in the parents mind is a black and white yardstick the successes escape the failures with little or no choice despite all the education and privilege heaped on them to keep them away end up in the family business thats why art talks all the time about paul with hardly a word for vincent georges nodded he recalled jeanpaul once consoling jon larsen who was upset that his son had dropped his law studies to pursue a career in palaeontology relating how carlo gambinos children hadnt followed him into the business one of them opting for the totally polarised unmacho world of dress design gambino didnt fight against it because he knew at heart his children wouldnt be right for it thats why john gotti was nurtured to finally take over after castellano he came from the same mean streets as gambino his edge hadnt been softened by two generations of money and education but then you get all the times when its not so black and white all the grey areas like pascal and me where we end up in the business by default pascal because our father found out his bookkeeper was cheating him and he needed someone he knew he could trust for a while before getting someone new jeanpaul shrugged though pascal ended up staying much longer and me because he feared that roman wouldnt have the right acumen for the business or temperament that he was far too headstrong and then of course what happened with pascal ended up supporting that judgement he waved his brandy glass you know that my father partly blamed roman for pascal yes i know theyd touched on the subject before but never in such depth or so heartfelt the only emotional plea ever put to it had been when jeanpaul and jon larsen first convinced him to join the fold explaining why this bid to clean the business was so vital so close to the familys heart it wasnt just a passing whim and suddenly it hit georges why jeanpaul was covering it all now something was wrong was concerning jeanpaul and he was testing loyalty but was it just a suspicion or had jeanpaul heard about chenouda hauling him in which way to play it so hopefully now you can see why cleaning this business is so important not just to me but so many others like art giacomelli a possible solution for the generations to come aside from them simply having to step outside of the family business to get their fathers approval because the problem is not really with them but the nature of the business and the fact that nobody wants to leave a legacy to their children that might end up getting them killed georges laid one hand flat on the smooth polished table to stop it trembling which way to play it jeanpaul had circled in so well georges had always felt the terrible burden of this commitment the fear of letting jeanpaul down when he knew how much it all meant personally to jeanpaul that burden growing by the day with his withheld secret then had come the knowledge that their progress was suddenly of interest to other leading crime families bets and prejudgements were being made on each side but at least hed been able to view all that as one step removed from the fray now suddenly it was of personal interest to art giacomelli he wouldnt just be letting down jeanpaul but also americas most powerful crime boss it was as if jeanpaul had purposely chosen it as the perfect extra pressure to apply he moved the hand to trace one finger around the base of his brandy glass his brow creasing measured concern i knew how important this was to you from the outset though i must admit i didnt know that it was also something so close to giacomellis heart i thought he was just a close friend and interested observer nothing more he chose his words carefully sensing that he was tiptoeing through a minefield but my commitment was made on what i think about that aim not anyone else if i didnt believe wholeheartedly in it and see it as a challenge i wouldnt have joined you its as simple as that and that commitment remains as strong now as on day one jeanpaul slowly nodded in understanding he proffered one palm towards georges its just that sometimes it can be difficult joining a family like this its easy to feel like an outsider as if theres nobody you can confide in confide in now there was little doubt remaining yes i know he swallowed hard his collar felt suddenly tight a hot flush rising up through his neck to his face and at first i must admit that was difficult particularly the close relationship you had with roman the feeling that i might be somehow interfering coming between you by changing the direction of the business and now jeanpaul opened out both palms a priest welcoming confession georges swallowed hard again a light sweat coming to his brow it was as if hed been steadily pushed in a corner with each word domino played by jeanpaul hed been expecting so if you ever feel the need to confide in anyone dont forget im always here for you but instead jeanpaul had done it with just two words two words as that final feather on the scale to hopefully make him crumble the burden of his betrayal suddenly too much but it would seem conveniently trite just to blurt it all out and turn turtle on what hed struggled to avoid all along setting brother against brother and would likely come across as little more than a desperate cheap shot under pressure and what if he was reading the whole thing wrong just getting paranoid and this little heart to heart was completely innocent had simply been prompted by jeanpauls recent visit with giacomelli but if he said nothing or got the tone wrong chenoudas warning could soon hold frighteningly true jeanpauls protection would quickly evaporate and hed be out in the cold at romans mercy he traced the same finger back and forth again by his brandy glass which way to play it which way before looking back directly at jeanpaul the right words finally in place within twentyfour hours they had all the answers to the information georges had provided jeanpaul phoned roman minutes after georges leaving roman had been expecting the call so after the initial impatient so what did he say roman merely listened his breath falling shallow over the line as jeanpaul ran through georges account of events yes he admitted that he had been confronted by chenouda and had to go downtown with him but he says nothing happened chenouda is apparently suspicious that you had something to do with savards death and he had a tape to play because savard was wired for sound the night he was abducted georges said he only listened to part of the tape before he started screaming for a lawyer they pumped him some more questions about that night with leduc things apparently passed on by savard but he claims he said nothing and shouted again for a lawyer they kept him alone in a holding room for another twenty minutes or so then let him go how long did he say they kept him just over an hour maybe an hour and a half no it was over three hours my guy doesnt make mistakes donatiens isnt telling you the whole picture and why didnt he tell you all this before he says that he was nervous about coming between us has been from day one he wanted to sit on the information for a few days perhaps get some advice from jon larsen before confiding particularly with chenoudas claim that you had a meeting arranged with savard the night he was abducted jeanpaul left a marked silence making clear the gravity of this information roman knew the likelihood of it coming out and had prepared well with him on a rcmp video it wasnt something he could lie about sure i had a meet with savard earlier the night he was killed for which he didnt show i mentioned to frank at the time that it was a strange but it wasnt the sort of thing worth troubling you with tony was still working protection in lavalle and with our club there id meet up with him sometimes twice a month roman sensed faint clinging doubt from the pause at the other end come on if im going to take tony out ive got opportunities every day and week to do it quietly without anyone knowing you think im going to do it knowing that tonys wired and a pack of rcs are looking on no the cacchiones are behind it perhaps they even knew through savard we had a meet and set it up to make us look bad and chenoudas fallen for it because hes desperate and so now he puts pressure on our weak spot donatiens could be but i take your point about such an open move roman sensed the advantage and decided to push a bit more i mean you know donatiens is so concerned about not coming between us and then the first opportunity he does just that he starts speaking out of school about me no he was quite reluctant to talk i had to press him he kept saying you really should be talking to roman about all this not me yeah well youre talking to me about it now and you know what i think the guys full of shit they agreed that not much more could be done until jeanpaul could check with georges pa jaqueline just how long he was actually away from the office the morning in question roman was sitting the other side of jeanpauls desk when the call was made first thing the next morning after prompting with are you sure halfway through jean paul related pensively that she thought about an hour and a half shes lying or shes mistaken roman fired back and in face of jeanpauls quizzically raised eyebrow he fell silently thoughtful for a second before coming up with the suggestion of checking with some of donatiens regular callers they came up with six names and split the list between them three hadnt called at all that morning one couldnt remember whether he had or not but of the remaining two they ascertained that donatiens was out about ninefifteen ninetwenty and again at am it could have been two separate occasions that donatiens was out so they decided to visit the building after office hours and get security to run through the video tapes for that morning as chairman of santoine international jeanpaul explained to the guard that he feared a breach of security might have taken place two police officers came that morning and left with monsieur donatiens we need to see what time he returned it took almost half an hour to run through the tapes on visual fastforward they quickly found the point where chenouda and an another officer entered the building and left with donatiens seventeen minutes later the timer in the top right corner showing am as the guard slowed the tape again then came the more tedious trawl for him returning involving checking the basement garage cameras as well just in case he came back in that way they finally found it donatiens walking back in through the foyer with a glimpse in the background of the same unmarked grey car hed left in earlier with the timer now showing pm chenouda wasnt evident this time but from the profile the cars front passenger looked like the same accompanying officer as before jeanpaul closed his eyes for a second as the grainy grey images registered three and a half hours georges had lied to him thanks he muttered to the guard youve got to do something about it roman pressed as they walked from the building i know i know jeanpaul kept up the same brisk pace slightly ahead of roman not wanting him to see the pain of betrayal in his eyes that he was close to tears but this isnt a decision i can take lightly i need overnight to sleep on it work out what to do well talk again in the morning georges looked out over the lights of montreal from his penthouse the dark expanse of mount royal to his left a snaking stretch of the st lawrence to his right slim ribbons of reflected light punctuating its inky blackness with the band of downtown lights in between spreading wider and sparser into the distance his body was shivering even though the heating was set at c his eyes darting cannoning off the citys skyscrapers as if they might provide the answer to his problems and what he should do next he wished simone would call back he knew she had a dinner function for a client launch this evening and hed left two messages now surely shed know that he wouldnt forget her meeting and wouldnt be bothering her now unless it was urgent all she had to do was steal two minutes away two minutes he relaxed back his clenched hands breathed deeply tried to ease his tension he was convinced his salvation now lay with her to spill all to jon larsen wouldnt sit right after his meeting with jeanpaul only somebody emotionally close would do so emotionally close that it wouldnt seem strange sharing with them all the awkward details that hed shied away from with jeanpaul but what he felt the crushing need for most now was that he act quickly his talk with jeanpaul had only been a halfway house a stopgap and caught on the hop like that it hadnt gone quite the way hed hoped with jeanpaul pressing hed said much more than hed have liked he couldnt admit that he was with chenouda for three hours with what little he claimed had passed between them so hed said only an hour or so and covered himself with a call to jaqueline at her home straight afterwards maybe he was worrying for nothing maybe jeanpaul would as hed suggested talk to roman about it roman would say something that didnt quite fit and any shadow of doubt would fall more on roman than him but as his eyes cannoned between the buildings measuring the various angles and potential problems he saw more ways of the chips falling wrong for him than right perhaps once hed spoken to simone and the dust had settled hed head to his parents for the weekend but was that guilt because his workload had kept him from seeing them for almost three months or a reaction to him feeling shunned from the lacaille clan left out seeing in jeanpaul some sort of replacement fatherfigure to make up for his stepfathers shortfalls that he should have known from the start had the potential for disaster would only complicate his longrooted feelings about family fear now that once again he was being deserted the backs of those he held fond were again turning away just when the ringing phone crashed abruptly into his thoughts he went hurriedly across and grabbed the receiver before it had hardly started the second ring yes georges simone i got your message background clatter of voices plates and cutlery muted music simone was struggling to be heard above it theyre deep into the thankyou speeches now hopefully nobody will miss me for a few moments whats the problem ive got to see you somethings happened and i need to talk to you about it urgently can you come by here afterwards i i dont know ive got a real splitter here her voice faded for a second the clatter taking over cant you tell me over the phone no this isnt the sort of thing that can be done over the phone we need to sit face to face a moments pause then simones voice came hesitantly not a problem with me with us is it georges no no nothing like that its a problem i might have with your father and roman less marked pause this time lets meet tomorrow please i couldnt hack it tonight if i make it through this all im looking forward to is some hot cocoa and bed yeah okay okay tomorrow then simone only had a halfhour free at lunch and georges was sure it would take longer than that so they agreed on dinner at thursdays on rue crescent eightthirty table then ill book it and pick you up at eight yeah great see you then love you a light blown kiss quickly swallowed amongst the clatter and she was gone georges let out a slow tired exhalation as he hung up so hed have to wait twentyfour hours having waited a year to finally bare his soul given that perspective it hardly seemed to matter nothing much was going to happen between now and then georges simone i got your message theyre deep into the thankyou speeches now hopefully nobody will miss me for a few moments whats the problem ive got to see you somethings happened and i need to talk to you about it urgently can you come by here afterwards funicelli sat forward with the urgency in donatiens voice as the tape rolled donatiens sounded troubled funicelli had to tweak the sound up to fully hear simones voice above the background clatter he hoped that the problem might be explained especially when donatiens commented that it was to do with her father and roman but everything ended abruptly with their arranging to meet all he could do was pass it on maybe roman would know what was troubling donatiens roman got the tape by messenger at am the next morning and wished that funicelli had phoned him immediately the evening before funicellis covering note mentioned the call from simone and donatiens sounding worried maybe you know what might be worrying him but obviously any urgency attached to that knowledge hadnt immediately dawned on funicelli the one drawback of always making sure the people around you only had half the picture and while roman knew all too well what was troubling donatiens with the two of them meeting in a restaurant any chance of finding out exactly what was going to be said were gone hed just have to fill in the gaps in his mind he remembered a maid that his mother lillian had shortly after his father died she would move objects around in the room as she cleaned and some of them would get progressively closer to the door then the next thing they would disappear completely it was as if the maid wasnt quite bold enough to steal them straightaway but once they got closer to the door they became almost hers the next step wasnt so bold lillian came to know what would disappear next according to how close to the door it was last time the maid cleaned and with the next two items gone and lillian sure of her ground she fired the maid thats what donatiens was doing moving his story closer to the door he hadnt wanted to tell all to jeanpaul perhaps hoping naively that yours truly roman would meanwhile have a sudden stab of conscience and do it all for him but first and foremost no doubt was the awkwardness of donatiens admitting at the drop of a hat that hed been lying to jeanpaul for the past year all trust went out the window either way and coming hot on the heels of him keeping quiet about meeting chenouda as well there were high chances jeanpaul would have had doubts about both stories no hed read georges well he had little doubt now either that georges was going to tell all to simone unburden all the messy detail hed been unable to with her father and use her as gobetween she could explain all the subtleties of why georges had lied for so long that would have been difficult for georges to explain directly faceon roman closed his eyes for a second and bit at his lip a faint sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead as he opened them again and glanced at his watch just over an hour to know jeanpauls deliberation twelve hours before donatiens passed the ticking bomb to simone how long before simone in turn passed it to her father a day two days at most hed have to move quickly if jeanpaul didnt sanction a move on donatiens straightaway hed have to make his own plans before the day was out and he knew now that those plans would have to include simone as well or hed have to think of a way whereby her voice would be ignored would have no potency thirteen im sorry so sorry i just didnt know how to tell you at the time elena shook her head there were no tears left now shed cried them all out during the day ruined two sets of makeup but you could have told me gordon held one hand out as if clutching for an invisible explanation in the air i thought we could admit anything confess anything to each other i thought we had that sort of relationship obviously i was wrong he hovered the wine glass in his other hand close to his lips then put it down firmly hed drunk four glasses during dinner and the hour since waiting for the kids to go to bed and was now most of the way through a fifth although it had adequately dulled and mellowed his mood which is what hed wanted he sensed that it was starting to make him confrontational not what he wanted after twelve years of secrets and silence over this the last thing he needed was for elena to become defensive and clam up retreat back into her shell im sorry i didnt mean that i just need to know thats all i just need to know elena was stung by the pathetic plea in his voice shed run an emotional sword straight through the man who most loved and trusted her a sword shed worked inch by inch through his guts the past twelve years without him knowing and all he wanted to know was why gordons only retaliation and payback had been to leave her alone all day to dwell on the bombshell problem hed received the folder in the early morning post and dumped it in front of her half an hour later ive already read through it im going out now to see clients perhaps youd like to explain it all to me when i get back his tone and his sharp stare made her realize immediately that it was no light problem but gordon hadnt returned until the kids came home from school elena thought on purpose so theyd moved around each other like two awkward bantam cocks avoiding eye contact and with conversation kept to curt abrupt comment when absolutely unavoidable until after the children had gone to bed hardly a virulent payback a days awkwardness to compensate for twelve years of deception and already there was no fight left in him he just wanted to know she started with what gordon did know about her background and her past rift with her father the years in marrakech and in hippie communes and squats when she returned to england the drug busts the demonstration marches the years of rebelliousness not just against her father but all he stood for that was all that appeared on the surface the visible symptoms of the root problem gordon looked at her aslant are you saying that perhaps i should have known or guessed that something else was wrong from all of that no no she shook her head vehemently how were you to know i wouldnt have been the first rich kid to rebel against establishment parents in the sixties it was practically mandatory she forced a wan smile but she sensed she wasnt going to get far fluffing around the edges the only way she was going to get through this was by going back to the beginning back to her pregnancy at fifteen and how shed come close to death twice within a month his name was michael kiernan we were very much love such as love is when youre only fifteen at the time it seemed allconsuming he was all i cared about he had wavy dark hair and the most incredible blue eyes and at nineteen he seemed to me so adult and masterful so in control greeting her at the door for their second date with a single white rose and a theodorakis instrumental of the white rose of athens he was caring romantic rare i suppose for that age looking back now and had one of those easy smiles that made you feel warm alive my father hated him on sight too smooth too smarmy by half when pressed my father said that he just didnt trust him didnt think his intentions were good though i suspected and probably my mother too if you could ever have got her to speak out against my father on anything that it was more to do with michaels family background only two things counted to my father serious money or status within british society preferably both michaels father had a successful landscape gardening business but it fell far short of where my father had set his sights by then and his nationality too was a drawback elena noticed gordon look quizzical for a moment not fully grasping and she went on to explain about her fathers early days in england and the discrimination hed felt both shielded and overt how even at the stage hed built up a successful import trading business he was still refused membership of the local golf club dont forget it was the fifties and minds were narrower then but those memories rankled deeply with my father thats why later he completely anglicised himself and buried his greekcypriot background to feel accepted part of british society apart from the transformation to anthony george he wore tweed and herringbone tried to play the perfect english gent you might see on a pearl amp dean advert elena smiled crookedly and so with michaels family being irish my father saw them as only one rung above the cypriots in british societal acceptance it just wasnt enough for my father by then gordon still looked vaguely puzzled but why was that all so important you were only fifteen you could have been looking ahead to scores of different boyfriends over the years before getting close to finding the right one the pregnancy the pregnancy was what made it so important right there and then if michael had fitted the bill more my father might have pressed him to marry me do the right thing but instead it quickly became i told you so time i told you he was no good gordon nodded knowingly so that was the abortion yes but i lied about everything else about it not only to you but everyone else at the time which is what caused most of the problems you see it was nine weeks before my sixteenth birthday when my period didnt come on and i hoped first of all that it was something else then the second month and still i didnt say anything i was desperately fearful of my fathers reaction not just for myself but by then for michael as well i knew that if my father discovered id conceived underage hed have been blind with fury would have probably called the police and had michael locked up so i fluffed and kept quiet about it until after my sixteenth birthday though the first point i could have worried i was pregnant then from missing my period wasnt until about seven weeks after the earliest date of possible conception i proposed was ten days after my sixteenth birthday which was when i claimed id first had sex with michael i said that wed been together only twice since but instead of trying to get the poor girl has just been unlucky sympathy vote i should have been more concerned about that three month lie because it almost ended up costing my life elena watched gordons eyes cloud and glance down for a moment some sympathy at last thirty years later elena took a hasty gulp of wine and shook her head you know nobody actually asked me if i wanted an abortion ive never seen a family rally round so fast all of them talking and arguing about what to do as if i wasnt there had no say in the matter only uncle christos boldly ventured that i should be asked what i wanted but he was shouted down mainly by my father with everyone else just numbly going along too afraid to go against him single mothers were social lepers in those days michael wasnt suitable so it was the only remaining option a quick quiet abortion the whole matter quickly swept away and forgotten elena waved one hand as if she was swatting a fly her eyes filling she closed them tight for a second oh god i was so frightened i knew nothing read nothing was so young and naive and even my closest girlfriends i didnt confide in because i feared the secret would get out and for the same reason my father didnt have any tests done that might have revealed that i was lying about the date i conceived all he did was arrange a backstreet kilburn butcher and lead me there by the hand a month later looking across and recalling that the last time her father had held her hand like that was five years earlier at a fairground leading her safely onto one of the rides the welling tears spilt over started running down elenas cheeks she dabbed at them with the back of one hand he thought i was only two and a half three months pregnant but i was already almost six months gone she glanced at the light glinting off a lone knife and spoon left on the table after dinner instruments glinting on a white cloth the cold press of the formica table against her back staring up at a bright fluorescent striplight that washed in and out of focus it was all decided in those twenty minutes the dye cast on practically my whole life ahead i remember the doctor giving the abortion if indeed he was a doctor had a faint irish lilt and i remember looking back at it all if that was all part of my fathers cruel humour an irishman to give it to you another to take it away elena smiled crookedly but gordon could see that it was just a weak attempt at relief from the descent into hell at play behind her eyes elena shook her head but at the time i was too numbed to frightened to think anything the abortionist realized halfway through that he was dealing with a fully developed baby rather than something hardly beyond a foetus but by then it was already too late the damage was done my water had broken and i was bleeding heavily from a ruptured womb blood running off the table droplets starting to splatter rapidly against the linoleum floor the doctor shouting frantic instructions to her father for fresh instruments swabs fresh towels water there was a suspended moment between my father and the doctor when my father said do something with him and after a moment the doctor very slowly and deliberately stated that he merely stopped babies being born he didnt kill them the main problem by then was with me the doctor reminded him if i didnt get urgent attention i could die and whether to appease what he thought was a dire concern of my fathers he added that born so prematurely it was unlikely the baby would survive in any case we couldnt go to a hospital too many questions would be asked so he rang ahead to a colleague in swiss cottage a doctor with a fully equipped surgery who dealt with a lot of quiet pregnancies for arab and foreign clients elena closed her eyes for a moment her voice trembled with the effort of biting back the tears to get the words out you know that was the first moment holding him in my arms on that fourmile drive that it hit me what id done streetlights flashing in rapid bars across his tiny bloodied body his eyes struggling to open and see against the piercing strobe effect call it that moment of maternal bonding or what you will but it hit me then that it was a life a life that was a part of me and id tried to get rid of my lifeblood was fast flowing away over the seat of my fathers new mercedes that crooked smile again which didnt quite make it but all i could think of in that moment was him willing with every ounce of me that he would stay alive and too numbed beaten up and washed out to care anymore about myself and as i hugged him close my father fired me a strange look that i just couldnt read anger at the nightmare id caused still wishing my baby dead or anger at seeing me so close to someone else a closeness id never really shown him but i remember thinking thank god its not me driving and him holding the baby a horrible creepy feeling that he might have smothered or strangled it en route four days in an incubator and little christos thats what id decided to call him by then survived as did i elena waved a hand dismissively and shivered as if someone had laid a cold hand on the back of her neck except that part of me that would ever again be able to have children i wanted to keep him oh god i wanted to keep him but again i was given no voice in the matter i was too young had my whole life ahead of me didnt have a husband my father made the running and the rest of the family quickly supported he was going for adoption i was still too numbed with it all and in any case felt it would have done little good to even trouble to fight back but as those plans became set in stone that feeling of powerlessness and a terrible sense of loss and desolation at what id done gripped me hard i felt totally worthless that with him gone there could be nothing good ahead anyway even if i could face another day or myself with what id done i tried to take my life emptied half a bottle of aspirins from a bathroom cabinet down my throat my mother found me my stomach was pumped once again i made it elena tapped her chest and fired a brief laconic smile either god was watching over me or more likely he wanted to keep me alive because he had a much longer more fitting punishment in store that would have been too easy a way out elena cradled her forehead for a second before running her hand roughly through her hair she took a quick sip of wine but at least when i came around id found my voice i wanted to keep him my father fought me every inch papers are already done cut and dried then he brought up the suicide to get a court ruling that i was unstable unfit to be a mother finally he said that if i fought him any more over it hed have michael charged with having sex with a minor and put away i dropped it didnt even trouble to turn up for the final ruling i knew already what it would say but even with what fight id put up or perhaps fearing that id change my mind again in a few months my father vowed that hed bury him out of reach and out of sight id never find him she traced one finger absently across the tablecloth and looks like he was right i never could win the day against my father and now its much the same with ryall powerful men blight of my life elena grimaced tightly and looked down for a second before looking back directly at gordon but at least you know now why there was such antipathy between me and my father why i rebelled against him so all those years silence as she finished crushing silence she could practically hear gordon swallow as he tried to summon his thoughts and some composure to be able to meet her gaze with equal steadiness after a moment she added thoughtfully i suppose there might have been some sort of tame reconciliation later if it wasnt for andreoss suicide i blamed my father mostly for that too always pushing towards this perfect picture of what he thought everyone should be doing with their lives but nothing was ever good enough for him she bit at her bottom lip and lightly shook her head after all who could live up to the great anthony george gordon merely nodded the stifling silence returning you could have told me he said at length id have understood could i could i she saw him flinch under the feverish intensity of her stare and look slightly away again suddenly not so sure this wasnt just about you not knowing gordon it was about everyone not knowing but most especially me because if i had to admit what had happened to anyone id have also had to admit it to myself and before you know it id have been back in the bathroom swallowing another bottle of pills and so i buried it buried the thought buried the memory buried everything it never happened she rubbed her left temple her brow furrowing heavily the years in marrakech and in hippie communes werent just to seriously pissoff my father it was all part of the oblivion the forgetting then eleven years later i woke up in a camden town squat laying partly in somebody elses vomit having lost a flatmate just the month before from an od and trying to fight my way through an lsd haze to work out if the pattern on the wall ahead was wallpaper or just in my mind and finally said enough enough i realized then that i was punishing myself more than my father hed probably given up caring long ago and meanwhile i wasnt making good on what id done no amends were being made thats when i cleaned up my act and started working with uncle christos then a few years later we met married and started adopting which was how i felt i could possibly make amends uncle christos to the rescue again gordon raised his glass but it lacked any exuberance the mire of abortions attempted suicides lost children and lost years clung too heavy in the air for even a trace of a smile was it always him that helped you gordon remembered her telling him that during the years in the hippie wilderness uncle christos sent bits and pieces of money her father had set up a trust fund for her but she refused to touch it on principle so uncle christos had stepped in yes pretty much you know my father was annoyed even that i wanted to name the baby christos he protested you only name children after dead relatives a fleeting wry grin curled her mouth there was always this rivalry between them mostly coming from my fathers side if christos had done this if christos had done that he could have been as successful as me but my father seemed to have missed the point completely uncle christos was too laidback to be bothered to compete he didnt want to be a big shot like my father didnt have the first inclination to be ruthless or determined like him and when i saw those qualities as endearing started to see uncle christos as an alternate father that incensed my father even further he couldnt stomach it or maybe he truly couldnt comprehend it but he used to rub the salt in all the more about uncle christos being a failure she looked at her glass and tapped its rim as if prompting where she was with has story so making amends became the thing we adopted named him christos and though for a while everything was fine it still wasnt enough so when he was old enough i joined the agency to see how many children i could make happy after the childs life i might have destroyed my own child elena gripped the stem of her glass tight here eyes were watering heavily again gordon wanted to reach across to grip her hand assure her that everything was all right he understood but her other hand was clenched tight into her and with her still caught up in the throes of her confession her body trembling slightly his reaching all the way across would have felt like he was imposing invading her space he felt frustrated inadequate a decade of secrets stripped away between them and he couldnt reach across to bridge that final gap of the tabletop elena shrugged helplessly but still it wasnt enough i had to save one of those children myself so we adopted young katine still something missing a need there and the only thing that helped fill it was each child i saw successfully placed with a happy family because each one told me that the son id given up had probably gone to a good family somewhere hed been happy had had a good life and i was doing fine elena smiled crookedly she was suddenly reminded of a line from an old bill cosby lp i was doin fine only then my eyeballs started bleeding the thought seemed so ridiculously out of place that she burst out with a nervous laugh but it went awry became a halflaugh halfcry her muttered until on a fractured breath barely out before her face contorted the buildup of her emotions finally too much her shoulders sagged as if a sack had been laid across them and her head dipped as she sank into uncontrollable sobbing that brought gordon around to hug and console her though still he felt inadequate it had taken the final submission of his wifes tears for him to be able to cross that last distance between them it wasnt that noble he hugged her a moment more trying to savour that now finally there were no more secrets between them but apart from the gentle quaking of her body with her crushing emotional distress it felt no different to all the other times hed embraced her he made fresh coffee for them both always gordons solution in times of trouble elena thought wryly wiping back her tears make tea of coffee poured a baileys for her and a glenffidich for himself and she told him the rest how ryall with lorena had finally broken down the wall shed long built up and set her on her search of the past ten days that now too like her help mission for lorena had hit a deadend until ryall id always told myself that my son was probably in a good home somewhere happy and each child i saw successfully placed reaffirmed that then with ryall it hit me that no matter how secure and happylooking that home might be on the surface all kinds of horrors can be lurking beneath and suddenly i had to know i had to know what kind of life hed had whether he had been happy or whether id abandoned him to a wolves den a living hell gordon thought of venturing how that might help if hed had a bad life how shed even begin to make up for it but that base desire to find a longlost son he knew rose above all else rationalising wouldnt help and besides the possibility of ever finding him now looked gone chapter closed so in the end all he said was i understand then after a moment he shook his head you know i should have known should have at least guessed all the signs were there the depth of antipathy with her father the lame story now in retrospect of her not being able to have children due to an early horseriding accident the aid agency the adoptions shed held up a giant route map in front of his face and hed hardly noticed how could you have known she raised an eyebrow sensing that he was just saying it to make her feel good take some of the burden away that shed held all of this secret throughout their marriage deceived him id buried it even from myself so everyone else was a step further removed they couldnt get there until i got there first as she saw the acceptance slowly filter through in gordons eyes she looked away again fixing blankly distantly ahead gordon came and snuggled her close again he felt her breath against the hollow of his neck and slowly closed his eyes shed finally got there and now didnt know where to head next the routemap had finished in two deadends and he wished he could think of some bright snappy answer to buoy her spirits because while the barrier of twelve years of secrets between them had suddenly gone the son that she would now never be able to find again had as quickly taken its place while that stayed unresolved he knew that a part of her would remain distant out of reach the barrier would continue having lifted only briefly for those few moments of her pouring out her heart to him before crashing back down again like some cruel magicians trick fourteen you just dont seem to grasp the seriousness of this roman threw his right hand towards jeanpaul as if he was tossing dice his hand gestures had become increasingly volatile as their arguing hit fever pitch yes i do jeanpaul eyes stayed fixed hard on roman had only shifted at moments as their voices raised as if concerned others might hear beyond his office walls more than obviously you appreciate but what i dont want to do is throw everything away everything weve worked long and hard towards these past three years over a two minute panic he could destroy us jeanpaul and yeah thats all it takes two minutes two minutes with the wrong thing said but he was there fucking hours and he lied to you about it and that might be just the tip of the iceberg who knows what else enough enough jeanpaul held one hand up we went through this chapter and verse yesterday i thought hard on it overnight and ive made my decision im not going to rake over the same ground now jeanpaul moved the letteropener used for that mornings mail to one side besides this isnt just about you me and the remnants of our past activities georges is practically family theres simone to consider and our mother too holds great fondness for him thered be a lot of people hurt if we made the wrong move on this i know roman looked down bracing his right hand hard on his thigh as if to forcibly stop it from gesturing wildly but that could be part of the problem right there you know that was always our fathers main worry with you that when it came to the crunch you might shy away from strong action that you going the more reasonable diplomatic route would one day not be the right route to go this could be that crunch time now jeanpaul and youre too blindsided with simone and family to be able to make the right move that as may be jeanpaul shrugged impatience as if hed only halfregistered the remark or wished to give it scant relevance we just cant be sure yet which is my main point and why for the moment i think we should i mean if youve got a problem with that you dont need to say it straight out the fact that its your daughter puts you in a predicament but not necessarily the rest of us just silently nod or close your eyes for a second and ill take it as understood that you just dont want to know about the problem anymore and ill take care of it ill take it off your hands jeanpaul visibly jolted with what roman was suggesting he blinked heavily for a second as if he might have picked up the wrong signal but seeing the intent in romans eyes his body arched slightly forward little doubt remained jeanpaul contemplated roman stonily you know thats the other thing father said that you were far too rash impulsive hotheaded thats why in the end he left the final decisions with me not you jeanpauls tone was cutting acid and make that decision i will when the time is right and we have all the facts roman met jeanpauls glare challengingly his jaw setting tight then finally his eyes flickered down uncomfortably hopefully hed given the intended impression suitably cowered yeah sure sorry i uh its just theres a lot for us to lose thats all hed feared just this reaction from jeanpaul which was why hed already started sowing the seeds of his other plan hed gone as far as he could pushing jeanpaul conventionally and maybe too some rumours i heard about donatiens at the club and im putting two and two together and coming up with five what sort of rumours well you know its probably nothing roman tried to shrug it off but jeanpaul was looking at him keenly god he knew how to play them leduc georges venegas and now jeanpaul and they all thought he was so dumb just talk that when georges does the take at the club hes a bit overfriendly with a couple of the girls but as i say its probably nothing only me getting paranoid in face of all this other shit now as roman watched the cogs turn in jeanpauls mind he wondered what was most prominent if the rumours had substance georges cheating on simone would make it a stronger bet that he was also cheating on them that it would then be easier to make a move on donatiens visavis family or simple straightforward concern for his daughters emotional welfare still looks like it warrants watching following up jeanpauls hands had clasped tight together on the desk top he freed one and gestured to roman which brings me back to what i think we should do for now he should be watched closely i want to know his every move and anything new from the club about georges i want to know immediately not like with this other thing a month or two later right sure sure roman struggled hard to keep deadpan conceal his inner mirth watched closely hed had a bug up georges ass the last month without anyone knowing and now jeanpaul was personally sanctioning the club sting hed already set into motion which was just how roman had hoped it would go played so well and for one of the first times he didnt feel intimidated in jeanpauls study with its tomes and diplomas for once he was in control he talked about frank and who else he might need to keep an eye on donatiens glancing at his watch as if considering when he might be able to get hold of them but in reality his thoughts were already shifting to timing the final parts of his sting plan and just how much longer donatiens had to live the full impact of georges story hit simone halfway through her plaice florentine her fork hovered suspended above her plate she shook her head and closed her eyes for a second god what a mess you should have said something earlier i know i know georges said it like a penance but i was fresh on the scene and so afraid of coming between your father and roman by telling tales out of school and by the time id waited hoping meanwhile roman would say something himself it was already too late for me to come clean and make good but still roman roman she shook her head again if the situation was reversed hed have been pretty quick to speak out against you i know more penance but i wasnt aware of that so much then that i was such a thorn in his side and he didnt totally agree with jeanpauls new moves with the business and it was still early days for those moves i just wasnt sure how much the old rules of staying silent and not ratting one to the other still applied simone stayed looking at him levelly and shrugged as if she only half accepted his rationale her fork finally dipped down again to her plate georges continued okay now its easy to see i made the wrong decision but it wasnt made lightly i can tell you he picked at an alaska king crab claw his favourite but he wished now hed chosen something else it had been difficult enough getting through this with simone and at times the cracking of the claws grated added an extra flinch i agonised long and hard over it and more than a few times came close to telling your father so fine youve got good reason not to say anything early on but when you were hauled in by this guy chenouda why didnt you say something straightaway then there was so much to weigh up too much if chenouda knew from savards statement that leduc didnt have a gun that night was he aiming for a murder wrap if so i felt that was unfair because however hasty or stupid it was an honest mistake by roman he thought leduc had a gun georges leant forward keeping his voice low practically a whisper also would that then make me and your father accomplices me for being there your father for ordering the meeting and what about savard did roman have him killed to cover his tracks or was chenouda just pushing that angle for leverage and again it would have felt odd just blurting out to your father that id been lying all that time it was all bubbling away all i wanted was a week or two for it to settle and decide what to do but meanwhile i started to worry that your father might have heard or at least suspected something and then with our meeting the other day i knew for sure did he mention directly that he knew no you know your father hes far too subtle for that he started talking about confiding and commitment particularly how important this whole change in the business was after pascals death and how even art giacomelli had shown a keen interest because of his own son georges saw simones brow furrow slightly he filled in the details as he finished simone eased out her breath and sat back i thought you said subtle he tells you that americas leading mobster is keen too that you perform well but dont feel the pressure any she forced a trite smile but heavier shadows shifted behind her eyes she paused for a second as if deciding whether to reveal them but with pascals death my fathers not pulling any punches it ripped the family apart you know that my grandma is very religious yes i do georges decided finally to crack a fresh claw well she always kept a statue of st antoine in her room hes the one you pray to when you want things made right things that have already gone wrong or you fear they might do but as kids every now and then wed see st antoine turn up in the fridge and we then discovered that when things went wrong and st antoine hadnt answered her prayers shed stick him in the fridge so we always knew when things werent going right in the family because there was st antoine out in the cold alongside the milk and butter she smiled briefly but the shadows were quickly back with pascal she prayed and prayed you know there was this period of three days when he clung on in a coma and there was slim hope and when he finally died we expected to see st antoine back in the fridge but he wasnt there nor in her room shed smashed him given up all faith in him or god for that matter at least for a while she pulled a stray strand of hair back behind one ear st antoine didnt show up in the house again until fifteen months later and she didnt even go to church for nine months after pascals death georges looked to one side for a moment as the bustle of the restaurant imposed a waiter showing a party of three to a table close by miguel their usual waiter smiled over from the bar it was strange all the other times theyd come here their conversation had been so light carefree two young socialites high on the citys grace list among the throng of yuppies that regularly crowded thursdays restaurant three bars and basement disco with miguel invariably leading them straight from their table and past the usual disco queue at weekends on occasion some of her friends from the agency would be there or theyd meet up with his old friend mike landry and his latest date but most of the time theyd be alone they would talk about the weeks triumphs her about new agency accounts at the agency him about fresh business ground broken for her father or where they might vacation that summer or ski that winter or more recently wedding plans now he was concerned not just for his status in the lacaille family but also if chenouda was right for his life and he was dumping on her twentythree year old shoulders the pressure of bailing him out it was no light burden far removed from her normal concerns of what colour to choose for the next sports car her father was buying her and she was rising to it by filling in all the heartfelt family mosaics that might have led to this problem now is that why your father chose santoine international for the company name he asked yes it seemed to sit right for him new hope despite the odds he saw stacked against she took a fresh mouthful and waved her fork but certainly my father wasnt just playing on your emotions by mentioning pascal so much else changed in the family then like a house of cards tumbling down grandpa dying soon after grandma turning her back on religion for a while and my father finally deciding to move away from the old ways pascal despite the odds it gripped georges all the harder just what a heartfelt quest this had been for jeanpaul and how much hed let him down it felt almost a cheek a final insult that now he was getting his own daughter to bail him out make good now he had her tiptoeing through the same minefield using terms like old ways instead of crime in case someone was listening in georges shook his head i shouldnt be asking you to do this no no its okay i want to help she smiled and shrugged besides i dont know if theres anyone else who can help you with this so looks like im stuck with it he knew she was making light of it mainly for his sake to make him feel that he wasnt burdening her too much he reached out and clasped her hand across the table closing his eyes for a second as if in final penance thanks she leant across and planted a warm and lingering kiss on his lips as if she somehow sensed that he needed an extra touch of comfort reassurance but it brought a few glances from nearby tables god how he loved her both sides of her fun flippant simone with hardly a care in the world which was all that most people saw or the little girl whod grown up before her time under the shroud of a crime family seeing st antoine in the fridge next to her milkshake and flapjacks each time her father or grandfather came out the wrong side of a gang or turf war the first georges was sure was just a camouflage for the second he clung onto her hand a second longer telling himself that his depth of feeling in that moment had little to do with dependency even though throughout his life from his mother dying and the years of abandonment in the orphanage and even the times his stepfather let the family down financially his concept of love had often been forged through dependency he couldnt face being left out in the cold again it would be almost as bad as the more ominous threats chenouda was warning of with roman a tingling chill washed through his shoulder blades and the nape of his neck and as it showed in a faint trembling in his hand he let go of simones almost but little doubt remained now that he was dependent on simone and as she began to talk about how best to tackle the subject with her father he realized just how much so she stressed that it was important she didnt come across just as the concerned girlfriend doing her duty she had to sell herself as the right and only person to cover the problem given the circumstances and it struck georges that for her father to take her seriously and her pull it off heartfelt oldbeforehertime simone was needed yet he didnt know nor had ever troubled to find out how jeanpaul viewed his daughter if like most people he saw her simply as a carefree happygolucky twentythree year old then he was sunk roman was in heaven having watched viana writhe in the club half the night now she was writhing on top of him he held his hands by her waist as if to guide her but her body had a rhythm and purpose all of its own he tried to match his thrusts to it but more often than not hed be a beat out so would just relax and let her do it all it was as if she mimed all evening to screwing just building up to the real thing so that she could let it all go with one final virtuoso performance thats why he liked to show up half an hour early for the take when he was planning to head home with her he could look at her dancing and gloat you guys are just getting the playacting ill be getting the real thing the anticipation added to his excitement that was his buildup shed already had one orgasm and the second was even more tumultuous bringing him to a finish at the same time quicker than hed have liked he was trying to draw it out savour the experience longer she shuddered with a last few strangled gasps and then lay on top of him her breath hot in his ear her chest rising and falling hard as she clawed back to normality her gasps and screams had been loud enough to make neighbours think she was being murdered except that his nearest mount royal neighbours were at least a cadillac length away behind thick brownstone walls her breathing gradually settled but he could still feel her heart racing hard her body poured out heat like a steam blanket against him and he could feel her still moist and pressing against his thigh another moment to savour but there was no point in delaying longer hed not wanted to broach the topic before sex he would have spoilt the mood now that was over and time was tight he still had to get back to the club later with funicelli he rolled her off gently but the jolt in the mood still registered faintly in her eyes he touched her face with the back of one hand reassurance babe ive got this little problem but i think you might just be ideal to help me out with it what sort of problem curiosity rather than suspicion hed never before asked anything of her outside of sex roman ran through the story hed constructed georges was fooling around it was threatening all sorts of problems with simone and the rest of the family but the problem was he didnt have proof so his only choice left was to set him up and take a few photos and that was where viana and an escort agency girl hed arranged came in she looked perplexed doubt starting to set in so he jumped quickly to the money this is important to me so im paying top dollar eight grand and dont worry none about paying for supplies the next four five months he gently touched her nose the treats on me her smile slowly emerged thats good of you roman thanks her eyes flickered searching his fleetingly this must be important to you yeah yeah as i say it is he knew hed have to be generous she earned fifteen hundred dollars some weeks but probably the nose candy was enticing her most a sly twinkle suddenly came to her eyes anyways georges i always thought he was quite a cutie would hardly seem like work roman sat up bristling he reached out and pinched her cheek look this is just playacting youre not there to fuck him for real besides hes gonna be zonked from what you put in his drink back at your place so thisll just be lookgood stuff for the camera he gave one last hard pinch and pushed her face away in disgust she came sidling up against him after a second stroking the nape of his neck come on i was just teasing roman but i didnt know you cared so thats where you got that wrong i dont care thats why im fuckin paying you he remained rigid a moment more before finally giving in to her insistent stroking he shrugged and smiled reluctantly well maybe when youve just fucked my brains out like now i do care just a little her hand froze on his neck and he gripped it and pushed her back on the bed straddling her her eyes glared back at him for a moment before realizing from his smile that he was teasing too but he was glad in a way that shed chosen to rib him over georges it would make what was coming easier the tension gone between them he ran through the rest someone from the club that shed made the mistake of dating hed become a bit freaky and possessive was waiting outside her place the night before and theyd ended up having a fight could georges run her home see her safely into her apartment she was afraid the guy might be waiting for her again that night she grasped the plan clearly after only a couple of minor questions except for one point a fight wouldnt it be enough just that im rattled afraid no i think were going to have to be a little more convincing what i put on some makeup for it to look like bruising or something no i dont think so he might pick up that its just makeup get suspicious this was the best part watching that gradual dawning of realization on her face he was still straddled on top of her and her eyes darted uncomprehendingly for a moment before settling on him no roman no way my face is my work my money sorry doll i just dont see any other way round fear settled in her eyes and she grappled out frantically to push him away he pushed one arm back easily with his left hand and pinned the other under his right knee the bruising will be gone in just a week back to normal no romy please please she writhed and bucked to try and shake him loose but he had her pinned too tight her breath came short with the effort verging finally into tears and gasping sobs as she realized the futility she wasnt going to get free noooo please ill round it off to ten grand and just think of all that nose candy he cocked his right fist above her face no roman dont do this to me im begging you nooooo she shook her head wildly tears streaming down her face she let out a piercing scream that went straight through him and he dug his knee harder into her left arm shut the fuck up and keep your head still unless you want to get your nose broken as well her head stopped shaking and she stared straight up at him her pupils dark and dilated full of terror he drank in that terror for a moment wallowing in the heady sense of power combined with her bodys trembling it told him that finally he was in control all her resistance had burnt out but there was a plea beneath her eyes that he found disturbing or maybe turn your head a little so that i can be sure of a clear shot she slowly reluctantly turned her head to one side tears streaming unashamedly down her face her body trembled beneath him like a trapped humming bird her only sound a muted whimper as she bit tautly at her bottom lip and with his final sorry babe her eyes fluttered gently shut a second before his fist came down roman let carlo funicelli into the club less than an hour later funicelli perched up at the bar roman poured them a couple of beers and they started talking aimless chatter it was all for the sake of the security cameras if jeanpaul got sight of the tapes hed say that he met funicelli at the club after hours to talk over surveillance of donatiens after a moment roman pointed something out along the rows of bottles behind and funicelli came around the bar they moved along but as soon as they were out of security camera view roman knew the exact position funicelli ducked to one side towards the cash register roman had already given him the key and in just over a minute funicelli was finished two sets of codes keyedin that he knew would disrupt the clubs four linked registers handling both cash and automatic stock ordering they moved back into view of the security camera with roman pointing out some sambuca on a high shelf as funicelli nodded azy would call in a panic soon after they opened that night and everefficient donatiens would come running the new system had been his recommendation roman knew that he couldnt wait for donatiens normal monthly till check and reconciliation he had to somehow get him there quickly funicelli noticed romans right hand clenching and unclenching and asked something wrong its nothing roman shrugged you know for every bit of love theres always some pain funicelli didnt pursue it he went back to silently sipping at his beer as roman glanced at his watch fortyeight hours for donatiens left to live and counting fifteen five days since baring her soul to gordon five days of searching with nothing but fruitless dead ends and now practically elenas last hope lay with these two old steamers trunks raking through her fathers memorabilia and keepsakes all that remained sixtytwo years of life neatly packed away she was so absorbed with their contents that she barely registered the footsteps behind her come on enough elena you can go through the rest later if we dont get ready were going to be late for the restaurant yes i suppose so elena was kneeling down her breath short from raking and sifting through she lifted her head and half turned towards uncle christos just five minutes more and then ill jump into the shower get some of this dust off okay after a second a reluctant okay from uncle christos ill make us another coffee meanwhile then the sound of his footsteps shuffling back down the stairs the first three days had been spent searching through uk credit reference agencies for the stevens previously stephanou family mostly at gordons instigation shed all but given up felt that she had no fight left in her to continue searching but gordon insisted it wasnt the sort of thing she could give up on lightly it would only come back later to haunt her he offered to help with his knowledge of credit reference tracking and the next fortyeight hours they burnt up the phone loans between terry megans trace man and seven reference agencies from gordons card file but they found nothing linking back to their previous canterbury address with either stevens or stephanou they concluded that either the stevens had miraculously survived without any credit for three years after moving had lied about their previous address or more likely that theyd left the country they were stuck at first as to how to find out where they might have gone then gordon hit on the possibility of her fathers old passport providing clues if her father had a hand in spiriting the stevens away then he might well have visited their destination around the time of them moving elena thought it worth pursuing but the only problem was that her fathers belongings were still stored at her mothers and elena didnt want to visit her especially not for this purpose shed had little or no contact with her mother while her father was alive and with elena not turning up for her fathers funeral five years ago things had become even more strained between them theyd only spoken briefly once on the phone since when uncle christos informed elena that she was ill so it was uncle christos to the rescue again phoning her mother with an excuse about trying to find some old business papers ill pick the trunks up and have them back to you within a few days then straight after he phoned elena back and she jumped on a train to london to start her search she received a call from barbara edelston the day after her heart to heart with gordon and halfway through a predictable dressing down about her being desperately out of order to still be interfering especially given your background she finally blew and gave edelston a piece of her mind one day youll wake up the fact that ryall is a control freak and a dangerous one at that hes been controlling young lorena for years he controlled nadines enquiry by taping our meeting me by getting a secret report done and you by sending you both the tape and the report and just like the mug he hoped youd be you fell for it all and responded strictly by the rule book if all of that doesnt look the tiniest bit suspicious to you then im afraid i cant help you she slammed down the phone before edelston could respond and dialled straight out to shelley mcgurran shelley too would no doubt have received ryalls poisonous file and she didnt want shelley to have to phone first to get an explanation after a strained halfhour on line with a condensed version of her soulbaring to gordon and shelley voicing her sore disappointment that elena hadnt felt they were close enough to be able to share this earlier shelley finally rallied behind her i agree you have to find him elena and try and help young lorena if you can that is if youve got either the time or inclination to handle both elena wondered if that was shelleys polite way of saying that she no longer had a job with the aid agency but shelley was quick to reassure god no devoted workers like you are hard to find im disappointed and i only half accept your reasoning but not enough to boot you out and especially not at the bidding of that prick ryall take a month off or whatever it takes to sort out your life then give me a call your place will still be here and give that ryalls ass an extra kick for me promise elena was close to tears when she came off the phone from shelley her ready understanding made it all the harder another whod so loved and trusted her and her repayment to them had been so poor over the years so lacking in trust and it was those close to her like gordon and shelley that were now firing her up into action after twelve days of searching with megan and terry that ended nowhere and ryall rallying half of chelborne against her and sending his damning report shed all but given up felt she had nothing left to give until her fathers two trunks were in front of her then suddenly she was on overdrive again frantically sifting through dusty plans for their old house gce results for her and andreos her communion prayer book her first school photo andreos at nineteen standing proudly by a new suzuki bike hed just bought the family all together raising glasses in a cyprus beach bar when she was just nine shed found her fathers passport covering near the bottom of the first trunk but still she kept going poignant nostalgia of the years she was there the family all together plus filling the gaps on the years she wasnt she was totally absorbed found it impossible to break away it was strange looking through photos of herself and andreos as children and some old birthday cards one from her to her father at the age of seven with a pressed flower inside it was as if a softly nostalgic vulnerable side to her father had been exposed which shed never witnessed while he was alive when shed aired that thought to uncle christos he mentioned that her mother too had packed away some old family memorabilia in the same trunks so again her father remained an enigma she couldnt be sure of a chink in his emotional armour the agreement had been that as soon as she found her fathers passport uncle christos would book a table for them at beotys his favourite cypriot restaurant a small celebration there were five entry stamps in the few months either side of the stevens disappearing hopefully one of them would prove fruitful she made the excuse of continuing her search in case there were other papers which might give some clue but when over an hour later uncle christos found her still on her knees busily raking through now half covered in dust from the trunks contents he became concerned he reminded her that time could be tight for the restaurant but she was sure his main worry was that she was getting too wrapped up in the trunks contents some of it might be too emotionally painful for her so when he returned with coffee she immediately stood up and dusted down took a few rushed gulps before showering knocked back the rest straight after and within fifteen minutes they were in a taxi wending through the remnants of rush hour traffic between queensway and the west end streetlamp light bars playing across one arm the small face looking up at her struggling to see she closed her eyes for a second shaking off a faint shudder perhaps going through her fathers things for so long hadnt been such a good idea the face across for her now thirty years on wasnt far different to her fathers the resemblance was mainly around the eyes and nose and with the same thick hair which had turned from black to stone grey in their early fifties but it was a slightly more rounded face with a readier easier smile the edges softer the clownish compassionate foil to her fathers stern allbusiness manner it was no wonder that shed warmed more to uncle christos as a child and before she was old enough to discover if she might break the barrier of how she felt about her father somewhere between cool remoteness and open fear the rest had been written in abortion blood and sealed with court adoption papers never to be reversed you dont rate athens hamburg or rome too highly do you uncle christos commented no i dont three of the five stamps in her fathers passport around the time of the stephanous disappearance i think their names being anglicised and then them turning up somewhere where those names would stand out would be pointless whereas in chicago the name stevens would be commonplace and almost half of montreals population is anglophile youre working on the assumption that your father had it all planned out do you know of any time that he didnt plan everything to the last uncle christos shrugged a tame accord and they sat silently for a second anyway well know soon enough she said theyd used terry to put in trace requests with both the american and canadian embassies for visa or emigration applications in the name of stevens or stephanou around the time the family disappeared terry had been asked to call back the next day uncle christos merely nodded she could tell that something else was on his mind and finally he turned to her his expression slightly drawn concerned elena you really should see her some time i know with picking up the trunks it could have been difficult she might have asked too many questions but before you leave london you should make the effort maybe when i return the trunks tomorrow you could come along at the same time no no it would be too painful for both of us too much has gone before uncle christoss pet beef reconciliation with her mother she watched his expression change from hopeful to questioning and added especially not now with everything else ive got on my plate uncle christos grimaced with reluctant understanding and turned to stare blankly ahead again nighttime london rolled by their taxi windows the lights from an oncoming car making his profile shadow more pronounced for a second she could practically read his mind always an excuse whenever he broached the subject shed usually raise how her mother had always taken her fathers side was practically a silent conspirator she found that difficult to forgive or last time that it was too close to her not showing up at her fathers funeral her mother wouldnt have forgiven her yet now it was the search for her son you know shes not getting any younger elena i know elena bit lightly at her lip guilt worming deeper then after a second shes not ill again is she no shes not christos shot her a look of tired reproach but that shouldnt be the only reason you feel you must make contact again because you fear she might be on her deathbed besides his eyes flickered down slightly direct eye contact was suddenly difficult has it ever struck you that she was equally as afraid of your father that alone apart from the fact that shes your mother is something you have in common you were both on the same side of the fence more than you probably realized but i was barely more than a child uncle christos only fifteen at least at her age she had a voice she should have said something she might have been able to she stopped herself realizing she was launching again into a diatribe about how much more her mother could have done she didnt want to spoil the mood for the restaurant and she hated to see uncle christoss face darken the lighter jovial side would suddenly be gone he would remind her too much of her father despite her own feelings she understood why uncle christos felt so deeply grieved by the split in the family andreos and her father long dead her years apart from all of them and now the thought that her mother might die after years of being alone without any reconciliation between them was too much for uncle christos to take she reached across and gripped his hand youre right i should make the effort some time and perhaps when im through all this will be that time i can show up at her door with my son for a big reunion shell know then that i have back what i want thered be no reason for me to still hold any resentment im there at her door because i want to be there not because i feel i have to be there uncle christos smiled tightly and patted her hand but as he looked away again she could tell that he was only half reassured it could be just another excuse pushed out of reach again by being tied to something that might never happen she had so many hopes and desires riding aboard this and now uncle christoss hopes that one day their shattered family would be patched back shed strapped to the same possibly doomed ship at least they didnt have to wait long to know two calls the next day could decide it montreal or chicago but when the next morning terry called with the good news that the canadian embassy had confirmed they had a stevens family listed in october for immigration to montreal father mother and a young baby elena had other problems two calls late the night before from young lorena gordon phoned her about them not long after shed called with the news from terry they came through to your studio so i didnt even hear the phone ringing last night and didnt play the answerphone back until just now i see she swallowed slightly then asked gordon to play them i should hear them okay one second but gordon sounded hesitant as if worried the effect they might have on her a rustling and clicking as gordon set it up then lorenas frail uncertain voice elena elena i thought you were going to help me since you came to the house i ive heard nothing and mr ryall is still coming to my room please please if you can hear me pick up the phone a moments silence then the sound of soft whimpering before the line went dead a short beep then her voice again he he doesnt touch me when he visits maybe hes frightened to since you visited but he does touch me in the dreams and theyre so real sooo i i dont know what to do a pause a sniffle as she battled to control her tears please if theres anything you can do elena im sorry to call you like this but i dont know who else to call if youre there the tears had finally stopped only shallow breathing as lorena waited on expectantly for the phone to be picked up before finally she gave up elena took a second to compose herself as gordon lifted the receiver away from the dull dialling tone she pictured again lorena reaching out her hand to the back window of nicola ryalls range rover but nobody was there to grip on to that hand to help her elena took a fresh breath how did you get on with mikaya i finally found someone in the village ready and willing to speak up joe hawley at the garage he had a run in with ryall over a bill last year apparently mikayas at durham university hardly anyone down here sees anything of her anymore ive phoned the university twice now and left messages but no return call as yet elena sighed might still prove fruitful but im not sure weve got the time now to wait theyd agreed that the best way to help lorena was through finding out more about what had happened with mikaya gordon had offered to start digging while elena was in london looking through her fathers things but now with lorena sounding so distressed she began to reassess mikaya might well decide not to speak to them now or at any time and they had to do something quickly she outlined her new plan youre crazy gordon said after a pause as if unsure for a second that she was serious its far too risky maybe so but look where i am now from not taking risks not standing up to my father twentynine years without seeing my own son and too afraid to admit that ive even got a son to anyone just so that i dont have to face it myself pathetic if something is happening with ryall and i do nothing id never forgive myself lorena could end up in a few years time where i found myself so screwed up that she empties a bottle of pills down her throat as the only way out and ryalls just like my father the only way is to make a stand push back otherwise theyll just steamroller straight over you i still dont like it only a few ways gordon could see it going right and far too many of it all going horribly wrong but he could tell that her mind was made up he might as well start thinking of ways to help her try and reduce the risk whichever way the chips fell one thing looked certain from this point on their lives were going to be very different sixteen viana wore a mask covering her bruise for her dancing that night bright turquoise feathers with cream tinges it covered one eye and swept in a semicircle down one side of her nose and across just under her left cheekbone shed had it made especially by a friend who made costumes for the annual caribbean carnival shed felt selfconscious at first as if people could somehow see the ugliness of the swelling on her face behind the mask or guessed that she was covering something but as she realized people were none the wiser and that with some it even heightened the mystique the allure made her stand out from the other girls she relaxed back into her normal rhythm she saw georges turn up an hour after opening but she didnt want to rush over roman had assured her that he should be staying for the evening or even if he did leave for a while to eat he was going to be back to do the take at closing she bided her time kept half an eye on him between dances for the first fifty minutes he was busy with a technical guy checking all the cash registers just as roman had said would happen she waited until about fifteen minutes after the technician left before sidling over georges was sat at the bar nursing a beer while azy was at the far end serving another customer hi georges she perched on the bar stool next to him you should come by more often we always get stuck with that goon roman trouble with the cash registers he waved his beer towards the bar register and smiled back he wasnt sure what was more important her paying him a complement or taking a swipe at roman while he wasnt there ah and we thought it was because you couldnt keep yourself away from us all here she mocked a hurt expression yep thats it he raised his glass in acknowledgement and took a quick slug couldnt keep away from that smile viana he remembered all of the girls names even though he came by the club at most twice a month he thought it was important in a trade where they were usually treated impersonally pieces of meat just to gawk at he often talked with the girls and viana had been as free and easy with the smiles and talk as any of them but what had stayed with him most was that along with another girl amparo from costa rica noble aims lay behind their work they were both helping their families out amparo simply because of their dire poverty while viana was saving for surgery to help her mothers crippling arthritis hows your mother now closer to having the money together yeah quite close now thanks she flinched slightly at the mention this sting tonight would go a long way towards helping pay nor did georges have any idea that if it wasnt for her habit shed have probably had the money together months back she was touched also that he remembered roman never asked about her mother she hoped that this was all as roman said just to split georges from simone because he was fooling around that roman wasnt thinking of harming him with the still tingling ache behind her mask to remind her what roman might do if she let him down she pushed the worry from her mind like so much else in her life what choice or control did she have her fleeting concern at least seemed to have set the right tone georges there was something else i wanted to talk to you about a little problem that i she looked up as azy started down the bar towards them roman had stressed to keep it all out of earshot of azy she looked to one side can we go over there maybe and talk georges nodded with a tame smile he could see that she looked troubled was conscious of prying ears they moved two booths away from the bar she ran through the story exactly as roman had coached a club visitor who shed made the mistake of dating hed became difficult and possessive started shouting that he didnt want her working at the club anymore while she was going out with him shed tried to break it up the night before and we ended up arguing things went from bad to worse and thats when he hit out gave me this she lifted up her face mask she was careful to keep her back to azy who was no doubt keeping half an eye on them although azy would have clearly seen georges pained flinch as the ugly bruise was exposed she bit lightly at her lip as georges sucked in his breath i was worried that he might be waiting by my place again tonight so i was wondering if if you might be able to run me home tonight see me safely to my door the right emotions were easy to turn on seeing georgess reaction to her bruise brought home just what a mess roman had made of her she was close to tears again if its not putting you out any you see normally i would georges clasped her hand no no its okay i can run you home georges eyes searched hers a moment longer her fear was genuine and if her intention was to hit on him she would have chosen another time with her face half mashed up she wasnt at her most alluring but what about the other nights im not here what will you do get roman to run you back he looked past her shoulder or azy maybe she held up one hand no i dont want either of them to know about it you know what romans like if he found out hed half kill the guy and azys real strict on us dating clients because of past problems hed feel that he had to tell yves or roman ive laid on my cousin to pick me up most nights its just that he couldnt make it tonight no its okay ill run you georges gave her hand one last reassuring pat before pulling his away ive got to nip out for something to eat but ill be back later to do the take romans not doing it tonight no with the problem with the registers i wanted to do the tally tonight no point in us both being here i phoned him an hour back viana let out a slow breath as if a burden had been eased that was another thing i was worried about having to cover with roman if he asked about the mask i was going to have to lie to him tell him i fell down some stairs she forced a nervous smile everything was going how roman planned and hopefully shed feigned her side well georges looked convinced settled but as she turned slightly she was aware in her side vision of azy still looking over at them id better get back now thanks again georges see you later she touched his sleeve and headed off towards the far side of the room quickly slipping back into her normal seductive sway as she roamed for fresh dance clients she hooked a client after only a minute but as she started to dance her nerves began to build she noticed georges was back at the bar talking to azy she was sure georges wouldnt say anything but what if azy read between the lines azy looked up at her for a moment before moving along the bar to serve another customer she closed her eyes tried to absorb herself in the mood of the music and her dancing twenty minutes later straight after another check with azy of the bar cash register georges left viana waited ten minutes more then went to her mobile in her handbag and put through the prearranged call to roman its done hes gone now but hes coming back to pick me up later okay good stuff well be sitting outside see you later but wondering if azy suspected something each time he looked over and thinking ahead to what shed have to do her agitation hadnt abated her hand was shaking heavily as she tucked her mobile back in her handbag the passing hours didnt help she took a shot of vodka in each of the three cokes she had after pm but still her hands were shaking her stomach in knots she even took a quick snort of coke in a washroom cubicle but all that did was sharpen her focus her sense of apprehension georges was one of the nice guys one of the few that took the time out to show any interest in her welfare what might lay beneath her skin what if roman did intend to harm him when they were getting near closing and georges still hadnt returned she started to hope that he wouldnt show that hed had second thoughts about them being alone together worried that she might come on to him as for roman shed have done her bit it wouldnt be her fault if georges didnt show surely roman wouldnt take it out on her the pros and cons tugged at her but any clarity seemed out of reach beyond the pounding of the music and a slight buzzing in her head she wished now shed laid off the drink and cocaine and registering the slight frown from the client before her she realized that her preoccupation had made her pause for a second in her dancing she picked up the rhythm again and halfway through a second dance for the same client georges walked in by that time her nerves were so out of control that all she could manage was a small wave and a tight nervous smile she became more concerned that azy had picked up that something was wrong when he finally wiped down the bar and just before leaving came over to her and another girl lucy everything okay girls yeah my boyfriends coming by to pick me up lucy answered im waiting on my cousin viana said quickly azy nodded and said smiling goodbyes to them and georges who was busy finishing the register tallies but viana couldnt help noticing that azys eyes lingered on her a moment longer than lucy viana arranged with georges that just as a precaution shed leave a minute earlier and wait a block down for him to pick her up georges too picked up on her nervousness seeing her hand shake as she slid in the car and shut the door behind her though he put this down to apprehension that her boyfriend might be waiting for her dont worry georges assured he sees me roll up with you and even if he is there hes going to disappear pretty sharp can you stay inside with me maybe fifteen twenty minutes just to make sure viana asked her nerves put a faint croaky tremble to her voice just the right touch she looked across at him expectantly with this last cog in place the dye would be cast no turning back a few nights back he rang my bell five or ten minutes after i showed up georges paused only for a second yeah sure he took his eyes from her back to the road he could see that she was deeply perturbed which made him feel safe romance was the last thing on this girls mind walmerton school founded the school plaque was discreet gold lettering on a small blackpainted board by the main double playground gates a smaller school than chelvale primary where katine went though nothing between them academically perhaps the schools longer heritage had attracted ryall elena had only visited once before five years ago when deciding where to send katine but she was far more nervous now than she was then even though that meeting had been terrifying the schools atmosphere austere stuffy and the interviewing headmaster no less so with the accent on rules and tradition more than any ambient needs of the pupils crossing the school playground it was almost deathly silent only some faint birdsong from some nearby trees the quiet before the storm of the lunchtime bell and the playground being filled with a mass of shrill voices suddenly let loose but now all elena was conscious of was the fall of her own footsteps beyond her heavy heartbeat for a second they fell in unison sounding ominous like approaching soldiers in step and she changed pace slightly through the main door into the corridor a faint echo for ominous effect now elena could hear her own laboured breathing coming back to her with the muted murmur of voices straining through the pale cream walls the classroom doors were all marked with types of tree oak ash beech elena found lorenas classroom four along elm she didnt want to hover by the small glass lookthrough and possibly gain the teachers attention too early so she went a few yards past and sat on the nearest bench seat she pondered whether shed planned everything okay shed chosen the regular weekly time when nicola ryall went to the hairdressers and then had a long lunch with her newly acquired charitycircle friends gin and tonic dogooders whose nearest appreciation of the gritty reality of children starving was through a catherine cookson novel mrs ryall would be indisposed twoandahalf hours maybe three and normally kept her mobile off elena had tried just twenty minutes ago it went straight into a caller unavailable recorded message then shed phoned straight through to the school and posing as mrs ryall left a message that lorena had to go to a dentists appointment at pm our housekeeper will come and pick her up at lunchtime elena hoped and prayed shed managed a reasonable proximity to mrs ryalls voice but then how many times in the year might mrs ryall phone and speak to the school maybe two or three at most mrs truett the school secretary merely asked if lorena would be back for class later in the afternoon or the next day tomorrow now i think elena answered though if she can make it back in time for the last lesson today ill make sure shes returned from mrs truetts reaction nothing seemed to have jarred be untoward but what if someone else from the school was now looking out and knew what mrs ryalls housekeeper looked like or what if theyd managed to raise mrs ryall on her mobile to check or the ringing bell crashed into her thoughts on impulse she stood up looking out expectantly a door at the far end was the first to open a few children emerged with a teachers voice booming from beyond but as the main mass appeared the other doors too were opening and spilling out children within seconds the corridor was awash with a cacophony of small voices and movement eight or ten children had so far emerged from elm elena moved closer to the door so that she could look out for lorena and as she picked her out she caught the teachers eye practically at the same time a slight quizzical frown crossed lorenas face shed have to move in quick ive come to take lorena to the dentist mrs ryall phoned earlier the teacher a thirtysomething redhead with a strained smile as she tried to bark some calm into the exiting class looked between elena and lorena nobody told me anything uh it would have been only about forty minutes ago elena had affected a slight foreign lilt the way some of her cypriot relatives spoke english to distinguish from her voice as mrs ryall on the phone instant domestic speak with a foreign accent she forced an apologetic smile and lorena finally picked up on the game and came across and took her hand elena swallowed hard against her hammering nerves mrs ryall forgot earlier the teacher gave them one last look okay fine ill then her attention was gone as she called out to two children jostling each other towards the back shell be back in tomorrow elena said but the teacher only turned towards them briefly with another thats fine before continuing her shepherding of the childrens exit elena led lorena out by the hand before the teacher had more time to think about it her mouth was dry her legs leaden as they wended their way through the crowded corridor she gripped lorenas hand tighter in reassurance but partly it was to quell the trembling in her own hand the shrill voices echoing from the corridor walls seemed to merge with a solid pounding at her temples only a few paces more to the main doors the call of one minute from behind barely broke through it all it had to be repeated hold on a minute before she finally faltered her step and turned an older matronly woman approached with lorenas teacher now alongside elenas heart sank she wasnt going to get away with it after all someone had managed to raise nicola ryall on her mobile or maybe this woman knew the ryalls knew full well that she wasnt their housekeeper the matronly womans expression lifted slightly if lorenas not coming back later shell need her satchel from her locker oh of course elena smiled and patted lorenas shoulder she recognized the voice from her earlier call mrs truett the school secretary yes go on they stood as an awkward triangle for a moment as lorena scurried off a stream of children milling past them then mrs truett commented nothing too serious i hope it took a second for the penny to drop uh uh no hopefully just some fillings elena felt exposed standing in the corridor with all the children passing katine had a friend who went to this school what if she came past and spotted her mrs waldren what are you doing here she pushed a taut smile to hopefully cover her nervousness at mrs truett who looked about to say something before deciding against it with the level of noise around them elena silently screamed for lorena to hurry and return if the noise abated mrs truett might well decide to pipe up again and elena wasnt sure her nerves could take it already she could feel her blouse sticking to her spine with sweat and her legs were close to crumpling lorena appeared only seconds later though already the numbers in the corridor were thinning but at that moment another teacher came to talk to mrs truett and with a quick wave and thanks elena made good her escape with lorena through the main doors across the playground a slight weave to avoid a group playing ball through the entrance gates into the car elena didnt speak to lorena throughout nor did she dare look back in case someone else was trying to attract her attention as they got in the car lorena asked where are we going but still elena didnt speak she kept her eyes resolutely ahead until they were over five hundred yards down the road well clear of the school only then did she finally let out a long breath and turn to lorena i got your message lorena so im going to help you that is if you want me to help you yes of course lorena looked slightly puzzled that is why i called elena looked across sharply no its more than that i need lorena i could get into a lot of trouble for what im doing now youre going to be away from home two or maybe three days the police will start looking for us trying to track us down this isnt a game any more but from the light in lorenas eyes at the mention of police and tracking that was exactly what lorena thought this suddenly was an exciting game so i need to know for sure cross your heart sure that this is what you want yes im sure sure sure her clipped accent added vehemence okay okay elenas eyes flickered to her rearview mirror no cars visible behind but they were still too close to the school elena took the second turning on the left and went a half a mile down before stopping at the first pullin by a farm gate but i cant be seen to be abducting you lorena so it has to be clear also to others that this is all totally of your own free will something that you want rather than me elena took the halfpage shed typed earlier from her inside pocket if youd like to read that and if youre happy with it well put it on tape elena felt guilty watching lorenas consternation as she read only seconds with her out of ryalls clutches and here she was acting like a big city lawyer with first thought to covering her back but it was necessary if she hoped for any chance of avoiding a jail cell for this and it might also help take some of the steam from the police pursuit of them yes its okay lorena said finally are you sure elena pressed lorena was probably so relieved at being helped that shed have said yes to anything but elena didnt want anything possibly guided by force or lack of choice lorena had had enough of that with ryall yes im sure lorena smiled hesitantly sure sure elena took the cassette recorder from the back seat there was a falter at one point and they had to redo the last two sentences but they were all wrapped within a couple of minutes elenas nerves had bristled with the two cars that had passed them in that time and now she was keened sharply to traffic as she rejoined the main road her eyes jumping to the rearview mirror with every car that appeared she dropped the tape off at home gave gordon a quick peck on the cheek and call you later theyd said their main goodbye earlier and hit the road again she didnt want to take the sandbanks ferry and risk getting stuck in a queue where she could be easily apprehended so shed decided to head through wareham which would add an extra fifteen miles she glanced at her watch three hours to eurotunnel or the ferries and by then nicola ryall would know that lorena was missing then shed probably lose halfanhour or even an hour waiting for the next departure and boarding how long before mrs ryall raised the alert with the police fifteen twenty minutes it was going to be tight perhaps picking up on the worry and strain in her face lorena clutched lightly at her left arm and nestled close thank you elena thank you elena gave her a little hug and ruffled her hair she felt like adding dont thank me yet but she didnt want to dull the light in lorenas eyes the first light of hope that had probably been there for a while and she was equally concerned now about her own state of mind the last half hour of tension had totally drained her her nerves were still as tight as piano wire leaping wildly with each car that came close she could feel her bodys gentle trembling as she hugged lorena with fortyeight hours or more of the same ahead she wasnt sure shed be able to cope do you want coffee or something stronger or maybe something soft viana posed the question just how roman had suggested try not to leave the option of donatiens not having a drink just a coke thanks georges voice sailed through from the lounge okay viana felt some of the weight lift from her shoulders though still she found the shaking of her hands impossible to control as she reached for a glass and took the coke from the fridge she pondered for a second what to have for herself before deciding on coffee more time pottering around in the kitchen more movement to provide cover for her slipping the two pills into georges drink while the coffee machine was getting close to boiling she went to her handbag and took out the tablets wrapped in tissue then with a quick look back listening out that he wasnt moving and about to walk in on her any second she put them into his drink they fizzed a bit while she was pouring her coffee she stirred cream into her coffee and gave the coke a quick stir too just to make sure theyd dissolved and walked back in the lounge with both drinks with a smile there you are she handed georges the coke and set her cup down on a coffee table between them i really appreciate you helping me out like this thanks thats okay its nothing georges took a quick sip of coke whats this guys name the one giving you all the trouble ohuh she stumbled for a second that was one thing theyd never thought about she grabbed quickly for a clients name she recalled barry barry picard georges just nodded and took another sip viana became concerned that he was drinking too slowly five minutes roman had said but that was probably from when hed finished it all what if he sipped his way slowly through then knocked back the rest only seconds before leaving she looked away slightly as georges met her eye worried that her preoccupation might have shown youre obviously still anxious georges said but stop worrying even if he was waiting outside hed have probably left by now or certainly within a few minutes max i dont see him waiting beyond that its cold out there youre probably right she fired back a hesitant smile her guilt weighed heavier with the reassurance how many had ever taken the time out to give any thought to her welfare but youll stay the extra ten or fifteen minutes just to make sure right yeah sure no problem he took a heavier gulp this time he could tell that she was deeply agitated it was going to take more than just an offpat reassurance to calm her seeing the fear in her face made him think for a moment of his own problems jeanpaul was on a quick loop trip to new york and boston simone wouldnt be able to see him till the morning he just hoped that jeanpaul wasnt delayed he was near the end of his tether his nerves shot with waiting on the outcome viana took the first sips of her coffee she could sense the awkwardness the tension between them growing more with each beat of silence georges still had only drunk a third of his coke and would probably be more likely to leave prematurely if he felt awkward she tried to lighten the mood smiling wryly as she launched into petty politics at the club between azy roman and yves of how because yves as floating manager was there only one or two nights a week azy seemed to assume responsibility the rest of the time often hell talk straight to roman about anything serious without bothering to consult yves and a few times its caused problems yves feels hes losing his authority viana shook her head watching keenly georges take another few sips and theres no rhyme or reason to what azy might pick up on to complain about one time amy you know well she took too many hits of dope before going on then she slipped a quaalude and topped up by sneaking some heavy whisky shots into her orange juice from a flask in her handbag an hour into dancing and shes on cloud nine she starts laughing uncontrollably when her ass brushes too close and knocks a clients toupee out of place the client complains bitterly and azys all apologies and offers the client a free drink on the house but azy dont say nothing to roman or yves about it vianas smile broadened fact is as soon as the client left azy too is wetting himself over it georges grinned he could just imagine azys fawning wideeyed yes bossman sorry bossman act until the client was gone he felt himself relax a bit but maybe that was because viana was relaxing and smiling for the first time her fear and tension were easing a notch but he could definitely feel his body mellowing no more than that his senses were floating slightly which struck him as strange he could only remember having one glass of wine with dinner and a beer earlier while checking the tills and it was also hot in here his throat dry he eased his collar a little and took a couple of gulps of coke viana followed the glass keenly two thirds down but then other times azy will be as strict as hell wont budge an inch particularly when it comes to dating clients perhaps its because we had a lot of trouble with that michelle last year dating a client some real nasty scenes and shouting matches in the club before yves and roman got rid of her and then azy too had that problem with dating janine last year he got a real roasting over that so perhaps thats why hes so strict on it with others yeah i can see that god it was hot he took another slug felt it cut through the chalk in his throat and he felt dizzy with a dull ringing in his ears perhaps the beer he had earlier was off or maybe something he ate thats why i didnt want anything said to azy about this guy bugging me for sure hed have said something to yves or roman yeah yeah georges held out one hand i understand no problem look i i im afraid im not feeling that well i think id better go the ringing had turned to a solid ache at his temples and everything was slightly hazy more distant he got uncertainly to his feet oh right cant you stay just a few minutes more he could still be waiting outside her concern she hoped came over as real inside she was panicking at this rate georges was going to flake out halfway along the building corridor or in the elevator for all her neighbours to see or worse still while he was driving home stay longer uh ii dont know his legs seemed to hardly hold him he took a step but they felt like numb jelly and buckled quickly he grabbed onto the coffee table for support the room shifted and swayed with vianas voice little more than a dull echo and suddenly all the other signals gelled in that instant her insisting on him staying longer her pause recalling the boyfriends name her watching his glass keenly as he drunk vianawhat have you done to mewhat have you nothing georges nothing are you okay youre frightening me georges tried to look at her directly to see from her eyes whether she was lying but at that moment his legs gave way completely the side of his right shoulder and arm crashing into the table before his face hit the carpet perhaps hed got it wrong it was just some bad food or beer her plea that she was frightened had sounded heartfelt real and he could feel her now shaking his shoulder her voice frantic georges georges but there was a moment before everything faded in which viana obviously thought he was already unconscious and couldnt hear anything she started gently sobbing and then he felt the soft press of her lips against one cheek the moistness of a single teardrop against his temple as she muttered im sorry georges so sorry he began to fear the worst seventeen elena was slightly breathless as she jumped back in the car and waved the tickets great ive got them she started up and headed off from lorenas uncertain smile fired back the significance of the triumph was obviously lost on her elena had become rigid with tension when the clerk seemed slow processing everything on screen filled with sudden panic that an alert might have already reached the ticket desk first hurdle down two more to go as she wended her way around and got her first view of the euroshuttle checkin kiosks eighty yards ahead she could see that there were about three or four cars in each queue dont forget if anyone asks youre my daughter katine elena stared the message home for a second with lorena shed already mentioned it on the long drive but it was crucial now that they were coming up to customs one of the key parts of her plan katine was still on her passport and with lorena only a year older they should sail through with no problem i dont think they will ask but just in case okay lorena nodded and fixed her eyes straight ahead again as they veered slightly and slowed to join a queue that had just reduced to two cars each car seemed to be taking about a minute elena tapped her fingers on the steering wheel as the one in front started to take longer the ticket desk clerk had informed her that she could go to the duty free shopping area for the twenty minutes before boarding but she wanted to get through straightaway if there was no alert at the ticket desk then probably one wouldnt have reached the checkin kiosk yet either but each extra minute increased the likelihood the car at the kiosk finally moved off just one ahead now elenas body ran hot and cold she stopped her fingers tapping on the steering wheel tried to look relaxed calm nicola ryall would have discovered lorena was missing fifteen minutes ago now how long before it hit nicola ryall that it wasnt just some innocent mixup with lorena getting a lift from a friends mother and she called the police five minutes ten minutes then how long for them to arrive start questioning and get to the stage where they realized that shed taken lorena another twenty twentyfive minutes at most but would they put out an alert straightaway or head to her home first and listen through the tape left with gordon the car ahead moved off elena pulled forward to the kiosk the clerk a man in his early twenties smiled cursorily at her she stiffened her arm as she handed over the ticket folder to dampen the visible shaking of her hand he flicked through the tickets for a second before looking up one child and an adult yes the clerk looked at the screen ahead and keyed in some details after a second his eyebrows furrowed and elenas heart froze then as quickly his face relaxed and he made a quick note as he tore off part of the tickets board at gate eight and wait for the green signal there thank you he handed back the tickets with a boarding card elena was a second slow pulling away caught off guard at getting passed through so quickly but the most difficult part lay only sixty yards ahead customs any alert put out would likely have gone straight through there not to the ticket desks she felt a rush of guilt when she thought of the crushing shock that must have hit nicola ryall when she realized lorena was missing reflecting for a moment how shed feel to discover that katine had disappeared from school with a stranger to abate that panic she wanted nicola ryall to get to gordon and the tape as quickly as possible and know that lorena was safe and wouldnt be harmed but her thoughts were seriously at odds to allow her time to get away she hoped that there was some delay two cars ahead in the shortest queue at customs one by the time shed slowed and pulled in people were being passed through quickly she took her passport out of her sidepocket her heart beating wildly if an alert had come through already it would all be over now brief nod as the guard handed the passport back to the driver in front and elena pulled forward to the kiosk the customs guard fired a curt smile without hardly looking at her as he asked for her passport his only direct stare into the car as he flicked through its pages was towards lorena your daughter yes elena tried to keep her voice flat calm but she swore she could hear a few nervous modulations just in that one word the guard looked again at lorena and then at her and handed the passport back okay thank you elena kept her return smile equally as curt and controlled tried not to let him see the relief and elation that swept through her in that moment she pulled away but not too hurriedly so no alert as yet at least not one that had reached customs but her elation faded quickly in the first minutes of waiting in the queue for a green light fifteen more minutes to go to boarding her name and car registration were now on the computer and an alert could come through at any minute she found her eyes drifting anxiously to the rearview mirror what would they do run out of the customs kiosk to catch up with her or would they just contact the guard ahead controlling boarding with a walkietalkie then the halfhour train journey itself more than enough time for the police to visit gordon hear the tape and alert customs theyd simply phone ahead and stop her as she rolled off the train at calais her mouth was suddenly dry and it was hard to swallow lorena picked up on her consternation were through now no everythings okay her tone was questioning with a hint of plea yes yes everythings okay elena took her eyes from the rearview mirror and let out her breath by necessity shed put lorena on her metal approaching customs but there was no point keeping her on a knifeedge for the next forty minutes with what shed probably suffered with ryall elena didnt want this trip to be yet another nightmare shed just have to weather the brunt of that alone she forced a reassuring smile as she lightly ruffled lorenas hair france here we come im sorry to phone again so late its starting to become a habit the smile in azys voice stopped short of a chuckle it was way too late for open jibing but i thought youd want to know this straightaway michel blinked and rubbed his eyes as he focused on his bedside clock am this time thats okay whats up azy related how hed seen one of the club girls viana get a lift home with georges donatiens she told me she was getting a lift home with a cousin but i was suspicious so i hung about a block up from the club and saw her get into donatiens car what made me suspicious was she was talking earlier to donatiens and it all looked pretty sensitive private they moved away from the bar didnt want to be overheard michel didnt see anything overly worrying at least not to warrant a am call doesnt donatiens talk to the other girls or sometimes give them a lift home yeah he talks to em hes friendly enough alright but its all at arms length he never usually leaves the bar as for him giving them lifts home i don think so he hardly ever hangs around that late azys gravel voice hushed a shade as if he was concerned about listenersin as he came to the crunch point but the problem with this girl viana is that shes also romans girl on the side thats why i called michel sat bolt upright a sharp tingle running up his spine are you sure uh huh as sure as can be they tried to keep it quiet lowkey but ive had my suspicions for a while then a few nights back the last time i called in fact they had a scene in the club and it all came out roman blurts out about her riding his dick like it was going out of style embarrassed the hell out of her the pieces were all tumbling into place for michel so this was the girl roman gave a hard time to the night he finally materialised after venegas disappeared yep one and the same michel fell silent the tingle in his spine had risen to solid tense knot at the back of his neck he massaged the taut muscles with his free hand faint traffic sounds from beyond his window were starker more pronounced through the phone azy was obviously calling from a downtown booth and you think they were headed for her place not his yeah they went east on sherbrooke and her place is in the latin quarter a couple of blocks beyond st denis michel was sure it was some sort of set up but how would it pan out his brain was still too addled with sleep to apply clear thought to it he realized hed left another long pause and brought his attention back to azy you were right to call thanks then with a quick confirmation that the same girl was on the next night before signing off he asked azy to call him again then i want to know her every movement and who she sees but just as important her mood how she acts michel contemplated the phone thoughtfully for a moment after hanging up another early hours call tomorrow but he needed to know straightaway in fact it might already be too late by then michel ruffled his hair brusquely as he ran through likely scenarios some photos of georges and the girl together for sure but would that be enough on its own or would roman want something more torrid graphic more graphic knowing roman hed have to build his case strongly with jeanpaul a setup that left nothing to chance no other possible interpretations which would mean that unless georges was tempted and the camera was concealed theyd have to drug him and once he was drugged michel stood up started pacing the hand was back quickly at his head but now clutching lightly in exasperation as he ruffled but would roman be bold enough to take advantage while georges was drugged and take him out straightaway with the photos then purely to cover his tail with jeanpaul or would he play by the book and use the photos to get jeanpauls sanction for a hit michel stood by his apartment window looking out the floodlit flank of notre dame was the strongest light outside and made a faint silhouette of his body against the dark room behind that was the problem with roman you never knew option two might be the most sensible but if time was pressing hed take whatever rash action suited him best but it hardly mattered even if roman waited on jeanpauls final nod that would delay things one or two days at most and there was little or nothing michel could do in the meantime anyway hed already hauled georges in on the premise that his life was threatened and held him hours on a technicality georges wouldnt even give him the time of day a second time michel regarded the rough stone walls of notre dame with a wry sour grimace so no fanfare wedding there in a few months time not even a burial there georges family were middleclass and suburban from out in beaconsfield from what michel recalled from his files theyd probably arrange a quiet burial and service for him somewhere out there hed be forgotten quickly by the lacailles michel found his eyes watering slightly unsure for a moment if it was sorrow for georges anger and frustration or the floodlight glare on the basilica walls his hands had unconsciously balled tight at his sides and he took a deep breath as he loosened them tried to ease the tension from his body it felt wrong sitting by when he knew with such certainty that georges was about to die a final condemnation of just how pathetically handtied theyd been throughout with the lacailles but then what could he do what could he do but most important is that you to know ive gone with mrs waldren of my own free will ive not been abducted i phoned mrs waldren only a few nights back and asked for her help to try and see a psychiatric counsellor to know if my concerns with my stepfather are just in my dreams my imagination or whether they might be real counselling which my stepparents and the local social services have refused that is why i asked for mrs waldrens help faint swallow slight hesitation from lorena the sound of a passing car drifted through the small cassette speaker but when wed left my school mrs waldren asked me again if i was sure that i wanted to go ahead with seeing a counsellor if not shed return me straightaway to school i said that i did want to go ahead another brief pause as lorena took fresh breath so i want you all to know that im safe well and in good hands and will remain so i dont want mrs waldren elena to get into trouble for this shes my friend shes helping me and theres nothing to worry about ill be back home safe and well in only two or three days gordon left only a seconds silence before stopping the tape the lead police officer ds barry crowley was slow in breaking his gaze from the recorder an assisting detective to his side had a notepad out but so far had only scrawled two sentences a uniformed constable stood sentry at the lounge door as if wary that gordon might make a sudden break for it and another sat in the car outside probably to start putting through traces on elenas car crowley had announced on introduction that they knew elena had lorena and asked gordon where she was i dont know not here but she left me a tape to play you crowley then asked what car she was driving and after another dont know which crowley seriously doubted by his return glare he sent one constable back to his car gordon heard some radio squawk filter through from outside as he stopped the tape theyd probably have elenas car registration within minutes perhaps saying he didnt know had come across as pointlessly obstructive but then the leeway elena needed might be down to just those few extra minutes crowley was looking at him keenly so if were to believe this tape that shes not been abducted then why the secrecy with you not knowing where your wife is or what car shes driving im aware that the ryalls probably wouldnt share that view theyd want lorena back straightaway particularly mr ryall gordon nodded towards the tape but crowley held his gaze with worn indifference he wouldnt be keen on lorena receiving counselling but lorena desperately needs those two or three days for a few sessions to be put in crowley nodded thoughtfully you seem eager to tell me so it might as well be now why wouldnt mr ryall be keen on lorena receiving counselling whats the supposed problem between him and lorena well uh gordon was caught momentarily offbalance being asked straight out shes afraid that her stepfather might be interfering with her the statement still sounded lame unable to carry the weight of all the connected horrors it mentally ignited even with the pause for emphasis i see crowley pursed his lips and looked down hed in fact heard a part of this already from nicola ryall in one of the few moments hed been able to get any sense from her amidst her panic and screaming to please find her daughter please halfway through his interviews at the school news winged in that a pupil had seen lorena leaving the playground and thought she recognized the woman with her mrs waldren lives up the top of chelborne chine mrs ryall seemed relieved at first at this news at least some mad stranger didnt have her child but then panic quickly set in again as if other connected consequences had suddenly dawned on her crowley asked if she had any idea why mrs waldren might take lorena and shed told him about the two visits from social services with mrs waldren in tow mrs waldren has some crazy misguided notion that theres a problem between my husband and lorena crowley contemplated gordon steadily you said that lorena was afraid something might be happening with her stepfather doesnt she know for sure has the girl said nothing directly in that respect no it was all mainly from her dreams she couldnt be totally sure gordon realized then that crowley had probably heard something already from the ryalls he tried to add ballast so that it didnt come across as so tenuous thats why the recommendation for psychiatric counselling to try and make sure one way or the other i see only in her dreams crowleys tone was vaguely mocking and what did the social services say gordon sighed heavily crowley seemed intent on throwing out the ballast making his explanation not just tenuous but almost laughable the social services worker who interviewed lorena on two occasions along with my wife in fact recommended counselling but her supervisor apparently had other ideas mainly courtesy of mr ryall trapping the officer and my wife by taping their last interview with lorena gordon forced a tight i bet the ryalls didnt tell you that smile crowleys eyes flickered only slightly before recovering he leant forward resting his hands resolutely on his knees but the upshot is that the social services saw no reason finally for lorena to have counselling lorena herself has made no direct accusations its all just in her dreams so in the end your wife decides to take the law into her own hands and abduct the girl gordon shook his head firmly no no it wasnt like that for gods sake youve listened to the tape if lorena didnt want help my wife wouldnt have gordon faltered realizing his voice had raised he was almost shouting crowleys soft dorset brogue had a lulling effect as if this was all just a cosy fireside chat and his appearance pressing forty with fast thinning blonde hair rumpled brown suit which had seen better days made him seem worn tired almost past caring but his sharp pale blue eyes warned of stronger metal beneath and meeting them steadily now it dawned on gordon that the sharp aboutturn with pressure was purposeful crowley was getting the rise out of him he wanted crowley was obviously going to be a stronger adversary than hed first judged but thered be more than enough to raise crowleys hackles over the coming hours no point in going headon with him now gordon tempered his voice well my wife simply wouldnt have taken lorena if it wasnt something the girl wanted thats all thats why the tape was made so that not only was my wife sure of that but you also crowley looked back at the cassette recorder the tape certainly muddied the chances of any clearcut procedural line minutes before arriving to confront gordon waldren his immediate boss inspector turton raised him on the radio to advise that hed just had cameron ryall on the phone ranting and demanding fast and firm action turton had assured that he was taking full personal control of the investigation but privately to crowley he admitted that he had no intention of getting handson unless or until it was clear that the girl had been abducted or was in danger this was going to be an interesting conundrum for turton ryall would no doubt scream that she had been abducted whereas the waldrens supported by lorena on tape would claim that she hadnt the only saving grace was that ryall might be unlikely to scream too hard and push things to a press appeal given that the reason for the girl being taken would also no doubt come out innocent or not some tar was bound to stick and what if the waldrens were right his own daughter was only a couple of years younger than that now the thought made him shudder he decided to give the soft approach one more try i can sympathise completely with whats behind your wife doing this that is if her suspicions are right but if shes wrong just think of what shes putting the ryalls through right now and unfortunately its not our job to judge whether or not her action might be justified regardless shes broken the law and so the quicker we can talk to your wife and sort this all out the better so again i urge you mr waldren to tell us your wifes whereabouts and what car shes driving im sorry its more than my lifes worth i gave my wife my promise in any case i dont know exactly where she is right now which was partly true he wasnt sure if she was still in england or would have crossed to france by now would crowley have already put out an alert if so and elena hadnt yet hit customs thatd probably be the furthest shed get maybe that was what the constable outside was waiting for news on gordon felt suddenly hot a faint film of sweat rising on his forehead he resisted the temptation to check his watch and forced an apologetic smile as he looked towards the window and the intermittent radio squawks from outside still im sure that wont hold you up long from finding out what car shes driving crowley grimaced tightly and looked down for a second he didnt want to just revert again to a hard line so he decided to go inbetween at least it would put gordon waldren on a tight time leash look youve obviously made the tape to argue the case that your wife hasnt abducted lorena to try and keep your wife clear of a jail term for this and while right now that argument might just wash as the hours pass with the ryalls worried sick and screaming for action thats going to quickly fade and attitudes will harden so im going to cut a deal with you mr waldren one that hopefully i can sell to both my superior and the ryalls if your wife can get lorena ryall back by say crowley glanced at his watch midnight tonight ill recommend that charges for abduction not be pursued and that we put this all down to an unfortunate mix up but if not gordon was shaking his head im not sure that my wife will be in touch any time tonight for me to pass on that message even if she might agree to returning lorena straightaway crowley held gordons eyes for a moment he seemed to be sincere at length a reluctant nod okay ill stretch that to am tomorrow eighteen hours from now but already im pushing things to the very limit so try not to let me down if you can sell that to your wife you have my word that ill do everything i can to make it stick my end but after that time im afraid a nationwide alert will go out and your wife will be tracked down as a common criminal gordon closed his eyes for a second and nodded yes okay ill do my best he was trembling from the confrontation it was clear now that after tomorrow morning elena was facing a jail term for this and he was pretty sure already that she couldnt make it back by then well we at least have hopefully reached some understanding on this mr waldren crowley left his direct line number and with a final curt nod left with his assisting detective and the constable manning the door as they pulled away the constable hed left in the car informed him that vehicle registration had two cars listed for the waldrens and ive already eliminated the suzuki jeep parked in their drive which leaves a saab three years old from the registration what do you want me to do crowley eased back in his seat and let out a faint sigh he paused for only a moment ask central to put out an allpoints alert county and nationwide including customs points turtons directive had been to wait until hed visited the waldrens home before putting out an alert just in case they had lorena tucked away in a bedroom crowley felt a stab of guilt lying to gordon waldren but then so was everyone else turton to cameron ryall and no doubt waldren too gordon waldren probably knew exactly where his wife was right now but at least it was only a lowlevel alert for now missing persons instead of abduction and kidnapping turton had advised initial caution and if they apprehended her before tomorrow morning crowley had every intention of keeping his promise about charges not being pressed if he could convince turton and ryall hed said only that hed try his best no more the camera clicked repeatedly as the two naked girls slithered and writhed over georges laid out flat on the bed viana and the other girl a luscious greeneyed blonde escort called eve started at opposite ends viana took him in her mouth while eve licked his nipples then they changed position for a moment before viana slid on top of him eve guiding him slowly home the camera clicked repeatedly and roman found himself getting excited looking on from the back of the room despite the fact that it was viana the drug was working as per the recommendation georges could still hold an erection in the same way as a sleeping man having a wet dream but was out cold would remember nothing roman was probably getting more sensation from just watching than anything georges might be enjoying the photographer had to set up some of the shots placing georgess hands on vianas and then eves hips as they rode him pulling his eyelids open for some shots so that it looked like he was staring up at them for the rest he made do either with profiles or where it might look like georges eyes were closed in abandon viana had taken off her face mask and at romans instruction the photographer was careful to keep her just in profile her bruised side concealed as they finished something in the way roman surveyed georges body on the bed as if gloating in the control he had over him made viana ask what he planned to do with georges you promised that you wouldnt harm him i wouldnt have had anything to do with this if i thought you were you said that it was just to make the cut clean with simone thats right thats right its just a spoiler cause hes doing the dirty on simone but i dont remember saying nothing about not harming him that teasing mocking smile which now she knew so well then his face suddenly became deadpan stern he reached out and lightly pinched her cheek her bruised side dont worry your head none about what im going to do with him whatever it is it aint going to happen here well have him dressed and out of your place in no time one last pinch harder which made her gasp in pain you did good thats all you need to think about the sign flashed by bethune km a ballad in french played on the radio the sound on low elena would turn it up when songs came on in english particularly ones lorena recognized and liked elena looked thoughtfully towards lorena theyd stealthily avoided the subject so far their conversation had been light incidental but elena found her thoughts turning to it more and more particularly in the silent lulls you know if you did want to say anything more about what happened with mr ryall were away from there now you dont have to worry any more about what you say because hes hovering in the next room elena watched lorenas expression keenly weak sunlight flickered through the trees lorenas lightbrown hair intermittently strobelit silver translucent lorena bit lightly at her bottom lip pausing for a second i was nervous in the interviews yes thinking about what hed say or do afterwards but that wasnt why i said nothing then she shook her head i just couldnt remember being awake when anything happened not for sure at least its okay you dont need to explain watching lorenas small face tense grapple for images that were either out of reach or pushed there by her psyche for her own protection elena wished she hadnt asked but lorena simply shook her head again she appeared too wrappedup in her own thoughts to take heed it seemed so real him touching me his voice in my ear i imagined i could almost feel his breath against my cheek but then when i awoke in the morning i just couldnt remember another time that i was awake in the night and the dreams too had seemed so real you remember lorena looked directly at elena yes i remember elenas throat tightened how could she forget lorenas recurring nightmare was that she was back in the sewers and the waters were rapidly rising when she couldnt raise the manhole cover to get free and was fast drowning shed awake screaming her body bathed in sweat elena recalled two such nights at the cerneit orphanage during lorenas ten months there after her sewer days hugging lorena tight and reassuring her that she was no longer in the sewers she was safe and there were apparently many more nights with similar nightmares when elena wasnt present one of the cerneit wardens had voiced concerns about lorenas state of mind when after a nightmare lorena had pressed whether the warden was sure that she hadnt sneaked off in the night back to the sewers maybe to look for patrika patrika was her closest friend from the sewers whod drowned one night when the waters rose the main event which they suspected had triggered the nightmares the line between the dreams and reality had often been thin in lorenas mind and perhaps lorena was flagging that now because she was worried that with all the trouble elena was going to it might all end up as nothing any suspicions of ryall unfounded all of it just in her dreams elena felt suddenly guilty that wasnt why shed asked she reached out a hand to touch lorenas shoulder it doesnt matterthats what the psychiatrist is meant to sort out if nothing is happening at least then youll know for sure one way or the other elena pushed a smile that hopefully rose above her uncertainty as she looked across and hopefully be able to sleep easy okay i understand but from the faint shadows that lingered in lorenas face as she took her eyes from elena to look stolidly at the road ahead elena wondered if she did a couple of songs later all saints never ever came on the radio and elena turned it up a notch noticing after a moment lorena hum along at intervals the shadows receding but elenas guilt and uncertainty remained shed brought up the subject because between their lightweight inconsequential conversation and the awkward lulls it felt almost as if they were purposefully tiptoeing around the issue it was starting to rise as an awkward barrier between them but she wondered if part of her had pressed for her own ends shed been tonguetied with nerves practically throughout the euroshuttle crossing and lorena had done most of the talking then with the relief of getting clear on the open road in france in contrast shed been more animated taking over the conversation until they passed a police car travelling in the opposite direction a reminder that they were still far from home and dry an alert could be out with the french police at any moment theyd passed only one more police car since but again it made her pulse race tripletime and put her stomach in knots and perhaps she was hoping for a quick admission from lorena so that the nightmare could end here and now she wasnt sure she could face many more hours of this assault on her nervous system a light trembling constantly with her that rose spasmodically to an intense hot rush her hands at times shaking so hard on the steering wheel that the muscles in her arms ached but even if there had been a sudden admission and shed stopped the car and put it on tape it probably wouldnt have helped shed no doubt have still needed it taped under the guidance of a psychiatrist for it to hold up with social services and what now if those sessions revealed nothing conclusive either way or worse still they leaned towards the likelihood that ryall was molesting lorena but without enough to support that claim with social services despite her frayed nerves at least getting lorena away was an adventure a hopeful escape to freedom how on earth would she be able to return her to the ryalls if she knew with all certainty what fate awaited her the first real break in the case came through just after pm within an hour of returning from interviewing gordon waldren crowley had a team of five working on and off tracking down elena waldren and lorena in addition to an allpoints police and customs alert theyd traced all cashcards and creditcards in her name and news finally came in that one of her cash cards had been used fifty minutes beforehand in france crowley went through immediately to inspector turtons office where turton asked breathlessly at a credite lyonnaise branch in bonneval about fifty miles southwest of paris where does it look like shes headed at present shes on a direct line for the southwest coast bordeaux or biarritz crowley shrugged but she could easily veer off sharp and head to brittany or direct south to provence or even spain okay turton brooded only for a second contact interpol and ask them to put out an alert for her and her car with special emphasis on the areas you think she might now be travelling through will do crowley nodded summarily and headed back into the harried activity of the squad room hectic at the best of times the waldren case had added an edge of urgency it wasnt often they got a child abduction particularly not one that started to blaze a trail across europe he had to look up the interpol number the last time hed contacted them had been over eight months ago as it started ringing crowley glanced at his watch forty minutes or so to process everything through interpol and then elena waldren would be hunted down in earnest a britishplated car offseason it probably wouldnt take that long the bonus would come if she used her credit card to pay for a meal or a hotel that night either way crowley was confident that within hours elena waldren would be apprehended eighteen jeanpaul swam with more vigour than in his regular prebreakfast sessions not faster but with more determined cutting strokes as if he might somehow thrash away the lethargy and pentup frustration tyingup his muscles and joints roman had interrupted his normal time for a swim was hot on his doorstep at first light with news on donatiens eagerly waving a brown envelope in his right hand they spent a sober half hour over breakfast while roman went through the details and laid out the photos in the envelope before him last night donatiens had slid himself away in a private corner with this club girl viana for quite some time roman used the opportunity to get his guy into donatiens apartment to place some bugs and while there he did a search and look what he found tucked away in a drawer while jeanpaul was still frantically making some semblance of the tangle of naked bodies roman went on to tell him that donatiens gave the same girl a lift home didnt leave her place for over two hours jeanpaul picked sparsely at his breakfast the bodyblow of the photos and the news on georges had suddenly taken his appetite their meeting ended soon after with him begging a few hours in which to make his final decision though he could see from the keenness in romans eyes that only one decision was expected now there was little room to manoeuvre he would have taken his swim then immerse and hopefully swill away all his problems ease some of the sudden aching burden from his shoulders but his meeting with simone was only twentyfive minutes away and he needed every second of that time if not more to get clear in his mind how on earth he would present all of this to her he paced agitatedly fuelled by two more fresh coffees for most of that time spinning possible scenarios around but when she arrived most of it went straight out the window hed planned to broach the subject immediately but shed clearly arrived on some sort of mission with something pressing to get off her chest so he let her speak first and meanwhile continued gathering his thoughts he hadnt intended to actually show her the photos his initial plan was just to say that he had strong reliable information that georges was seeing another girl and combined with their problem with him over questioning by the rcmp that hed very obviously lied about she should steer clear of him until they decided what to do but as simone ran through georges fresh account of events that fateful night with roman and leduc and why supposedly hed said nothing then or since his anger began to grow uncontrollably very obviously georges somehow realized they were on to him about the club girl so hed primed simone to throw in this ridiculous story at the last hour to try and save his neck georges didnt even have the courage of conviction to face him personally hed chosen to hide behind his daughters skirt he cut in halfway through and voiced his thoughts in a fierce volley and within minutes they were arguing no she didnt accept it georges wouldnt do that its just something made up by roman because he knew georges was going to come clean i dont think so i had my doubts too initially when roman claimed something was going on with this girl but now hes brought me proof proof proof what proof and as he hesitated realizing he didnt want to cause her the pain of actually seeing the photos she sensed the advantage sneering and what girl is this supposed to be one of the girls from the sherbrooke club oh right right one of romans pet harem slipped some money to say shes got a thing going with georges and youre ready to just accept it no no of course not georges always feared that when it came to the crunch youd take romans side and he was right thats why he was so nervous about telling you this all along he recalled then just closing his eyes and holding up one hand willing her to stop as his anger bubbled over though it wasnt directed at her more at the way georges had her wrapped so much in his control but she was on automatic unable to stop now that georges had wound her up and sent her in romans playing both you and georges for mugs has been for a while but youre just to blind to he flung the photos across the table in that moment flipped open the envelope and just emptied them out from a foot up a halfdozen of the twenty falling facedown then scrunched his eyes tight shut again and shook his head im sorry so sorry jeanpaul rested one elbow against the pool edge as he came to the end of his third lap his laboured breath showing in the humid air across the courtyard through the glass the breath and body heat of the stable horses rose in the cold morning air as if competing with the vapours drifting from the pools heatexchange vents he remembered his father crossing the courtyard the year before he died one cold february morning his father and lillian had moved into the separate wing at the end of the courtyard which jeanpauls growing family had previously occupied when raphael was born and simone was just seven seeing his need for space as greater than his own security became more of an issue with the advent of their battle with the cacchiones and so the pool block and gymnasium were added the house they felt was too vulnerable with the courtyard open to their rear gardens in turn open to the st lawrence only two hundred yards away the pool block squared it off made it more of a compound not that any of that made a difference pascal was picked off leaving a rue st gabriel restaurant before the pool block was even finished jeanpaul had been in the main dining room looking out when his father ventured out for the first time after pascals funeral shoulders sagged breath heavy on the air as he trudged across the courtyard snow raising only a weak acknowledging hand to the builders finishing off the pool block jeanpaul should have known then that his father might not have long to live he looked to have aged ten years in the past ten days defeated all spirit gone but he could have done with his fathers sage yearsworn advice now he felt so alone with the decision he now faced undoubtedly the toughest call hed ever had to make he regretted immediately showing simone the photos even though in the heat of the moment there appeared little other solution her eyes darted uncomprehendingly for a long moment before she finally looked back up again he could see clearly the hatred aimed at him beyond the hurt anger and her fast welling tears he reached out a hand to her there was so much else he wanted to say in that moment but all that came out was another weak sorry as she flinched back from his touch turned and stormed from the room he knew that he risked losing his daughter over this not the complete loss his father and the family had suffered with pascal but with simone losing all love for him and its place taken by nothing but recrimination it would be like a death of sorts jeanpaul didnt think he could face that but he just couldnt see any other possible choice crowley leapt across the squad room as one of his team of five dc denny hobbs raised one hand frantically waving more news just in cash card used again hobbs cradled phone tight in by his shoulder as he covered the mouthpiece with one hand where a small town called montrichard banque national du paris cash machine this time hobbs lifted his hand back off the mouthpiece and started scrawling with his pen yeah yeah okay thanks he hung up tore the top paper from his pad and handed it to crowley fifteenhundred francs taken out at french time and the street location of the machine the second breakthrough in only fifteen minutes the first had been that an elena waldren and child had been ticketed through to catch the pm euroshuttle crowley went back to his desk and leafed again through the routiers guide that hed pored over on and off for the past hour trying to work out the likely pace and direction of elena waldrens journey montrichard population km southwest of paris pm dark for over three hours the next town loches not much larger and almost twenty miles away and getting late to check into a hotel it was worth a try at least no other leads or sightings of her car as yet he went over to sally the only one of his team with reasonable french and asked her to raise the gendarmerie at montrichard get the number from interpol or the main national gendarmerie number in paris sally pushed a prim smile and clutched lightly at her hair as she tapped and brought up a fresh screen on her pc scrolled down and dialled out shed been under more pressure and harried than most of his team had born the brunt of their liaison with interpol and putting out a french police alert on waldren introductory burst in french and then a more generous smile from sally oui oui angleterre she looked back at crowley okay ive got them what do you want to know crowley got her to ask how many hotels there were in town five four in and around the centre one just a kilometre outside then which hotels were closest to the banque national du paris on rue petupliers the richault was the closest only thirty yards away on the same road then the chateauville a hundred and fifty metres around the corner crowley got sally to explain their current situation with elena waldren interpol had already been advised and a french national police search was out for her sally quoted the interpol reference number shed been given and the liaising inspector at lyon central if they wished for verification then crowley got to what he wanted two or three gendarmes or whatever they could spare to visit both the richault and the chateauville to check for elena waldren or her car crowley had to wait patiently while sally phonetically spelt out the name and car registration the other three hotels just a check by phone with their receptions would suffice a last flurry of translation tennis which at one point appeared to overstrain sallys vocabulary grasp and she conveyed to crowley that captain lacombe head of station assured that he would take personal charge of the situation and do all he could to assist hell dispatch some men straightaway crowley passed on descriptions of elena and the girl in case elena had registered under a false name and they waited the return call came through seventyeight minutes later lacombes men descended on montichards hotels as if they were searching for one of frances most wanted criminals montrichard rarely got foreign or interpol enquiries six years since the last if lacombe remembered right and he was eager to prove that the montrichard gendarmerie was nothing if not efficient he visited the richault himself assisted by two gendarmes sent a team of two simultaneously to the chateauville and one man to each of the other three hotels emptying all but two men from the gendarmerie lacombe personally saw and via the receptionist questioned the only two british residents at the richault a single man and a family of four his other men ran through the same exercise at the remaining four hotels seven british registrations but only one close to the description passed on of a fortysomething mother and a child of ten but the interviewing gendarme who had sight of them said that the mother was blonde no more than metre and was quite plump probably close to kilos crowley did some quick mental arithmetic four inches shorter and twentypounds heavier than elena waldren even if she had dyed her hair lacombe had liaised with all his other men while still at the richault and as a precaution had asked for the passports of all british guests to be photocopied almost as an afterthought crowley asked where the two british registrations at the richault were from a clue is the last page of their passports emergency contact addresses its okay i know from my interview notes where theyre from lacombe proudly announced back through sally the family of four are from maidstone in kent and the man on his own is from poole dorset poole a tingle ran through crowley practically on the waldrens doorstep what age is the man on his own fortyfive maybe fifty crowley was pretty sure he knew what had happened the waldrens had got a friend to run decoy with her cash card he thought of sending lacombe back to question him but there was little point he probably wouldnt admit it or give any clue to where shed gone even if they had been stupid enough to tell him and using someone elses cash card with consent was no crime but at least crowley had a clearer view now on where shed probably headed three or four main options as far as he could see he made use of lacombes eagerness to ensure that elena waldren hadnt continued on to the next town loches by having him check by phone with their hotels also and when lacombe phoned back twentyfive minutes later with a blank there also he asked sally to recontact interpol to urge them to concentrate their focus on border posts with belgium germany and switzerland and paris airports orly and charles de gaulle elena was frantic within half an hour of waiting at the airport gordons elaborate plans might have worked the train journey for the last stretch so that her car wasnt visible on the road for too long the decoy run with her cashcard if it wasnt for their flight being delayed by almost two hours more than enough time for the police to work out possible alternatives and start circling in on her she heard the news first at the checkin desk and it made her head spin walking away she felt nauseous faint as if her legs could hardly carry her the blaring airport tannoy echoed and reverberated inside her head made it all the worse she feared she was going to blackout at any second and eased herself down at the first bank of seats only twenty paces from the checkin lorena asked if she was okay yes im fine just tired from driving and all the rush elena didnt want to let on how frightened she was her nerves at breaking point each police car theyd passed the ticket guard on the train another man not far behind who looked from side to side seemed to be observing everyone as he walked down the aisle each incident had raised her nerves another notch and now ive just heard that weve got a bit of a wait for our flight lets grab a coffee she smiled and went to take lorenas hand then realized that her own shaking hand would give away her panic so in the end she just draped her arm over lorenas shoulder but her hands were shaking openly on her coffee cup and seeing the concern in lorenas eyes she felt she had to explain im worried that the people wholl have been looking for you probably now for the past few hours might be able to catch up and find us because of this delay now with our flight elena kept her voice low in case anyone nearby might overhear but as an extra caution said people instead of police but we left that tape to tell them that there was nothing to worry about i was okay elena shook her head and smiled the naivete of children if only she could take the same simplistic view to dampen the combinedharvester of nerves churning her stomach i know but i think theyll still come looking for you for us lorenas eyebrows knitted but even if they find us nothing will happen to you will it well im not so elenas eyes flickered past lorenas shoulder to a uniformed policeman shifting into view at the back of the room going over to talk to a man in a grey suit with a walkietalkie in hand they seemed to be paying little attention to anyone in the coffee area but still elena felt uncomfortable with them so close im more concerned though about you she reached over and gently patted lorenas hand come on lets go they spent the next twenty minutes browsing in airport shops picking up a walkman and two tapes and a harry potter from a section with english books to keep lorena occupied during the flight or was it equally for herself so that she didnt have to brave out any more awkward questions from lorena where are we going how long will it take how long will we stay there two or three days it seems a long way to go just for that lorena was animated excited to her this trip was an adventure whereas elena felt like a condemned prisoner too occupied with her impending doom to take up her last moments with idle chat at least she felt less conspicuous rummaging in the back of airport shops away from open concourses and the view of everybody but still the occasional policeman or airport security guard would pass and make elenas heart leap and as they finally came back out into the main throng of activity elenas nerves were back to hammering intensity more policemen security men with walkietalkies customs officials antiterrorist guards with submachine guns just passing the occasional policeman every forty minutes or so on the way to the airport had put her nerves on edge now she was surrounded by them having to pass two whole hours trapped here was elenas worst nightmare come true she glanced at her watch still one hour and eighteen minutes to go the question was whether to go through customs now and wait out the remaining time airside or only go through at the last moment if any alert had come through thats where the main check would be the more she waited the more the chances of something coming through but if she went through early and the alert came through afterwards would her name then be down so that she was just a sitting duck trapped airside for them stop upon boarding its okay dont worry im sure everything will be alright lorena reached out and slipped her hand into hers lightly clasping thanks youre probably right oh god she bit at her lip suddenly guilty she should be the one consoling reassuring but it suddenly struck her that this tenyear old girl had practically seen it all abandonment at only three shuffled from orphanage to hellhole orphanage where the mad and infirm were strapped to cots and simply left to cry and scream the nights away with often only death finally bringing silence her nightmare sewer days and seeing more of her friends die and now trying to unscramble the nightmare images in her mind to know if her stepfather was molesting her or not she was old beyond her years probably far tougher far better equipped to deal with this than elena would ever be elena dragged lorena into a gift shop to grab a moments more clear thought away from the hustlebustle before finally deciding to go through customs straightaway not just because she felt she should be putting on a braver face for lorena but that with her growing panic if she waited any longer she might not be able to face going through at all okay lets go she gave lorenas hand a reassuring squeeze though it was more for herself but within minutes in the customs queue she was having second thoughts she was shaking heavily and her legs were weak again the airport announcements back echoing dizzily she could hardly understand a word for all she knew it could be rallying all guards to immediately apprehend her and at that moment she noticed the plainclothed guard with earpiece and walkietalkie a few yards behind the three customs desks ahead watching hawkishly each person that went through but it was too late to leave the queue and turn back eight or ten people now behind them theyd be spotted by the guard ahead singled out and so she just continued shuffling numbly forward like a condemned person almost certain now that there would be no last minute reprieve simone drove blindly for the first twenty minutes the passing buildings and oncoming traffic blurred with her streaming teams she was headed downtown but with no idea where she wanted to go certainly not to the office shed already begged the morning off with an excuse and the way she felt shed probably take the afternoon off as well she didnt want to see or speak to anyone or even be near people for a while so decided in the end to head for mount royal park she wound her way to the far side of the hillside park and pulled into the parking for the lookouts over east montreal and towards the north in the summer there would always be two or three coaches and several cars but now midweek and barely out of winter it was deserted all but for two cars and an elderly couple at the last telescope in line simone purposely parked furthest away from them she took deep breaths trying to claw back some composure but her anger still burned redraw and her eyes kept filling she could barely pick out any detail from the blurry landscape ahead the photos and the deception had been bad enough but what hurt all the more what she could never forgive georges for was how hed played her for such a patsy with her father she felt foolish used it made the betrayal far more bitter the elderly couple were ambling back to their car so she decided to get out she wiped back her tears and walked across to the rail edge looking out there was faint spring warmth in the air from the midmorning sun but at the rail a biting wind hit her making her eyes water again snow had all but gone from the city and surrounds only patches of white could be seen in the distance towards the totally white laurentide mountain range on the horizon she took a deep breath the isolation was what she wanted to clear her head but the laurentides suddenly reminded her of skiing with georges and the images on the photos were quickly back searing through she needed a drink or three she didnt want to bump into anyone she knew so picked out a bar at random on her way through outremont she started with a couple of brandy collins but with the effects slow in washing through she went on to tequilas two quick shots later and she felt the first glow her senses mellowing swimming pleasantly but she started to feel selfconscious drinking alone among strangers a few eyes drifting her way and wondering why she was knocking them back so quickly she headed for thursdays it was more of an evening haunt with her crowd she wouldnt bump into any friends but at least the barman miguel would be company and good for some advice she went back onto brandy collins was halfway through the first as she looked up thoughtfully and asked him could you go for someone like me miguel yes i i suppose so he was cautious given the possible connotations come on to a mob girl one week end up in the river the next i mean she toyed with her swizzle stick do you find me attractive yes of course youre a real pretty girl but youve already got someone georges ive got strict rules about things like that not necessarily true hed fooled around with a couple of married women but he thought it was the right thing to say would keep him clear of the river yeah sure she pulled a face and looked down into her drink shame hes not got the same rule book they were silent for a second miguel could see that shed been drinking heavily but her maudlin mood was the main signal that she wanted him to ask something wrong yeah she slowly nodded and pushed a rueful smile i just found out that georges has been fooling around cheating on me im sorry to hear that he reached out and lightly touched her arm the closest with consolation he dared get hes a fool thats all i can say if you were my girl well for sure i wouldnt treat you like that he said this with conviction another step away from the river thanks simone patted miguels hand for a second before it was pulled away thats her mobile started ringing thats nice of you to say so miguel broke away with a pained smile and went to serve some customers at the far end of the bar she looked at the display georges office number shed promised to phone him midday to let him know how it went pm now obviously he was curious and wondering why she hadnt called let him stew she let it ring out then as soon as it had stopped she switched it off miguel started to get busy with the lunchtime crowd so she decided to leave she didnt feel like continuing about her problems with others close and besides what else was there to say she knocked back her brandy collins and lifted one hand to miguel who volleyed take care now simone over the fresh people he was serving the same pained smile he was concerned about her she ambled down rue st catherine blindly window shopping her thoughts were still elsewhere then dived into eatons shopping centre but some of the shops reminded her of days out with georges the boutique where on impulse hed bought her a dress she liked the jewellers for her engagement ring the tears were quickly back again and she started to feel uncomfortable with so many people milling close some of them looking at her curiously she headed out to the street again she was far too drunk to drive so hailed a cab to the latin quarter it should be quieter there she dived into an italian restaurant at the start of rue st denis maybe shed feel better if she ate something but could manage only three mouthfuls of lasagne before pushing it away though she made good work of the half carafe of red shed ordered with it finishing it all two calls had come through to her mobile message board since shed left thursdays she played them as she ambled away from the restaurant the first was her father im sorry everything went the way it did earlier but i dont want things just left on that note call me back as soon as you can the second was georges i tried to get you an hour ago but it didnt answer please if you have news on how it went im getting frantic here simone you know how important it his wheedling tone pushed her over the edge she smashed her mobile against a lamppost to one side before the message had finished then gave it three sharp stomps with her right heel fragments of plastic and circuit board splayed across the pavement a waiter from a vietnamese restaurant to one side was staring at her and a group of three further down who werent quite in focus she stepped back as if to detach herself from the mess but her legs felt suddenly weak unsteady and she buckled slightly before righting herself she fixed her gaze finally on a labbatts sign twenty yards away and headed for it she had enough of her senses left to know that she probably wouldnt make it much further than that her hands were still shaking with rage as they wrapped around her glass another brandy collins she closed her eyes as she took the first few slugs bastard bastard bastard and as she opened them again she noticed for the first time the guy looking over from the end of the bar late twenties ponytail black tshirt cut high on his shoulders totally inappropriate for the weather but it showed off his biceps and the small tattoo high on his right arm why was it men had some homing device to pick out drunken women who might be easy targets she looked away tried not to encourage him though maybe thats what she should be doing pick up some hunk and get him to fuck her stupid then send georges the photos let him see how it felt it put the first smile of the day on her face but a sudden worry one thing she hadnt thought of before gripped her then her fathers uncharacteristic anger as hed bit back about georges his comment about roman providing proof no doubt the photos and their concern about georges giving information to the rcmp as much as she despised what georges had done and probably never wanted to see him again that was a far stretch from wanting to see him in any way harmed she reached to her pocket then remembered she no longer had her mobile she paid and made her way uncertainly out of the bar looking for the first phone booth theyve got her sally beckoned crowley excitedly and covered the phone mouthpiece with her other hand where paris orly airport they stopped her at customs just ten minutes ago she lifted her hand free and turned her attention back to the phone oui oui daccord yes i see well wait on your call back then she let out a tired breath as she hung up theyre just getting someone to question her officially theyve got a fair few english speakers at customs but apparently they had to wait on a national police officer with sufficient rank and good enough english for the purpose and shes got the girl with her sounds like it from their description girl with long brown hair of ten or eleven great crowley clutched the air by his shoulder into a fist he decided to use the lull to phone turton whod called just twenty minutes before to complain that hed had ryall on grilling him again turton agreed that it was good news i didnt even mention the montrichard hotels fiasco when he called just said that we had some good leads in from france and were confident that shed be apprehended soon yes well at least finally looks like were he faltered across the room sally had answered her phone again her face rapidly clouded she glared towards him and waved urgently were there but uh perhaps best not to say anything to ryall until we have the interview confirmation through were waiting on that now yes should be no more than ten or fifteen minutes sallys expression told him hed need that time to unravel whatever this new problem was he hung up and darted across what now sally exhaled heavily as she dropped the bombshell close call but not her the womans name was walden not waldren janet walden apparently the alert went out just on the surname the customs officer misread it on the passport and everything trickled down wrong from there until the police officer went to interview her in the detention room middle name sally glanced at her notes eileen oh and the girl with her is twelve not ten crowley grimaced tightly it wasnt her this time it was an error rather than a deliberate foil but he was starting to develop a healthy respect for elena waldren obviously she hadnt just leapt for the first border post and airport options shed planned things through he went back to his maps and tried to put himself in her position if hed had a false trail blazed through the middle of france where in reality would he have headed hed better come up with at least some sensible suggestions before he phoned turton back the two men in the black econoline held eighty yards back from the st laurent bar practically the last clear view that could be had of its entrance a discreet distance with the vans tinted windows adding an extra discretion the man in the passenger seat was on his mobile theyve been inside almost two hours now still hang on they cant be much longer and this might be the best shot well get yeah okay will do wait till hes heading home or at least the two of them are parted and well clear of each other then make your move and make sure you grab monsieur d not the friend a lighter tone to the voice but falling short of a chuckle the line was digital and hopefully secure but still he was careful not to say donatiens name not much chance of that weve got the photo right in front of us and make sure youre not seen dont worry well have skimasks on and well pick a quiet spot and well have the hood over his head before he has a chance to even turn around nineteen eight beers and half a bottle of kentucky bourbon between them and theyd put half of georges and the worlds problems to rights but still hadnt come up with any answer to his dilemma with jeanpaul georges stared miserably into his tumbler and rattled his ice for gods sake why doesnt she call perhaps she still will mike landry knew it sounded lame at this stage according to georges she was meant to call him over six hours ago but mike had already spun through most of the options perhaps she got tied up at work perhaps things got delayed and she wasnt able to see her father till later perhaps she tried to get hold of him and missed him perhaps perhaps perhaps but georges was adamant no shed have made sure to get hold of him one way or the other she knew how important this was to him something was wrong no i dont think shell call now georges chewed at his bottom lip after trying her countless times late afternoon he phoned mike landry landry was an old friend from university and theyd also worked together at banque du quebec the only person he could think of turning to with this dilemma they arranged to meet at pm at the gipsy one of the new wave of bars on st laurent i think i was right about last night being some sort of set up cant you remember anything that happened after blacking out at this girls place almost nothing until i was in the foyer back at my place with the lobby guard fishing through my pockets for my keys the guard informed him that a taxi had dropped him off just ten minutes beforehand no the taxi driver hadnt said where hed been picked up from dont you know yourself and a gap of almost two hours lost in between yeah but as i said all i can recall are hazy fragments viana naked on top of him but then the feel of someone elses slow tongue licking him someone lower down just out of view and a mans voice yeah thats it that position hold it for a second then nothing until the foyer but it all had a dreamlike surreal quality and when he fell asleep later in his own bed it was simone naked on top of him writhing but the heat and sweat from her body suddenly became leducs blood an expanding pool spreading across his stomach his thighs and it was romans voice from the side taunting yeah thats it you do it you kill him for me he awoke abruptly and made strong coffee hed had barely three hours sleep and his nerves were ragged as hed told mike after going through everything over their first drinks he just couldnt be sure now whether the earlier images were real or just another dream he shook his head then as the hours passed with still no call from simone thats when i began to fear the worst about last night landry pulled a tight grimace as he looked at his friend georges hands were shaking his eyes bloodshot and unfocused from drink and lack of sleep he was a wreck but theyd already raked over everything twice over and now there was little for him to offer as encouragement or sound advice georges was practically beyond consolation when georges had first aired the problem landry had felt uncomfortable with the burden and commented flippantly i thought it must be something pretty serious for you to phone me out of the blue but it quickly went the wrong way descended into heated banter well just that i havent heard from you for over three months hed been busy busy whens the last time you saw your parents i was planning to go out and see them this weekend or next as soon as this all blew over yeah but whens the last time christmastime georges closed his eyes solemnly accepting the point early on in his relationship with simone when hed been lauding jeanpaul landry had voiced that he should be careful not to see jeanpaul as a surrogate father a largerthanlife figure to make up for his stepfathers shortcomings and ups and downs over the years georges bit back that it wasnt all oneway things hadnt been made any easier with his stepfather in turn trying to dress down jeanpaul because of his criminal background and to my old chums at banque du quebec i was suddenly a total nogo area they darent be seen near me in case word got around that they were associating with a supposed moneylaunderer always one eye on that next promotion huh it was only you that didnt give a shit because we went all the way back to university landry agreed that that was the case with a lot of them but not everyone people like gerry marchant for instance he couldnt have given a shit either in fact he found the whole thing quite glamorous but you put up the barriers just as much georges as soon as you got in deep with the lacailles georges gripped landrys hand tight on the bar counter at that moment look this isnt just about social ostracising because im worried about being cast out of the lacailles precious golden circle im afraid for my life mike but if you dont want to help georges got up from his barstool but landry clutched at his shoulder sitting him back down yes of course he wanted to help what were friends for just that it would be nice to see you now and then outside of the latest hot problem but now there was little help landry could offer and few consoling words beyond maybe he was jumping to conclusions and maybe shed still call he felt redundant merely along for the ride while georges steadily drowned and spilled his woes no more use than a confessional priest except that instead of three hail marys he was telling georges that perhaps hed drunk enough and should think of heading home a few hours rest and hed probably feel better get a clearer view on it all come on lets get you out of here georges wasnt so drunk that he needed support but he definitely needed encouragement from his bar stool with his morose state and a finger of bourbon still in his glass he looked reluctant to leave he finally knocked it back as landry paid and they headed out the two men in the econoline saw them as soon as they were a yard beyond the giant gypsy dancing figures that marked the bars entrance okay which way they headed looks like towards donatiens car theyd agreed at the outset that a good spot to snatch donatiens would be the side street where hed parked it was quiet not much activity the friend was parked further up on the opposite side of st laurent shit looks like the friends staying with him theyre stopping maybe theyre going to split up now oh great choose now to give the fucking gettysburg address the fresh air on st laurent had cleared landrys thoughts a bit i think you should tell jeanpaul everything bare all to him in the same way that you have to me yeah sure im here to rat on your brother because maybe youre daughter didnt put the point across properly oh and whatever happened with that club girl last night if anything i dont remember a thing i was drugged and out of it i know but its probably your only chance and maybe something in your account will strike a chord throw some doubt on whatever romans spun about it all enough at least for jeanpaul to hold back until hes checked it out georges met landrys gaze evenly he was serious so when am i meant to spill all of this to jeanpaul come on come on move it not tonight youre in no fit shape and besides simone might still call and clear up the whole mess still trying to sell the hope of her calling or maybe meanwhile youll get hold of her if not go see him first thing tomorrow morning a keening wind along st laurent stung georges face made his eyes water landry was practically the only thing in focus among a blur of cafe signs streetlights and the streaming taillights of passing cars he started shaking heavily though he wasnt sure if it was with cold or exhaustion and nerves only half a day with simones back perhaps turned to him and he felt so alone deserted at least the drink helped numb the pain a little he could feel its effect more now with the cold air and swayed uncertainly in the wind maybe youre right landry reached towards him look i dont think you should be driving let me run you home georges put one foot back steadying himself before the hand connected what you youre almost as bad as me landry shrugged as georges smiled incredulously at him not exactly true georges had drunk at least three to his two hed felt it his duty to keep a clear head so that he could throw an incisive light on georges problem not that it had helped then at least grab a cab no no georges held one hand up i leave my lexus in that side street by midnight the wheels and the radio will be gone if not the whole car maybe thatd be the best thing thrown in a cell for the night for drunk driving safest place for me he smiled crookedly and swallowed down the tailend of a belch holding up his hand again at landrys concerned expression dont worry ill take it easy cant be more than a dozen blocks thats it come on they watched the friend step back a few more words spoken between them then with a parting half salute the friend turned to cross st laurent donatiens continued on the same side towards the turning thirty yards away where hed parked the driver fired up the engine and looked in his wing mirror two cars passing then a gap but the next car was approaching fast he waited for it to pass donatiens was pacing briskly only eight yards from the turning as they pulled out their every move from this point in had been prechoreographed the passenger went into the back of the van and picked up a skimask and a black cloth hood he slipped on the skimask and crouched expectantly by the vans back doors ready for the signal to jump out the driver moved slowly for the first ten yards until donatiens turned into the side street then he sped up the last distance he pulled over to the centre line for the leftturn and waited for a passing car but just as he started to turn had edged forward a yard a parked car five down pulled out it beeped and they stood uncertainly nose to nose for a moment before it swung lazily around him shit the driver clutched the wheel hard as he finally made the turn donatiens friend further up had looked around briefly but didnt seem to dwell on them he was already at his car had the door half open to get in donatiens hadnt looked round but the problem was that he had gained eight or nine yards meanwhile theyd agreed that the best time to grab him was just before he got in his car but now he was only yards from it bleeping it open the driver accelerated hard down the street his pulse racing as donatiens reached out opening his car door the driver kept in close to the parked cars hoping that at the last minute donatiens might push the door back and stay pinned tight by his car until theyd passed afraid of getting his door creamed theyd brake sharp just past swing the back doors open and but donatiens went for the second option of jumping in swiftly and shutting the door before they reached him the driver slowed and finally screeched to a halt ten yards past his breath falling hard with the adrenalin rush of the near miss what now skimask pressed anxiously through the back window he saw donatiens starting up but the driver stayed frozen with indecision a second more before suddenly slamming the van into reverse we block him in duck down out of sight the van sped back and stopped sharp with its back four feet beyond donatiens front bumper the driver watched in his wing mirror donatiens quickly check if there was enough room behind to reverse and still swing out there wasnt only two or three feet leeway at most donatiens lips pursed tight as he pressed his horn a curtain pulled back briefly from a window four houses along but little other attention drawn nobody out walking on the sidestreet and the few passing on st laurent thirty yards behind didnt look over a trickle of sweat ran down the drivers forehead hold tight hold tight the horn blared again and donatiens head came out of the window come on shift it skimask hissed from behind yeah come on lets get out of here hell wake half the fucking neighbourhood just a second more just keep out of sight the curtain four along stayed still and no other movement that the driver could see but he was sweating profusely his nerves close to bursting point and he was ready to accelerate hard away as soon as the next beep sounded he saw donatiens hand raise again but this time it was to swing the door open as he came out shouting come on move will you move i cant get okay now skimask burst the back doors open and had the hood over donatiens head before hed finished the sentence one hand clamping hard over his mouth the driver leapt out and they bundled him quickly into the back and sped off no other curtains moved in the street and nobody looked over from nearby st laurent seconds later it was as if theyd never been there elenas nerves didnt start settling back until three hours into the flight dinner had been cleared away an hour and a half ago and most of the cabin shutters were down the lights subdued end of days was playing on three popdown screens above the centreaisle with a choice of german english or flemish dialogue through her headphones but she paid the film little attention her headphones were tucked into the seatback ahead her eyes flickering lazily in the semidark as she willed on sleep she felt exhausted completely burnt out by the niagararush of nervous energy shed outpoured over the past hours but still some residual nervousness turning over in her mind things that could still go wrong kept her from slipping completely under lorena was beside her in the window seat and had decided to watch the movie only to doze off halfway through elena had gently removed her headphones and tucked them into the seatback she looked so serene and untroubled sleeping no hint of concern that she was probably by now on police wires across half of europe elena returned the prim smile of a passing stewardess then leant her head back trying to let the last of her tension slip away gordons plan at least seemed to be working so far dumping the car at lille so that she wasnt on the road too long then the train to brussels to catch the second leg of a frankfurtbrusselstorontoedmonton flight shed booked to board at frankfurt to hopefully foil any early ticket searches at brussels and originally they were ticketed to go all the way to edmonton but theyd changed at the last second to toronto and would catch the train up to montreal even if they were finally traced as catching the flight the police would hopefully start searching in and around edmonton gordon had carefully planned out every move and revelled in it seeing his cats got the cream grin as he put the final embellishments to her route shed ribbed him that hed missed his vocation he should have gone into the secret service not banking shed planned to tell lorena the other reason why they were travelling so far as soon as they were airborne but the first good opportunity had been when dinner was cleared away im also hoping to see someone i havent seen for quite some time whos that my son we got split up some time ago so i havent seen him much you see she swallowed back the lump in her throat she was unable to bring herself to say that she hadnt seen him at all lorenas expression was quizzical why did you get split up what happened well its a long story it goes all the way back to when my father was alive and elena suddenly stopped herself she couldnt go into the horrors of the story with lorena and regardless of the reasons this girl whose life had been so scarred by abandonment since infancy would never understand how anyone could possibly abandon their own child especially not someone like her who lorena no doubt looked up to as a saviour of abandoned children one light of hope amongst the gloom and confusion lorena had seen enough dreams and illusions torn down by ryall to have to shoulder any more she smiled with that indulging reassurance grownups often give children when they suddenly realize theyre not old enough to know something as i say its a long story maybe if i do finally catch up with him i can tell you it all then now she couldnt resist another smile to herself at the irony she should be as excited as lorena by this adventure she might soon meet the son she hadnt seen since birth it wasnt enough that she probably by now had an army of police tracking her down to take the edge off of that now shed also be playing shellgames with her constant companion but having lied to gordon and everyone else for half her life that part at least should be easy now all she had to do was deceive a tenyear old child she shut her eyes fully shut out the last remnants of faint flickering light from the changing screen images and willed on welcome sleep to envelope her nervous exhaustion but her mind kept churning what if they did track their tickets while they were in flight what would they do radio ahead to the pilot or simply have a police welcoming committee with handcuffs for when she alighted her eyes flicked suddenly open again watching keenly the movements of the stewardesses trying to judge if they were glancing her way at all anxiously or guardedly she might as well forget it sleep was impossible georges was still gasping for breath minutes after the cloth had been put on not just because it was tight around his head and face but from the exertion of the struggle as he was bundled in and tied up and his breath was hot it felt as if his head was boiling his pulse pounding like a jackhammer at his temples what the fffuck isss this two tremulous breathless bursts whats this about though in his rapidly sinking heart he knew exactly what it was about hed worried about little else for days no answer as he regained more breath he ventured this is about roman isnt it still no answer only the drone of the van and its vibrations against his side as it sped through the city he was laid flat in a half coiled position found it difficult to sit up with his hands tied behind his back and his legs also tied georges honed in closer on the city sounds beyond the fall of his own breathing trying to work out where they were headed two turns already a left then a right or had it been a right then a left he was so filled with panic that hed hardly paid attention he felt them slowing and finally halting a junction or traffic lights indicator ticking for ten or twelve seconds then they swung left a long stretch this time their speed picked up more than before and seemed to be staying constant the rush of other traffic close by was also stronger as if on occasion they were being passed after a few moments a voice finally from the front so what did you tell the rcs when you were in with them nothing i didnt tell them anything you were in there quite some time whadya do talk about the weather conditions on the ski slopes no they put me in a holding cell for a while to cool my heels because meanwhile they were tracking some guy called venegas and they georges found it hard to talk with the hood tight on his face he spoke in bursts between fractured breaths raising his voice because of its muffling effect and could instantly feel the strain to his throat it made it sound all the more like a desperate plea they were worried that if they let me out straight away i might warn roman and spoil their operation yeah sure heavy doubt in the voice and nothing else no that was it the tape hed mentioned chenouda playing the tape to jeanpaul if jeanpaul hadnt in turn told roman no point in mentioning it now if he had then it put an extra dark edge on what was happening now theyd know that he was aware he was about to die the thought made him feel suddenly queazy he wished now he hadnt drunk so much his thoughts were spinning frantically with fearinduced adrenalin but he couldnt focus clearly on what to say that might save his neck it felt as if two sets of nerves were at play in his stomach one clutching so tight he could feel the ache the other set skittering wildly around the edges and with the vans swaying and bobbling he started to feel sick i dont think hes going to say anything nah doesnt look like it the driver speaking for the first time so where are we going to do this theres a multistorey a few blocks beyond the bus terminal i thought thered be good whats the drop six floors but itll be enough he wont survive it george nerves hit fever pitch his whole body was racked by coldsweat trembling his pulse a pounding ache at his temples as he felt himself spinning close to blackout raw bile swirled up without warning and he let out a couple of weak liquid belches before swallowing back tasting the sourness as he fought for even breaths and some control almost surreal as if it wasnt actually happening to him their conversation now mirroring the tape but he was sure now from the tease in their voices that it was purposeful they knew hed listened to the tape it was just the sort of sick move that would appeal to roman was that why simone hadnt phoned but even if she did know about whatever happened in the two hours hed lost at vianas place he could imagine her angry and beating his chest with her fists or not wanting to speak to him for weeks maybe months or never but what he couldnt picture was her just simply turning away while her father said that hed have to take care of it now or whatever tame euphemisms he used when he had to order someones death the van bobbed and swayed he felt it turning but more of a veering off than a sharp turn this time he remembered meeting simone that first time her warm open smile with its sly teasing challenge fired at him so often when hed catch her eye after meetings with her father at the house yet it took him almost a year to get up the courage to ask her for a date maybe her beauty maybe who she was and how it might affect his relationship with her father and now finally that smile was turned from him she was walking from the room he lunged after her desperate to explain that the girl last night was a setup it had probably all been romans doing but as he touched her shoulder he felt the stiffening in it the power and muscle the same raw tensing hed felt in romans thigh beside him the night he pulled the gun on leduc and as she turned it was her familiar sly challenging smile but romans face yeah fooled you didnt we foooo he snapped to with a jolt as he felt the van hit a bump and rise up sharply he realized that hed blacked out for a while lost some seconds maybe minutes he had no idea where they were how far theyd gone the van was winding circling then came another bump and rise ramps they were at the multistorey the driver had mentioned or maybe like venegas out in some field with snowpack ramps roman was no doubt enjoying this part too after hearing the tape him not knowing not being sure his eyes were stinging part tears at simones betrayal for letting him die like this part sweat from fear and the pressurecooker heat inside the hood another ramp more winding round he was tilted back had to press himself forward to compensate how many floors now four five he listened hard tried to pick out the background sound of city traffic or the vans engine reverberating off of concrete or was it just the silence of an open field but the engine revs were high whining and his own pounding heartbeat now filled his head drowned out anything else another bump and rise and the passenger said quite a few empty slots over the far end there right looks as good a spot as any the van straightened slowed and georges felt them turn in and stop jesssus guys you dont have to do this georges was hyperventilating so hard he could barely get the words out no answer their doors opened closed then a second later the back doors swung open he felt himself being lifted carried out for fucks sake dont do this im begging you dont do this georges shouted out the last maybe someone would hear him but the quaver and tremble in his voice robbed its strength combined with the muffling of the hood it probably hadnt carried far one last chance georges he was still being carried they were shuffling him into position as they spoke what did you tell the rcs nothing nothing pleassse youve got to believe me they stopped he felt the cool whip of the wind around his body six floors up or an open field probably the field everything else had followed the tape so far he aint gonna talk so we might as well do it on the count of three right right as georges felt them start swinging him suddenly he wasnt so sure this was just the sort of warped last twist that roman would love from the tape him thinking that hed just be dropped in a field and then the cruel lastsecond surprise as he started sailing down a sixfloor drop one big drop down there georges no please no god no georges screamed at the top of his voice hed hoped to rob them of the lastminute satisfaction of mirroring everything that had happened with venegas but in the end instinctive fear overrode he was blubbering and screaming for his life just the same as venegas two georges felt himself swinging higher no no his stomach suddenly surged again though this time he couldnt hold it back he retched violently sour vomit clogging his mouth his nostrils he started choking could hardly breath with most of it trapped inside the hood three georges prayed for another blackout so that he didnt have to feel the sensation of falling but it didnt come and he saw simone finally turn to him and reach out her sly smile was gone she looked concerned tender as if there was something troubling her which she couldnt quite bring herself to say but her hand missed gripping his and he started falling falling it felt like a lifetime but was probably only two seconds before he felt the solid thud of earth against his back shock exhalation combination of relief and getting winded a suspended moment to allow adjustment then we lied georges you see were really quite generous guys because you have in fact got a second chance now what did you tell the rcs georges georges was coughing spluttering fighting for breath after a second a weak garbled nothing i promise nothing hes not going to say anything looks like youre right resigned sigh shame faint rustle of movement then the sound of gun safeties being clicked off georges pictured them positioning and pointing their guns no no please georges mind frantically spun for something apart from pleading that might stop them but there was nothing nothing and facing the inevitable seemed to sap what little clear thought was left along with his resolve he felt washedout desolate no more than a hollow shell sorry georges roman wanted us to tell you that he never liked you always thought you were a smarmy shit he said it would give him great satisfaction to know that was the last thing you were thinking about but for us georges its nothing personal just sorry and at that moment georges did finally blackout his psyche thankfully protected him from what he knew from savards tape was coming next two bullets to the body one to the head twenty as i say listen to the tapes then call me later on if you have any questions or particular points you want me to put across at tomorrows session oh my notes are towards the end of the second tape right elena glanced at the cassettes in her hand in acknowledgement yes yes i will thank you dr lowndes she smiled and turned with lorena to the door a twentysomething auburn receptionist to the side smiled with a silently mouthed goodbye aimed more at lorena than at her if not ill see you in any case at eleven tomorrow dr lowndes looked keenly between them a hulk of a man with wild greytinged blonde hair elena thought john lowndes looked more like an ageing lumberjack than a psychiatrist the only hint of erudition apart from the diplomas on his walls were pincenez glasses which looked all the more out of place given his size but he came well recommended from one of the local dorset psychiatrists in nadine moores file apparently one of montreals better anglophile child psychiatrists from his fifteen minute introduction before the one hour session he seemed very capable and though the only clue was his parting smile now he was obviously also keen to get to grips with lorenas problem if there was one yes see you then thanks again elena headed out with lorena and took the elevator four floors down to rue drummond they walked a block and a half down to the car park where shed left the hire car paid the ticket and headed east along st catherine st as she slotted lowndes tape into the cassette player the first moments were settling lorena in and general background nothing of any relevance so she tweaked it down a bit as she asked lorena did it all go okay yes i suppose so lorena grimaced and shook her head but i still couldnt remember anything she sounded annoyed with herself elena reached out and lightly clutched her hand dont worry its only the first session we didnt expect alarming breakthroughs straight away but she had at least hoped and she was silently worried they didnt have weeks for endless sessions two or three might be all they could cram in before the police net finally closed on them worrying news from gordon on that front when shed phoned the chelborne call box theyd prearranged hed told her about the heavy swoop search in france related from the friend whod run decoy her name had obviously been out on the wire with interpol practically from the word go theyd originally hoped that the tape would give them at least twentyfour hours or possibly avert a police search altogether how long before they traced the frankfurtbrusselsedmonton flight gordons bet was at least another twelve or eighteen hours and theyd probably start trawling edmonton first canada was a big country but shed speculated what if they always put alerts out nationwide as a matter of course gordon fell silent and his unlikely a few seconds later sounded uncertain and when she pressed him he admitted that of course he couldnt be sure that they hadnt already traced her flight and her put her name out on the rcmp network or might do so in only a few hours another but unlikely and so her nerves were still on edge with every police car that passed she found it impossible to relax the clock was fast ticking down on her getting to the root of lorenas problem and finding her son shed visited three of the stevens with initials n m or g listed in the phone book all she could fit in before lorenas session but no matches or even remotely hopeful leads there twentysix more to go plus the two unlisted terry had given her if they were still in montreal she shook her head she must have been crazy trying to do both at the same time under this set of circumstances the pressure was stifling the lack of sleep on top hadnt helped she hadnt slept at all on the flight and had grabbed barely an hour on the train up from toronto before the blaring train klaxon as they crossed a series of levelcrossings woke her abruptly i was trapped couldnt lift the cover couldnt breathe elena turned the tape up again and this was a recurring dream during your time in the orphanages yes and for a while afterwards how long afterwards well a few months at least i see but by this time youre settled in with your stepparents the waldrens yes yes i was elena picked up on lorenas beat of hesitation as she mentally selfprompted about the false name and story elena had presented herself as lorenas stepmother concerned about abuse from the stepfather not an aid worker abducting her it was the only thing she could think of to get lowndes to handle the case elena smiled conspiratorially at lorena but the dreams started to become different then lorena continued in what way well in the last two i was able to get the manhole cover open get free i see and you felt relaxed then no problems or concerns with mr waldren coming to your room at night no as lowndes questions rolled on and it became clear that nothing dramatic was being revealed lorena looked at the tape player and then at elena with an i told you so expression the only small triumph was lowndes establishing that the return of the bad dreams coincided with ryall mr waldren starting to visit her bed late at night and this time in their original more worrying form the manhole cover was once again immovable she was trapped and when you dreamt that your stepfather was touching you was that part of the same dreams or separate separate the same nights or different nights different nights oh i i think one was on the same night longer pause this time from lowndes now id like you to think about this question a bit more carefully lorena now when you awake and remember dreams with your father touching you do you at any time remember actually being awake when he touched you no i cant im sorry faint rustling as if lorena was moving or shaking her head the dreams seemed so real at times but but i dont think i was awake at any time dont thinkis it possible that you might have in fact been awake but the sleep either side has muddied your memory i dont know im not sure i cant remember lorena sounded flustered well for a moment it seemed lowndes was going to press more before deciding against it thats okay thats okay gently soothing tone as lowndes recapped on some of the ground when the dreams first started the real sewer floods theyd suffered and the death of patrika elena turned it down again it was background she knew all too well too painfully and one that she wished she didnt have to drag lorena through again now lorena looked wistfully at the tape player and bit lightly at her bottom lip as she cast her eyes down as if concerned she might have let everyone down elena turned into st denis heading towards their hotel dont worry she reassured its early days yet tomorrow might be a completely different story but she could read the questioning frankness in lorenas eyes as she looked across if she didnt remember she didnt remember how were these sessions going to help jeanpaul picked up the message from simone on his answerphone pa i know that im angry at georges verrry angry and i know youve got your own problems with him and i dont want you to read into this that im trying to interferrre in your business never have done but i dont want georges in any way harmed brief pause the sound of traffic in the background oh and im sorrry that things were left the way they were earlier ill be back at my place in half an hour call me there breathless the words punched out as if she was afraid that if she hesitated shed forget them completely with a slight slurring on some words jeanpaul wasnt sure if shed been drinking or it was just due to distress or both jeanpaul kept the tape rolling two business calls in between and then another call from simone with you not calling back i decided to phone georges apartment no answer i tried his mobile but that just rang out too ive tried five more times in the last two hours still no answer im starting to get worried you promise that nothings happened to him a heavy pause as if she expected him to offer reassurance in the gap then with a speak to you later she hung up jeanpaul anxiously checked his watch pm after leaving a message on simones mobile hed got wrapped up in a meeting with jon larsen at their tax lawyers office the rest of the afternoon then had gone for an early dinner with larsen part of which was to delicately explain that they might have some problems with georges larsen should shy away from sharing any possibly sensitive business information with him at least for the time being until theyd finally worked out how to play everything he dialled simones number it answered on the second ring hi simone ive just come in now and got your messages have you managed to get hold of georges yet no no i tried him again just ten minutes ago but still no answer not at home or on his mobile a moments tense silence between them as jeanpauls concerns verged towards panic please tell me that hes alright that nothings happened to him simones voice broke slightly with the plea i know that youve had some concerns about him seeing the police but no no of course ive done nothing like that do you think id be calling back now if i had he sounded more annoyed than hed intended but his anger wasnt aimed at her more his rising worries about roman look let me make some calls then ill phone you back when give me an hour or so to sort it out and if georges turns up meanwhile call me straight away he hung up and dialled straight out to roman no answer at home so he raised him on his mobile roman weve got a problem georges has apparently disappeared jeanpaul honed in intently on the silence and the intonation of roman response whenwhere how do you know little indication either way simone phoned shes been trying frantically to get hold of him the past few hours cant find him anywhere i want you to come to the house right now so that we can sort this out maybe he could pick up more face to face from romans eyes and body language well i was planning to go to the sherbrooke club to i said right now see you here in twenty minutes jeanpaul slammed the phone down before roman could draw breath let alone respond roman made it to the door at cartierville in seventeen minutes slightly flushed after jeanpauls tone on the phone he was visibly agitated obviously halfexpecting a confrontation jeanpaul rarely lost his temper jeanpaul wheeled on him as soon as theyd entered his study im going to ask you the difficult question first roman have you done anything to georges he held one hand up forefinger and thumb close together harmed even a hair on his head roman jolted slightly looked shocked at the suggestion no no of course not either he hadnt or a very good act but then hed probably had a few hours to prepare jeanpaul shook his head you know because its just the sort of thing youd do youve been pressing and pressing for me to do something about georges telling me what a danger he could be but in the end you just couldnt wait for the final nod could you no no im telling you i aint done shit to him roman held his hands out in exasperation his face redder still fit to burst as father said always the bullhead barging in before youve had a chance to put your brain in gear roman moved a step closer to jeanpaul his eyes fixing hard on him look i havent touched the fucking creep okay much as i might have liked to he looked ready to strike out jeanpaul paced to one side looking away uncomfortably i dont know i come back home to find nothing but frantic messages on my answerphone from simone she cant find him anywhere is worried sick about him he ran one hand through his hair and sighed i just dont know what to think roman found more confidence with jeanpaul easing off he raised an acute eyebrow i dont quite see the panic even if i had done something which i havent surely having him taken him out is what youd have decided yourself in the end anyway pleading hearts from simone or not jeanpaul looked back sharply at roman was this an attempt at rationalisation because he had in fact done something with roman protesting his innocence so vehemently any further assault was probably pointless jeanpaul exhaled tiredly i was actually thinking more in terms of sending georges to cuba to run our business interests there and in mexico until things cooled down not only in respect of simone but in case youve forgotten were meant to have moved away from crime respectable businessmen dont go around killing people yeah and mugs who get ratted on end up spending twenty in orsainville roman smiled dryly i told you the transition wouldnt be easy jeanpaul cuba might be a good shortterm solution but in the long whatever jeanpaul held one hand up abruptly as his felt his anger rising again that would be my call not yours he watched roman flicker his eyes down and shrug with a subdued yeah yeah sure jeanpaul took fresh breath but thats not the main problem right now hopefully georges might materialise later tonight but if he still hasnt shown by tomorrow if he doesnt turn up at the office then i think weve got to face we could have a real problem georges suspects that we might be rallying against him because he sent simone in with some wild story to try and turn the tide at the last minute and if he fears that hes out in the cold thats when he presents the strongest danger to us he might go to ground for a day or two until hes worked out what the hell to do but theres strong chances hed prove our worst fears and end up in the arms of the rcmp and then solutions like cuba would be out of the window id have to leave things in your hands right i see roman noticed how jeanpaul couldnt even look at him directly let alone say it just the tame wave of one hand to signal that georges might after all have to be taken out he thought it pathetic deathbed promises to their father over pascal or not jeanpaul used to be so direct unflinching someone to respect this new jeanpaul trapped between this recentfound social conscience and what he needed to do to take care of business he found hard to stomach his conviction that he should be the one taking the reins of their business couldnt have been stronger than in that moment but it was important to keep up the image of acquiescence just a little longer until the final parts of his double game were in place he held out his palms so what do you want me to do if georges doesnt show in the office tomorrow then i want you to find him and find him fast work every street contact you know and if and when i do bring him to me so that i can decide what to do but again that telltale flinch in jeanpauls eyes that told roman the decision on that end solution would be difficult if not impossible for jeanpaul to take hed read things right all along you will probably notice mrs waldren that although i pushed a bit on the subject of whether lorena remembered anything happening with your husband while awake rather than just in her dreams i wasnt insistent i didnt push too hard there was a specific reason for this elena was in her hotel room playing the end of tape notes from john lowndes hed preadvised that lorena shouldnt hear them so shed sent lorena down to the hotel bar to have a coke and some crisps with the promise that shed join her in eight or ten minutes pause as john lowndes drew fresh breath he was obviously measuring his words carefully we have a slight dilemma here if the problem with lorena not remembering is that shes selectively blotted it out because its simply too terrible to remember then the only way for us to break that protective barrier and draw the memory out is to push but then if we push too hard and it starts to look as if we might have even suggested that particular scenario to lorena unfortunately we then get into the muddy area of fms false memory syndrome is it a real memory or one weve planted there halfdefeated sigh from lowndes though theres nothing conclusive either way at this stage im afraid i must reserve strong concern that your suspicions could indeed have foundation the main clue to this is that so many of the horrors lorena has suffered in romania have in fact been transposed to her dreams she sees that as safer ground than direct recall it might also follow therefore that any horrors she feels she cant face now she also stashes away there a safe haven to protect her psyche if you will but thats a long way from tangible proof lets hope we have a better day tomorrow she stopped the tape and let her thoughts settle for a second she was sat on the edge of a kingsize bed with a tape player borrowed from the hotel owner alphonse just call me al something the decor made an attempt at french regency with fake wood beams mock fireplaces and fleurdelis wallpaper but overall was too garish heavyhanded even the dressing table was mock louis xv with the bed a matching fourposter with red velvet trim the only modern things in the room were the tv and lorenas sofabed but it was just what she wanted small and faceless just one of many bowwindowfronted b ampbs in the latin quarter shed decided to avoid the larger hotels that might list with a central computer register as a matter of course the only small problem was that alphonse a small rotund man with dark brylcreamed hair and a thick bristling moustache who also doubled as the hotel barman and receptionist was discomfortingly gregarious and friendly he seemed to want to tell them everything about the city while at the same time drawing out snippets about them dorset huh sounds nice practically on sight given their situation shed have preferred one of those mousy indifferent desk clerks that barely looked up when you came in or left she drummed a few fingers lightly against the cassette player great start she thought ruefully they needed desperately to push but their hands could be tied from word go she went down to see lorena shed finished her coke but was nibbling at some peanuts alphonse had put before her she was just telling me all about england the house you have there alphonse commented oh right elena went on alarm which house had she mentioned hers or ryalls sounds like a palace well not quite but getting there probably ryalls their place wasnt quite so ostentatious but she was nervous about what else lorena might have talked about that she could get caught out on she was eager to leave look sorry got to dash now longlost relatives to track down and not much time left what you mentioned earlier thats right she fished her hirecar keys out of her bag lorena got up and they hustled out see you later they headed in the car towards avenue du parc if alphonse was going to show willing then she might as well use him to advantage so shed spun a story about looking for longlost cousins the stevens previously stephanou greekcypriot relatives from my fathers side shed shown alphonse the list of addresses shed written down and hed given her a quick regional guided tour of the city french to the east english to the west with st laurent as the main dividing line except for outremont just northwest of st laurent which is decidedly upmarket and almost exclusively french then weve got the jewish community around main and st laurent the italians of course in little italy around st joseph and laurier and the greeks and hispanics spread mostly in between westmount is the main upmarket anglophile area and the few blocks wedged between st laurent and du parc thirty years ago used to be a predominantly greek area but now the new immigrants are mostly portuguese elena turned off of du parc into rue milton then took the second left the address that terry had given her as the stevens first address in montreal and started counting down she pulled in as the house came into view and turned to lorena will you be okay here for a little while she didnt just mean the few minutes shed be now but for the five or six calls she hoped to get in before dinnertime youve got the radio or the walkman if you like she glanced towards the back seat where it had been left from lorena waiting during her earlier calls uh huh ill be okay elena patted her hand and got out the pavement was wide then three yards of approach path and five steps before the house two bells she rang the bottom one a narrow brownstone with half basement orangepainted window frames on the ground and lowerground floors neutral cream on the top two floors it was obviously now divided into two apartments but twentyeight years ago it could well have been all one house a small swarthy woman in darkgrey tracksuit and floral headscarf opened the door she looked elena up and down curiously oui then glanced over her shoulder towards her car i was looking for some old relatives of mine that used to live here and i wondered if you might have known them or know where they might have gone how long have you lived here four year now why what their name stevens but it was a long time ago over twenty years the woman considered for a moment no no know any steven sorry from her appearance and her accent elena thought she was probably arab or north african rather than greek or portuguese the woman seemed to keep her gaze more over her shoulder towards the car and lorena than meeting her eye directly but then she too was looking over the womans shoulder taking in the decor in the hallway and what little she could see of a room twodown through a halfopen door elena pointed to the top buzzer and how long have your neighbours been here just over a year no longer right twentyeight years thered probably been a dozen or more owners since then elena glanced around bike against the railings leading down to the basement an infants blue plastic tricycle on the sixyard square of front lawn and it suddenly struck her what had drawn her here despite knowing that the stevens would probably have left longago what was making her look keenly around and try to get glimpses of the inside she was following in his footsteps trying to see what life he might have had after she gave him up good environment bad well cared for or neglected happy sad she snapped to as she noticed the womens eyes on her questioningly sorry thanks for your help anyway there was no way of her knowing from this postagestamp of a garden and glimpse of a halflit hallway almost thirty years on the next few hours became an increasingly wearying blur practically the same pitch each time stevens previously stephanou nicholas and maria and baby of only eighteen months george twentyeight years ago relatives that my family lost contact with a lot of headshaking shrugs and hastily closed doors and with it dark for an hour and a half and her still calling on fresh doors lorena started to become agitated still more you havent found him yet i havent seen him in years now we lost contact completely it could take a while more elena smiled sheepishly with the long flight and perhaps some nervousness about the impending sessions lorena had been quieter than normal more subdued now she was obviously getting alert and brighteyed again and impatient with it just a few more then well go grab a pizza promise she managed two more calls the third was out before deciding finally to call it a night it was getting late to keep disturbing people and they were both hungry with lorena bordering on cranky complaining that shed listened to all three tapes on the walkman and there was hardly anything on the radio most of the stations are in french she sounded bemused but elena now realized that it was going to take a lot longer than shed first envisaged three not there to call back on out of the ten stevens so far canvassed plus eighteen more fresh calls to go it was going to take her all of the next day if not spill over into the day after especially since five of them were in farflung suburbs the only brief respite a fleeting flash of hope that had caught her breath in her throat was a man in his twenties swinging open a door to greet her dark brown hair quite tall but as she looked closer she realized that he was probably closer to twentytwo or three than twentynine and she quickly discovered that his name was guy parents charles and madeleine but it suddenly struck her that that was easily how it could happen the right door swinging open and suddenly hed be there twentynine years melting away in an instant all the years shed turned her back on him and tried not to think about him yet in truth hed hardly left her thoughts for a second and shed clutch at him and embrace him hard or perhaps stand trembling uncertainly for a second before bursting into tears but then she was quickly back to the harsh reality of the headshakes shrugs and hastily closed doors with her fathers voice ringing incessantly in her ears ill bury him out of sight and out of reach you wont find him twentyone maurice roubilliard pulled up in front of the bar rodeo with his normal trademark show and flourish one harley taking the lead of his gleaming silver wheeler two more bringing up the rear his attempt at a presidential cavalcade at least in terms of drugdealing at the street and club levels in quebec roubilliard was omnipotent allpowerful at sixfootthree and twoforty pounds he cut an imposing figure with immaculate black leather trousers and matching jacket which was closer to a waistcoat with its arms cut out and only a fourinch silver chain linking it at the front it looked as if it had been purposefully tailored to show off his biceps and pecs his age hed frozen at thirtyeight but most put it closer to fortysix with the main sign evident in his fast thinning shoulderlength rust hair he sported the green and gold mohawk headband hed always worn but now it was pushed further back on his crown to shield his receding hairline he was now on his fourth hair transplant to cure the problem but any of his inner circle that spread that wellconcealed titbit put their health at risk vanity went against the ruthless hardman image he carefully nurtured boosted years back by him beating a murder rap with only manslaughter he served five out of the sevenyear sentence had continued running his drugs network from inside leferge prison and had been out now nearly four years the wheeler was heavily customised with tinted glass bulletproof rumour had it oversized chrome exhaust snaking up one side like a truckers funnel and big wheels that pushed it ten inches higher off the ground the two girls with roubilliard stepped down carefully in their high heels a blonde and a brunette both stunning and leggy close to six foot if more than a little tarty in their dress matching black leather trenchcoats open at the front to show tight silver hotpants and bubblegum pink tanktop on the blonde the brunette with black leather mini black seethrough blouse and black lace bra the brunette looked about nineteen but the blonde looked disturbingly young no more than fifteen at a table by the front window of the rodeo roman nudged frank massenat and smiled as roubilliards entourage approached would you get this fucking guy makes you wonder if were doing something wrong we should be flauntin it too theyd parked the beamer discreetly round the corner and had entered quietly but in their suits and crombies they couldnt help feeling nevertheless as if theyd made some sort of grand entrance the bar was awash with checkshirts jeans and leathers and more than a few eyes had turned to them curiously roman noticed a hooker outside stepping out intermittently to attract passing drivers in hot pants not dissimilar to roubilliards blonde but with black nylons and a grey fake fur he couldnt resist the jibe as roubilliard burst through the rodeos swing doors he stood up theatrically holding his arms out hey hey maurissse maurissse he clamped his arms around roubilliards bulk in an embrace then gestured towards the girls as he pulled back these two come with you or did you just pick them up outside massenat guffawed as the two girls scowled the brunette perching one hand on her hips challengingly only one corner of roubilliards mouth curled slightly making it clear he thought the humour value was scant let me tell you my friend these girls are a cut above what you mean theyre ten years younger yeah yeah i suppose you could say roubilliard levered down into the seat opposite with a faint grunt as roman sat back down he gestured towards the window i didnt know you liked your girls streetworn like those tired pussies out there just i like them to at least finish their schooling so that they pick up on the finer points of my fucking humour roman eased a ready smile still enough of my pussy preferences to business no point in riding roubilliard too hard the regular drug shipments roman was middlemanaging for medeiros guaranteed roubilliard dancing to the strings he pulled but this was a side issue on which he wanted roubilliards cooperation roubilliard peeled off a twentydollar bill and told the two girls to perch up at the bar hed join them in a while and with only a brief interruption as the waitress came over and they ordered a fresh jug of beer roman ran through the fresh dilemma with donatiens nobody had seen him in the last twentyfour hours he hadnt shown up at the office wasnt contactable on his mobile and hadnt left messages with anyone and weve checked every likely place he could be hes completely disappeared and we need to find him fast roubilliard nodded knowingly and sipped at his beer knows too much huh yeah well were starting to get worried about him he had a little runin with the rcs recently and we need to talk to him thats all right roubilliard took another slug of beer and fixed his eyes keenly on roman a slow leer rising rumour has it that hes been a problem to you for some while so maybe this disappearance now is that you finally decided to do something about it hes already keeping venegas company at the bottom of some lake or river waiting for the spring thaw roman sneered and chuckled nervously dont be ridiculous why would i be sitting here roman waved his arm towards roubilliards henchmen at the table behind and the bar at large surrounded by a bunch of assholes who look like theyre stuck in a fucking time warp since easy rider asking you to find him roubilliard shrugged maybe cause like everything else with our drug deals and leduc and venegas you havent told jeanpaul he doesnt know youve already offed donatiens and so you need to go through the motions now with me to keep up the pretence roman reached across and gripped roubilliards arm hard look youre just arms and legs in this someone with the right street connections to find this fucker if hes still in quebec im not paying you to think roubilliard gave a more philosophical shrug as if accepting it as a complement if roubilliards connections werent second to none they wouldnt both be sitting here now by necessity his drugs distribution network touched every club clipjoint neighbourhood cafe or bar dealer in the province and his contacts with fences and counterfeiters were also excellent if donatiens had gone to ground anywhere or wanted a falseplated car or false identity and credit cards to be able to moonlight discreetly out of quebec roubilliard would soon know about it matters not to me if youve already taken out donatiens im hardly likely to let on to jeanpaul we dont exactly mix in the same circles hes only interested in being seen around politicians and city movers and shakers these days not excon bikers roubilliard raised his glass towards roman if you say try and find donatiens ill try and find him but roman held the same poker face with just a hint of ingratiating smile roubilliard couldnt tell either way whether hed already taken care of donatiens or not session the tragic incident with your friend patrika drowning in the sewers was something that intensely upset you something you found hard to forget yes yes it was and what were your feelings about the rest of your time in the sewers outside of that tragedy did you feel vulnerable and uneasy frightened even yes we did much so there were always noises the rush of water strange echoes rats scurrying we never slept much it was just somewhere to escape from the cold at night elena sat in a small annexe sevenfoot square listening in on headphones to lorenas session in the adjoining room no window between the two rooms in front of her was a nova scotia tourist board poster with a rugged coastline vista the headphones snaked out of a cassette player rolling to one side and there was also a microphone before her because lowndes dealt with so many child cases the room was for parents who might need reassurance that their offspring werent being unduly pressured the microphone was only for necessary prompts or in extreme cases for parents to call a halt to the session lowndes had urged her only to use it if absolutely necessary as it tended to interrupt the flow in a tenminute briefing beforehand lowndes voiced that having reflected more on the first session he had strong doubts hed get anywhere trying to draw directly from lorena that she might have blotted out unsettling events with her stepfather his aim therefore was to start with other events and edge in and how long did you stay using the sewers as a refuge after patrika died three months i think maybe four and were you even more frightened then knowing what had already happened with patrika yes yes lorena was slightly breathless obviously agitated by the memory it was even harder then to sleep each night we would all huddle together and listen out and the slightest rush or surge of water would waken us the fear of it perhaps rising again trapping or sweeping us away i see but this didnt in the end at any time happen it was only the fear of it happening and this replayed mainly through your later dreams thats right it was only really in the dreams edging elenas hands clasped tight and worked together shed have done anything to avoid lorena now being dragged back through those dark days but lowndes was insistent that there could be a vital link there a key to the protective barriers in lorenas psyche so too what happened with patrika his death and all the fear and anxiety that came as a result afterwards that was also kept mostly to your dreams was it not did you spend much time thinking or reflecting on those events at all while you were awake no no i didnt not much anyway it was mainly in my dreams so recall of this period possibly one of the worst in your life would it be true to say that to the large extent you pushed away at arms length into your dreams yes i i did push it away i suppose a long pause faint rustling the sound of lorena swallowing it was very tough for me to think about you know i know i understand soothing tone elena closed her eyes she could hear the tremor in lorenas voice as she finally admitted to pushing events away her easteuropean accent slightly more evident the breakthrough lowndes had no doubt been seeking but at what price elena too found herself trembling with the stifling pressure of lowndes questioning lowndes had flagged that unless they tried a fresh angle and had a breakthrough soon he had strong reservations about continuing sessions we could find ourselves just going around in circles hitting the same brick wall and so shed finally relented to allowing lowndes free rein it was either that or risk having to throw in the towel the thought of shipping lorena back to ryall possibly even later that same day made her shudder and so with other terrible incidents in your life that you dont wish to remember directly do you think its possible or even likely that you might want to push them away too i i dont know lorena sounded uncertain or perhaps she hadnt quite picked up the link the prompt from lowndes came quickly push them away to your dreams where perhaps theyre easier for you to deal with i i suppose so i hadnt really thought about it slow exhalation from lowndes elena pictured him summoning up fresh reserves then he continued on relentlessly as if afraid that if he eased off the pressure the thread would be lost with a few more questions he drew out of lorena that if indeed something was happening with her stepfather that too would likely be too terrible for her to remember he finished with a flourish something you might wish to blot out perhaps again as with the your terrible sewer days and what happened with patrika push to the safety of your dreams there was a suspended moment as lorena contemplated this it was as if the impact of where lowndes had been heading hadnt really hit her until that final connection was made tentatively it it could be that yes i see now i just didnt know what might be happening because i didnt really think about it before i its okay lowndes cut in perhaps sensing it would be the most hed get at this stage and lorena was once again heading for more uncertain ground you dont need to embrace that thought fully that would be unfair after all this is probably the first time youve even looked at that possibility but i do want you to stay looking at it for a moment letting it settle more as i ask you to consider something else elena had to admit lowndes was good even without his voiced presession concerns shed begun to worry that it wasnt enough hoping that lorena would simply unlock the memory on her own and in her call to gordon late the night before shed asked how he was getting on with mikaya theyd agreed that as soon as she was home dry in canada hed try and make contact with her ive left two more messages but still no return call as yet ill try twice more tonight and if theres still no luck ill drive up to durham university first light tomorrow one of the most beautiful girls ive ever seen if there were darker secrets behind mikayas earlier pregnancy and she pointed the finger at ryall theyd have enough for a social services order to get lorena away a few months respite if not longer for more considered sessions to discover if the same thing was happening with lorena rather than this madness now of trying to cram in everything in only days in the hope of a breakthrough what do you think would happen if you did speak out against your stepfather and say that these terrible things that you picture now only in your dreams were in fact happening that they were real im not sure in what way well were only talking hypothetically what if for now but what do you think would happen to you lorena you obviously wouldnt be able to stay in the same house with mr waldren any more so where do you think you would go i dont know i havent really thought about that i see i truly dont think you have heavy pause then a fresh breath from lowndes but have you considered that perhaps part of your mind has and that part might fear that youd have to return to what you knew before the horrors of the orphanages and your days and nights in the sewers i i dont know but apart from the dreams and your concerns about mr waldren youre happy there at the house its comfortable and secure and you have everything else you need yes i think so its a very nice house elena held her breath as with a series of questions lowndes teased out of lorena that in fact this was a level of comfort and security that shed never experienced at any time in her life before the tremendous gulf between her current life and the deprivation and horrors of her past existence something youd probably wish to avoid going back to at any cost a marked pause as if lowndes perhaps expected an answer or was intently studying lorena for reaction now that may or may not also be causing something of a block but its never that easy just to say now that i know theres a block ill just remove it so im going to ask you lorena to relax and imagine that if you did have to leave mr waldrens house youd go somewhere equally as nice and warm and secure somewhere with your mother obviously the first choice but if not perhaps some friends do you have some other friends perhaps youd like to stay with yes theres my aid worker who first saw me in romania she doesnt live far away whats her name elen er ei eileen elena closed her eyes and swallowed hard the warm rush at being lorenas first choice of alternate haven was swiftly quashed by guilt at what she was putting lorena through just when lorena was meant to be opening up her mind to discover the truth about her own life she was forced to hopscotch around lies as to who everybody else was and is it a nice house yes it overlooks a wooded ravine and at the end is the sea there see youre spoilt for choice lowndes let out a relaxed soothing sigh now i want you to think about those nice places that youd go to just as comfortable and secure as where you are now because for sure your mother or your friend eileen arent going to let you go anywhere thats not nice or safe and if youre worried about youre stepfather being angry and ranting and shouting at you dont he wont be allowed near you youll have nothing to fear from him and absolutely nothing to fear as to where you might go or what might happen to you is that perfectly clear now youre settled about that and understand that you have no worries at all in that regard yes i understand and i want you now to draw on that feel relaxed feel calm feel the pressure gone of perhaps being afraid to speak out because of how your stepfather might react or what might happen to you but at the same time i also want you to be cautious if you still cant remember anything happening with your father even with all that pressure now gone and i mean clearly remember then that too is what we want to hear i im not sure like i said before some of it seemed so real as if it couldnt possibly be a dream but i just couldnt remember any time when i was awake elenas palm sweated as she clutched unconsciously at the headphones wire she could feel the clawing pressure on lorena with each fall of her breath swallow or faint cough lowndes had edged in so deftly purposefully it reminded her of the carefully layered brushstrokes of her painting but then it was as if hed suddenly remembered false memory syndrome and went back and wiped out a stroke worried that he might have painted her too much into a corner he needed to push hard to break any block but then he didnt want it possibly viewed that the memory had come about merely as a result of that pressure because lorena thought that that was what he wanted to hear and when you thought back trying to recall if it was real or just a dream this was already the morning the first moments of waking yes lowndes confirmed with lorena that her stepfather wasnt usually there when she awoke but have there been times in the night when he was at your bedside when you awoke yes some times when i had the bad dreams about patrika and the sewers yes but were any of those dreams with your stepfather touching you and youd awake to find him there at your bedside only one ii faltering pause lorenas breathing fractured laboured gentle prompt from lowndes its okay go on i dreamt that he was stroking me soothing me telling me that it was okay then it became the waters of the sewer washing over me but it was somehow warm strange and as it came up to my mouth i was choking and spluttering for breath but still he was stroking me telling me everything was okay okay and when you awoke was he touching you yes yes but only my forehead and he was saying the same words that everything was okay lorena swallowed hard trying to regain her breath and her composure he said that id been screaming had woken him up did you think hed just run in from his room or did you get the feeling hed been standing there all along i i dont know i couldnt tell im sorry lowndes paused and took a deep breath elena couldnt help sensing that hed reached a sort of crossroads uncertain where to head next or perhaps because with only a few minutes of the session remaining he wouldnt have time to fully explore where he wanted to go elena looked down to see her hands noticeably shaking lowndes questioning or all the other panics she was frantically juggling at that moment crossroads in their call last night gordon had warned her that the timescale in which they could have traced her flight to canada was soon up and she should be doubly wary the next morning shed squeezed in three more doorcalls before the session with lowndes and heading down st denis a squad car came out of a side turn and pulled up two cars behind her at the avenue monte royal crossroads she tried not to look too pointedly or repeatedly in her mirror but it stayed behind her all the way to sherbrooke before turning off by which time her nerves were completely frazzled she pulled over immediately afterwards her stomach was still somersaulting and for a second she thought she was going vomit you dont need to be sorry lorena as i said if nothing is happening then thats fine too and if this is still a question of your memory being blocked in some way i wouldnt expect it to suddenly be freed within minutes it could take time but what i do want you to do is continue thinking on what we covered earlier there are absolutely no pressures or worries as to what might happen to you as a result of you speaking out if you finally remember anything and maybe with some time to let that thought settle that might help us in your next session lowndes voice lowered becoming soft almost conspiratorial would you do that for me lorena yes i will with a perfunctory but equally softmannered good see you tomorrow then lowndes closed the session he let lorena go ahead with the receptionist as he held back a moment in his office with elena he turned to her thoughtfully you realize that if theres no breakthrough early on in the session tomorrow it could all be over quickly there might be nowhere else we can go with this yes i realize she agreed sombrely as much as she wanted the nightmare ended quickly the only acceptable way was with a solution she didnt think she could bring herself to send lorena back to ryall still with the knowledge that he might be molesting her oh one more thing this eileen lorenas friend the aid worker are they very close yes fairly she helped lorena a lot in romania suddenly realizing she should distance herself more she added so i suppose so and does she know about this new problem now with lorena i im not sure she stuttered her heart suddenly in her mouth but as her mind flashed frantically through all the possible pitfalls shed already mentioned social service visits to lowndes she decided to at least partly tell the truth yes she must know now she came along with social services on their second visit but probably she didnt know at the beginning right i see lowndes mumbled she could see that he was still slightly lost in thought and quickly added any problem no no not at all he looked at her directly forcing a smile just its always useful to have as much background as possible but fifteen minutes later grabbing a quick beefburger lunch with lorena she couldnt help dwelling on whether lowndes had some deeper concerns about lorenas mention of eileen the aid worker as lorena reached across for much ketchup and the hustle and bustle of the restaurant crashed back in she pushed it from her mind she had enough to worry about and it was probably nothing just her paranoia because she knew they were lying the telephone lines had burned red hot the last twentyfour hours between cameron ryall inspector turton and ds crowley and in turn between crowley interpol and an everwidening net of airports and customs posts halfway across europe and as the likelihood of a quick breakthrough diminished inspector turton decided that rather than try and kidglove the increasingly heated calls from ryall hed pull himself out of the loop and suggest that in future ryall should contact crowley directly to be kept up to date on progress ive been told i should speak to you now about this apparently youre doing all the legwork ryall made the emphasis as if it was the lowest form of activity the message was patently clear he was only talking to crowley through sufferance and his patience was already long gone now what the hells going on crowley clarified with ryall what information turton had already passed on then picked up from there the cashcard trail seems to have petered out in the middle of france weve had no other notification of its use there or indeed anywhere else and any sightings of her car in france no nor again anywhere else for that matter i dont want us to get stuck on the fact that she might still be in france so weve got alerts out not only with most airports in northern france but also border posts with belgium switzerland holland and germany not to mention airports too that she could have by now reached in those countries were also going through airline passenger records at those airports plus we mustnt rule out that she could still be in england the euroshuttle ticket and the cashcard might have all been just a diversion he didnt add that hed soon have to widen the net to cover italy and spain as it became possible that shed reached that far it made the search sound all the more tenuous underlined that they really had no idea where shed gone he tried to sound confident believe me were doing everything we can wherever she is well find her what about mr waldren turton had already told ryall about them putting mr waldren on a tight time leash the first twelve hours with the promise of them possibly holding back on charges till then so crowley jumped to what had happened since theyd piled on the pressure by extending the deadline by a few hours but that now too was well past theyd applied for a telephone tap on the waldrens line along with a record of all calls made the past thirtysix hours and received both in late yesterday but nothing interesting from the records or from the monitoring so far though that might be because mr waldren seems to make the habit of travelling out to call boxes usually late at night which is the other thing were doing following his movements two chelborne boxes and one on the way to wareham he uses different boxes each time and every time he appears to be receiving the calls rather than making them the way it came across crowley couldnt help thinking their efforts sounded quite impressive as you can see sir were not sitting on our haunches on this were covering every possible option is that right ryall quickly killed any exuberance but the end result of all this marvellous activity is that youre found absolutely nothing concrete yes well i im not sure what else you expect us to be doing on this i though that was your job to work out mix of bristling impatience and sarcasm but if i think of anything ill make sure to phone you ryall hung up abruptly child molester or not crowley didnt want to go near the dangerous area of even attempting to think about it cameron ryall was certainly not a nice person ryalls intimation that he might not be doing his job properly had particularly stung him he felt the strong urge to redress the balance score back some points and when forty minutes later the two dcs trailing gordon waldren patched in to say that he was on the move heading out of the area this time obviously not seeing local clients he thought he might just have that something though he waited for another hour to receive the news that waldren was on the a approaching northampton before he called ryall it could be that hes going to meet up with his wife or at least where hes headed could give some clue to her whereabouts certainly its a change to his normal routine yes i see some activity i suppose rather than nothing thank you for phoning keep me posted crowleys next call wasnt for over two hours hes gone to durham it appears my men have just watched him park which street ryall asked pointedly what crowley was fazed for a second before going back to the other line to ask elvet hill road thats where my other daughter is you oaf your other daughter yes my eldest stepdaughter mikaya shes at durham university and what would gordon waldren be doing seeing her i dont know for gods sake ryall blustered maybe abducting her as well a full bloody house though he did know an icy tingle ran up his spine made his whole body rigid his secretary had looked up with his raised voice was still looking concernedly through his glass office partition he looked down lowered his voice to an urgent rasp look youve got to stop him seeing her i i dont know if we can do that its not our job to deal with preventive crime management just because you think something might happen now it was crowleys turn to be condescending besides waldrens not even meant to know were tailing him and hes not exactly going to get far with anyone with my two men sitting right over his car but youve got to do something i dont want him speaking to her is that clear no it wasnt not really but with one daughter now missing for over forty hours crowley conceded that ryalls reasoning powers were probably heavily bruised as i say i dont think theres much we can do but you could of course phone her yourself warn her off from meeting him if thats what hes got in mind thanks youve been a big help for the second time crowley found himself left holding a dead line with ryall ryall tried mikaya first in her dorm room no answer then he tried to raise her through her tutor or whatever lectures she might be in at that moment but still no luck all he was left with was the registrar secretarys consolation weve got messages out for her with the note that its urgent im sure shell call you back as soon as shes able yes thank you im sure she will by then it would probably be too late waldren could already be with her in a study room or quiet corner questioning her ryall started trembling a tingling heat rising up through his neck to his face his secretary looked away as he looked up sharply turtons revelation that the main reason given for lorenas abduction was for her to undergo psychiatric counselling and now gordon waldren confronting mikaya it was like a onefamily allout assault he doubted that conventional childpsychiatry would uncover much but with repeated sessions the odds could rapidly worsen who knew for sure each extra hour with no news on lorena tightened the tourniquet on his nerves made him want to scream out loud part anxiety and fear part exasperation at the lack of control so alien to him mikaya too probably wouldnt recall anything but what worried him most with her was the time that had since elapsed how long did something like that stay buried at the back of the mind before it could finally be recovered twentytwo elena observed her hand shaking as she put her cup of herbal tea back in its saucer the shaking was less now but still evident another three squad cars shed passed that afternoon with her nerves on a knifeedge until theyd finally gone from view she should have known that trawling door to door across half of montreal the chances of crossing the path of the police would be greatly increased but the rationalisation did little to ease the tightrope pressure she didnt know how much more she could take of this shed dived into a local chemists after squad car number two which slowed for a second while the passenger officer gave her the onceover as she gave her by now standard doorstep pitch to stevens family sixteen or seventeen shed lost count and grabbed a bottle of natural nervecalming tablets their main ingredient was something called valerian and the label advised to take two tablets at four hour intervals she swilled down four straight away with an orange juice from a deppaneur then she started to recall the advice given by gordons doctor for him to combat stress and high bloodpressure and head off another heart attack avoid fatty foods dairy produce and high sugar intake avoid stimulants such as coffee and coke brandy and vodka were a definite nono but beer was okay in moderation and whisky was actually good for him has a calming effect and also thins the blood actually improves the circulation but again in moderation shed miss the kickstart of her normal five or six cups of fresh caffeine a day and already the craving for it was excruciating with the energy badly needed but sadly lacking to plod around yet another six or seven doors that evening before finally calling it a day the herbal tea was a poor substitute shed picked up three whisky miniatures at the same depanneur and had downed the first just before the next door call but shed held herself in check since hadnt taken any more she hadnt slept well the night before and with her eyes slightly bloodshot and her nerves frayed she was starting to look increasingly like a woman on the edge she couldnt help noticing that the doors were being opened more cautiously tentatively some people talking through only foot gaps if she started enveloping them in whisky fumes shed be given even less of a welcome the thought put a faint ironic smile on her face and from the side of the cafe she noticed lorena smiling back at her coming out in sympathy elena smiled more openly lorena was zapcrashing her way through tombraider on a game machine for the moment seemed happy untroubled brief respite from the pressure of the sessions and the tedium of reading harry potter or listening through the halfdozen more cassettes elena had bought her to help pass the carwaiting time while she continued with her doorstepping vigil each time hopefully the last one the one that would suddenly smile and invite her in rather than the succession of knit eyebrows and shaking heads ill bury him out of sight and out of reach who was she kidding two days and she didnt even have the faintest sniff of a lead and the way the sessions were going with lorena it didnt look likely that anything would be uncovered there either her father had got the better of her and now ryall too dominant men story of her life why should she be so surprised her hand gripped tight on her teacup as she took another sip at least she was consistent and when she returned to england defeated maybe even as soon as tomorrow she was facing a jail term for this gordon had made that clear on their last phone conversation the deadline for no charges being pressed was now almost twelve hours past no possible reprieve dont pass go dont collect go straight a plump woman in a thick quilted parka brushed past her heading for her table broke her from her mental maudlin middleaged afrocaribbean this area of east montreal around rue hochelaga had a heavy caribbean population both french and english with an equal mix of french canadians and a wider ethnic mix than probably any other area of the city making up the remainder halal butchers jostled next to greek steak houses burrito bars and deppaneurs selling yams and cassava with every so often shops that were boarded up and covered with posters and graffiti there were actually some areas of the city where elena hoped she wouldnt find him she didnt want to face the added guilt that his life might have been tough underprivileged she decided to try and buoy her spirits with some calls in a better area she paid hung over lorenas shoulder a moment while she finished her game then they headed north to the block between rue beaubien and diberville a stephanou this time halfway through the day it had suddenly struck her that her enquiry line was incomplete shed ask if there was a nicholas maria or george stevens in the house give respective ages and some background then that was it there was nowhere else to go she couldnt ask if they might be relatives because stevens was an assumed named and she began to wonder too about the choice of montreal if the sole purpose of the change to stevens was a common anglicised name to help bury them deeper in the city then why not chicago or new york where the population was almost completely anglophile maybe the choice of montreal was because they had relatives there she checked the phone book eight stephanous it added to her doorcall burden but at least she could feel assured that she was covering all the bases shed called on two earlier and this now was stephanou number three the street was wider and treelined and her hopes raised for a second when the elderly man that answered said there was a maria in the family but the age was wrong thirtyfour and shed moved to montreal only nine years ago elenas shoulders slumped and she closed her eyes for a moment as she sat back in the car pm shed hoped to squeeze in three or four more calls before calling it a night but the way she felt now she didnt think she could face it washedout dejected her nerves in shreds she hardly felt able to raise an ounce of spirit or energy for anything im sorry you havent been able to find him yet lorena said thoughtfully almost worriedly thats okay elena was about to add mechanically its not your fault but instead chewed at her lip for a second before commenting im sorry too to trail you around so much like this she reached across and gave lorenas hand a gentle squeeze youve been very good very patient elena looked again at her list and checked the map one stevens only five blocks away another within a mile she should at least check these two while she was here then see how she felt she could sense that lorena wanted to say something else it finally came as she started up and pulled out you know what the doctor asked about where i might go was it wrong that i mentioned perhaps staying with you no no not at all i i mean is that something that could happen if i had to leave the ryalls maybe i could keep your katine company and play with her be like a sister shed jumbled it all together before elena hardly had a chance to think about it elena reminded herself that lorena could at times be cute to get what she wanted leftover from her having to become streetwise before her time to survive in bucharest but the raw plea in lorenas voice came through strongest she was obviously deeply concerned what might happen to her elenas throat tightened ashamedly shed spared little thought to where lorena might go a good family somewhere yes without saying but not necessarily hers yes of course you know that id love to have you her voice was laden with assurance she pushed from her mind the chain of procedural nightmares that might make it impossible the whole mess uncovered with giving up her own child and her now being an abductor no longer made her exactly ideal adoption parent material but she sensed that right now it was more important to keep up lorenas hopes of a familiar welcome alternate home to hopefully ease the block in her mind yet another deceit to add to the heap albeit wellmeaning she tried not to dwell on the ludicrousness making promises to lorena when with the jailterm probably ahead shed have trouble even caring for the two she already had as she slowed to a stop at the next junction she noticed her hands were still shaking steadily on the steering wheel but at least the valerian pills had helped in one respect they made the lying easier and numbed some of the crushing burden of the problems she faced she felt oddly distanced from reality driving through the nighttime streets of a city strange to her with more purpose and more at stake than shed ever known before yet feeling totally aimless lost so what sort of problem is it with my father mikaya ryall arched an eyebrow as i said nothing serious gordon had already assured her on first approach that her father wasnt ill or anything looking agitatedly each side in the bustling university corridor hed added that all the same it was something hed prefer not to discuss too openly guarded nod from mikaya after a second and theyd headed to a nearby cafe has he phoned you in the last couple of days no why strange thought gordon either the ryalls panic with events had kept them from phoning her or it was an indication of some distance and barrier between them hed introduced himself as donald benham one of his clients because he hadnt wanted her blurting out waldren arent you the people whove abducted lorena shed have refused to speak to him theyd taken a seat by the far wall of the small cafe it was only a third full with about a dozen people interspersed the smell of bacon frying was heavy in the air but there was a nosmoking policy so there was only one pollutant to cope with gordon held one hand out and made an expression of strained apology well its young lorena you see shes been taken your stepparents know the person who has taken her so theres nothing to fear for her safety but it is the reason why im here that eyebrow again are you with the police no nothing like that i know both lorena and the person who has taken her though its more the reason why shes been taken thats brought me here gordon launched into the dramatic chain of events interrupted only by their coffees being brought to the table lorena and the two social services visits her stepfather blocking psychiatric counselling and then the final abduction all the while he watched mikayas expression especially her eyes large darkbrown with only a slight slant but he was looking more for the shadows her reaction as he spoke fivesix slim with sleek dark hair almost to her waist and a warm if cautious smile she was stunning it was hard to get away from the thought that ryall chose his stepdaughters primarily for their beauty heavier shadows as he mentioned lorena possibly being interfered with but that could have been just the shock reaction most people would have to such news are you with the social services she asked no let us just say im a family friend who knows everyone involved including the aid worker who has taken her for counselling and i sympathise with the reasons why gordon took the first sip of his coffee now for the difficult part but you know i wondered if there was anything from your own past experiences with your stepfather that would lead you to think that lorena might in fact be telling the truth more delicate than just asking straight out if her stepfather might have molested her as well but the only effect was a seconds delay before the shock realization hit her she stood up abruptly shaking her head i really dont think this is a good idea us talking please i ive come a long way he half raised lightly clutching her arm his eyes imploring the woman who has taken lorena has done so with all good intention only because she didnt see any other option and couldnt bare the thought of just leaving her at your stepfathers mercy if something is happening but she could be in a lot of trouble for whats shes done and she happens to be a very nice person someone i care a lot about uncertainty the shadows in mikayas eyes darker gordon was sure in that moment that she knew something it surfaced only fleetingly then was pushed back as she pulled her arm away im sorry i cant talk to you she half turned found it hard to meet the plea in his eyes anyway nothing happened to talk about she hitched her bag hastily back on her shoulder she was flustered the bravado uncertain gordon could tell that she was lying whatever had happened the thought of it suddenly resurfacing to face again was making her intensely anxious he observed her hand shaking on her bag he clutched back at her arm i know its difficult but please if you can help if you can think of anything the woman whos taken lorena could face prison if shes got it wrong about her gordons tone was urgent but low under his breath so that others in the cafe couldnt hear still a few were starting to look at them an older man clutching at the arm of a beautiful young girl the girl agitated and eager to get away a lovers tiff that looked like it might develop interestingly im sorry im sorry mikaya shook her head again and looked close to tears she kept her eyes stoically from meeting his as if afraid of what he might see there i just cant help you she pulled her arm back and turned away please what about the pregnancy anything you can tell me gordon had to raise his voice slightly because she was already a couple of paces away others in the cafe did hear this time confirming their suspicions but mikaya was head down shoulder bag clutched tight to her along with her secrets and didnt look back as she headed out elena didnt look round at first as the policeman walked in the shop she was too busy trying to watch and direct what lorena picked up from the shelves left to her own devices shed pick up an armful of sweets pop magazines and cds when all theyd come in for was some soft drinks and a chocolate bar it was quite a large depanneur almost a small supermarket she only half turned as she felt the presence of the figure a couple of paces behind black leather jacket and dark navy trousers motorcycle boots wide black belt with baton and gun french writing arched over an insignia on his jacket epaulette a tall rangy man at least sixthree with his crash helmet making him look even taller she looked away hastily her heart thudding wildly put her gaze back stoically on lorena as the policeman shuffled closer behind browsing along the newspaper and magazine shelf displays to one side look theyve got the spice girls but i think its in french lorena was looking down a rack of cds theyve got billie too and this ones in english do you think i could have it lorena lifted it out of the rack with a hopeful smile yes fine fine the last thing elena wanted to do was protest and lengthen the conversation if lorena had picked up cds shed have just dumbly nodded right great she didnt want to hiss lets go which was her first inclination the policeman might pick up on the tremor and haste in her voice tune into some problem so she just glared at lorena and shifted her eyes slightly to indicate the problem behind but lorena couldnt see the policeman because of her height and the shelf rack in between and before elena could catch her eye she was absorbed back with the cds for a second before moving further down pop posters cards chocolates lorena picked up a chocolate bar and a bag of toffees do you think they might have j no i dont think so the magazines are mostly in french come on elena silently screamed the policeman was now just two feet away she could almost feel his breath at her left shoulder shed injected a slight american lilt to her speech tried not to sound so english and she hadnt wanted to say straight out that they wouldnt have magazines from england her pulse was racing she could feel it wildly pumping a vein in her neck and her throat felt tight she could hardly swallow they could easily have traced where shed gone by now a dispatch alert rattling around in the back of policemans mind about an english woman with a young girl and then as he hears them talking it all finally gels the policeman approached the counter with a newspaper and magazine said something in french and handed across a note the boy at the counter pimply and barely out of his teens cashed it on the register and held out the change but the policeman seemed to remember something else at the last moment and pointed behind the boy et vingt winston elena observed with a sideways glance towards the till counter and the boy she didnt trust herself to look around fully at the policeman now directly at her side she stood there clutching a bottle of orange juice and a coke and could feel the policemans eyes on her for the first time as the counterboy reached behind for some cigarettes cinquantecinq cent plus the policeman handed some coins over and at the moment lorena emerged from behind the shelves maybe theyll have sug she stopped as she saw the policeman and her eyes went wide her hands suddenly seemed to lose coordination on the items she was clutching and she fumbled and dropped the bag of toffees her face flushed heavily as she bent to pick them up elena stepped sharp and got there before her she could just see lorena dropping everything in panic as she stooped okay thats everything now a statement so that lorena didnt have to respond as she straightened the policeman was smiling lightly at lorena hopefully thinking that lorena was merely surprised at seeing someone so large in uniform rather than anything else elena gave a tentative smile back as she put everything on the counter she pressed her hands against the counter so that hopefully he wouldnt notice them shaking and with a brief nod elena wasnt sure if it was at them or the counterboy shed pulled her eyes swiftly away he turned and left the heavy step of his motorcycle boots receded almost in time with her pounding heart and she thought never again she couldnt stand another minute of this let alone hours or days were looking believe me were looking jeanpaul closed his eyes for a second and held out one hand thats all he seemed to have done these past long hours make excuses make penance simone shook her head its almost two days now with no sign of him nothing i know somethings wrong seriously wrong i can feel it they were in jeanpauls study raphael had been talking to francesca the housemaid in the corridor outside enquiring whether two of his favourite sweat shirts were in the laundry or not and theyd shut the door for privacy simone looked worse than when shed first confronted him after her furious drinking binge two nights of fitful sleep and her worst fears bedding deeper with each hour had put dark circles under her eyes and her hair was lank unwashed her usually immaculate makeup scrappy she chewed nervously at the side of one nail how do you know romans not done something to him already i cant be sure i know his eyes closed for a second again more contrition im stuck with taking his word but if its a bluff its a good bluff dont forget its roman that right now has got half of montreal looking for him she switched off from what he was saying halfway through was lost again in her own thoughts its just what georges feared was why he asked me to talk to you like i said before simone i just dont think roman would do something like that without my sanction he might be hotheaded and irrational at times but hes not completely suicidal her first screams of accusation at first light the day after georges disappearance had been directed at jeanpaul with roman merely doing his dirtywork jeanpaul fired back that a sixmonth coolingoff period in cuba or mexico was what hed had in mind thats not how i do things any more and you more than anyone else should know that his reprimand carrying with it pascal and all hed fought so hard for since to make amends made her flush and softly say she was sorry and theyd turned their thoughts to roman possibly acting on his own jeanpaul had pointed out that there was little point in roman investing so much time convincing him that there was a problem with georges only to then suddenly jump the gun and take action himself even if he was of a mind to do it himself he could have done it long before he didnt need to waste breath on me yeah youre probably right simone agreed dolefully looking down she stopped nibbling her nail and pulled a lank strand of hair behind one ear the photos were back before them as the only reasonable explanation for his disappearance he knew that theyd been found and was embarrassed as hell knew that shed be furious and so hed gone to ground for a few days until she cooled off he was right on that count shed phoned at least thirty times between the two numbers each time ready to slam the phone straight down good now that ive got you this is just to say fuck off and never phone me again maybe hes looked up an old friend upprovince or out of quebec or headed to a skicabin for a while to rethink and reevaluate jeanpaul didnt add that the main reason he had roman trawling half of quebec wasnt to find her lost albeit fallenfromgrace love but because georges going to ground could be the final signal that he was about to talk to the rcs roman could have been right all along or maybe even hes gone on a short hop to mexico hes got a lot of friends and contacts down there now yeah hell probably surface later tonight or tomorrow and call me she eased a tentative smile the first in fortyeight hours and then i can kill him the policeman was a bad start to the day seemed to have sapped all of elenas energy barely a half an hour into her doorcalls or maybe it was the buildup of nerves the lack of sleep and the valerian pills and whisky shed downed the two remaining miniatures last night then had nursed another two at the hotel bar with alphonse after lorena had gone to bed now shed sunk another three valerian straight after leaving the depanneur with the policeman to steady her nerves she was a quivering jelly frantic her trembling was clearly visible and as she looked in the cars vanity mirror after sinking the pills she noticed a small muscle spasm at intervals below her left very bloodshot eye she looked more like a hardline heroine case the spasm eased after twenty minutes and her nerves settled she just felt numb but the problem was the numbness was all over her body and her step felt heavy laboured as she made her way towards the front door of her second call of the day her thighs and legs felt leaden as if they were weighted with sacks shed hoped to squeeze in three or four calls before lowndes session in just under an hour but the way she felt now this would probably be the last or maybe it was the repetitive nature of the calls the endless chain of headshakes frowns and sorrys creating her lethargy steadily grinding her down so that now she couldnt raise the faintest spark of hope or enthusiasm as she approached a fresh door it just wouldnt be any different more head shakes and frowns with nothing left but to trudge on to the next and the next and the she felt dizzy disorientated felt herself sway slightly her step unsteady she was deep inside the chine and with dusk approaching the light at its end was fast dying she started to head back up the slope to home but her legs felt heavy the same heaviness she felt now as she made her way up the four steps to a cream front door progress was slow she started to fear that she might not make it back up before the light died completely she wouldnt be able to find her way any more the darkness of the chine was intense no trace of moonlight or starlight filtered through the thick blanket of trees above and it suddenly hit her that the light at the end didnt just represent hope but that without it she wouldnt be able to find her way at all she was totally lost she rang the bell its chime lingered in her head for a second after she pulled her finger away but didnt she know her way in and out of the chine practically blindfold she been there so many times muted sound of footsteps approaching the other side suddenly she wasnt so sure she wasnt sure of anything any more and when after her standard pitch the man confronting her a stephanou in his late fifties nodded and with a strained grimace opened the door wide youd better come in she was still grappling with reality slightly lost it took her a moment to finally respond and walk into his house and realize that the light at the end of the chine was suddenly back again twentythree pardon bell canada madame oui oui cest vite odette donatiens opened the door wider to let the man in we noticed the line was dead but we havent even reported it yet i was just about to go to my neighbours and phone in carlo funicelli shrugged and smiled amiably we found a junction box burnt out with a short that effects you and three other houses which means that one of you has a problem with too much resistance on the line he followed her down the hallway slightly broad in the beam but still a good figure for what hed heard from roman was a midfifty year old the grey track suit and trainers maybe helped her look more youthful and there was only a touch of salt in her auburn hair so we thought wed better check oh right she could see him scanning to each side of the lounge she pointed its over there thanks funicelli smiled back at her as he reached the phone as if to say its okay now hoping that shed disappear for a moment and leave him to it but she just stood there looking at him as he undid the phone cradle casing could take a little while she stood there a moment more looking blankly on then jolted slightly oh sorry would you like coffee or something yes thanks that would very nice madame black white white no sugar thanks funicelli breathed a sigh of relief as she finally disappeared at a push he might have got away with the phone bug with her still watching but the other two would have been more difficult he had both in place one under the sofa another behind a sideboard within forty seconds of her turning away then started on the phone bug hed have to hurry the last thing he wanted was her coming back in and asking whats that or why was he tampering with the handset rather than the cradle as it was hed been nervous about the few minutes hed had to spend up a telegraph pole outside to disconnect her line if shed seen him through the window fine that tied in with his story now but he was more worried about a real bell engineer passing and seeing him his uniform looked authentic enough but a van with logo had been impossible to arrange hed parked his plain white van twenty yards along so that it was obscured from the donatiens view by some trees his hand shook slightly as he positioned the bug behind the earpiece and connected it sound of footsteps starting back along the hallway he clipped back the handset cover and tightened its one connecting screw then quickly shifted to putting the phone cradle casing back on as she walked in he gave the cradle a few more screwdriver turns as she put his coffee on a side table thanks there were a couple of wires touching that could have caused a problem so ive seperated them ill just check the socket then im done he busied himself undoing the socket and checking connections with a metre between sips of coffee while odette donatiens talked aimlessly lot brighter today for a change i might go out and do some gardening later yeah yeah looks like it could turn out nice he screwed the socket back together and knocked back the last of his coffee that should be okay now ill just reconnect on the junction box outside and youre ready to go she thanked him and showed him out and after another three anxious minutes on the telegraph pole outside hoping that no bell engineers passed or that none of the onlooking neighbours thought something was suspicious and decided to phone in funicelli drove away roman was probably right if anyone donatiens was bound to contact his stepparents at some stage but word was settling deeper on the streets that roman had already taken donatiens out and all of this frantic blanket search activity was merely a smokescreen for jeanpauls benefit funicelli had no firm thoughts on it either way if roman wanted to waste time with planting bugs that he knew already wouldnt bear any fruit it was his money viana couldnt help looking around as she stood in the boarding gate queue for her flight to haiti at new yorks jfk afraid that roman or one of his goons would appear at the last minute and stop her escape shed done the same at ticket checkin just an hour ago and at checkin and boarding for her flight from montreal to new york at am that morning only five people ahead of her in the queue now she could hardly believe her luck that she might actually get away the first warning sign had been azy early on last night you know that georges has disappeared what happened with you two the other night azy looked heavily concerned and kept his voice low even though hed chosen a moment when there was nobody at the bar he obviously saw her answer as potential dynamite not for anyone elses ears nothing i dont know what you mean she acted nonchalant he leant closer as he gave the bar a couple more wipes look viana what you get up to in private is your own business but the thing is i saw you get in his car the other night and then the very next day he disappears gives you plenty to think about no it was nothing he just gave me a lift home thats all she shook her head and got up from the bar how should i know whats happened to him but she could tell by azys eyes following her as she went back to dance that hed picked up on her nervousness was doubtful then roman came by the club two hours later with the same thing he disappeared the night after your place not a trace since hasnt been on to you has he if nothing else to ask what happened at your place that night no no nothing she tried to read the bluff in romans eyes but as usual she just couldnt tell poker face poker heart then she recalled him gloating at georges powerless on the bed and him pinching her cheek and telling her not to worry about what was going to happen to georges she felt certain in that moment that roman had killed georges hed been dumped at the bottom of a river or chopped into two or three sacks for a garbagetruck mangle or incinerator never to be found again and all of this was just a pretence to throw her off the scent he didnt want any possible leads back to his connection but how long was that going to last at some stage he was going to panic that with her knowing about the sex sting with georges she could provide a lead back and that would come sooner rather than later if azy let slip to roman that hed seen her get in georges car that night shed be next for the garbage sacks and incinerator roman kept her dancing for him for four records in a row and it was one of the hardest things shed ever done she was desperately afraid that hed notice how nervous she was a couple of times shed had to lithely snake away from his hand in case he connected and felt her trembling or how hard it was for her to force a smile and keep the small talk going he stayed another twenty minutes nursing a brandy at the bar with azy all the while her panicking that azy might mention about her getting in donatiens car then as soon as hed gone she headed for the bathroom and emptied her stomach she resolved then to leave that night she couldnt face roman another minute let alone night after night sitting like a caged bird waiting on when hed finally decide to kill her she got clear of the club at am and forty minutes later she was packed and heading back out of her apartment to mirabelle airport new york atlanta and new orleans were the best hubs for haiti the earliest she could get on was the am to new york now the pm from jfk to haiti a smiling stewardess held out one hand for her boarding card and welcomed her on board viana couldnt resist one last glance back to make sure that shed actually made it before returning the smile thank you elena found her eyes drifting to different objects in the room as sotiris stephanou talked a decorative plate with five different harbour and city views of limassol photos of a boy and two girls at what looked like their holy communions a horribly syrupy wedding portrait in sepia with its edges fading into misty heartshaped clouds elena could still see the likeness in sotiris of the young man he was then but it was harder to discern in his wife nana now a good fifty pounds heavier ferrying in with halva and cakes and a pot of thick strong coffee both to show good as a host and presumably the fuel to help her beloved recall events from almost thirty years ago sotiris shook his head a tragedy a real tragedy elena found it hard to catch up assimilate it all shed been starved of detail for so long twentynine years without hardly thinking about it then the forced drought of the last days and weeks and suddenly there was a torrent of information hitting her all at once a car accident over twenty years ago the boys stepmother maria killed his stepfather nicholas sotiris younger brother by three years heavily injured the boy surviving with only minor injuries when sotiris eyes had clouded with the first mention of tragedy and accident in the same breath her heart fell like a stone thinking for a moment that her son was dead she quickly masked her look of relief as sotiris filled in the details nodding in sympathy as sotiris remarked what a terrible ordeal it had been for his brother and how hed never really recovered from it believe me the last thing he wanted to do was let the child go if he could have possibly avoided that he would but he just couldnt cope the second stone fall what you mean let him go to another family elenas voice was slightly highpitched strained no that would have taken eight or nine months even if at that age little georgiou was almost four by then he could have been placed anywhere and when the problem hit with nicholas it hit hard and quick he felt he couldnt cope another day let alone months sotiris cast his eyes down found it hard to meet her searching stare directly im afraid the only choice in the end was an orphanage the third but this time the stab of pain went deeper made her feel emptier and number inside than a whole bottle of valerian pills her eyes shifted inadvertently to lorena in the car outside oh god how shed fooled herself shed clung to the false hope all those years that at least he might have had a good life somewhere but in reality it had been little more than a living hell one stepparent dead and then the other giving him away to an orphanage when he was barely four tears started to brim in her eyes and she kept her gaze turned away as she bit at her lip for more composure sotiris still clearly saw her distress and tried to lighten the impact it was a very good orphanage run by gray nuns if i remember right nicholas visited a couple of times and it was a nice place apparently they were very kind very caring i dont doubt that but what i dont understand is why your brother didnt keep him shed managed to push back the tears but still her voice was strained why he didnt at least try to make more of elena broke off lorena in the car outside with her explaining the reason for her visit and then sotiris talking shed got carried away with time at least half an hour had gone she checked her watch she should leave now for the session with lowndes but there was so much more she wanted to find out look im sorry about this but my young daughter is in the car outside and she needs to be downtown urgently do you know of a good reliable cab firm sotiris looked genuinely relieved at the shift to more comfortable ground where he could also be more helpful his cousin worked as a cabbie ill make sure its either him personally or one of his close friends that he knows he can trust you didnt want a tenyear old girl jumping in any old cab because it was a quiet time of day they were able to get his cousin dimitrios he arrived in only four minutes and sotiris gave him instructions that he was to walk the girl right to this doctors door and she wasnt to be left on her own for a minute elena told lorena that shed be there as soon as she could twenty minutes or half an hour but if im late stay right there at the doctors dont go anywhere in the fourminute wait for dimitrios sotiris explained that his brother had been crippled by the accident he wasnt a permanent wheelchair case otherwise he might have got permanent help only one leg was affected so he was allocated a home help two half days a week to take care of washing and chores but the rest of the time he was on his own he tried to cope but what got him in the end was selfpity because with half a leg lost he felt that both his job prospects and his chances of finding another woman were slight he felt that georgiou needed a womans touch and love and so he hit the bottle decided to drown out what hed lost and what he felt he could no longer provide for the boy within two months he was a hopeless case and the orphanage became practically the only option sotiris waved one hand towards the photos on the side cabinet as they sat back down inside we would have gladly had him ourselves but we already had three of our own and money was tight very tight im sorry no i understand i i suppose im just looking for others to point the finger because of my own guilt she hadnt told sotiris that her baby had been practically ripped from her arms she just said that shed been underage thered been a bit of family pressure and it had all very awkward at the time finally she made the decision to let him go the wrong decision she felt years later with the benefit of hindsight but shed mainly blanked it from her mind and hadnt troubled to look for him until now her eyes stayed on the cabinet for a second it was stuffed with silver and silver framed photos with decorative plates dotted inbetween mainly from cyprus and greece she saw only one from canada niagara falls the cabinet marked the main separation from the diningroom beyond dark wood furniture and still more decorative plates an oil painting of a terraced olive grove and a dark velvet and silverthread embroidery of the acropolis in contrast the lounge where they sat was modern beige leather sofa glass coffee table and an abstract and a david hockney print duelling from opposite walls it was as if the dining area represented their old life in cyprus and the lounge their new life in canada or perhaps sotiris and nana had already filled the dining room with family heirlooms so the children took charge of the lounges decoration and she suddenly realized why she was so interested sucking in every small detail sotiris had mentioned that his brother hadnt lived that far away then only eight blocks she was trying to get some measure of what georgious environment might have been like those few years she stopped the chain of thought abruptly chiding herself only eight blocks but a million miles in heart and spirit stepmother dead and a stepfather intent on blotting out what little life he felt was left with drink the only hope was that georgiou had been too young to remember it all that the scars wouldnt have been too longlasting we wondered at the time didnt we sotiris aired this more towards his wife than elena nana just nodded as she nibbled at some halva there was all this talk about some problem with them having children and getting fertility treatment from some doctor in london dr maniatis elena prompted i i dont remember im not even sure they mentioned a name at the time maniatis was the only likely middleman elena could put between her father and the childless stephanous she nodded and sotiris continued well anyway suddenly there was a child but the gap seemed to short and we thought we would have heard something as soon as she was pregnant sotiris ran one hand through his thinning hair we guessed that theyd probably adopted but we never stuck our noses in and pushed them on it we thought maybe nick had heard the problem was down to him and they were embarrassed to talk about it you know male pride and all that especially greek male pride sotiris forced a weak smile and the new name stevens my god we argued over that the smile quickly died i told him he should be proud of the name stephanou like i was not try and bury his roots and his heritage but he said that he wanted to make a fresh start didnt want to be seen as ethnic and have any possible discrimination that might hold him back or his new son for that matter we didnt see eye to eye on that one i can tell you things were strained between us for quite a while they were silent for a second what happened to your brother elena asked he met someone else eventually about five years later and a few years after that they ended up going to cyprus to settle there too many bad memories here i suppose sotiris eyes drifted slightly melancholy at the lost years or something that would have been best left not recalled i think he felt a lot of guilt later about giving up georgiou but by then it was too late why what happened elenas interest was piqued though the last thing she wanted was to empathise with nicholas stephanou especially not on the guilt front she surely had the market cornered there well not long after meeting this woman and finally getting his act together clean of the drink once and for all he went to the orphanage hoping to see georgiou but he was too late hed already left and been placed with a family how long before elenas spirits raised a fraction maybe hed had a more settled and happy family life the second time around fifteen eighteen months i think sotiris shrugged im not totally sure elena calculated three and a half years in the orphanage almost eight years old before he was finally picked off the shelf again she reminded herself that it would have been a far cry from the orphanages she was used to in romania if it wasnt too austere or cool an environment hopefully the experience wouldnt have been then quickly stopped herself again realized she was just rationalising to ease the weight of guilt shed felt settling heavier as sotiris talked she checked her watch again shed covered practically everything and lorena would already be over halfway through her session by the time she got there do you remember the name of this orphanage i dont remember exactly but its in a small town about seventy miles upprovince baie de something sotiris pulled at the air with his fingers for the exact memory baie du febvre nana prompted yes thats it du febvre and its the only orphanage there run by nuns i would think so it shouldnt be difficult to find elena thanked them for the help and the coffee and cake said that shed better go catch up with my daughter as they were walking along the hallway sotiris commented you know its funny we had a man phone a while back asking exactly the same thing about where young georgiou had gone when was this did he give a name elena turned by the door five six years ago he didnt give a full name just said he was tony an old friend of nicks from when he had young georgiou said he was curious what might have happened to the boy thats all tony tony her nerves tingled the name spinning in her head as she drove to lowndes office but she finally discarded it as a coincidence why bury the boy out of sight only to try and find him again years later it made no sense no it was obviously just some other friend of the stephanous lorena was forty minutes into her session when elena arrived and the receptionist informed her that dr lowndes thought it best that she not interrupt hed talk to her afterwards and shed be able to listen to the tape so she decided to use the wait with the receptionist to find out the name of the orphanage in baie du febvre eight minutes of leafing through quebec telephone directors and two calls later and she had the name convent de st marguerite she phoned and made an appointment pm that afternoon hangingup she tapped the details shed scrawled on a piece of paper thoughtfully with one finger with the nightmare saga from sotiris she was already regretting coming on this odyssey her sons real life was so opposed to the gloss image shed fixed in her mind to help ease her guilt she wasnt sure she could face any more nightmare tales michel chenouda sat quietly as the three men the other side of the conference table leafed through the thick file before them the exact same copy for each of them he let out a quiet cough muffled with one hand at one point then the heavy silence again only the sound of flicking pages and the faint airrush of the heating vents below the tintedglass windows behind the men the view was over ottawas mcarthur avenue seven floors down the man at the centre superintendent neil mundy silverhaired with sharp blue eyes in an otherwise nondescript rotund ruddy face was the first to look up so your claim is that the lacaille family organized this hit now on georges donatiens who apparently worked as a money man for their organization yes thats right its all there dates times movements michelle pointed across at the file how they set it up is almost identical to a hit on eric leduc back in february part of which was monitored by us during a surveillance operation yeah i can see that mundy flicked back a couple of pages before returning to the place he held with one finger by chenoudas summary notes pretty cheeky huh right under your noses wry awkward grimace from chenouda but mundy rolled straight on without waiting for response and your reason for coming to us here now is that youre afraid theres a leak in your department yes i i think it was how the lacailles knew about the setup with leduc and perhaps also how they knew theyd have to jump quick with donatiens mundy arched one eyebrow sharply almost doubtingly and as if to add support to what he was thinking at that moment inspector kaufman to his right commented thats quite a serious charge i know michelle nodded and cast his eyes down for a second otherwise i wouldnt be here troubling your department with it s the ottawabased rcmp department you went to when you suspected internal corruption or an information leak and there was nowhere else left to go ultrasecret and the ultimate sanction over every other rcmp department to mundys left was inspector bob welch his first point of contact when hed approached them you didnt think this was something you could go to your department head with mundy checked the file for the name chief inspector pelletier surely you dont suspect hes in on it too no i well i just dont know it could be anywhere up or down the chain from him or sideways i just didnt want to take the risk mundy nodded thoughtfully the questions continued for a while mainly clarifying details already in the file then michelle was asked to wait in the adjoining annexe while the three discussed his request privately for a moment michelle waited almost another twenty minutes before mundy finally reappeared with the good news request approved michelles smile was slow in rising as he shook mundys hand the uncertainties that had settled during the wait finally slipping away his first judgement had been right after all the combination of such a large organized crime strike and internal corruption s would find impossible to resist mundy passed him a sheaf from a notepad phone this man at three this afternoon inspector steven graydon right here in ottawa ill have already spoken to him by then so hell have been fully primed to provide the men and the backup you need from hereon in mundy patted his shoulder and perfunctorily checked his watch and if we can move everything along as fast as i hope perhaps we can aim to make an official announcement by say ten or eleven tomorrow okay michelles step was light for the first time in weeks as he left the building no more leaks or interdepartmental wrangling that he could see to stop him from now finally nailing the lacailles his only regret was that things might have been different with donatiens but with a game of chess this big there were always pawns that ended up having to be sacrificed twentyfour i think weve had a breakthrough at last with the problem with lorena lowndes had ushered elena into his office straight after the session leaving lorena for a moment with the receptionist he glanced briefly towards the closed door as if worried she might still hear or at least what is probably the main key to the problem oh right elena sat forward slightly one bit of hopeful news at last though it took a moment to seep through her valerian haze and the days slings and arrows with sotiris and the orphanage her mind was mostly on what might await her there there was one thing that troubled me at one point but once again im afraid we didnt get that far with lorena remembering anything directly happening with your husband my ploy of easing up any subliminal pressure on her psyche didnt quite work as id hoped or more likely i believe now theres simply no such direct memory there i see elena was suddenly adrift lowndes two comments were completely at odds but tell me more about this eileen the aid worker lowndes opened out his hands i think we might have hit on something there why i i dont understand elena stumbled frantically trying to gather her thoughts further adrift what on earth had lorena said in the session she cursed herself now for not being there and listening in shes very competent and cares a lot about lorena but i dont see what i think thats the problem right there mrs waldren she possibly cares too much or rather lorena has tuned into the fact that she does and might have purposely played on her emotions with this situation now youll see what i mean when you listen to the tape now did lorena insist that eileen was told about this possible problem with your husband early on panic gripped elena she couldnt even remember what shed said last time i think so maybe but im just not sure now lorena says that she was told about the problem almost straight away i see right probably yes elena felt her whole body flush hot her palms were suddenly clammy this was a nightmare all she could think of was getting away from lowndes clutches and listening to the tape before she said anything to possibly put her foot in it this eileen i understand was the main one to help lorena through her tough orphanage days particularly after her time living rough in the sewers and she also helped a lot i believe in getting her placed in england with you smoothing the way yes yes she did one safe foothold and when this new problem came up and lorena wanted her to mediate with social services was eileen keen to get involved did she rally to help quickly i im not sure she was frantically searching again for where to put her feet she began to panic that lorena had let slip about the abduction or at least had made lowndes suspicious and now he was testing trying to draw her out i i suppose so because im beginning to fear that all of this might be just a cry for help mainly for this eileens benefit to get her attention but at the same time youve got sucked in too elenas head was spinning with it all she started trembling she just had to get away and listen to the tape she stood up abruptly glancing at her watch look im sorry theres somewhere else im meant to be now and all of this has caught me a bit by surprise id rather us talk when ive had a chance to listen to the tape soak it all in i understand lowndes got up to open the door but kept one hand flat against it for a second in a nutshell what im trying to say is that this eileen has been there to help lorena with all the main dramas of her life and through all of that theyve formed an attachment probably closer than we appreciate then lorena is with you and your husband and everythings hunkydory and suddenly theres no dramas any more and therefore also no eileen lorena craves that attention again and the close bond she had with eileen as a result so she creates her own new drama yes i i suppose it makes some sense lowndes words touched a raw uneasy chord deep inside her her world had already been tilted ninety degrees with sotiris that morning now it was being turned completely on end nothing was what it seemed any more or was it just the valerian pills and the lack of sleep making her feel so adrift detached from reality her pulse stabbed at her temples and a grey film washed behind her eyes she feared that if lowndes didnt hurry and open the door she was going to black out right there and then oh one word of warning some parts of the tape are probably best not played in lorenas presence she gets quite distressed at points and as before certainly dont play my notes at the end while shes listening right right all elena could focus on was the door ahead the trembling reached her legs she felt them weakening threatening to crumple then suddenly the door was open and she was walking into the reception area she hoped that she wasnt swaying or looked unsteady small smile from lorena as she stood up elena gave her a light embrace with one arm something to steady her at least as she turned to lowndes ill call you later and swiftly led lorena out elena was still trembling slightly miles north of montreal on the open highway heading for baie du febvre on the outskirts of montreal shed stopped at a radio shack and picked up a set of headphones to plug into the cars cassette player she was going to be with lorena all day and she couldnt bear waiting till that night to hear what was on tape the salesman had at first offered her an impressive studioquality set with bulbous cushioned earpieces but in the end shed gone for the most discreet set with thin black wire and small black earpieces that would be mostly hidden by her hair it would be an ironic slap of fate to be stopped by the police for wearing headphones while driving but still she was careful not to put them on and start listening to the tape until she was well clear of montreal and driving with open fields each side not a police car in sight lorena had said that she was sorry as soon as theyd jumped in the car he asked a lot of questions about this eileen well you and i just didnt know what to say half the time lorena looked disconsolate close to tears perhaps partly in sympathy with how shaken elena appeared thats alright it wasnt your fault i should have been there she was sure lowndes hadnt given away his suspicions to lorena and there wasnt much more she could say herself until shed listened to the tape gauged the extent of damage it was getting worse by the minute lorena lying to lowndes lowndes lying to lorena and her in the middle halfzonked with valerian whisky and sleepdepravation pathetically trying to juggle it all when she already had a full set of balls in the air from her own lies of the past twentynine years and this was proving to be the day when the balls were finally starting to slip from her grasp hit the ground with a thud of reality still she felt awkward playing the tape with lorena looking over at intervals so after the first eight minutes she stopped it and didnt press play again until lorena dozed off thirtyodd miles into the drive he was standing by the bedside saying that it was okay i was very tired couldnt remember and youre sure you were asleep at that point that you were only dreaming yes yes im pretty sure and he was saying some numbers seven eight the first event of any significance the first minutes on tape had been mostly reestablishing the ground built up in the last session probably what had troubled lowndes at one point she could see where lowndes was coming from it was the sort of conversation that happened when you were awake it wasnt particularly dreamlike some numbers was that part of a story perhaps something from school or was he saying that you couldnt remember the numbers i i dont remember now it wasnt clear and did you talk back at any point did you say anything in return to your stepfather no no i didnt it was just him talking all the time which then was more dreamlike elena reflected one voice talking no twoway conversation lowndes asked if her stepfather touching her was part of the same dream yes but later later there seemed to be a gap in between as if id slept a bit in the middle without dreaming and it was a second dream lorenas breathing was laboured and unsettled i i didnt like it i know thats why youre here calming tone from lowndes but i dont need to know about the specifics of him touching you in the dream its just enough for you to say that it was where it shouldnt have been lower down yes yes it was even that simple admittance seemed difficult for lorena to make her breathing becoming more laboured staccato but what im more interested in is did you talk to your stepfather then say or shout back anything in protest ask him to stop i wanted to i tried but it was as if my voice was trapped in my throat and i couldnt make any noise however much i tried i felt stifled somehow couldnt breathe and then i was back in the sewers again with the waters rising it went up quickly above my head started to fill my mouth and nose and i was trying hard to scream out for help but i i just couldnti its okay its okay heavily placating with an edge of concern its just to get clear that you didnt at any time speak to your stepfather while all this was happening no no i didnt elena could tell that for lowndes that practically sealed it he saw it as hardly conceivable that lorena would have said nothing if shed been awake he moved onto the subject of eileen the questions were relaxed and conversational at first no edge when did you first meet her did you see her a lot while you were at the orphanages so she helped you quite a bit through those days you became quite close then when you arrived in england did you see her much then lorena answered calmly casually she obviously felt she could talk freely without worry about the period before her problem with ryall but elena felt the tension building with each question because she knew already that a trap was looming lowndes gradually circled in so with you not seeing much of eileen once you were in england you must have missed her yes i suppose i did a little the first hesitation from lorena i mean youd become so close from before shed become one of your closest friends and practically the only person you felt you could confide in yes i i suppose she had the hesitation was marked now probably lorena didnt see where lowndes was heading yet but she was obviously becoming unsettled at so many questions centred around eileen is that why you confided in eileen with this problem now yes but i told my mother first lorena was suddenly more alert wary starting to fight back i only told eileen because my mother couldnt be in the interviews with me and i didnt want to be on my own with someone i didnt know from social services i wanted someone there i knew i appreciate that slow exhalation from lowndes as if he was slightly peeved at getting dragged from his target but without this new drama now with your stepfather its unlikely youd have even seen eileen again there would have been no reason for you to see her i i dont know i havent thought about it lorena was on uncertain ground again and that would have made you very sad wouldnt it because you liked eileen in fact before your stepmother she was the person you felt closest to elena bit at her lip what lowndes didnt know and made it all the more poignant was that in lorenas mind at that moment eileen and her stepmother were one and the same lorena paused for a moment only the shallow fall of her breath coming over on tape finally yes thats true that would have made me sad elena glanced over at lorena curled slightly away in sleep and felt like suddenly swinging the car in and hugging her tight one simple sentence that somehow made all the long years of her work in the orphanages worthwhile however much it might have given them a dilemma now with lowndes and so this problem with your stepfather at least gave you something youd long missed and craved seeing eileen again being close to her again and sharing a problem with her like the good old bad old days in romania yes thats so i like eileen a lot and i lorena faltered with an uneven intake of breath almost a gasp shed seen where lowndes was heading a suspended second then as she let her breath free but i wouldnt have done anything like that to eileen she took a very great risk taking me away and she stopped herself again suddenly realizing taking you away oh god she should have been there the pressure on lorena must have been insufferable elena would have probably decided to throw in the towel and bare all to lowndes felt that it was all too much for lorena to face alone but once again shed put her own quest first and left lorena forgotten yes my my mother asked eileen to take me away one day to see her house and the nearby chine and beach but in fact it was to talk about my problem with my stepfather my stepfather found out and was very angry about it told on eileen to the social services elena couldnt resist hissing yes under her breath lorenas bucharest streetwiliness obviously had its uses right i see lowndes had little choice but to accept it but the lingering doubt was evident in his voice he went back for a moment to the dreams and her stepfather as if seeking one last affirmation that she remembered absolutely nothing on that front while awake then he closed the session lowndes summary notes merely went through in more detail the concern hed voiced earlier now with the benefit of the tape for almost pointbypoint illustration but listening to lowndes elena couldnt help wondering as she looked across at lorena so innocent while asleep but perhaps her life so far had made her wily and complex rather than just confused and vulnerable whether lowndes assessment might be right after all her bond with lorena was far more acute than he even realized lorenas bond with nicola ryall was almost nonexistent so even long before this makeshift roleplay now elena had been filling both roles mother and helper saviour it was a powerful combination st margueritas became progressively quieter the atmosphere heavier as elena started along the cloisterstyle corridor away from the main front building a flatfronted gothic stone edifice threestoreys high elena suspected the childrens dormitories took up the top two floors with the classrooms and playrooms on the ground floor elena spotted a playground area to the side of the building as shed parked and at pm it was quite active and noisy beyond the play area was farmland with the warehouse units and sawmills on the edge of baie du febvre visible half a mile away elena had stood for a moment taking it all in not too bad an environment and view and possibly the warehouse units had only appeared in the last ten or twenty years when little george had been here probably the she shook her head and turned abruptly to head in no more mental compensating after the event flanking the left of the cloister corridor were four arched windows interspersed one stained glass one clear looking onto a small courtyard with a statue of st marguerite at its centre elena could see a grey nun reading on a bench under st marguerites outstretched palm elena and lorena were led the way by sister bernadine who twothirds along the corridor indicated towards three upright chairs to the side if youd like to wait there i wont be a moment sister bernadine walked to a door a few yards further along and with a light knock and a small tight smile back at them went inside the silence was intense as they waited the sound of the children in the playground outside was muted and distant barely audible this section wrapping around the courtyard was twostoreys on one side and singlestorey the remaining three elena got the impression that this was the nuns private quarters cut away from the noise of children so that they could concentrate on administrative paperwork and prayer elena glanced back towards the door bernadine at least appeared helpful keen to please and had a ready smile elena knew that orphanages could be strict about passing on information hopefully bernadines seeming compliance was an encouraging sign but moments later as she left lorena in the corridor with a hopefully wont be long and bernadine ushered her into the room elena modified that hope on sight of the woman behind the large oak desk before her small no more than foureleven midfifties almost twenty years older than therese and wearing thick glasses that gave her an owlish stern countenance not aided by the scant economical smile upon greeting bernadine introduced her as sister therese but her english is not perfect so ill translate where necessary elena eased herself down in the proffered seat another oldwood upright with faded red velvet seat covering elena felt her spirits sag another notch language as a possible extra barrier between her and sister therese but with a fresh breath she launched into it as best she could she was careful not to mention she became pregnant underage a bad footstart with nuns she just said that she was sixteen at the time very young and her family and her had made a joint decision because of her studies and college plans at that time vocational aims seemed a better bet to get their understanding she admitted though that shed suffered guilt years later at what shed done and this had led to her working with orphaned children in romania vocation and guilt piling on the empathy stakes she avoided too the problems with lorena she said that her involvement in a heartfelt reunion between one of the romanian children and her family had finally made her realize that an important part of her life was missing and would probably remain so until i find him despite the lies just talking about it brought the pain of the separation and the lost years to the surface and elena felt the onset of tears welling she cast her eyes down for a second more empathy thats why the special trip now all the way from england i was given the name of your orphanage just this morning by my sons stepuncle at the time sotiris stephanou i phoned straight after for this appointment now elena had aimed her set speech at sister therese with only occasional glances towards bernadine and hopefully had come across as appropriately humbled and beseeching it was difficult to tell with the translation at intervals from sister bernadine she translated only selected segments so either therese had rudimentary english or bernadine was heavily editing from sister thereses few basic confirming questions in english that followed it was obviously the former elena clarified that stephanou was the family name before the change to stevens then the approximate dates when young georges had first arrived at st marguerites and then finally left for a new family sister therese spent a moment more checking through two files and a large register book on her desk yes george stevens i see it now she traced along with one finger for a second before looking up im sorry i dont think we can help i i dont understand elena looked at the register accusingly incredulous that it might lead to such a blunt assertion so quickly dont you have the information i want no no we have it all here its not that sister therese turned to bernadine and spoke in rapid french her english had obviously gone as far as it could bernadine explained in the register we make note of any children who later contact us and express the desire to have contact with their parents if the parents have also contacted us or later do so we then pass that information on to the child its the only criteria we have for putting the two parties together elena nodded thoughtfully similar to the adoption contact register and for that matter most orphanages she more than anyone knew that the child had to make the running but shed come too far leapt too many obstacles and dangers to entertain possible failure at this final hurdle now but now that ive made contact you could pass this on to my son and still leave the decision with him as to whether he wanted direct contact with me or not i know he would im quite sure there wouldnt be any problem with that just the delay shed have to wait on in quebec another two or three days for his response another burst of french between therese and bernadine sister therese spoke this time im sorry im afraid theres nothing we can do the system weve set up is the only one by which contact can be made elena couldnt help wondering if theyd done this before it looked almost a routine therese for blank refusals bernadine if any elaboration was necessary the threeway nature of the conversation put an extra obstacle to fighting back but having battled through adoption registers ryalls investigator run the gauntlet with police on two continents and endured the doorstep vigil of the last two days she was damned if she was going to let herself be defeated by two nuns elena smiled wanly im sorry too because i know from my own work that theres a legal principal by which youre duty bound to notify my son that ive made contact it was a bluff the principal held only for the acr the rules differed between orphanages but it was the only straw she could think of clinging to sister thereses eyebrows knitted heavily as bernadine translated therese fired back sternly in french without looking at elena suddenly she was invisible and therese was showing her indignation by not gracing her with any more english with a fresh breath awkwardness at getting caught in the crossfire more than impatience bernadine translated sister therese says that unfortunately we have our own strict rules rules that are explained to both the parents leaving children with us and adopting parents these become part of our contract with them the right to bring up that child without later harassment or interference and we dare not breach that if your son hasnt told us of his desire to make contact with his parents im afraid theres nothing we can do sister therese really is truly sorry elena was sure that therese hadnt offered any apology her expression was too stern unyielding and her french hadnt extended that long bernadine was obviously edgesoftening now as well as elaborating regardless it was all slipping away the light at the end of the chine was suddenly more distant dull again and when elena listened for the sound of the children in the play area she could no longer hear them either playtime was over or sister thereses office was too distant remote from the children to hear anything remote from any emotional involvement elena had a sudden image of young george as he was then scurrying in the playground or through the corridors and classrooms of st marguerites along with the other children and then when he might have fallen from grace he was suddenly cut off from them and brought along this same cloister the noise of his friends receding with each step until he reached this deathly silent foreboding office to face some predecessor of sister therese and know his fate she wished shed been there to hold his hand but pathetically she couldnt even put a face to that lone figure she hadnt asked sotiris for any photos nor had he offered any probably he had none but she had no idea what her son looked like at any age she felt a sudden tight knot in her chest anger frustration or her sinking spirits as it dawned on her that a whole lifetime of images and memories were lost to her never to be regained but the rest of her just felt numb it seemed so unreal unjust that it could all possibly end here now you have no idea what ive been through to get here suddenly she was on remote scramble in the hope of striking a more poignant chord ive even brought my daughter with me all the way from england to see him how do you think shes going to feel when i tell her she cant see her older brother the brother shes never seen shes so built up this moment in her mind hoping to finally meet him the tears were suddenly welling again threatening to brim over this time of course the lost hope was all hers but that was almost too painful to voice would probably have made her break down in racking sobs on the spot much easier and more likely to evoke sympathy to transpose it all to a tenyear old girl sister therese and bernadine looked more concerned at this and some more rapid french flew between them absolutely everything hung by a thread on what was said next elena realized her hands started to shake and she pressed them firmer into her lap in the moments on the drive when her mind had drifted to how to approach everything and how she might handle the unthinkable of them saying no shed found herself becoming nervous she feared that would be counterproductive so shed blanked her mind to it still a trace of nerves remained so halfanhour before the meeting shed downed two more valerian pills now those were beginning to wear off or the intensity of the moment was pushing her agitation above even their effect sister therese says that shes truly sorry bernadine cast her eyes down as if she was consoling over bereavement or found it difficult to meet the plea in elenas eyes headon she fully appreciates the time and trouble youve put in coming here now but there really is nothing we can do to help our hands are tied the finality of the words the immovable brick wall shed suddenly run into hit elena with a jolt it was as if the pressure had been quietly building up for the past twentynine years then suddenly it became too much and shed been shot like a champagne cork through the drama of the past days search agencies abducting lorena customs ducking the police her grinding doorcall vigil with a seemingly endless succession of frowns and headshakes a diet of valerian and whisky just to keep her going and finally the breakthrough with sotiris but shed been gathering momentum all along not seeing not preparing herself for the possible deadend ahead and as it came now it hit her with a jolt took her breath away and its surreality made her slightly dizzy surely she couldnt have gone through all of that only to hit this brick wall now she had to fight back but she felt tired oh so tired and her scrambled mind couldnt grapple onto what might be left to fight back with nothing left but to beg she leant across the desk please please she slid one hand across to make contact with thereses hand added weight to her imploring but thereses hands were almost out of reach and she pulled them tighter into herself and looked alarmed if you have an ounce of compassion left in your heart elena felt her tears brimming over running cool down her cheeks and her trembling ran deeper now gripping her whole body it was clearly visible in her hand reaching across the desk and from the shock on sister thereses face she probably did in that moment look like the halfcrazed heroine addict shed viewed earlier in the mirror some more words between therese and bernadine before they turned to her again a defensive tone but it was suddenly quieter more distant she could hardly tell if it was french or english being spoken their figures too were now more distant like two apparitions in the last fading light at the end of the chine and as the greyness behind her eyes washed through she watched their figures slowly tilt as the floor rushed up to meet her voices distant voices highpitched excitable the voices from the playground were back again then suddenly they were closer elena could hear the clatter of footsteps at the end of the cloister corridor a group of children were looking on at her their voices now muted to hushed whispers young george was among them and he broke free and ran towards her he put one hand on her shoulder gently shaking are you okay now are you okay then another voice ive brought you coffee coffee and as it all finally fell into focus elena saw that it was lorena shaking her shoulder are you okay now elena are you awake and bernadine was standing to one side looking equally as concerned as she held out a cup she was back sitting next to lorena in the cloister corridor she shook the last woollyness from her head and took the proffered cup thanks she noticed her hand still shaking holding the cup but the aroma and the first warm liquid cutting the dryness in her throat felt good she closed her eyes for a second in appreciation as she opened them she noticed a group of small children looking on from the end of the cloisters where it joined the classroom corridors they were quickly ushered away by a grey nun following behind she was sure she saw one of them smile probably things hadnt been so bad here but the fact was she was never going to see him again now the emptiness she felt inside at that realization was overwhelming but at least there was one compensation she didnt have to battle on any more and try and find him she felt she hardly had the energy left to continue anyway she was so battleworn and weary so as a result perversely she felt a strange sense of serenity a feeling that she could finally let loose her breath let it all wash away from her and say its over no more doorcalls obstinate nuns and ducking from the police just home with gordon christos and katine her warm and familiar bed her studio and paintings the chine and the fresh sea breezes and life as it was before the nightmare started and as for lorena oh jesus she bit lightly at her bottom lip between coffee sips at the thought of what might happen there lorena so concerned about her as if she was the only person in this world she felt close to or cared about which sadly was probably true and yet even if the nuns had told her where george had gone she was about to betray lorena send her packing back to england everything lowndes had said in his last session had begun to stack up in her mind as uncomfortably true all the signals were there her close attachment to lorena going back all the way to romania lorenas distance not only from her stepfather but also nicola ryall her being the first person lorena had called for help lorenas ready agreement to the abduction and her excitement at times on the trip almost as if it was some sort of holiday then finally lorena asking if she could stay with her permanently maybe i could keep your katine company and play with her be like a sister even if the mosaic didnt slot together so well and lowndes had somehow got it wrong there was nowhere left for her to go with it theyd tried their damnedest to uncover something with ryall and still no light in sight further sessions would just hit the same stone wall and she couldnt possibly return to lowndes with this now that he felt he had the right bone in his mouth hed just continue gnawing at lorenas attachment to eileen lorena would either crumple under the pressure or her abduction would finally be uncovered no shed decided just before going in to see the nuns there was no option left but to put lorena on the first flight back to england are you feeling better now elena i was very worried about you that gentle angels wings touch of fingers on her shoulder elena shuddered at the thought of what she had planned for her lorena would no doubt see it as a form of betrayal or at the least that she was once again being discarded given up on but there was no choice no choice yes im fine now fine she nodded and closed her eyes again for a second at least that might now help soften the blow she could tell lorena that theyd be flying back to england together nothing left here for either of them elena sensed bernadine hovering to her side as if she wanted to say something bernadine glanced anxiously back towards the door of sister thereses office then slipped a piece of paper from the folds of her habit and pressed it into elenas hand elena looked at the piece of paper almost indignantly what is this ticket perhaps to the convent fete as apology for giving her such a hard time she unfolded it two names claude and odette donatiens and a montreal address bernadine leant over whispering conspiratorially thats where hes gone but i havent given it to you okay another nervous glance back to sister thereses office okay barely audible mumble elena stared at it blankly a moment more she should have felt elated and leapt up and hugged bernadine until she turned blue but clearly bernadine wanted her to stay subdued secretive and a part of her still felt numb just when shed let free the last thread it was back in her grasp again i should have told that man too when he came all those years ago he was sat exactly where you are now head in hands when he found out he wouldnt be able to see the boy what man elena was still in shock reeling from the gameplan constantly changing and where did that leave her now with what to do with lorena but as sister bernadine sat down next to her and explained nothing could have prepared her for this one final change pulled from the hat as if bernadine was some cruel magician elena felt her whole world turned upside down its very foundations shaken to the core she felt herself close to fainting again and shook her head refusing to accept but all she could think of was rushing to the first phone box to speak to the only two people who could possibly explain set her world to rights again uncle christos and her mother twentyfive roman had insisted he know urgently of any developments on tape so carlo funicelli checked them twice a day lunchtime and early evening with sometimes an extra check midnight or early hours if he was downtown late for the early evening session he usually stayed the longest forty minutes or sometimes an hour and hed grab a sandwich and an espresso on the way in if he wasnt heading later to a restaurant the tapes were all on soundactivate so the one fed from the bugs in donatiens penthouse would usually play through in eight or ten minutes the only sounds so far had been the increasingly frantic messages left by simone plus the occasional social or business related call all seemingly innocent but now with bugs also at donatiens parents in beaconsfield the tape there was running longer a lot longer the house was a haven of activity with odette there most of the day her husband and her talking dining or watching tv in the evening and then the various calls from friends neighbours and claude donatiens business partner or his golfing buddies funicelli quickly became bored he started winding through for more interesting soundbites and almost missed the one conversation that didnt quite fit in the pattern he wound it quickly back to the beginning of the call my names waldren elena waldren im sorry to trouble you like this but ive just come from st marguerites and they gave me your number its regarding your stepson george i i really need to see you and talk to you about him why whats happened nothing nothing but it is nevertheless a bit delicate personal something id rather discuss with you and your husband in person rather than just over the phone i see heavy pause static over the line and i have come quite a long way for this all the way from england in fact funicelli picked up on the callers agitation she sounded anxious very anxious that odette donatiens might not agree to see her whatever it was it was important the prawn salad roll held poised by his mouth the last ten seconds he finally took a bite out of maybe that was where donatiens was holed up england well i suppose so but you know sometimes we dont see him from one month to the next so i dont know how much help well be youre sure theres nothing wrong hes not in trouble or anything no no really nothing like that this is just a catchingup exercise from someone he hasnt seen in a long long while funicelli munched steadily odette donatiens still sounded uncertain but it was difficult to tell which was paramount her concern due to the secrecy or her curiosity not being immediately sated she obviously wanted to know more than her caller was willing to give at that moment the caller said that shed just left st marguerites and was still fifty miles upprovince odette donatiens said that her and her husband were planning to go out that night anyway so in the end they arranged that she should come to their house at pm the next day my husband more often than not stops by for lunch so ill make sure hes around tomorrow when you call funicelli stopped the tape and phoned roman straight away sounds promising could be the break weve been looking for roman agreed he was thoughtful for a second look you stay there and listen to the tape live tomorrow and ill make sure to get someone parked looking on at the house for when she shows there was no conspiracy no collusion between me and your mother to keep things from you believe me elena it just wasnt like that then tell me uncle christos what was it like elena could practically hear the swallow the catching of breath at the other end of the line in london well all i knew was that your father tried to find young christos george as he was then not long before he died but id been sworn to secrecy by your mother and in any case i had no idea where hed gone to try and find him there was nothing useful i could have told you and by then youd already narrowed it down to montreal or chicago why do you think i was urging you so hard to go and see your mother she said shed in turn been sworn to secrecy by your father but i just had the feeling that if you told her that youd finally decided to try and find him that you were at that moment desperately searching shed have opened up and told you what she knew right now it was elenas turn to swallow hard she almost lost a part of it had to strain her hearing with the noise of a long trailer passing on the highway close by she was still at the same service station where shed leafed through directories to get the donatiens current address and number and bought a globalcall card to phone england straight after their call the phone kiosk was halfway between the service station building and the road and at intervals the traffic noise imposed i i thought that was just you banging the same old drum trying to patch up old family differences get us all back together again i began to tire of banging that drum long ago elena or hadnt you noticed id hardly mentioned it the past year or so maybe in the back of my mind i saw it as an opportunity for some of the old wounds to be patched but my first thought was that your mother might be able to help have you spoken to her yet no not yet i wanted to speak to you first the shaking was heaviest in her legs buildup of the emotional helterskelter of the past days and the final twist in the tail at st marguerites or the fact that shed now been standing for almost twenty minutes on the same phone she noticed the cashier starting to look out the window at her at intervals why did he suddenly decide he wanted to find him after all those years because he was dying elena dont forget he knew about the cancer a good three years before in fact the doctors only gave him eighteen months two years as i say your mother hasnt really shared the details with me but i think he saw it as a last chance to make some amends a lump suddenly rose in her throat she found it hard to swallow but in the end he hadnt made it he was sat exactly where you are now head in hands when he found out he wouldnt be able to see the boy the wave of empathy that hit her felt so strange alien that it made her shudder she hadnt felt that way about her father since well since almost the age young george had been when he left st marguerites theres something else elena something i do know more about and i think should tell you now you know that money i used to send you now and then yes shed blankly refused to touch the money left in trust for her or take any money from her father then when shed run into problems which was probably more often than shed have liked on the hippie trail uncle christos would send money it wasnt a fortune but given the timing and the dire circumstances it was practically a lifesaver each time then in addition hed send generous sums for her birthday christmas her patronnames day buddhist new year whatever excuse he could think of she was sure shed never have survived those years without uncle christos help most of that money was from your father id send a bit for your birthday thirty forty pounds whatever but hed insist on sending the other twosixty or seventy or when you had problems a lot more and hed swear me to secrecy each time he knew that if i said it was from him youd refuse it elena felt as if her life was like a set of plates in a greek restaurant just when she had the table set again right okay thats what my life was like some mad waiter had come along and again spun the plates into the air to fall smashing on the ground she found it hard to find her voice she sounded frail tremulous but why why didnt he say something later tell me what hed done you know your father proud to the end proud and obstinate i know i know she leant against the kiosk and closed her eyes sighing heavily suddenly it wasnt just a problem with her tired trembling legs her whole body and mind felt weary not a spark of energy or clear thought left i think hed have seen it as admitting that hed made a mistake with you and you know your father was never very good at that admitting he was wrong it was the cause of probably ninetypercent of the arguments i used to have with him uncle christos risked a small chuckle is that it or is there something else maybe i should know like perhaps he wasnt a hotshot businessman after all but secretly head of the hampstead hare krishnas or surprise surprise hes not dead but living in some commune in the himalayas along with elvis and lord lucan shed aimed for humour as an escape valve but the acid tremulous edge in her voice left little doubt she was angry angry and confused im sorry elena i know how you must feel but no thats it thats as much as i know as to why your father made that last trip to try and see george and what happened when he was there only your mother knows the details when are you going to phone her well straight away i suppose it seemed a stupid question given how much she desperately needed to know what had happened but she picked up the concerned edge in uncle christos voice he was afraid it would be like his hopes of her finally seeing her mother these past years shed put it off and in the end would never do it ill call her as soon as i put the phone down now thats good ill ill leave you to it then and once again im sorry elena it was just how your father wanted it small resigned sigh smothered by the airrush of a passing truck good luck with your mother but having said her thanks and signed off standing with the dead phone and the dialling tone back again with lorena starting to look around expectantly from the car only a few yards ahead suddenly she wasnt so sure she didnt feel she could take any more shock revelations right now each one had been like a body blow and she felt like a punchdrunk boxer sagging against the side of the kiosk for support under the relentless rain of blows her legs aching from trembling and now her hands shaking too as she gripped the dead receiver one more blow and she was down she stood uncertainly a moment more unsure whether to call then or wait till later and meanwhile hopefully summon more reserves and nerve to face the call lorena looking over anxiously also reminded her that she still had to decide what to finally do there the delay hardly helped elena was going to wait until they were back at the hotel to make the call but with each passing mile back to montreal on highway her anxiousness to know pressed harder it was like a tightening coil at the back of her neck and as she started to get a headache and could barely summon a clear thought she swung the car into the next available stop a roadside diner miles from montreal it was busy and judging from the car park popular with truckers she ordered a mineral water at the counter for herself and pointed the waitress over to the table with lorena for her coke and blueberry muffin she swilled back two aspirins quickly followed by another valerian with the mineral water on the way to the phone by the washrooms at the back shed gained a bit more resolve and energy since speaking to uncle christos but still her nerves were shot how best to start a conversation with the mother youve hardly spoken to in half a lifetime the ringing tone seemed slow with a slight echo to it as a hesitant voice finally answered hello elena put her other hand by her ear fading out the clatter of plates and voices and the hiss of the shortorder grill mom is that you its elena elena she started with the preamble of enquiring how her mother was then quickly lurched into not being able to even think of how to start apologising for not being in touch for so long im sorry mom so but her mother cut in halfway through youre there now in montreal yes yes i am uncle christos said you might phone and its okay elena you dont need to apologise you had every good reason to stay away and not see me i understand oh god elena closed her eyes and wished the floor could open up the ready almost fatalistic acceptance made it all the worse made the guilt worm deeper but then her mother too rambled for a moment about how was gordon and her two young ones christos and katine before returning to the meat of why elena had called her fathers trip to montreal the year before he died uncle christos is right that him knowing that he was dying provided the final push but its not as simple as that it had been building up for some while many years in fact going all the way back to when you discovered you could no longer have children and then later andreoss suicide elena felt the years stripped away pictured herself suddenly again in her late teens in andreoss room telling him how upset she was with their father how she felt like just running away and him saying dont leave but never explaining why she shouldnt too shy to admit that he wanted her to stick around as his own emotional bolster but but all those years how come i never knew or at least guessed your father was very secretive very guarded he felt the guilt straight away i saw it in him where probably others didnt but it didnt surface fully until years later one of his secretaries had a messy miscarriage and couldnt have children any more she cried on his shoulder that it was the worst thing shed ever endured or could imagine happening to any woman and days later he was on the phone to the stephanous asking about young george nick stephanou had already given the boy away to the orphanage two years previous but he didnt have the stomach to admit that to your father maybe he feared your father would ask back for the money hed paid them so he didnt mention the accident didnt mention any problems just said george was growing tall and doing well at school and both him and maria were very happy and very proud your father would phone every year or so and get the same story yeah fine at high school now you know and it wasnt until eight years later that he finally got to know the truth when he was having trouble contacting nick and ended up phoning his brother sotiris george would have been fifteen then but what could your father do he phoned the orphanage and they told him george had gone to a new family at the age of eight and their rule was not to pass on any details so all he could do was just shrug his shoulders and hope that hed gone to a good family somewhere that he was having a good life and hadnt suffered good family somewhere good life elena felt a shiver run up her spine all the years shed thought how different she was to her father how opposite their views were particularly regarding her son that her father had given him away purely to punish her and hadnt spent a minute since wasting an ounce of emotion on what hed done or worrying about the boys welfare yet all the while his thoughts had been almost exactly the same as hers your father as he did with most things put on a brave face on the surface shouldered it well but i could see the pain and guilt close beneath the surface and he was missing you too regretted what hed done he used to send you money through uncle christos and asked that you werent told thought youd probably refuse it i know uncle christos told me she looked up to see their waitress heading back to the counter lorena was taking the first sips of her coke and so practically the whole focus of his life all his ambitions and hopes got poured into your brother andreos andreos is going to be a great successor in my businessandreos is going to do this andreos is going to do that there seemed no limits to what andreos might achieve in your fathers eyes then with andreoss suicide particularly when it looked like the main reason was that he felt he couldnt cope couldnt live up to your fathers expectations all hope there too was lost and again your father blamed himself he drunk himself silly for weeks and one night i caught him gently weeping in his sleep probably one of many hed done so without me knowing and he turned to me tearfully and asked what was wrong with him what is it about me that drives people away or pushes them into the ground am i such a monster tears welled in elenas eyes the cafe scene ahead suddenly blurred distorted shed never before seen that soft emotional side to her father it was so totally out of sync with the image shed long held true of him and all shed done was add to his guilt and suffering the funeral had been the last time shed seen her father and shed stood stoically on her mothers side as andreoss body was lowered into the ground and the priest said the prayers then when finally her father seemed to have summoned the courage and spirit to speak to her towards the end of the service shed turned abruptly and stormed off this is all your fault too youre to blame for this im sorry i i had no idea her own voice sounded distant lost among the hustle and clatter of the restaurant she had to shift slightly to one side as two men in blue overalls came past her from the washroom behind how could you he never showed that side to anyone when i suggested to him that maybe that was part of the problem and he should try and show his emotions more he said that i was being ridiculous if he wore his heart on his sleeve he wouldnt last a minute in business his competitors would have him for breakfast and besides it just wasnt him so the defences would quickly come up again that hard skin he saw as his protection from the world outside i remember him once saying to me that that sort of thing was for old greek widows wailing and gnashing their teeth i think with the prejudice he experienced early on hed fixed this strange notion in his mind that not showing his emotions would somehow make him more english and less cypriot stiff upper lip and all that rubbish elena wiped her eyes with the back of one hand and looked towards lorena how could she have got it so wrong so wrong her thoughts about her father had guided practically everything in her life the rebellion her hippie years her staying away from home and now theyd been the foundation of her suspicions over ryall another dominant man probably lowndes was right nothing was happening there it was just lorenas overattachment to her full house shed been wrong about everything everything then with the cancer he probably did look at me and imagine an old greek widow in a few years and everything else crashed back in at the same time he started to dwell on his life and things past and think of all the mistakes hed made he started to think that it had all been a waste devoting so much of his life to money building up an empire what was it all for when you didnt have family and loved ones around you with andreos it wasnt only the son hed lost or with you that hed practically lost a daughter as well by driving you away but the fact that you could no longer have children and andreos had died before hed even started a family there was no possible continuing bloodline and the only grandchild hed ever had hed given away that was when he resolved finally to try and find george the tears brimmed over streaming down elenas cheeks and the trembling was back in her legs they felt ready to crumple at any second she half turned and put one hand flat on the wall for support as a truck driver in a redcheck shirt approached heading for the washroom but hed already noticed her distress and mumbled something in french then with her blank look switched quickly to english are you okay lady everything alright yes its its okay just someone i havent spoken to in a while her mothers voice crashed in halfway elena is there someone there with you the truck driver nodded with a tight smile as he went past her and she assured her mother that it was all right she was in a restaurant and it was just someone passing by the phone her emotions wanted to scream no no its not alright stop stop i cant bear it any more cant take more of my lifes foundations smashed down any more illusions destroyed on which ive based almost every principle the past thirty years but her mind was curious thirsty wanted desperately to know every last detail however painful trouble was your father never was able to succeed in that final quest he hoped that maybe if he visited personally but in the end the nuns wouldnt relent wouldnt pass on where george had gone that final blow hit him hard elena he died a very sad and lonely man he was sat where you are now elena couldnt hold it back any longer racking sobs convulsed her whole body and she turned to fully face the wall so that people in the diner wouldnt see her tears and distress she hadnt even shown up for the funeral if nothing else to support her mother in her moment of grief nor troubled to phone at any time to offer her condolence and in the years since shed never visited theyd only spoken once briefly on the phone her mother had buried the man shed loved knowing that hed died with a heart heavy with a lifetime of regrets and purely because of her own past battles with her father shed left her mother alone for all those years with that terrible pain and burden no wonder uncle christos had kept urging her to see her mother how could her mother possibly ever forgive her she clutched her hand in a fist against the wall her eyes scrunched tight to stem the flow of tears and finally found some composure to speak but why why didnt he say something earlier or maybe you why didnt you call me and tell me what was there to say that he tried to find your son that hed given away twentyodd years ago but in the end hed failed and before he died he swore me to secrecy he said there was little point in telling you if there could be no possible good end resolve it would just build up your hopes only to dash them again and besides youd probably blanked it all from your mind long ago too painful to think about yes that was partly true i suppose she rubbed her nose with the back of her hand sniffed back the remnants of tears she felt uncomfortable admitting that it was spoton that her father knew her so well and just like her father shed kept the truth and her real emotions buried from everyone going one better by keeping them even from her own husband oh jesus she was her fathers daughter more than she realized he said that only if you decided to find him when you were finally sure you wanted to fill that gap in your life should i tell you i see still her voice was uncertain she feared she might collapse again into tears at any second she felt nothing but empty inside as if a team of emotional burglars had stormed through her and upended every drawer love hate family closeness hopes ambitions there now you try and sort it all out and she was left to pick through the ransacked mess one hand braced against the wall of a diner full of strangers while keeping her head turned from them so that they wouldnt see how destroyed she was or the tears streaming down her face or notice that her whole body was shaking uncontrollably with her legs threatening to buckle at any second and meanwhile her mother at the end of a crackly line three thousand miles away had in the space of less than fifteen minutes told her that nothing in her life so far had been quite what it seemed but there was only one possible silver lining she could see now one way to repay how shed unknowingly betrayed her fathers memory and left her mother to grieve alone these years past one good thing mom partly why i was phoning now i think i might have found him one of the nuns ended up giving me the details of the family that took george in im seeing them tomorrow she didnt add that the one quirk of fate to stab sister bernadines conscience to finally give her the address had been her father sat in the same spot six years ago head in hands if he hadnt have visited she probably would never have got the address it was as if an invisible hand was reaching out i tried to make good while i was alive but at least you might now be able to succeed where i failed when i catch up with george ill try and convince him to come to england sometime and we can all have a big reunion that would be nice elena but you know you dont need to make promises just to make me feel good id be happy enough just to see more of you when you get back but you need to find him for yourself elena to fill that gap in your heart and soul that your father was never able to fill twentysix you know youre quite a little girl for your age alphonse beamed and reached across the bar playfully pinching lorenas cheek he looked towards elena perched at the bar stool next to lorena seeking confirmation she certainly is elena nodded with a rueful smile and took another sip of her champagne particularly on holiday you get twice the questions so of course you need twice the energy just to keep up she hardly looked at lorena as she spoke she found it hard to meet her gaze directly knowing what was coming very likely packing her back to england in the morning or at the latest soon after shed seen the donatiens theyd grabbed a quick pizza on the outskirts of montreal then headed back to the hotel alphonse was all smiles asking how their day had been elena didnt want to get into the rollercoaster dramas of the day just said that theyd finally tracked down this longlost relative and were seeing them tomorrow so maybe a celebratory drink is in order she ordered a bottle of moet and mixed lorenas with orange juice lorena wasnt sure she liked it at first only warming to it after a few sips then at the start of her second glass she became more talkative alphonse was originally from northern yugoslavia the part that is now slovenia and had been in montreal fourteen years but rather than him swap notes with lorena on the one area they had in common hardships of life in the eastern bloc lorena wanted to know all about canada how deep does the snow get in winter how cold does it get do you go hunting are there a lot of bears we get some too in the mountains in romania as lorena deftly shifted to what to do if you were out in the forest and got surprised by a bear and didnt have a gun and she suggested to alphonse that because he was big maybe you could wrestle with it he reached over and playfully pinched lorenas cheek though short with his sixpack long ago sagged to a barrel alphonse was extremely broad with forearms like tree boughs i remember a dancing bear once in bucharest lorena commented thoughtfully he looked so sad his owner was getting him to dance and hit a tambourine and act like he was happy but all the time his eyes were so sad so sad she should have been pleased seeing lorena come out of her shell become more lively animated except for the sessions with lowndes when the reminder of her problems would weigh heavy again lorena had been better each day since leaving england but elenas first worry with her talking so openly excitedly was that lorena would suddenly say the wrong thing and give the game away elena herself sometimes forgot who they were meant to be each time elena waldren and daughter elena for lowndes daughter katine for customs and the police and now alphonse as well because shed had to show her passport on registration perhaps lorenas liveliness and change of spirit confirmed lowndes finding that it was all a ruse just to get her attention lorena had got almost nothing but attention these past days no wonder she was happy but what if she was wrong what if the smiles were coming back to lorenas face purely because she was free of ryalls clutches and tomorrow shed be sending her back to england to are you okay yes fine bit tired thats all she gripped her champagne glass firmer to mask her hand shaking she was still far from wound down from the days slings and arrows and this final nagging doubt with lorena wasnt helping alphonse repeated the bit of conversation elena had faded out what lorena says is true you do share the same first name with ceaucescus wife i know elena grimaced tautly the exromanian dictator and his wife were blamed for most of the countrys orphan problems by encouraging couples to have large families elena reached across and lightly pulled lorena to her for a second but still she avoided direct eye contact one elena to cause the problems another as saviour hopefully shes forgiven me by now her driver nick used to joke about it whenever they got a difficult border guard or policeman just tell them your name and theyll quickly do the sign of the cross and wave us on but she was careful not to add that right now she was elena the mother not the aid worker she decided in the end to delay her decision about lorena till am that morning and her call to gordon her main reason for barsitting now to kill the time by when pm in england gordon thought hed be back from seeing mikaya ryall in durham making the call finally at am having put lorena to bed just after pm and ambled along st catherine until she found a cocktail bar to kill the remaining hour she spent the first ten minutes with the days ups and downs and the final elation of getting an address she didnt go into the whole messy drama of her father visiting the orphanage or her phoning her mother that was going to take another heart to heart her secret life parttwo when she returned she just said that one of the nuns had a sudden change of heart about passing on the address gordon was full of bonhomie and well wishes for her meeting with the donatiens the next day then finally they got to how it went with mikaya ryall no great revelations except that gordon was almost sure mikaya was hiding something something which made her very uncomfortable very quickly she practically ran from the cafe halfway through elena agreed that it was suspicious but shed practically reached the end of the rope with sessions theres nowhere left for me to go with this and its just not enough for me to be able to hang on to lorena i can hardly walk back into lowndes and say that hes got to probe deeper because lorenas sister too is now having panic attacks at the mention of possible interference from her stepfather i know i know you need something more concrete and im already one step ahead of you gordon had been uncomfortable after the meeting so on the way back hed put through a call to an old contact an investigator who worked for the banks and insurance companies i thought if ryall can dish the dirt on you then maybe we should try turning the tables on him i gave him everything i knew and told him to dig particularly deep around the time of mikaya ryalls pregnancy whens he coming back to you i told him it was urgent and hes already been on it half a day he said hed try and get back with as much as he can by midday tomorrow pm by then in montreal four hours after seeing the donatiens but then if they gave her an address and he didnt live far away she might well be going on to see him later elena liked the idea of reversing the tables on ryall giving him a run for his money but overall she couldnt help feeling that they were stretching clutching at straws on one hand the delay made her nervous having to keep running the gauntlet with the police yet on the other she felt relieved at putting off breaking the bad news to lorena okay lets wait till then to decide what to do and having said it she felt as if a weight had been lifted it was no longer inevitable a foregone conclusion that lorena was going back to ryall there was still some hope left however slim or was it mainly for herself that she didnt want to dwell on the problem to keep her mind clear for the big day ahead meeting the donatiens and then hopefully later her son once again pushing lorena into the background because her own score card was full years her mouth was suddenly dry at the thought what would she say how would she even begin to explain the prospect was far more daunting than perhaps finally having to let down lorena elena didnt sleep well that night she thought she might given that shed finally reached the end of her search and was so utterly worn out from the nervous anxiety and lack of sleep of the past days but the excitement of the day ahead kept her mind churning as to how she might broach everything and how it might go then there was some commotion with sirens not too far away that seemed to go on endlessly in the end it was over two hours before she finally drifted off and suddenly the sirens were coming for her they were all around and policemen were pounding up the stairs she couldnt escape then she was outside in chains on the pavement with a crowd of people looking on pointing lorena was also standing there in chains though it was ryall holding the other end not a policeman he was smiling crookedly at elena ive got her back now and shell never get free again now dance and clap your hands and try and look happy theres people looking and she thought yes i should be happy im seeing my son tomorrow but all she could see was her father as shed left him by andreoss graveside and everyone else had also turned their backs and left him alone she rushed over to comfort him to say sorry for having deserted him for all those years but as she got closer it wasnt andreoss name her father was muttering as he looked down at the grave george i tried to find you really i tried and she rushed breathlessly to tell her father that shed found him pointing to his figure at the end of the chine look hes there there i found him i found him though still he was like the young boy she pictured in the orphanage not a grown man and in that moment george turned and she was afraid that hed move away before her father looked up and saw him but the chains were still on her legs and she didnt seem to be getting any closer to attract her fathers attention and as george finally turned away the light too at the end of the chine faded leaving her in darkness the darkness was total a black shroud she couldnt see her father or george any more could only guide her way by grappling at branches and feeling for trees where she remembered them then suddenly there were other footsteps behind her in the pitch darkness the fall of their breath competing with her own in the new silence and getting closer closer bearing down quickly their breathing more rapid with each step and so close now she could feel it against the back of her neck making her shiver and she wasnt sure if it was ryall or the police or she woke up her breathing ragged she went over to the minibar and opened a bottle of mineral water felt the first few slugs cut through the dryness oh jesus jesus jesus she let out a heavy exhalation to ease the tightness in her chest hopefully after tomorrow shed no longer need the sanctuary of the chine to try and bury the ghosts of what shed done the man in the back of roubilliards fourwheeler shrank back a few inches as the heavy bulldog face suddenly appeared at the front side window peering in what do you think roubilliard half turned round from the front drivers seat joining frank massenat in his appraisal of the back seat passenger massenat wrinkled his nose questioningly take of his glasses roubilliards henchman beside the passenger obliged the passenger suddenly appeared more anxious than at any time during the fiftyminute wait his eyes dilating wide and his breathing falling heavy from what he remembered from his schooldays this is what usually preceded a fist landing on your nose massenat squinted doubtfully a moment more nah not him close but no cigar sure sure massenat straightened up and turned away taking out his mobile roubilliard pulled out a twentydollar note and held it in front of the passenger some guy who owes our friend money you could be his twin brother now lose yourself and make sure to lose your memory too about all this okay the passenger looked between the note and roubilliard hardly believing he was being let go there must be some last minute surprise in store then with a hasty nod okay he took the note and was out of the car practically breaking into a run as he passed massenat on his mobile to roman roman nodded knowingly at the other end yeah thought it was too good to be true finding him in less than thirtysix hours and right on our fucking doorstep in lavalle yeah yeah catch yer later roman stayed staring at the dead phone for a moment afterwards cracking some knuckles the third false alarm already but this was the first where roubilliard hadnt been able to eliminate them himself at least it meant that roubilliard was busy and in a few hours thered be news too from funicelli on just why this woman all the way from england was visiting donatiens parents out in beaconsfield the news item came on at am female newscaster against a backdrop of a faint grey map of canada with quebec highlighted in yellow talking about a rcmp breakthrough in their investigation against montreals lacaille family she glanced to one corner as prompt and the newsclip started of neil mundys press conference just half an hour beforehand mundy sat in the centre flanked by michel chenouda and inspector pelletier as camera flashes went repeatedly the television was at the end of a counterstyle deli the sound on low one of the three sandwich servers closest to the tv looked up for a moment in interest and two of his customers seemed engrossed but hardly anyone else including elena and lorena at the other end sharing a large frenchstick sandwich paid it any attention elena had woken up late so she decided that they should grab a quick brunch lunch might be late with them seeing the donatiens at pm after the deli they spent twenty minutes windowbrowsing in place villemarie before heading out there alphonse had told her it should only take thirtyfive forty minutes to get to beaconsfield but she wanted to leave some leeway to be safe talk was stilted on the drive she was far too preoccupied with what lay ahead to give anything more than brief responses to lorena and didnt instigate any conversation herself she got there seventeen minutes early so spent a while slowly cruising the area a small lake two blocks over with a park one side verging into a pine forest a parade of shops three blocks in the other direction theyd passed some messy industrial areas on the outskirts of montreal on the way there grain silos dilapidated warehouses and car dumps but this was a nice area a good place to bring up a child george would have she shook her head she was doing it again for all she knew the directory listing for this address was recent the donatiens could have moved several times since they took george from the orphanage she spent the last few minutes parked a hundred yards along the road from the house checking her hair and makeup and that she still didnt look like a halfcrazed heroine addict then continued the last distance and pulled up outside she didnt notice the man in the green oldsmobile saloon parked thirty yards back his gaze following her and lorena intently as they walked up the path to the front door she tried to even her breathing as she approached the door tried to relax her nerves had mostly settled since last night but all that pentup tension was suddenly back in her body ringing the bell and in the anxious few seconds lull before the door opened then suddenly she was on remote her senses bombarded smiles handshakes claude odette yes and this is my daughter katine come through come through odette was compact and wellpresented and claude dwarfed her and was heavyset but with his broadness and height carried it well he had a shock of stone grey hair and a ready smile and elena immediately warmed to them odette offered freshly made coffee and elena asked if her daughter could perhaps wait in their kitchen or play in their garden some of what ive come about could be a bit sensitive shed covered with lorena about the orphanage by claiming her son had some schooling there and that the donatiens now were sort of godparents but if lorena sat in on their conversation shed know the truth i didnt want to leave her in the car outside you see claude donatiens nodded knowingly his expression suddenly more sombre odette took over and led lorena down the hall asking what drinks shed like claude looked up at elena in the moment they were left alone and forced a smile but its openness had gone he was obviously nervous concerned and that same mood prevailed when odette returned with coffee and elena launched into the reason for her visit claude and odette exchanged glances at intervals as her story unfolded and looked increasingly troubled and uneasy they asked few questions and fell quickly back to their eyes cast down heads nodding slowly and sombrely and the occasional awkward glance between them at first elena thought it was just a reaction to the poignancy and drama of her story but after a while she got the impression that there was something else troubling them some unspoken cloud of worry that shed triggered in their minds and before she even reached the end claude donatiens was shaking his head his lips pursed tight together im sorry i thought you knew havent you heard the news again those downcast eyes he could no longer bring himself to look at her directly what news you shouldnt be so surprised claude it was only on a few hours ago odette rallied to her defence she could easily have missed it i know claude nodded and looked up briefly at elena its just that before you explained i thought your visit might have had something to do with whats happened that you somehow had advance notice or maybe even had links with the rcmp he ran one hand unevenly through his hair and let out a slow sigh its just the timing threw us the two things happening at the same time you understand he shook his head again and and after all youve been through now why whats happened elena looked keenly between them and her heart fell their looks said it all before claude donatiens had finally gathered the composure to explain twentyseven sorry georges roman wanted us to tell you that he never liked you always thought you were a smarmy shit he said it would give him great satisfaction to know that was the last thing you were thinking about but for us georges its nothing personal just sorry georges felt everything tilt and slip away into darkness he wasnt sure initially how long hed blackedout the first thing he was aware of was the rapid shuffling of footsteps then as two bangs sounded he jolted for a second that that was the shots hed been expecting before realizing it was the sound of the econolines doors closing hed probably lost less than a minute the engine was revved high and there was a sharp squeal of tyres as they sped away then the sound of another engine headlamps playing for a second across his body the approaching vehicle had obviously disturbed his two abductors the sharp slam of two more car doors then after a second the sound of another car pulling up and more lights the stark beam of a torch swung haphazardly on the ground closeby before finally settling on his body and voices frantic jumbled he found it hard to pick out what was said at first but as they came close he recognized chenoudas voice is he okay did we make it in time georges was given fresh coffee and donuts and left for almost two hours to rest before his first debriefing by chenouda which lasted only forty minutes georges discovered in that session that chenouda knew from a contact close to the lacailles chenouda didnt elaborate who about him being lured away the night before by one of the sherbrooke club girls viana they suspected a likely setup by roman so started closely following his movements two of his men saw the abduction go down and radioed straight through to chenouda they lost the van at one point and there was a scramble to catch up which was why chenouda arrived almost at the same time as them and none too soon by the looks of it thirty seconds more and we wouldnt be sitting here talking now your body would be being tagged in the morgue michel chenouda made no demands on him that first session asked no questions he ran through the events of the past twentyfour hours almost dispassionately except for that final stress that georges was lucky very lucky to still be alive and he had the rcmp to thank for that then he was left alone for the night to sleep chac one of the men from the lead car tailing his abductors stayed to keep guard that was the first thing to strike georges as strange they were in some nondescript threestar hotel near dorval airport not at dorchester boulevard or another police station chenouda instructed no calls strictly no calls upon leaving and chac reminded him just before they bedded down for the night if room service calls or the phone goes at all let me get it youre incommunicado for the moment dont exist the session with chenouda the next day was more intensive and lasted over two hours chenouda made it clear within the first minutes that he wanted georges to testify against the lacailles georges refused stuck to his ground from their last confrontation that despite what roman might have done he wouldnt betray jeanpaul chenouda fired back with just who did he think ordered that little number last night because if you think roman acted on his own think again he went to the trouble of setting you up with the girl purely to get jeanpauls final go ahead if he was going to take you out on his own hed have done it weeks back it made sense georges knew it but still he refused to accept that jeanpaul who he so admired and trusted and looked up to almost like a father would have ordered his death michel paced cajoled and waved his arms as he threw across every possible rationale in his armoury and at one point his patience finally ran out fine okay you go back out there and take your chances lets see how long roman is willing to let you live i wont have to waste my time beating my head against a brick wall with you and we can even have some fun in the squad room making bets on just how long youd last three days a week maybe finally after almost an hour they reached the bones of a deal georges agreed to testify against roman about that night with leduc but nothing beyond that he wouldnt talk about any of the inner financial workings of the lacaille familys enterprises besides theyd just support what hed been saying all along that jeanpaul had moved away from crime these past few years and he could only comment that jeanpaul had sanctioned the meeting with leduc not that he might have arranged or had prior knowledge that leduc was to be murdered because georges himself hadnt known the attack on leduc had come as a complete surprise looked at first to be an attempt at selfdefence gone wrong georges ran through the mixup with the notebook and the gun and then roman flipping his own second gun onto the floor before savard reached the car but thats as far as ill go if you want to get some sharp prosecutor to fill in the gaps and try and show a link to jeanpaul then thats up to you but im not testifying directly against him because theres nothing i really can say thats it take it or leave it michel spent another twenty minutes fleshing out the details and took it with savards murder and now the attempt on donatiens life a pattern could be shown donatiens confirmed that hed obviously open up as well about his abduction and the setup the night before with the girl and michels mind went for a moment on overdrive hopefully with some persuasion he could get azy to spill about the girl being romans pet favourite and maybe even something from the girl herself but when he pushed his luck with whether donatiens thought that night with leduc had also been a setup by roman he probably knew damn well leduc didnt have a gun but he needed it to look like selfdefence for your benefit and maybe for jeanpauls too if he wasnt already in on it georges reluctance resurfaced with whats happened since i can see how that probably makes sense but i cant really say beyond what i saw that night again thats going to be down to your prosecutor earning his pay by trying to make the connections michel quit while he was ahead he spent the remaining time going back over and making notes on what theyd agreed skeleton structure for donatiens later statement then called s straight after and explained his dilemma a hot informant in his grasp and concerns about leaks within his own department each rcmp regional office had their own section operating a wpp and internal affairs for investigating police corruption but when that corruption could lead to a leak and endanger the person in the programme s had been set up in ottawa the next morning he was sat before an s review board chaired by superintendent neil mundy and from there everything moved rapidly that same night donatiens was escorted by two s officers out of montreal to a safehouse where he would stay until the trial then he would go fully into the witness protection programme and be given a new identity chenouda himself didnt even have the location of the safehouse only donatiens escorting officers and an eyes only handful within s had the details at am the following morning by which time donatiens had already been ensconced in the safehouse for over twelve hours mundy called a press conference to announce their breakthrough with the lacaille investigation with inspector pelletier also present to dampen any speculation about interdepartmental wrangling it was hailed as a joint operation between montreals criminal intelligence division and s the whole process from donatiens abduction to final announcement had taken two and a half days for that time donatiens whereabouts had been a complete mystery and now with him at a safehouse until the trial six or seven months of the same lay ahead then he would disappear completely never to resurface again as georges donatiens witness protection programme twentyeight witness protection programme never to be seen again elena drove back from beaconsfield in a daze claude donatiens words spun through her head like some mad mantra though he hadnt directly said the second part shed extracted that from between the lines while he fluffed around and tried to soften the blow were not sure when even we might be able to see him if at all were going to phone later and find out maybe therell be a loophole by which we could see him and if so hopefully youd be able to as well at some time loopholes hopefully at some time claude donatiens just didnt want to say it straight out look i just dont think youre going to be able to get to see him now especially not right on the heels of her heartrending saga of ups and downs that had finally brought her to their door it would have seemed cruel to push the trapdoor lever straight away much kinder to send her down in the express elevator shed get there almost as fast but shed hardly feel the motion and she could listen to piped music on the way sugarcoat the pill shed spent over an hour at the donatiens after the bombshell getting all the background shed hoped for originally what was he like had they lived here long where did they live before his general homelife schooling then later college girlfriends and work and every small trait and nuance and what hed had for breakfast the past twentynine years if she could have kept them on the subject long enough odette brought out some photo albums as guideposts to the passage of time and events since theyd taken georges from st marguerites georges odette explained that the minor name change was because they were a frenchcanadian family his school was francophile and they hadnt wanted it too obvious that he was adopted elena found herself reaching out and gently touching some of the photos as she leafed through his ninth birthday party a school photo from when he was twelve throwing a frisbee in a park for a redsetter odette with one arm around him at a woodland picnic table a family group photo from a florida holiday with georges as a teenager against a marina backdrop his twentyfirst with some college friends spraying him with a shaken champagne bottle shed just felt numb stripped of any emotion with the shock news but in that moment the tears started to come though she quickly wiped and sniffed them back embarrassed it wasnt only from all those lost years coming home stronger with the sight and feel of something tangible a face to finally put to him but the sudden realization that this now might be as close as shed ever get to him it was all too much for her to bear at one point with claude and odette looking on concernedly and lorena by that time back from playing in the garden to join them and she got up and went over to the back window looking out shed managed to control from bursting into sobs but still her eyes were welling strongly and she was having trouble biting it back the land sloped away at the back and there was a partial view of the lake two hundred yards away between the trees claude donatiens left her alone for a moment before coming alongside to join her we used to bring georges to the park by the lake to play when he was younger and it became something of a dream for us to one day live in this area we managed to grab one of the last plots going with a lake view claude was a builder and reading between the lines there had been a few ups and downs through the years their previous homes hadnt been quite as salubrious though claude was eager to point out that they had been comfortable in good neighbourhoods georges schooling had been excellent and hed been wellprovided and caredfor and always loved but business had been good these past six or seven years partly thanks to some money from georges and his financial savvy claude conceded and so we finally built our dream home elena had the sense in that moment that claude had somehow displeased georges or maybe it was just the awkwardness of their roles muddling georges suddenly grownup adult and organized the hotshot financier and claude then the errant dependant it wasnt in anything said directly more inbetween the lines or the timing of when claude fell silent or quickly changed the subject but perhaps having spent a lifetime of shadowdancing around the truth in her own life that was where she saw everything now in between the lines and in the silences then came inevitably the even more awkward topic of just how georges went from successful banker to involvement with a crime family she never asked directly but claude seemed eager to make clear that georges wasnt in the least criminally inclined he had a good position was very solid with banque du quebec before joining the lacailles thats why i find this now so hard to take let alone understand he pointed accusingly to the tv which had been off since she arrived he always said that the only reason hed joined them was because theyd moved away from crime and it was a challenge he was very strict about things like that strong principles the only problem he ever hinted at was the two lacaille brothers not always seeing eye to eye but he said he worked only for jeanpaul who he insisted was clean as a whistle and equally as principled maybe it will all turn out to be nothing again he was back to trying to make light of it lessen the blow that after a lifetime parted from her son she might now never get to see him she shook her head her eyes welling never to be seen again the express elevator was still falling an abyss of dark despair sucking her inexorably down since shed left the donatiens shed skirted dangerously around the edges at moments during her doorcall vigil and at st marguerites but now the depths of that despair the gutwrenching emptiness she felt inside was total and after her battles of the past days her diet of pills and whisky her lack of sleep and her nerves almost constantly on a tightrope she felt completely drained no reserves left to claw her way back up again besides it was all over never to be seen again what could she do claude donatiens said hed phone later when hed spoken to the police but what was the point of deluding herself by still clinging to hope from what little she knew the whole point of witness protection was to keep the subjects away from family and friends because that was the first place criminals tried to track them never to be seen again she gripped tight at the steering wheel and tensed her jaw against it but still she was falling the dark edges of the abyss washing in traffic was heavier now approaching the centre of montreal and she had to concentrate but her eyes were welling faster than she could blink them clear or dab away the tears with the back of one hand and through her blurred pastelwash vision a car appeared out of nowhere and verged across her or had she swung over slightly as she wiped at her tears the cars horn blared and she braked and swung the wheel away then suddenly a squeal of tyres and two sharp beeps from the other side one after the other and she realized that shed cut in on something on the inside elena watch out lorena hit the stop button on her walkman looking concernedly over her shoulder theres a oh god oh god elena was shaking uncontrollably still falling a kaleidoscope blur of cars and road and buildings tilting slipping sideways she thought for a second she was going to blackout right there with the traffic streaming all around her she slowed waiting for the car on her inside to pass its driver fired her a last stony look then she pulled across and took the first turn on the left stopping twenty yards in she gave into the abyss totally in that moment sank down into its darkness as if it were a featherdown duvet the near accident had jolted away her tears all that remained was her shaking and a tight aching knot in her stomach the only sensation left amongst the overwhelming emptiness she felt last night struggling to get back to sleep after her dreams shed vowed silently to her father to find georges to make good on how shed betrayed his memory all these years thinking in that moment how shed never felt closer to her father and how oddly ironic it was that finally now after all this time theyd found some common ground and already shed struck out pathetic really almost as pathetic as the sham that had been her life so far are you okay elena and now lorenas voice heavy with concern to remind her that in a couple of hours shed phone gordon and then let her down too another failure its okay i just need a minute ill be fine a minute she probably needed twice as long in therapy than even poor young lorena to sort out the mess of her mind but only after shed slept for a week to shake off this tiredness sapping every last ounce of energy that was her first promise to herself she stayed head down eyes shut a moment more listening to the steady fall of her own breathing against the ebb and flow of city traffic as if like a metronome rhythm that might tell her when it was alright to start driving again she was slow in shaking off her dark mood finally lifting her head but the urgency in lorenas muttered ele and her suddenly aware of a figure by the car made her look up sharper brown uniform one hand by the holster the other reaching out the rcmp officer tapped at her window signalling her to wind it down though suddenly she no longer felt afraid but strangely relieved that it was finally all over she could get the sleep she needed and she wouldnt have to break any bad news to lorena theyd both been victims you just couldnt wait could you just couldnt wait no jeanpaul i tell you you got it wrong what they put on the news about donatiens has got nothing to do with me oh yeah really jeanpaul glared back stonily roman flinched under its intensity jeanpauls jaw was set rigid and roman noticed a small muscle pumping repeatedly in his neck jeanpaul had started shouting before his study door was barely shut behind them and for a moment roman thought he might break with character and start pushing and manhandling for an explanation what he himself might do if the situation was reversed roman could never remember jeanpaul angrier and he had to admit the situation looked bad real bad whichever way he might try to explain it away he was still pondering whether to keep protesting or just stay silent and let jeanpaul burn off steam when jeanpaul continued i mean we sat in this room not fortyeight hours ago and you swore blind that you had nothing to do with his disappearance and now this this you gotta believe jeanpaul it wasnt me wasnt me roman was shaking his head vigorously dont know shit about it jeanpaul rolled on as if roman hadnt spoken ive been assuring simone all along that you hadnt done anything wouldnt do anything without my sanction dont worry dont worry jeanpaul closed his eyes for a second and appeared to almost shudder all that time lying to her roman leant forward and slapped the flat of his palm on the desk youre not listening jeanpaul i didnt do it know nothing about it jeanpaul flinched only slightly then he slapped his own hand twice as hard on the desktop youre right im not listening because thats what i did before fell for every word and the same fucking outraged act youre throwing at me now so this time youre going to have to explain yourself roman and maybe you can start with just who did this if not you who the doubt in jeanpauls voice had now reached incredulity and roman had rarely heard him swear it made him more hesitant about his first and most obvious explanation the second and what he thought had really happened would sound even more incredulous i i suppose it must have been the cacchiones the cacchiones the cacchiones jeanpaul mimicked to blame for pascals death and now conveniently every family problem since leduc savardnow georges dont you think theyd have given on up on us by now realized that were out of crime and no longer pose a threat to them roman leapt for the handgrab to build his case i think youre right they probably do realize that but this isnt about us and continuing old vendettas this is more about medeiros the cacchiones are still dealing drugs for sure but medeiros thinks hes blocked their supplies and pushed them out for good roman chose his words carefully he was skirting uncomfortably close to the truth and didnt want to unconsciously give away that he knew more than he should the other main option for the supplies still getting out there is us so cacchione is keen to jump on anything such as this rcmp investigation right now to keep us in the frame as still involved in crime and still dealing it throws medeiros off of the scent jeanpaul mulled it over but looked far from convinced i suppose theres some sense to it but how would they know to pick on georges know that he was our weak spot roman felt himself getting cornered they could have known from savard or maybe thats my fault i have at times complained to frank and maybe one or two others that georges concerns me things like that can too easily get out all he could think of concede to a lesser crime perhaps it would also give jeanpaul somewhere to direct his anger i dont know i dont know jeanpaul swayed for a second before doubt again took grip and the timing too how would the cacchiones know about the problem with the girl that at this moment of all moments georges would automatically think that any attempted hit must be down to us because he feared he was out in the cold romans collar was suddenly tight and he felt hot finding a clear way through jeanpauls maze of doubt was getting more complicated with each step maybe the girl when i called the club last night azy said she hadnt shown maybe she knew something had gone down originally he was going to keep that under his hat until hed found out more of all people she knew too much could prove a problem but hed grabbed at the first thing in desperation right now he needed everything he could possibly throw across to break down jeanpauls wall of doubt jeanpaul felt himself swaying again but then roman had been equally as convincing last time then only fortyeight hours later he was left feeling like a mug simones words ringing in his ears how do you know romans not done something to him already this time around hed make roman sweat every word and as credible as roman might be hed pass it on to simone dispassionately with healthy reserved doubt safer stance he studied roman levelly a lot of maybes roman but youre the only one who knew for sure about georges problem with the girl yeah so why would i go to all the trouble of telling you about it only to try and take him out myself because you started to worry that i might not deal with it the way you hoped and have georges hit that my idea was leaning more towards getting him away to cuba until things had settled down roman leant across the desk his patience was fast thinning hed thrown across every good argument he could think of and still jeanpaul appeared entrenched i didnt know that was the way you were thinking until the last time we were in this same fucking room shouting at each other after georges had already disappeared that was true thought jeanpaul the only tangible fact roman had so far thrown across amongst a sea of maybes roman swept one arm away dismissively besides if i was going to take the fucker out id have made sure to do the job properly not left him for the rcs just so he could testify against us the only person that sort of scenario benefits is cacchione jeanpaul nodded and cast his eyes down truth number two but he was dammed if he was going to leave himself vulnerable again and he was tiring of the argument they were just going round in circles the most hed move to was a midground reluctant concession regardless of whether its cacchione or not if it wasnt for your little political background battle with georges the situation for cacchione to take advantage wouldnt have existed or for georges to even think it might be us and end up in the lap of the rcs giving evidence so whichever way this falls down to you roman with the onus on you finding him now stronger than ever what news on that front roman wasnt comfortable ending on that note but his nerves were shot from fencing with jeanpaul and perhaps it was the best he could hope for he brought jeanpaul up to date nothing yet from the streets and now it was pretty obvious why not no call yet from georges to his parents but some english woman had called out of the blue wanting to speak to them urgently sounded real cagey concerned could be something could be nothing his guy funicelli was monitoring their conversation right now hed know more in an hour or so and for the first time since theyd entered the room they were pulling in the same direction but their differences aired and those unspoken through the years now more than ever to remain so still hung heaviest in the air the gulf between them had never been wider of course roman knew that it wasnt cacchione he knew that because hed been working closely with cacchione for the past three years when jeanpaul had first announced them moving away from crime hed thought that he was joking then when he realized that he was serious his first protest was that that would simply leave the whole pie to cacchione hows that going to pay him back for what he did to pascal jeanpaul calmly explained almost as if enlightening a naive child that it was no longer a matter of payback or getting even that would simply continue the cycle and pascals death would have been for nothing that if that was the cost then cacchione was welcome to the pie jeanpaul had made a solemn promise to their father and he wasnt about to budge that same condescending tone every time he tentatively raised the issue over the next twelve months as if jeanpauls new quest was based on moral principles beyond his grasp and whenever that wasnt enough jeanpaul would raise pascal or their father as final moralistic tombstones to end the argument no care or consideration or even a minutes thought that he might not be happy with their new direction that as muscleman and enforcer the guy who took care of all the messy details nobody else wanted to get their hands dirty with what place was there for him in a setup without crime head of security made to sound important but in reality hed been relegated to checking the takings from their pussy clubs and restaurants with the occasional excitement on the rare occasion someone got drunk or out of order and meanwhile golden boy georges was in the hot seat the lacaille family money spread like monopoly confetti on stocks and shares or marina and hotel developments across mexico and cuba all eyes suddenly on him to secure their future fortunes and like hed warned cacchione did take the pie fill the vacuum theyd left until the runin with medeiros it was then that roman saw his big opportunity cacchiones business died as quickly as it had expanded over the last eighteen months cacchione tried a couple of times to establish himself with other suppliers but two middlemen at the bottom of the st lawrence later medeiros message was clear cacchione was a nogo area under no circumstance to be supplied and with jeanpaul out of crime the vacuum was once again there roman contacted medeiros his story was that he and jeanpaul had split the business jeanpaul would continue solely with legitimate business and now that their cooling off period had achieved its aim of suitably diverting attention roman would quietly revive some of their past enterprises with the accent on quietly officially they were still out of crime jeanpaul therefore wouldnt at any time contact medeiros or talk to him about that side of the business all dealing would be with roman and for the same reason they demanded absolute discretion no mention whatsoever on either side that medeiros was supplying to them medeiros agreed but roman knew that for the other part of the equation hed need gianni cacchiones cooperation cacchione wasnt just going to sit back and let him freely take over his old territory and contacts theyd have to work together drugs distribution in quebec and eastern canada was a strict hierarchy the colombians and mexicans provided the raw shipments the import and business arrangements were handled by the local sicilian neapolitan or union corse mafia who then used the bikers for distribution the colombians wouldnt deal with the bikers directly they saw them as renegade and volatile and at times indiscreet that was why medeiros had warmed to his approach in particular the discretion roman checked his watch as he crossed avenue jean talon he was driving faster than normal one finger tapping repeatedly on the steering wheel he was still wound tight like a coil from the session with jeanpaul twenty minutes before his arranged call to funicelli but he wanted to squeeze in another call beforehand he couldnt go a second longer without getting an inside track on the current state of play at dorchester boulevard discretion was also at the heart of his partnership with gianni cacchione and the tightrope nature of their duplicity seemed to appeal to cacchione as much as him medeiros thought it was the lacailles jeanpaul the cacchiones in reality they worked together and split the proceeds and they used independents such as leduc who previously worked for the lacailles or some of cacchiones old fold whod also gone freelance since medeiros shut them down but apart from the strong insistence on discretion they passed down the line you dont want to end up like the last two dealers that fell foul of medeiros do you these were midlevel soldiers with no possible contact with medeiros and jeanpaul their secret was safe until the problem with leduc and jeanpauls suspicion hed spent hours briefing leduc beforehand getting him to painstakingly fill in details in a little black book they made sure it gave nothing away would just send jeanpaul on a few wildgoose chases you dont give the book up too easy though that would look suspect wait until i interrupt and start pressing hard then finally you pull it out of your ankle sock roman knew all along that he was going to blast leduc as soon as he pulled it out they might have put jeanpaul off with a smokescreen for a few weeks but hed have kept pushing and eventually leduc would have cracked roman was close to breaking out laughing by the third time leduc wanted to run through the sequence and timing with the notebook as if it was a dress rehearsal for his big moment bigger than he realized then tremblay then savard now donatiens maybe there should be a definition in mob handbooks feluccis theorem the size of the fuckup minus the number of people involved times the money and gain squared shall determine how many finally need to be wasted his wry smile quickly faded fifteen months now hed sweated that one problem with an iron fist and muscle and blood how it used to be in the old days before jeanpaul developed a conscience and he was good at this double game what he savoured most was that everyone thought he was so dumb the boneheaded muscleman a neanderthal moustache pete symbol of the years theyd left behind and meanwhile he was playing them all like a string quartet but now there was another player in town one just as sharp at this double game as him and from what had now happened with donatiens obviously equally as willing to bend the rules because if he or cacchione werent behind the attempted hit on donatiens there was only one remaining option ds crowley decided to give gordon waldren one last push he called at the house without announcement having already been told by his men keeping watch that waldren was in he wanted this to be eye to eye to see waldrens reaction crowley started by just asking straightforwardly if gordon waldren had had any contact with his wife or knew where she was no to each and crowley grimaced as if hed bitten into sour fruit hed stayed standing saying he wouldnt be long and started pacing as he turned the screw you know that when i saw you last time i said that wed have to put out a general alert on your wife and lorena well that was finally done crowley didnt enlighten that hed put it out practically the moment hed left waldren at least the next part was the truth that was just a missing persons alert not a criminal one then wed pile on the pressure if we received a specific lead crowley didnt feel like going into the fiasco in france either he didnt want to give waldren the satisfaction of knowing that the false trail hed led there had worked but we are now coming up to the point where we will have to put out that criminal alert unless you cooperate gordon shrugged im not sure i see the difference i thought an alert was an alert and youd have either put one out by now or not gordon hoped that his anxiety wasnt obvious he was meant to leave any minute and his pad with notes was still by the phone along with a fax from the private investigator hed put on ryall he made sure not to even glance that direction and possibly bring crowleys attention to them the difference is that it will suddenly be shifted to grade one priority right now it will be on most police computers courtesy of interpol but they get a lot of missing person enquiries enough as it is from their own neck of the woods so often theyre not given priority all of that will change by say crowley theatrically checked his watch five pm tomorrow twenty hours from now if your wife either hasnt returned lorena or confirmed firm verifiable arrangements that shes on her way back that gives you more than enough time to make contact and convince her after that shell be hunted down in earnest shell be top priority on computers worldwide i see gordon gazed thoughtfully towards the window taking crowley at face value he was concerned but he couldnt help wondering if it was all just a ruse for crowley to be able to set another pressure deadline after the first hadnt worked a second bite at the cherry but gordon didnt have time to banter and perhaps draw him out crowley had caught him seriously on the hop he was meant to leave in only a minute for his next arranged call to elena he needed to wrap this up quickly well if and when she does make contact ill be sure to pass that on gordon pushed a tight smile a were finished here look but crowleys reaction was to take a seat and gordons heart sank he was settling in crowleys expression clouded his forehead furrowing i dont think you appreciate the seriousness of this mr waldren first of all youre insulting my intelligence by insisting that your wife so far hasnt made any contact with you if nothing more than to check on the welfare of her own children but this now means that shell be hunted as a criminal and the reason that she hasnt been listed as such to date is down to me mainly because of the tape you played and your insistence that your wife was not a kidnapper i decided to take you at your word on that mr waldren crowley looked across keenly waldren was trying to brush the whole thing quickly off act offhand but crowley could tell that beneath the surface he was agitated offbalance what crowley hadnt mentioned was that the alert status had been mainly for their benefit not waldrens the tape had been one factor for not listing mrs waldren as a kidnapper because of possible later problems with the cps but the main reason had been a metropolitan police case fifteen months back where an estranged father had abducted his eightyear old son and taken him to italy theyd listed the alert as a kidnapping which rang major alarm bells with the italian caribinieri in the resultant stormtrooper style siege the father was shot and seriously wounded the size of the financial claim was only surpassed by the dent to police pr turton advised caution at least for the first alert put out now having gone out on a limb for you i dont think insulting my intelligence is really a fitting repayment do you gordon nodded solemnly looking down no no youre right im sorry he had no doubt anymore that crowley was either telling the truth or it was a very good bluff but he had to get rid of him quickly already a minute over when he should have left and he should leave at least another two for crowley to get clear but no point in trying to make light of it or act indifferent that was just raising crowleys hackles and making him dig in his toes hed have to indulge him look my wife has called but i just cant say where she is it really is up to her to decide what to do now but i will i promise pass on what youve said and try and convince her to return lorena crowley kept his eyes fixed on waldren trying to gauge his sincerity after a second i think that would be very wise mr waldren because some countries adopt a very serious and aggressive stance with kidnapping and once the fresh alert has gone out from that point on charges for kidnapping will almost automatically follow at this stage while its still missing person status we still have the chance of stepping back from the brink yes yes i understand really as soon as ive spoken to her ill pass that on two minutes over and counting his brain was screaming go go for gods sake just fucking go it would also greatly help your case if your wife gave herself up before we traced her once we have i think it would be that much harder to pull back from pressing full charges theyd had great success with checking scheduled flights from all major airports in france and belgium but charters were proving more difficult due to sheer volume they were only halfway through they still had some way to go i understand gordon cast his eyes down for a second hopefully final contrition go go go right crowley nodded thoughtfully hed probably piled on the pressure as much as he could he thought originally waldren was trying to brush it all off through indifference but now as waldren stood up he noticed one of his hands shaking hed struck a chord waldren was so panicked he couldnt bear to stay on the subject a second longer gordon felt a pang of relief as crowley finally took the prompt and stood up then quickly tensed again as crowley looked towards the phone so five pm no later youll phone me before then and let me know one way or the other yes yes i will dont worry gordon quickly came around blocking crowleys view of the phone and the papers there as he ushered him out crowley stopped just before the front door oh and another thing youre doing your wifes cause no favours by bothering ryalls other daughter at university he called us to complain brief strained smile he didnt want to give away that theyd been following waldren right right im sorry he opened the door three minutes over two minutes still to wait he wasnt going to make it his nerves were hammering out of control and for a moment he feared crowley was going to bring up another last second issue but then he appeared to think better of it and with another curt smile and nod five pm tomorrow then he left gordons breathing was laboured heavy as he shut the door he had to strain to hear crowleys receding footsteps his car door closing the car finally starting and heading away hed aimed to leave a full two minutes gap but in the end he counted only fifty seconds before he grabbed the fax and notes by the phone and rushed from the house he put his foot down hard six mile drive to the phone box hopefully he might be able to claw back a minute or so crowley would likely have headed in the opposite direction towards poole the last thing he wanted was to race past him he screeched to a halt and leapt out the telephone box was on the opposite side of the road but he could hear it ringing as soon as he was out of the car he had to wait for one passing car then bolted across but within a yard of the box it stopped ringing what do you mean you dont know whats going on its your job to fucking know whats going on i tell you now its gone to s theres a complete shutdown on information on donatiens here not a whispers being passed round everything is being handled by mundys team out of ottawa roman clutched the receiver tighter with campions wheedling tone hed phoned through ten minutes ago as a clerk of the court chasing a file their usual prearranged alert campion then left dorchester boulevard and headed to a phone kiosk two blocks away to receive romans callback someone must know something chenouda is still right at the heart of this i know and he cant possibly be working this alone no hes not alone but its a tight knit group only two of his team chac patoine and maury legault know anything because they were apparently handling surveillance on donatiens when he was snatched but then chenouda went straight to s he hasnt shared anything with the rest of his team and i dont even know if patoine and legault are still in the information loop now that its gone to s great fucking great romans jaw clenched just when he needed campion the most he was ineffectual useless hopefully the bombshell with chenouda would shake him up when i say chenoudas at the heart of this with donatiens its more than you probably realize he told campion his theory that he thought chenouda was responsible for snatching donatiens to apply the final pressure to get him to testify certainly it wasnt me and i know for sure it wasnt cacchione either so you tell me from where i stand i dont see any other option left only the fall of campions breathing at the other end for a second youre joking no deadly fucking serious are you sure i mean i know he was desperately trying to get donatiens to testify but going to those lengths sure sure im sure if it wasnt me or cacchione then who the fuck do you think it was boy scouts practising ropeties for canada day i know i know im not doubting what you say its just that it seems so well so extreme chenoudas whole career would be at risk for a stunt like that not to mention a healthy jail term on top so the indians got big balls it was him no doubt but what im getting to is chenouda couldnt have pulled something like this alone he had help and there must be clues and an information trail there somewhere if you dig and push some youll find them campion sighed you dont get it do you its with s now ive got no jurisdiction or reason to push or even ask a single question about this case anymore and the reason its with s is that chenouda has said he suspects an internal leak at dorchester boulevard so the heat on that front is going to be intense ill be keeping my head low and have my breath held as it is if i start asking questions and probing who do you think is going to fall first in the spotlight they both fell silent for a second it hit roman then just how clever chenouda had been he probably suspected a leak and needed ss help in any case to put donatiens in the witness protection programme yet at the same time putting everything in ss hands out of reach of his own department put an extra camouflage over him arranging donatiens abduction but roman just couldnt leave things on that note there was too much now at stake then youre going to have to take a leaf out of chenoudas book he managed to organize snatching donatiens without anyone knowing youre just going to have to dig without anyone knowing im sorry its just too risky roman felt his blood boil hed first got his hooks into campion an assistant crown attorney under tom maitland when he learned about his gambling and highlife tastes hed have preferred someone in chenoudas own department because there were always delays in information filtering through to maitlands office but it was the closest option going now he was beginning to feel even further shortchanged you know what pilots always say they say that nowadays the computers and automatic pilots do everything that they really only need to concentrate for the few moments of takeoff and landing for the rest of the time they just watch the instruments and read a book whatever and that ninety percent of their training and the justification for their paypackets goes into how they might react in an emergency if god forbid something should go wrong well the plane is going down now campion this is when we fucking need you otherwise whats been the point of the money ive paid you these past two years its not that i dont want to help campion was suddenly more hesitant his voice tremulous its just that i dont know what i can do now with s involved well you work that out and come up with something more positive next time we speak and if youre worried about raising too much attention with s then just think on one thing if donatiens testifies and me and i go down what do you think im going to say when they ask about my internal contact and theres the chance of five or seven off of my sentence roman bathed in the warm glow of the stunned silence at the other end for a few seconds then hung up twentynine what are you going to do gordon asked i dont know i dont know when gordon hadnt answered the first time elena had tried again after a minute or so thinking that maybe hed been held up in traffic or had car problems and on the third try hed answered theyd spent a while swapping respective tribulations and dramas his with crowley were almost insultingly trivial compared to hers now it was decision time elena was relieved to hear that her flight hadnt been traced yet and the level of alert explained why she hadnt been flagged down by the first squad car the policeman who had approached her had seen her near miss and was merely enquiring if she was okay to drive on or if she needed assistance but that would all change in only twelve hours the next one to approach her would be with handcuffs and his gun drawn she was on a phone in the eaton centre with lorena at a table eight paces away in an open food hall area the clatter and bustle of people eating echoed slightly she had to cover her other ear at moments to hear gordon clearly she didnt notice the man at a far table watching her every move between cappuccino sips if youre not heading back will you at least be sending lorena gordon prompted as much as i know youd like to keep trying its probably the only sensible option left now i know sensible nothing shed done so far had been sensible her whole life in fact though shed only discovered it these past few days had been a nonsense how was she suddenly going to gain vision now dead ends at every turn all her options fast closing down and now shed reached the stage of inaction through fear almost fatalistically certain that whichever one she chose it would be wrong crowleys deadline little chance now of seeing her son and nothing helpful in the investigative report on ryall related from gordon nothing suspicious about the adoptions or around the time of mikayas pregnancy the only other link with children was him apparently doing party magic acts to pay his way through university but the bombshell news from the donatiens about georges hung like a heavy cloud over most of their conversation at first all gordon could manage was oh elena followed by a weighty defeated sigh then after a second i just dont know what to say that was all she seemed to get these days silent empathy the donatiens so awkward they could hardly meet her eye and now gordon winded and lost for words only lorena seemed to be bold enough to talk openly about it ask her what was wrong and shed either fluff around it or openly lie so in the end there was really nobody she was fully sharing the burden with and she felt tired so tired the endless search and chase of the past days only to hit the brick wall of the donatiens calamitous news then the jolt of the policeman by her car right on its back she felt totally drained no reserves left to struggle on she leant her weight heavier against the wall by the phone and softly exhaled i think youre right i should send lorena back with nothing on ryall and the sessions heading nowhere no point in holding on to her here any more gordon said sorry he didnt catch the last part and elena turned into the wall to shield from the echoing bustle behind and repeated herself gordon asked when and she said probably first thing tomorrow i think its too late to arrange anything tonight then after a second another thought struck her the only problem is that as soon as i send her back crowley will know where i am and alert the canadian police she felt unsettled having voiced it that the only reason she might keep lorena there was to serve her own aims once again she was putting those first well if you didnt send her back till tomorrow morning youd probably get a good twentyfour hours grace overall what with the flight and then time for crowley to make contact id probably need a hell of a lot more than that to sort out this mess with georges several days or even weeks that is if im going to be able to get to see him at all elena glanced around to see lorena heading back towards their table from her direction she must have been back at the food counter for something or to the toilets to one side when will you know for sure gordon asked i arranged to call claude donatiens in just over an hour he said hed have phoned the police by then and got their initial reaction not only for me possibly being able to see georges but if and when they might be able to see him i know it sounds trite but good luck thanks and if you are able to go for it you appreciate the risk youre running because youre certainly on police computers somewhere i realize shed thought of little else since leaving the donatiens and then hearing about crowleys new deadline originally her fear was that as soon as she made contact with the police about georges her name would come up on the rcmps computer now it was like russian roulette it might come up it might not but if she didnt make contact before crowleys deadline even that chance would be gone the gun would once again be loaded with six bullets theres also the possibility that crowley was bluffing just to create an extra pressure deadline he could have put out a grade one alert immediately i see and now a factor she hadnt considered the gun could already be fully loaded in that moment doubt once again seized her she was crazy to think she could go through with it she turned to a quivering jelly just at the sight of a passing squad car shed never be able to brave contacting the police over georges she should just throw in the towel and head back to england with lorena well maybe claude donatiens will just say its a no go so its not something ill even have to elena broke off as she looked around lorena wasnt at their table her eyes darted like a pinball not at the food counters not by the toilets not by the shops to one side then she surveyed quickly back through the other tables and the crowds milling around she was nowhere to be seen oh jesus whats wrong its lorena i left her at a table and now shes gone i cant see her her breath was falling hard and fast sorry gordon ive got to go now got to find her she hung up halfway through gordon replying i understand well and started working her way deeper through the tables trying to see if lorena was perhaps obscured by some of the plants and pillars nothing she recalled then lorena heading back to their table from her direction lorena had probably heard her talking heard her mention sending her back to england and ryall oh god thats what this was all about she became more frantic her step quickening and her breath staccato as she scanned furtively through the milling crowds then rushed and checked the washroom and the shops in each direction finally stopping at the fourteenth checked lorena surely wouldnt have gone this far and shed no longer be able to see her if she suddenly appeared and returned to their table still nothing nothing elena returned to where shed started by the phone still frantically scanning her breath fell laboured and heavy with the exertion and panic and her chest ached as if a nail had been hammered home dead centre shed asked herself what else could possibly go wrong on the way from the donatiens a whimsical escape valve from the ludicrous impossible problems with georges now she had her answer she stood in the same position with her breath easing as her stomach sank deeper with each passing minute until finally after almost fifteen minutes she felt nauseous the rest of her body little more than an empty numb shell with the realization that lorena probably wasnt returning shed lost her greyblue water iced over white in patches where the snow had settled from last night a ring of pines encircled in an oval half a mile away stretching into the distance as far as one could see right now the snow and ice gave the lake a hostile barren feel but georges imagined that in a month or so that would all melt and it would be almost idyllic azure blue water and rich green pines stretching endlessly straight out of a canada wilds vacation brochure difficult for georges to think of it in terms of being his prison for the next six or seven months maybe longer he guessed from the ice on the lake and the dusting of snow overnight that they were somewhere further north northern quebec or ontario perhaps even manitoba the ice and snow had mostly gone around montreal but further north it took longer to shift that apart from the twohour small plane journey and twentyminute car ride following was the only clue to where they were hed had to put on a headset with blackedout visor the minute they were airborne and wasnt allowed to remove it until theyd arrived chac chenoudas sidekick designated to accompany him for the first two weeks wore the same as would chenouda apparently when he came out for his first briefing in a couple of weeks s were taking no risks it wasnt a matter of trust chenouda enlightened when theyd initially run through procedure it was just the fact that the three of them by necessity would have contact with other rcmp staff over his investigation and could inadvertently give away clues to his location any such contact by georges would obviously only be by phone secure line chenouda was eager to add the others on the plane out the pilot and two detective constables were all s travelling without headsets the safe house was already well known to them and theyd stay with him one month on one off swapping duty with an alternate set of three s guards chenouda went to great lengths to explain how they were a clandestine elite cut off from all other rcmp contact or even discussions with their own families about their movements the secrets of the kingdom have got to rest with someone and their record is second to none theyve never lost anyone yet georges knew that chenouda meant well but it was going to take a while for his unease to shift if it went at all and the danger he was in was only part of it this level of remoteness being cut off from all other human contact was totally alien to him he was a city dweller used to the hustle bustle of downtown montreal and a crammed stopwatchtimed business day this lakeside retreat with nothing but empty time on his hands was going to take some getting used to and whether partly because of the time to dwell on it or not already he was starting to miss simone what hadnt helped was his phone conversation with chenouda the day before the mention of the secure line they were on led him to raise the subject that hed like to phone simone one last call a sort of goodbye if you will i never did get to say goodbye to her you see and also to tell her that i was sorry and put her mind at ease that i wouldnt be testifying directly against her father that this was all just about roman chenouda was vehemently against the idea simone would be one of the first theyd expect him to phone along with his parents we can use whatever scrambling and encryption codes we like but a skilled guy the other end can always crack it and under no circumstances did he want georges giving away what he might or might not say in testimony itll just give the lacailles defence lawyer ammunition to use against us his three s guards clive steve and russell hed been given only their first names had done everything to make him feel at home and the house was spacious and comfortable enough to stave off claustrophobia a stunning wood and glass contemporary with five bedrooms family and games room with snooker table and even a small gym and jacuzzi a firstfloor verandah stretched its entire length facing the lake and on his first look around in daylight it was easy to see why this particular house had been chosen the lake ran each side and then cut back in to join a hundred yards back so that effectively the house was on a peninsula with only a single bridge connecting and the study was apparently crammed with monitoring equipment with the guards taking it in turn to watch its screens views over the lake from all directions and the connecting bridge plus motion and weight sensors on the bridge and dotted around the first five metres of land in from the lake this was a fortress and as much as that made him feel more assured about his safety he couldnt escape the final keyturn that gave to his sense of isolation he was kept apart from the world outside as much as it was kept from him a gilded and comfortable prison but a prison nevertheless he shuddered slightly recalling his feelings as hed first approached the house with the blackened visor and the bumpiness of the last stretch of track before the bridge suddenly he was back in the van with the hood on he wasnt sure what upset him most recalling it now that in those moments hed faced death headon given up all hope or than now it represented his last moment of freedom the pivotal event after which his life could never be the same again roman sat with funicelli in his car forty yards back from elena waldrens hotel on rue berri roman had instructed funicelli not to break off from watching her not for a second so the only option had been for roman to come and collect what he had on tape so far roman couldnt resist a faint smile as the cassette tape rolled funicelli had related the substance of this womans conversation at the donatiens when theyd spoken almost two hours ago and hed immediately relayed it to jeanpaul but listening to it first hand the impact came home harder tugged at the heartstrings separated at birth the son she hadnt seen in twentynine years pure golddust if anyone had a shot at seeing donatiens it was her the light was fading fast as roman listened and funicelli found himself squinting slightly wondering if the streetlight was enough to see if she came out of the hotel or whether hed have to pull closer the strangest thing was with the girl funicelli commented absently i saw everything from where i was saw exactly where shed gone but i couldnt say nothing makes you wonder what was going on there yeah strange roman was too absorbed with the tape to shift his concentration much when the donatiens started talking about family background and how long theyd lived in their current house roman fastforwarded on the second windon funicelli prompted as claude donatiens voice on the phone came across this is where he phones the rcs to find out the lay of the land roman rewound a fraction after some preambles with another rcmp officer roman recognized chenoudas voice straightaway chenouda commented that he was glad of the call because they were in fact about to call the family anyway to brief about the current situation weve instructed your son not under any circumstances to make contact with you because youd be one of the first places the lacailles would look so if anyone contacts you asking questions anything suspicious at all youre to let us know anything like that already roman held his breath and looked sharply at funicelli but funicelli looked relaxed had already heard the tape no not that i can think of claude donatiens answered probably his wife hadnt even mentioned the telephone engineer calling or if she had he didnt see it as suspicious well thats good good its probably too early yet for them to react theyre still scrambling for what to do roman nodded and smiled at funicelli always said he had big balls but they sure aint fucking crystal but youll let me know the moment anything changes yes certainly i will then claude donatiens came onto the main reason for his call if and when they might be able to see their son he sounded hesitant chenoudas opening about georges being instructed not to contact them had obviously put him off his stride bade the worst but chenouda listened patiently and didnt completely pour cold water on the idea he explained that the idea of the programme was that their son would have no contact with family or friends but thats not to say that a meeting couldnt be arranged at a later stage if we can put the right safeguards in place it was difficult to tell if chenouda meant what he said or was letting the donatiens down softly didnt want to tackle right now the thorny truth that they might never get to see their son again roman sat forward as claude donatiens came to the topic of the woman whod visited them chenouda was off balance at first and it took a couple of questions for him to get things clear in his mind then he was circumspect raising the coincidence of the timing surely this comes under what i mentioned initially things out of the ordinary suspicious people making contact out of the blue and asking questions no no i dont think so she came across as very genuine and she showed us some papers from england birth certificate something too from a search agency shes been looking for him for a month or so way before any of this happened chenouda fell silent for a second well whether or not shes genuine i suggest you leave to me to decide after ive had her checked out and seen for myself what papers shes got faint resigned sigh as chenouda asked and made note of her name and where she was staying ill speak to her roman glanced up at the hotel ahead perhaps she was talking to chenouda right now if only they could get a bug inside there as well the uncertainty not knowing for sure was stifling had his nerves on a razors edge he told funicelli to phone him the minute anything new broke or she left the hotel then took the tapes and headed off to see jeanpaul jeanpaul looked up thoughtfully as they finished what do you think roman shrugged i think that if she lays it on thick like she did with claude donatiens weve got a chance thing is its our best and only chance right now jeanpaul nodded maybe so but this chenouda sounds more than a little reticent was very noncommittal yeah true its all in the balance could go either way but roman was more confident than he made out because what jeanpaul couldnt take account of was how chenouda arranging donatiens abduction could now play a vital card in their favour cutting donatiens off from his family friends and past was bad enough but being responsible for him never being able to meet his natural mother added an all the more poignant crushing burden hopefully the straw to break the camels back roman had been blind with fury when it first dawned on him what chenouda had done not just the sheer cheek of it or that someone else apart from him was suddenly playing under the table with an extra deck but the fact that hed been first to fall in the frame which chenouda would have known all too well hed been made to look a fool and a liar with jeanpaul despite his protestations last time and him making good now roman was sure jeanpaul still harboured doubt chenouda had probably had a good laugh up his sleeve at that getting donatiens to testify and at the same time putting him and jeanpaul at each others throats but now hopefully thered be some divine payback in store for chenouda roman grimaced tightly at jeanpaul well just have to wait and see which way he finally jumps if there was any way to avoid sending you back i would lorena but theres nowhere left for me to go with this cant you see that yes i i suppose i can lorena eyes flickered down and she bit lightly at her bottom lip the first acceptance perhaps even a shade of guilt at the trouble shed caused but it had been a tough few hours to get there elena contemplated lorena had heard her on the phone and at first thought of running away she went out of the mall and got as far as sixty yards down st catherine st before the confusion of people and traffic passing made her realize that shed be lost and alone in a strange city she returned to the mall and stood inside a shop doorway trembling trying to frantically think of what else she might do she could just see elena from where she was but was careful to duck inside the shop when elena turned then as elena appeared about to give up and go she rushed over and clutched on to her and burst into tears saying she was sorry sorry sorry between the tears she explained what had happened and begged and pleaded for elena not to send her back tomorrow the display took all the steam out of elenas anger all she did was wipe away lorenas tears order a coffee for them both and sit lorena down and try and calmly explain her dilemma but lorena was practically beyond consolation mr ryall will be angry with me much worse than before i cant go back now elena reasoned and cajoled but lorena clung on obstinately still pleading and panicked at the thought of having to face ryall again and in the end all elena could think of to break through was being dramatic you dont understand lorena if i dont send you back to england tomorrow im going to jail for this but that tape i thought that was to help you so that you wouldnt get into trouble yes that helped us for the last few days but after tomorrow that wont help anymore and they could send me to jail for a long while lorena you wouldnt want that would you no no i wouldnt watching the heavy shadows in lorenas eyes as she looked away awkwardly torn between her own very real fear and getting elena into such serious trouble elena felt immediately guilty using such tactics but she hadnt seen much choice shed had to break off to make her call to claude donatiens claude said that the officer hed spoken to michel chenouda was noncommittal but at least had said hed contact her he hadnt closed the door straight away elena was suddenly apprehensive when claude said hed passed on her details shed hoped to just be given a number have that option of whether or not to brave making contact now that had been taken from her grasp probably best she might have balked and never made that final move but she was nervous that now the police had her name and where she was staying they could already be checking her out she could return to the hotel to find it ringed by police cars with their beacons flashing both her and lorena were silent heading back to the hotel her worried about impending arrest lorena about returning to ryall thered been no flashing lights at the hotel but elena had been too tense waiting on chenoudas call to talk much about lorenas concerns shed just placated that lorena shouldnt worry so theyd sort something out well go for something to eat and talk then chenoudas call had been a nonevent after the level of anticipation and panic shed worked herself up to all he did was confirm with her the details claude donatiens had passed on to him then suggest that they should meet and talk fully at eleventhirty the next day he gave her an address on dorchester boulevard and asked that she bring her passport and all relevant paperwork regarding her son but soon after putting down the phone she began to panic how on earth she was going to face walking into a police station right into the lions den they found a restaurant on st denis that had a special on lobsters and elena talked lorena into trying one as a change from pizza if this meeting doesnt work out tomorrow ill be heading back with you elena was still throwing across everything she could to reassure lorena had earlier looked concerned when shed explained that if she was staying on all she could do was walk lorena into the nearest british embassy and give them the ryalls details theyd have to arrange transport back for her anything to meet the deadline i dont think much will come of it so youll probably end up with my company the shadows only eased from lorenas eyes a fraction elena once again opted for dramatics to shift lorenas mood she decided to open up more about her son explain why tomorrow was so important to her i said that i hadnt seen him in a while but i lied truth is ive never seen him since he was born i was very young when i became pregnant and my father gave him away to another family i was given no choice in the matter im sorry lorena said appearing confused for a second how else to respond you missed him a lot yes very much and now i dont know if ill ever get to see him again she blinked slowly but suddenly there were no more welling tears the seesaw events of the past fortyeight hours the valerian pills and her mounting tiredness had battered her senses numb sometimes she felt completely empty of emotions little more than a hollow shell or was it simply a protective barrier so that any new shock wouldnt send her reeling and rip her insides out she was finally battlehardened for the worst was he cruel your father no just very strict impossibly strict so he wasnt someone for you to be afraid of like mr ryall no i suppose not elena smiled wanly as she made the concession shed raised it as a trump card but lorena had deftly slipped it back in the deck where it belonged of course she had been afraid of her father but that suddenly put it all in perspective if lorenas claims had substance lorena had a real fear to face suddenly lorena was once again the frightened little girl reaching out a hand for help from the back of nicola ryalls range rover and whatever rationale elena threw across she knew that she could never shift the lingering fear in lorenas eyes jail sentence or not in the end she just didnt think she could face sending lorena back to ryall tomorrow another restless night elena had been hoping finally to get a good nights sleep she was so exhausted and so keen to make the right impression for her big day tomorrow get rid of the bloodshots in her eyes and steady her nerves hopefully not come across how she felt haggard desperate at her wits end theres no way this halfcrazed woman is getting to see him but perversely the worry about how the day might go kept her thoughts churning and now she still had lorena to worry about shed hoped to at least put that to rest all shed said in the end was for lorena not to worry she didnt think that she could send her back well try and sort something out tomorrow left that small gap open in case finally there was no choice sometimes she wished that she were arrested so that she didnt have to make the decision it was frustrating shed set her gameplan was almost there in convincing lorena getting her to accept then suddenly shed been slamdunked at the last moment the problem was which was the right lorena had lorena purely stumbled on hitting the right chord about her father through a childs naive bluntness or had she planned it her streetwiliness showing through was lowndes right that lorena had formed an unnatural attachment to her and this was all just a cry for attention to grab back some of their old bond together in which case lorena must have planned everything practically from the start except for one thing the fear elena had seen in lorenas eyes in the restaurant that was difficult to fake she herself was full of concern and panic for what the next day held but what shed seen in lorena in that moment went far beyond that whether something was happening with ryall or not it was certainly real in lorenas mind so why after all these sessions couldnt she recall anything the thought had a loop effect there was no real answer and so it just went around and elena let it because it was soporific pushed her closer towards sleep she finally dozed off after half an hour her last thoughts on what she might wear for her meeting tomorrow something cleanlined and respectable but at the same time not too cool and formal it should be softedged maternal shed glanced at the weather forecast before getting into bed to help her decide overnight lows of or or by midmorning rising to highs of or for some reason she found the numbers replaying in her thoughts halfway through the night jumbling with a segment from one of lowndes sessions and he was saying some numbers seven eight elena was suddenly wideawake again her breath falling sharp and fast magic acts she sat up and looked at the bedside clock am barely two hours sleep she felt like waking lorena screaming out loud that she thought shed found the key and theyd both jump up and down excitedly and wake the rest of the hotel but she needed to know for sure so she threw on some clothes grabbed her bag and headed for the nearest phone box she used her global call card and dialled her home number gordon initially pleasantly surprised almost relieved to hear her voice perhaps hed been halfexpecting another call from crowley berated her for breaking their call policy this couldnt wait elena said still slightly breathless from the rush to the booth besides ive used a global call card itll be scrambled through some faceless exchange in virginia i could be calling from anywhere in the world she told gordon what she needed to know ryalls background with childrens magic acts and why where did your investigator get that from from some old newspaper clipping i believe no he hadnt send them through but yes gordon could get hold of him now he works from home phone me back in fifteen minutes and ill see what hes got six minutes later gordon had the fax through three newspaper clippings in total he scanned rapidly through his blood running cold as he came to the reference twothirds of the way into the second article elenas hunch had been right he tapped his fingers on the table by the phone and read through more thoroughly as he waited on elenas call back elenas nerves had been wound too tight to do anything more than pace agitatedly back and forth ten yards either side of the call box to kill the time once again she was slightly breathless all she could manage was oh god oh god when gordon told her shed hoped that shed be right but another part of her had hoped desperately that shed be wrong she sighed heavily felt the last remnants wash away from her the rest now i suppose will have to be sorted out on the psychiatrists couch gordon again wished her good luck for tomorrow as they signed off thanks hopelessly inadequate for one of the biggest days of her life decision day now on two fronts but she felt too numbed and shellshocked to say anything else she stood for a moment by lorenas bed before getting back into bed herself lorena didnt appear to have stirred even notice that shed been gone she realized then that she couldnt say anything it could later be said that lorena had merely filled in the gaps to suit shed only be able to tell lowndes then theyd just have to hold their breath to see if events followed the nightmare path they feared but the strongest emotion she felt looking on at lorena gently sleeping was that she was sorry so sorry for ever having doubted her thirty funicelli located a telephone junction box in a service slipway fifteen yards along from the hotel montclaire the hotel where the english woman was staying the box also appeared to service three or four other buildings in the first stretch of rue berri he picked through and found the wires and switches for the montclaire then started making the connections four minutes five tops he estimated but four or five minutes in the open by a busy street was a lifetime hed been uneasy just in the couple of minutes up the telegraph pole outside the donatiens but that had been beaconsfield peaceful suburbia now he was in one of the busiest parts of montreal the hustle bustle and the sheer number of things he had to keep a watch out for made it an entirely different proposition hed chosen to do it early am telephone engineers often started at am but by the time their rosters were done and they were clear of the depots the earliest calls were usually after am so he shouldnt have to worry about a bell canada engineer passing and asking what he was doing but the rest of the city was coming rapidly to life the flow of traffic and people passing was increasing the occasional passerby throwing him a glance an east indian by the deppaneur on the corner possibly its owner studied him thoughtfully for almost thirty seconds before going back inside the shop funicelli was sweating cobs his hands trembling on the wires within the first two minutes this was a nightmare but roman had been insistent that they get a bug on the womans line weve got to know what progress she makes with chenouda if anythings going down itll probably be decided within the next few days that was the other thing funicelli had to worry about that no faults were reported on any lines within that time to make engineers open up the junction box and discover his bug they couldnt risk leaving something like that inside the box for any length of time for the last minute he hardly paid attention to who might be passing or looking at him his concentration was fixed intently on securing the last few wires in place he glanced at his watch as he slammed shut and locked the box four minutes twentytwo not bad he let out a slow sigh as he walked down to his white van parked round the corner but still his hands were shaking slightly as he opened its back doors and threw his tools inside he nodded briefly to frank massenat parked ten yards back on the far side as he jumped in the drivers seat funicelli had kept lookout on the hotel until pm then massenat had taken over for overnight take the van back change breakfast coffee and check his cousin hadnt burnt down his shop while he was away then hed return to take over again from massenat at am nothing nothing massenat commented as they changed over except that at halfthree she suddenly comes out and makes a call from that booth over there then she paces up and down as if her ass was on fire before making another call then back to the excitement of watching people sleep massenat shrugged and no signs of life yet this morning but just over an hour later that changed as funicelli watched her leave the hotel girl in tow she made a quick call from the same booth massenat saw her use then hailed a taxi funicelli followed through the midmorning traffic two or three cars behind a light drizzle started falling halfway along rene levesque and he put the wipers on intermittent hed already phoned roman two hours ago to tell him that the bug had been successfully placed but as he saw the taxi pull up outside rcmp hq on dorchester boulevard he took out his mobile to call again roman would want to know this news straight away the first halfhour of questioning was mostly factfinding and low key apart from a couple of jumpbacks to fill in small details at first overlooked elena ran through everything in historical and hopefully to staff sergeant michel chenouda patiently listening logical sequence her father dr maniatis with the birth certificate the stephanous the orphanage at baie du febvre and finally the donatiens michel chenouda sat directly opposite her at an oval table and the papers shed produced were spread between them at the end of the table a tape ran while another officer at its side made brief notes for the most part chenouda stayed silent with the occasional thoughtful nod as she ran through the background appeared on the surface at least to accept her story but she couldnt help sensing that underneath he was uneasy harboured underlying doubt and then the questions started to reflect that doubt become more intent the pressure was turned up a notch chenouda shook his head but what i dont understand is why you left it until now to try and make contact well for a long while i blanked it from my mind then i adopted two children of my own and i started working with children in need in orphanages in eastern europe mainly romania i think part of that was to push away the guilt that id given away my own child elena looked down then towards the corridor outside three doors along lorena aka katine waited in an open rcmp general office it was in fact a problem with one of the romanian children not much older than my own daughter katine that started me thinking again about my son id told myself all along that hed have been alright hed have gone to a good home somewhere and suddenly it hit me that that wasnt always true what sort of problems chenouda looked at her keenly elena felt the intensity of his stare like a blowtorch on her cheek and her heart skipped theyd probably known all along and the chain of seemingly standard questions had all been leading to this coupe de grace now she tried to cling again to the steely nerve that had made her able to walk in here in the first place shed paused just before the buildings wide glass doors taking a deep breath she thought she was okay but walking along all shed been able to hear was the pounding of her heart she couldnt even hear her own footsteps or any of the movement or activity around now again it was drowning out all else the officer at the end was scrawling in his notepad but she couldnt hear it she swallowed hard in an attempt to clear her ears perhaps chenouda was just being thorough didnt know anything after all well it turns out her father was molesting her i see michel eyes flickered down awkwardly for a second and he pursed his lips and what happened to the girl in the end elena watched chenoudas gaze slowly rise to meet hers and again her resolve slipped away theyd probably found her on the computer hours ago and were now busily matching lorena on screen in the office down the corridor her left hand on the table started to shake and she pulled it down and clenched it tight in her lap the officer at the end looked up keenly from his notes for a moment she hoped he hadnt noticed she uh shes gone to a foster home while the court case is pending and at the same time shes undergoing psychiatric assessment pretty much the scenario she anticipated with lorena moving things on a couple of months shed phoned lowndes to try and get an early morning appointment but the closest he could fit in was pm shed called gordon upon leaving to see if he could delay crowleys alert otherwise it would be going out about now maybe chenoudas people hadnt found anything yet on the computer but someone would walk in at any second or lorena would slip up and forget that her name was meant to be katine too many possibilities she felt them tugging her in all directions at the same time she must have been crazy to walk in here crazy right chenoudas gaze stayed on her steadily and for a moment she half expected him to suddenly stand up and announce but thats not what we in fact know to be the case mrs waldren and signal his assistant to handcuff her but in the end all he said was it must have been very tough on you yes yes it was she let out a tired breath as quickly as the pressure had been turned on it was off again michel contemplated the papers on the table it would have made everything so much easier if this was a hoax a predictable tryon from roman but it all seemed so real far too intricate and detailed to be a scam the english connection the court order and birth certificate the orphanage roman was devious but even he couldnt have gone to these lengths michel had already checked her out on the computer for any criminal record an hour before she arrived nothing now he had some new names and details to check but his first gut feeling was that this english woman elena waldren was telling the truth she was georges donatiens birth mother the coincidence of the timing hed been uneasy about the most but her explanation there too had come across as real heartfelt emotional her voice had been close to breaking at points if she wasnt telling the truth then roman had found one of the best michel had ever come across the other possibility was that roman had at some stage discovered about her being georges real mother and had pulled her out of the woodwork now when he most needed her but her initial enquiries with the search agency were weeks ago when roman still had georges firmly in his sights and high hopes of soon removing him and from her passport her flight over was three days ago eighteen hours before georges abduction even her visit to the orphanage was the day before their final announcement and roman possibly knowing that he might need her as an ace card though still michel sensed an anxiety and nervousness beneath that he couldnt quite fathom he looked at her contemplatively for a second as he forced a weak smile im sorry but we cant be too careful maybe it was more shellshock than nerves shed obviously been through the mill and now on top had to face the third degree from him and the worry that having got this far she might fail at the final hurdle she might never get to see her son and all of that now rested in his hands it was enough to make anyone nervous and that realization also pressed the weight heavier on his own shoulders just how was he going to wend his way through this explain these people threatening your son are highly dangerous and probably by now also desperate theyd go to any lengths to use others to try and get to him michel held out a palm others such as yourself oh i i understand though it had taken a second for the penny to drop theyd been at crossed purposes all the time with the questioning starting to have an edge shed become convinced that hed seen something on the computer but all the time hed been thinking that she might be a mafia plant she almost couldnt resist smiling partly release of tension partly at the ludicrousness but bit it back out of step with the mood what had brought them to this room and the fact that its outcome balanced on a knifes edge hung heavy in the air smothered all else now for the difficult part thought michel he felt her eyes on him expectantly full of hope that hed say shed be able to see her son the son hed made sure was hidden away from everyone possibly never for her to see again he felt the pressure of it like a dull ache at the back of his neck he remembered his mother saying that if you tell a lie itll come out somehow dont know how but it always does hed convinced himself before the meeting that it must be a ruse from roman it had his trademark all over it was the perfect extra pressure to bring into play you want to hide him away forever there ive trumped you the mother hes never seen get out of that one hed become so convinced that it was false that he didnt expect to have to face this moment now tell this woman whod already been through a living hell that the chances of her getting to see her son were slim the problem is mrs waldren as i told claude donatiens and he no doubt passed on to you this programme is very strict the idea is that your son sees no one and i mean no one from his past now thats not to say that that rule cant be broken given very special circumstances and then again only if we can put the right safeguards in place the first thing to happen is that we tell your son because its certainly not in the programmes charter that we withhold vital personal information from him now if he doesnt want to see you for whatever reason then thats the end of the road right there if he does then it has to be put before the department that set up the programme in ottawa then we have to michel broke off shed been through enough for her not to have to suffer him burying the likelihood of seeing her son under a chain of procedural details it was the least he owed her well put it this way we have to measure the strength and need of your request against the risk taken by granting it what are my chances michel looked slightly down to one side shed wasted no time cut right to the core now the spotlight had swung round on him and he found the plea in her eyes unsettling difficult to meet head on his first instinct was to bluff buoy her spirits if nothing else than to ease that searching stare but hed already played enough shadow games with this he didnt want to also be responsible for leading her on in the final clinches theyre no better than even his voice was level matteroffact your reason and need are strong couldnt be stronger but the risks wed likely subject your son to are equally as strong in the end it wouldnt be up to me to decide s in ottawa will have the final say another truth mundy would decide michel wasnt just passing the buck so that he could sidestep the pitiful plea in her eyes right now he was the only focus for what she wanted but her eyes stayed steadily on him and she reached one hand across the table and gently gripped his but youll do your best to help me to try and convince them michel wished she hadnt made that final physical contact hed saved a last gap for himself in case he needed to shield within it stay remote from her dilemma and now shed bridged it hed felt her hand trembling like a trapped bird felt all the hopes and desires of a lifetime built up and now passed on to him with that single touch yes yes i will his voice wavered slightly though once again he was telling the truth but what he couldnt explain was that hed plead her case strongly as much for himself as for her having trawled his conscience long and hard before finally going ahead with georges faked abduction what he couldnt bear was an ounce more doubt or guilt over it and if she finally got to see her son there was no harm done things would be back to how they were before shed made contact i think we can trace her crowley was hit with the claim as soon as he walked in the squad room that morning dc proctor one of the more technically attuned of his team invariably took pole position whenever things drifted sufficiently into cyberspace to make eyes in the squad room start to glaze over really crowley prepared himself for an onslaught of technobabble as he took of his jacket and looped it over the back of his chair he might have shown more enthusiasm if proctor hadnt broken the golden rule that it was best not to speak to him until hed downed his first coffee proctor continued undeterred crowley blinked at him twice heavily yawned and halfway through headed to the coffee machine with proctors voice trailing behind him it was about the call elena waldren had made with a call card yes central exchange but the cards were usually all numbered if we give them the number called and the time they should be able to tell us what number card made that call proctor paused for emphasis and also where that card was sold crowley poured and took his first sip but the last part had already got him fully awake his eyes were wide above the cup youre sure sure as can be crowley gave proctor the green light to start chasing it a stream of secrecy and liability disclaimer forms faxed back and forth between them and the global call company eat up much of the day and midafternoon gordon waldren was on the line about his wifes deadline could crowley extend it his wife had a session planned with a psychiatrist and she fully expected to come out with proof positive that ryall was molesting lorena but i wont know for sure until my next contact with her at eightthirty tonight i dont know crowley clasped at his hair and looked across at proctor at any other time he might have said yes but if they found a firm trace turton would probably be reluctant to delay any longer ill make a call to the powers that be and let you know in an hour or two proctor had the information in only another forty minutes that the card used was in a batch that went through their distributor for eastern canada eastern canada crowley confirmed they cant narrow it down closer than that no thats the closest they supply to the distributor and from there have no track of exactly which cities which cards go to great crowley thought theyd narrowed it to an area geographically five times larger than the half of western europe where originally they thought she might be but at least it was down to a population of million rather than million and the number of cities and towns was far less he phoned inspector turton and explained the state of play could be just a delaying tactic from gordon waldren turton commented sucking in his breath added weight to his deliberation he knows that shes made a mistake with the call card knows that we could well be close to tracing her so hes trying to buy some time but on the other hand if hes telling the truth i dont want a heavyhanded arrest or her cut down in a hail of bullets so alert the rcmp but just keep it lightweight for now arrange to speak to waldren at say nine tonight straight after hes spoken to his wife and if it appears hes only mucking us around get straight back to the rcmp with a grade one abduction alert jerry jerry jerry as georges walked into the lounge from having grabbed a coffee in the kitchen clive and steve were on their feet watching jerry springer chanting along with the audience as two scraggly blondes tried to tear each others hair out chac sat to one side smiling russell was downstairs in the study watching monitors dont tell me youre into this shit georges raised an eyebrow as he sipped his coffee yeah were into this shit clive said defensively its one of our topbet shows you never know how many times that bleepers going to go as the show wound down and clive and steve exchanged some money steve apparently held russells stake money clive explained to kill the boredom on safehouse assignments theyd started betting at first on sporting events icehockey football boxing whatever then theyd stretched it to normal tv with springer one of the first candidates weve been running bets now for over a year on just how many bleeps and fights there are in one show closest call wins the record so far is eightyfour bleeps and twentytwo fights they bet on how many times the dog appeared or the brother called at the door on frasier how many tunes were played on ali mcbeal and how often the record needle scratched off halfway through or whether kenny would get killed or chef would sing on south park for them the soap opera day suddenly took on a new excitement georges shook his head with a wry smile and went out to the terrace as friends came on the running bet was apparently how many times joey said hey or whether phoebe would pick up her guitar the sun was strong enough by midday that you could sit out wearing a thick sweatshirt but still it was crisp georges breath showed on the air chac joined him after a minute you okay just starting to worry that this is what my life holds from hereon in watching ice melt and putting bets on the number of fwords on springer georges went back to staring out blankly across the frozen lake i know chac shrugged but dont worry its just the first months until the trial after youll be relocated with a new identity be playing golf in the carolinas or fishing in the florida keys with some jennifer lopez lookalike on your arm or maybe with the language thing theyll buy you a new life in the south of france things will be looking up again yeah sounds good georges nodded dolefully he confided in chac more than anyone else perhaps because chac had been with him throughout since the abduction or maybe it was just his size broad shoulders and soft edges to cushion problems but the thing is chac im missing her im missing her like hell did you speak to michel about it yeah but he says no go theyll be watching her too closely and whatever i said would probably only be used against us at trial chac joined him in staring out across the frozen lake georges had probably explained it better to him than hed got a chance to over the phone to michel just why he was unhappy leaving things on this note with simone and it made sense a sort of closure to that part of his life so that he could get on with this new chapter now but chac could also see the risk from michels viewpoint ill try and talk to him about it next time he calls chac said maybe theres a different angle to play it crowleys call came through to rcmp central in ottawa at precisely am est no we cant narrow it down more than that im afraid and no she wasnt armed and dangerous in fact they know each other quite well so the girl is in no immediate danger but it is urgent we have contact with them and that the girl is returned to her parents within the hour the alert was logged and put out on the network for the attention of all stations in eastern canada which included dorchester boulevard but michel chenouda had already done his checking for elena waldren on the system over an hour ago then at pm est ottawa received another call from crowley weve narrowed it down theyve gone to toronto youre sure of that now before i make the final change yes yes positive we just got the confirmation through from the airline okay a few key taps and the alert was amended solely for toronto and ontario police it had been on the quebec network for less than two hours before vanishing like a dying radar blip hanging up crowley was bursting with excess adrenalin and energy theyd finally traced the flight a charter from brussels to toronto and edmonton shed booked all the way to edmonton then changed at the last moment two days with nothing and suddenly the breaks were all hitting at the same time the squad room was once again buzzing with it often the way the squad room was like a morgue a hubbub of activity only seconds before each time michel chenouda walked in it fell quiet this was the payback for having put them under suspicion with s michel felt like picking out individuals and saying i dont think its you or you or come on weve worked together years now im not pointing the finger at you its others here im not so sure about and then those others would stare at him blankly chac and maury legault were getting the treatment too because they were the only ones hed singled out to trust hed had to trust somebody and they were his longest standing partners but nobody had any idea just how much hed trusted them that they shared his secret of donatiens abduction maury had taken notes during his interview with elena waldren and the squad room had predictably fallen silent as theyd walked back in chac thought hed drawn the short straw getting the main duty guard with donatiens unlike him and maury he didnt have kids to see a failed marriage to try and make good on after the event but chac was better off out of it michel reflected at least his isolation was real tangible this forced isolation surrounded by people you knew so well yet were made to feel so apart from and out in the cold in a way was much harder to take he felt guilty having roped chac and maury in on his little scheme subjected them as well to this icy interdepartmental blast along with their help hed wanted them as sounding boards to convince himself he was doing the right thing if we just leave donatiens romans going to take him out for sure all were doing is advancing what romans going to do to him in a few days and at the same time we get our witness chac and maury had been heavy with doubt and concern at first thered been a lot of frowns and foreheadcradling at the terrible risk to their careers and michel moved in swiftly with the clincher whats the alternative we know hes about to die yet we just sit around and let it happen hed wanted their honest input but in the end had shamelessly cornered them left them little choice how could they put their precious careers before a mans life the reverse of that same coin once the battle banners had been raised suddenly made their actions seem terribly noble theyd put their necks on the line to save donatiens michel clung to that recited the same headline justification each time the guilt seeped back because what michel didnt want to have to face is that his obsession with the lacailles might have finally made him step too far hed known all along that he was going to corner chac and maury because he couldnt have done it without them he didnt just want headnods that he was doing the right thing chac had in fact helped him choose the two abductors and set things up then hed assigned chac and maury to watch over donatiens allowing just the right leeway for his abductors to get away until the last moment every detail had been painstakingly prechoreographed and timed and now maury was alongside him in a small back office at dorchester boulevard with chac and georges at the other end of the line in the safe house russell had set up the scrambler and watched a monitor for a second to ensure the signal kept shifting and the line was secure then left them to it their small circle of conspiracy was once again complete chac spoke only briefly and said that he wanted another word when michel had finished then passed him over to georges michel swallowed hard this wasnt going to be easy georges had at first been defensive and incredulous it was impossible his real mother had died when he was only three in a car accident maria stephanou and his father had been too spineless to bring him up on his own thats how i ended up in the orphanage and thats why i never troubled to see him since or even tried to make contact im sorry georges ive seen her papers and heard her story and i think shes for real michel ran through everything as it had been presented to him early pregnancy dominating father the court order the birth registration with the same doctor also finding the stephanous he didnt want to pull any punches so his tone was straightforward almost matteroffact belied the emotional weight of the subject it would have made everything so much easier if donatiens just said i dont want to see her washed all the guilt and the difficult decisions yet to come on this away in one and it would have been easy to put the spin on it now to lead to that response but michel already carried enough on his shoulders through influencing events moulding them the way he wanted it was doubtful enough that donatiens might ever be able to see his birth mother he didnt want to be responsible for driving home the final knife trying to influence to ensure they never met just to save added complications that would be a step too far this one hed have to play straight down the line georges still clung on defensively much of it covering ground that michel had tossed around a dozen times over the past two hours surely it was all just a scam dreamt up by roman no first thing michel had thought of no possible link and her search had started ten days before georges had even been abducted then why had she left it until now to try and make contact and michel had told him the rest her cutting herself off from her father and trying to blot it from her mind her work with adopted children to salve the guilt telling herself all along that youd have gone to a good family somewhere and everything was going well until she suddenly hit the brick wall of a child placed with a family where everything wasnt so fine georges let go reluctantly it was almost half an hour before his anger and defensiveness finally wound down silently submissive too silent after the earlier outbursts stiflingly awkward michel could still sense a hundred questions bubbling beneath but it was probably as close to acceptance as georges would come until all the pieces had sunk in and finally settled there was a moment close to the end when georges suddenly blurted our what would you do in my position well i dont know i suppose i but georges butted in oh i forgot you couldnt possibly have any idea of my position or know how i feel cut off from everyone i know and love and now one more added to the pot he eased an awkward muted chuckle are you sure this isnt one of romans warped games yeah im sure as i say we checked it every which way as if countering the barb after a second he added that georges didnt exactly have the exclusive on isolation since i went out on a limb for you by bringing in s a lot of backs have turned here i might as well then it was his turn to cut short his situation paled in comparison the closest hed come to knowing how georges felt was the situation with his own family following his wife from toronto to montreal because he couldnt bear being away from his children when theyd left it had been like a stab to the heart grinding month by month deeper the ten months before he finally got transfer and followed were one of the hardest of his life because of this squad room cold shoulder now and his role winding down as s took over hed thrown himself more into his family arranged a couple of days out with benjamin and angelle with his absorption with the case all too often theyd taken a back seat the cold shoulder from work colleagues was one thing uncomfortable a pain in the ass but separation from family was in an entirely different league well if its any consolation i know how you must feel i was seperated from my own children for a while though he didnt have the time or inclination to explain just how and why he took a fresh breath this might not be a decision you can make right now but she has flown all the way from england and cant stay indefinitely on the offchance so i promised to let her know one way or the other within twentyfour hours if youre not ready now fine we can just tell her that and when you are finally ready three months six months whatever she can be contacted again georges sighed nonchalantly whats the point even if i decide i want to see her itll probably just be the same as with simone no go i cant say one way or the other im just the messenger here i passed on what she said and if you decide you want to see her i again pass that on to s in the end its up to them to decide one thing in her favour is that unlike simone shes not the first place that roman and jeanpaul will be watching shes new on the scene they wont even know about her michel was pleased with the way hed handled it no edge or influence if georges finally decided he didnt want to see her he couldnt possibly be held to blame but with what chac had to say as he came back on the line pausing momentarily for georges to leave the room michel began to wonder whether perhaps he should have tried to influence georges mould him push him where he wanted things hadnt changed each time he feared the lacailles might slip from his grasp all else quickly went to the wind thirtyone you feel completely relaxed feel yourself drifting deeper deeper elena was in the small annexe room listening in breath held as lowndes pulled lorena down through the final stages this would be the first acid test of whether ryall might have hypnotised lorena not everyone was susceptible but youre still aware of my voice youre able to follow my instructions do what i ask deeper deeper silence for a few seconds only the sound of lorenas steady breathing youre in a deep sleep now but can you still hear my voice lorena no answer from lorena but elena imagined that shed nodded because lowndes immediately said good good longer pause this time then now let us go back to one of the nights mr ryall came to your bedside any night did he at any time do what ive done now talk you down into a deep sleep i i dont know i cant remember cant remember lowndes was doubting disbelieving but youd surely remember clearly something like that lorena or is it that mr ryall told you not to remember i dont know i cant say lorena was flustered her breathing rapid and fractured cant say i think more like wont say this time it was a statement lowndes decided to head abruptly in another direction for questioning last time we spoke you mentioned mr ryall counting down some numbers seven eight is that when he was counting you down into sleep or counting you awake again silence again but lorenas answer was obvious from her breathing becoming more laboured still she felt trapped part of her wanted to say yes but another part of her ryall still held in check seven eight lorena recalling the counting had given elena the first clue then gordons private investigator had mentioned that ryall had done childs party magic acts to pay his way through university one of the clippings hed faxed through to gordon revealed that part of this involved hypnotising the parents and getting them to do all manner of silly things no doubt a great hit with the children though not so popular when used against them elena thought sourly its okay lorena were your friends lowndes prompted trying to ease her from the deadend the uncertainty of where to head next and its okay to tell us mr ryall only said that you shouldnt tell anyone else after hed counted you back awake didnt he no answer a heavy swallow then the steady rapid fall of lorenas breathing returned and were still there with you he hasnt counted you back awake yet so its okay another swallow then are you sure lowndes leapt on the advantage of course im sure were your friends mr ryall would want you to tell us were still alongside you now the same as him waiting for his countdown silence again back to lorenas fractured breathing her uncertainty elenas hands were clenched tight together with expectancy lowndes had mentioned that ryall had likely built in a protective key that would be the second breakthrough stage hed want you to tell us lorena lowndes repeated brief pause then so lets move on to when your stepfather has already put you in a deep sleep like now lowndes had obviously decided to take the initiative to break the deadlock or maybe he felt that part of lorenas uncertainty was that she didnt know where to start her story hed have to lead her by the hand what happened next still silence from lorena elena counted down the beats with one finger against the table one two three almost in time with lorenas breathing hes already soothed your brow told you everything was okay is that what he continues to do stroke and soothe your brow five six finally hesitantly yes he he continues stroking me but gently on my cheek now saying everythings okay okay were all alone now nobody else around to disturb us lowndes eased a heavy breath hed told elena that one of his worries was that the protective key could be quite complex involving an unusual word to be repeated it could take them hours to hit on it though that method had drawbacks too in that a subject could stumble on the word in real life or what they thought was that word and suddenly start talking hed hoped that ryall had simply built in an anyone else once awake key back to the silence this is your story lorena so you have to lead us through it tell us what happens next elena sensed lowndes reluctance to continue prompting hed had strong reservations about hypnotising lorena initially it was outmoded something he rarely practised anymore but also it was viewed as strongly suggestive false memory syndrome could all too easily be claimed especially if it was seen that hed in any way led her after a second he he continued stroking me my neck my shoulders then lower lorena swallowed heavily where was he touching you then the closest lowndes dared prompt another long pause on on my breasts then as if uncomfortable with what shed just said she moved quickly on and all the time he was saying its okay its okay its our little secret nobody else will ever know elena closed her eyes and felt herself sucked back down into the darkness of the chine ryall had probably been molesting her practically from day one back even to when shed first visited elena that day and theyd gone down into the chine and meanwhile ryall had been dragging her into his own private darkness every other night straight from the hell of the sewers and orphanages to ryalls personal magicshow hellhole elena shuddered could hardly bear to listen as lowndes wrenched her through the rest ryalls hand travelling lower lower until it was between her legs ryall gloating telling her it was okay to enjoy it to feel excited it was their secret remember he wasnt going to tell anyone it was a difficult passage for lorena she paused frequently her breathing laboured staccato her voice often pushed in grabbed bursts inbetween and it was equally difficult for lowndes several times he sighed heavily it was evident that hed rather be doing anything else than have her relive these memories his awkwardness his frustration with not being able to openly prompt her came across clearly at moments elena could sense him want to reach a hand out guide her through the more difficult parts wrap her tongue around words and descriptions she thought shed never have to speak all the times that elena had harboured doubt sometimes small sometimes large but practically all the way through shed held some reserve for herself and lowndes too only fortyeight hours ago had doubted lorena and once again shed been swayed anger frustration just wanting to hug lorena tight and say again that she was sorry sorry sorry for ever having doubted her and tell her that now it really was okay she was finally safe elena suddenly pictured herself showing up at ryalls door before the police had even arrived to personally tell him the news that lorena would never be coming back and as he registered surprise shed swing a punch flat on elena was distracted lowndes questioning had shifted dont you mean eileen the aid worker shes the one you contacted for help no elena thats her name shes the one i phoned she visited originally with someone else a local social worker before she finally got me away oh no elenas heart dropped like a stone she should have realized the possibility the whole idea of hypnosis was to uncover buried secrets get to the truth but that ran equally for buried secrets on all fronts she felt like bursting in and screaming stop stop weve already got what we want but it was too late lowndes had picked up the thread got you away he tried to sound casual mask his astonishment yes got me away from england and mr ryall shes here with me now what here as in here in the next room waiting on you yes questioning tone faint surprise that he didnt know this already elenas heart pounded hard and heavy and her mouth was dry as lowndes wound the session down still she waited in the annexe rather than walk straight in as if she was an errant schoolchild hiding in the stock cupboard in the hope that the teacher wouldnt find her sound of a door opening and closing as lorena went through to the reception area then seconds later lowndes swung open the annexe room door i think we need to talk yes i think we do within two hours of putting down the phone on georges and chac michel decided to phone mundy hed spent the time between his office and pacing up and down the squad room meanwhile frantically turning over all the possibilities one advantage of being out in the cold nobody called out to disturb him spoil his train of thought could chacs reading of the situation possibly be right he started to work angles as soon as he was off the line suddenly he felt he should be back in there infighting pushing moulding things how he wanted a possible ace card to play hit him after only half an hour but if donatiens simply said that he didnt want to see her he wouldnt get the chance to play it there wouldnt even be any reason for him to contact mundy theyd all just have to sit tight on the rollercoaster and wait and see if it derailed off the edge as chac suspected but with all that had gone before everything theyd risked to bring them to this stage michel saw that as an unacceptable final chapter he couldnt possibly leave anything to chance he decided to phone mundy straightaway before hed even received georges call mundy listened patiently as michel explained the latest developments he sighed long and hard as michel finished strong heartfelt case couldnt be stronger but you know the rules with this type of programme absolutely no contact with outside i thought with the emotional stakes on this one and the fact that it was so unusual there might be an exception we could cut some slack nothing could be worse emotionally than not be able to turn up to a lovedones funeral but we never let them go a case a couple of years back with pepe aquilana his mother died while he was on the programme and believe me he loved his mother doted on her and she was around all of his life but we couldnt let him go i know michel had half expected this response had his gameplan prepared but thats mostly because funerals are the first place they look they expect the mark to come back for a lovedones funeral and theyre waiting thats why you dont let them go but this is different shes new on the scene nobody has even a sniff of her until the other day not even georges or the donatiens family so certainly not the lacailles she could see him and they wouldnt know the first thing about it i dont know i dont know mundy said it more to himself then after a second no doubt georges donatiens says he wants to see her michel sensed mundy was starting to sway just a touch more from our earlier conversation i think hell want to hes going to confirm back to me later then why dont we just wait for his confirmation he might say no he doesnt want to see her i i wanted to make sure of the ground first where s stood michel purposely appeared hesitant i didnt want to build his hopes up only to let him down hes already had one let down with not being able to speak to his fiancee and well weve got another problem whats that mundy was where he wanted teed up and ready for the swing through im worried that donatiens isnt going to last through the programme only three days in and hes missing his fiancee like hell the fact that he hasnt been able to speak to her has hit him hard withdrawal symptoms happens a lot hell probably get over it in a week or two i dont think so him wanting to speak to her is all tied in to a sort of guilt complex over what hes done he feels the need to desperately explain that this has nothing to do with betraying her father that this is all just about roman and survival he feels that her father was good to him and he doesnt want it seen that hes let her and her father down betrayed them and for good measure he wants to throw in that he still loves her maybe he sees that as the final noble gesture i still love you but look what im sacrificing for it and if hes not going to get the chance to pass that on get closure on the whole caboodle with her and her father then i think the guilts just going to work deeper well end up with a problem he wont last the course michels voice was doomladen as he hit the last words part had been passed on earlier by chac part hed filled in and embellished but hopefully the joins were seamless only twentyfour hours sitting on the fence and once again he was back to steering events where he wanted them to go the fear of possibly losing grip of the lacailles was again running through him like raw voltage so whats the solution i think theres a way of using this situation now with his birth mother to our advantage killing two birds with one stone michel explained his thinking and mundy stayed mostly silent confirming only a couple of small points at the end he was back again to i dont know but michel sensed that mundy was warming to the idea his earlier reservations were fast dying he was eightypercent there as soon as you know from donatiens whether or not he finally wants to see her let me know mundy exhaled like a deflating tyre ill give you my decision then except for a couple of times when lowndes looked down and shook his head his eyes hardly left elenas as she ran through the whole sorry saga of the past weeks you mean the police are seeking you now as we speak yes the last four days since we left england oh boy lowndes ruffled his hair lightly clutching at it some mess im sorry seeing the weight of problems shed carried with lorena suddenly shift to lowndes shoulders she felt the need to apologise but i just didnt see any other way through ryall had blocked all the routes if id turned my back shed have been trapped there and if i hadnt made out i was lorenas mother you probably wouldnt have seen her shes the only one youd take authority from right lowndes looked at her levelly one truth at least elena looked away awkwardly for a second then gestured towards the session couch and as things turned out in the end i was right to take that action vindicated yeah yeah vindicated lowndes chuckled nervously he was quickly back to ruffling trying to clear his thoughts then stopped abruptly looking up again look what youve just told me you never told me right otherwise it might be seen that ive been an accomplice in this too elena raised a quizzical eyebrow i dont see how thats such a problem now ive got to contact the police in any case hand lorena over and tell all about ryall given that my reasons for taking her were founded i dont see that theyre going to pursue it and certainly ryall wont be in any position to press charges true but but thats not the main problem now this really all goes back to my first concerns about false memory syndrome what sort of problem with lowndes hesitance and his eyes suddenly having trouble meeting hers directly elena got the first warning signs that this was no light problem one last hairruffle and lowndes leant forward with forearms rested on his knees to explain hed mentioned false memory syndrome at the outset of the sessions with lorena and particularly before this last session now involving hypnosis the reason that i emphasised it again is that hypnosis is seen as highly prone to suggestion thats why i was reluctant to use it particularly in a potential child abuse case but as you pointed out it was likely the only way to draw lorena out and you were proven right on that front we succeeded there and we have every right to feel happy with that success lowndes paused and drew a long breath but unfortunately it could all too easily end up a hollow victory lowndes went on to explain a case a couple of years back involving a close colleague in montreal a similar child abuse claim where the main evidence was gained on the psychiatrists couch the father screamed false memory syndrome said that the psychiatrist had planted the idea in the childs mind and he got off theres been a halfdozen or more such cases nationwide the past five years and all of those just involved conventional therapy with hypnosis where possible suggestion is already seen as a strong factor one of the reasons in fact why it has become outmoded the chances of the fms flag being raised are even higher it depends how hot on the ball the stepfather is this mr ryall hes a pretty highprofile businessman elena said vacantly it probably came across as a surrender flag but all elena felt was numb she was still assimilating what lowndes was saying no clear thoughts yet either way then she remembered from the adoption files oh and he used to be a barrister oh the single exclamation was like a pistolshot echoing and ricocheting round the room no chance no chance no chance in the silence following as the prospects of a doomed case against ryall settled like a grey shroud where only moments before elena had seen nothing but bright hope it suddenly dawned on elena that ryall had probably seen this last contingency from the outset the chances of his secret being discovered were slim enough but this was the final safeguard even if it was hed known all along that fms would be his getout all of her efforts and the dramas of the past weeks had in the end been for nothing hed covered every possible option controlling men story of her life no no she shook her head that couldnt be the final note she couldnt let it be surely lorena cant just go back to him the police cant possibly let that happen no but you probably know how these things works as much as me lorena will go to foster parents for a while until this whole wrangle is sorted out but i wouldnt hold your breath on this one going against ryall shell probably end up having to go back to him and the best you can do is try and complicate the legal process as much as possible to delay that inevitability delay elena jumped in only moments ago lorena in her minds eye had been free of ryall forever now she was reduced to desperate bargaining for time how long do you think we could play things along a good lawyer should be able to spin things out for a year eighteen months but dont forget ryall is going to be pushing just as hard to cut that time back shortcircuit things and i dont think youll have helped your case any by taking lorena from her home in order to bring her here abduction probably arguing that the evidence shouldnt even be considered because it was gained under forced criminal circumstances if ryalls lawyer push all the right buttons they could get it thrown out in a preliminary hearing within only a few months right i see elena blinked slowly the abduction she recognized as an obvious strike against but she hadnt realized that it might also get the main evidence thrown out the chances of nailing ryall were slipping further away by the minute shed hardly had a chance from the start let alone the halfcrazed woman she was now her nerves shot from the stream of valerian pills the pressurecooker anxiety of running hideandseek from the police and only a few hours sleep grabbed in days she felt strangely pathetic that somehow she could no longer get anything right wrong about her father and while shed been right overall about ryall shed read everything else wrong in the end shed been ineffectual unable to change anything michel chenouda would probably phone her that night and tell her no go on that front as well deadends at every turn maybe they should be glad of small mercies six months respite perhaps even a year or more but the thought of lorena having to go back to ryall after that time fully knowing that he was molesting her was somehow even crueller more unacceptable she voiced that thought i couldnt possibly let her go back knowing that id do again what ive done now abduct her lowndes shrugged awkwardly glancing towards the reception room where lorena waited on them the thing is she doesnt know that yet it was all under hypnosis and if the tapes were entered incamera she never would get to know unless of course you won the case elena considered the option for only a second before discarding it she shook her head cradling with her left hand as she gently massaged her temples another secret hidden more shadow games already shed spent too much of her life playing them seeing her so forlorn the storm clouds settling heavy in her face lowndes felt the need to reach a hand out she thought shed reached the last hurdle and now hed suddenly put another half dozen in front of her maybe ive painted too dark a picture but i didnt want you to get carried away with false hope and thats only how i see it from the canadian perspective things might be completely different in england when you speak to the police the best thing is get their view they might well see a brighter and better way through curiosity in the end thats what won through everything else all but cancelled out on one hand the fact that shed left him alone without any attempt at contact for all these years on the other that shed obviously gone to considerable trouble to make contact now search agencies the trip from england finally the orphanage shed let him be given away unforgivable but then shed been so young the father domineering left to her and perhaps a couple of years older it sounded like she wouldnt have let him go chenouda said that shed blotted it out too painful what did that mean that she thought of him frequently but blotted it out or that she blotted it out from the start and rarely thought of him how much thought how much blotting out with her work with the child agency certainly it looked like the guilt had stayed with her thought blotting out guilt with each passing minute that georges pondered and paced on the safehouse veranda the questions multiplied hed only get so far quizzing chenouda probably already hed passed on most of what he knew for the rest the only way would be to meet her face to face then there were the many gaps to be filled in on his own life one that already sat comfortably was knowing that nicholas stephanou wasnt his real father hed always found it hard to accept that that spineless wonder consumed only with burying his own misery at the bottom of a whisky bottle selfishly and heartlessly giving him away to an orphanage so young when he too was blinded by grief from the loss of his mother could possibly be the same blood his mother but at the same time hed revered what he thought was his mother so beautiful died so young she too was a victim just like him hed touch her photos longingly in the dark days in the orphanage and dream about her think how nice it would be to feel her hug and hold him tight feel the soft press of her lips against his cheek now too those fond memories would be sacrificed and that he didnt feel so comfortable about in the balance it was difficult but the action of nicholas stephanou and the orphanage had left by far the biggest shadow on his life his memory of maria stephanou had been little more than a fragment fading fast with the years in the end it was more what he hoped or imagined her to be like from her photos than the brief reality he recalled before the car accident shadows that plagued him for years with his second family or was it now the third the donatiens claude and odette they loved him doted on him but claude donatiens business ups and downs through the years meant that often things had to be cut lean a small jobbing builder whenever there was a property slide their own home fortunes slid with it they werent able to have children of their own and thered been another adoption planned a baby sister for him but in the end tight finances put pay to that too but despite the seesaw problems claude donatiens always managed to bravely smile his way through he never let them drag him down in any way overshadow his affection for him as a child or hide in a bottle like nicholas stephanou or at least he never showed it odette too was amazingly supportive throughout she never balked or swayed from claudes side though it was many years before he saw those attributes as in any way positive when the problems hit his predominant fear was that once again hed be given away the financial pressure would crush claude or odette would leave him because it was finally one crisis too many and in the melee hed be given away nicholas stephanou and the orphanage had left him with deeprooted insecurities that had hung over him most of his life even in his teens when abandonment no longer held the same threat he still harboured resentment viewed his stepparents problems with disdain probably what had made him so driven to end up in finance and banking he wouldnt make the same mistakes that didnt change until hed been through his first yuppie years in banking and had a bellyful of shallow people who chased money to the exclusion of all else including loved ones and family possibly they even viewed him as one of them didnt realize that to him family was vitally important with the money mostly as a means to that end it was only then that he finally started to appreciate his stepparents despite their financial problems theyd always put him first kept the family bond strong now hed seen the other side of the coin money dividing families battles over estates and wills money all too often taking pole position over a childs welfare in divorce battles or them cast aside and forgotten in the rush as one partner found a better financial match somewhere else in comparison claude and odette had suddenly shone through as heroes champions of how to survive business crises and still cling on hold body and soul and family together most other men would have long ago been trampled under but claude had this amazing bounceback quality hed have probably made a good spokesman at a small business survival conference and with a little financial help and guidance from georges business had been good these past five years perhaps that gentle touch on the rudder had been all that claude needed all along but still on occasions it was laid at his door that his attraction to the lacailles was because of his own past family insecurities that he saw in jeanpaul a strength and security that had been lacking in both nicholas stephanou and claude donatiens and all of that as a result of one abandonment now there was meant to be two maybe thats why the insecurity had wormed so deep a part of him had always known that it had happened twice elena waldren he uttered her name on a slow breath watched thoughtfully the vapour drift and disperse in the cool air she could probably fill in a lot of the gaps in his life shades that had never been fully clear but having spent so long coming to terms with what he thought was his life to date he wasnt sure he was ready to have it upended yet again he was curious curious as hell but was he ready for the pandoras box that might be opened up he was still pacing and rolling the pros and cons on his vapoured breath when twelve minutes later chac knocked on the glass behind him chac waved him in as he slid back the veranda door michel on the line for you thirtytwo john lowndes leant forward and stopped the tape is it came to the end at the other end of the line ds crowley stayed silent a moment longer before he asked whether that was it the wavering in his voice was discernible the tape had unsettled him is that all of the session yes yes thats it elena had asked lowndes to set up a conference call to play the tape so that he was there for confirmation and any psychiatric related questions she couldnt answer crowley merely clarified a few points about the total number of sessions and the dates asked if he dr lowndes could confirm that what hed just played was an accurate recording of his last session with lorena ryall then asked to be put back on to elena elena had already flagged lowndes concerns with fms now she explained in more detail now i dont know how that sits with you sergeant crowley but it sits very badly with me in fact it makes my flesh crawl thinking that in the end lorena might have to go back to ryall so please tell me some good news i dont know in a way what dr lowndes says is right and things run pretty much the same here as canada theres at least a couple of similar cases that i can recall but that by no means makes it an impossible or hopeless case just that the odds of successful prosecution might only be thirty percent or so if we could get anything else say like mikaya ryall coming forward some extra testimony that wasnt purely gained under hypnosis that could increase the chances my husband went to see her elena sighed heavily she was a stone wall didnt want to even talk about it and she might be just the same a lorena doesnt recall anything while awake true crowley was at the same time filling in some of his own gaps hed been curious what had happened at gordon waldrens meeting with mikaya but an official visit from us and some extra pressure might just open her up its worth a try yes i suppose so it felt strange having run like a crazed rabbit from the police these past days to suddenly now have them on the same side calmly discussing how they might work together to nail ryall crowley felt guilty building up her hopes but then shed asked for good news and that was probably the best he could give with the abduction their chances were probably far less than thirtypercent and with odds so low it was doubtful the cps would even take it on but he didnt have the heart to tell her that make everything appear so hopeless at the first strike and also he didnt want to have to face that himself shed only just played the tape and broke the news but already he felt his blood boiling it was bad enough that ryall was molesting the girl but hed been so arrogant and condescending with pushing them to trace her crowley recalled the way ryall had spoken to him and he felt like putting ryall on a spit roast but how from what elena waldren had told him without doubt it looked like ryall was going to walk flesh crawl he couldnt have put it better but his position stopped him being so vocal forthright by the book sometimes it was frustrating the seed of an idea started to gel at the back of his mind but it wasnt exactly something hed want to discuss on an open police line look youve just broken all of this to me and theres a score of things id like to check internally before i give you a final opinion is there a number i can get you on in an hour or so elena was back at the hotel to take crowleys return call and by then he had the whole gameplan worked out she was almost breathless at its audacity do you really think it could work i certainly hope so the thing is what other choice is there crowley was calling from an outside booth having already primed the man whose name hed passed on to elena we could contact him and run this weve used him before but it could take ten days or so to get the paperwork through with also the chance that it wont get approved concerns about police entrapment and all that you contact him directly and he could have it all up and running by tomorrow you dont want to leave lorena exposed with ryall any longer than you have to the mention of lorenas exposure made elena face again what she saw as the main problem the trouble is to pull this off lorenas going to have to be in on it shes going to have to be told that ryalls been molesting her knowing that im not sure she could face going back to him even if it might only be for days thats the one thing i cant answer for you whether or not shell be strong enough to go through with this but that is the choice right there nailbiting worry for a few days but if it works shes rid of him forever or take the chances with a court case with the knowledge that theres a seventy percent chance of her going back to him in six months or a year crowley suddenly felt he should mention his concerns about the cps so that she had the full weight of the options with the odds so low theres even the chance of them deciding not to pursue the case at all she could end up back with him in only weeks there was silence at both ends of the line for a moment another strike against elena sensed that crowley wanted her to take the leap but she just wasnt sure lorena was up to it shed braved the worst that the bucharest streets and orphanages could throw at her but playing this knifeedge game with a wily old fox like ryall was something else again she moved on to other issues to give her a moment more to think crowley told her not to worry ryall wouldnt give her any trouble with pressing for abduction charges his plan was to remind ryall of the tape shed left with gordon and that lorena had consented then comment that one of the sessions in canada could be seen as suspect in regard to him molesting lorena though in the end theyd decided it was inconclusive but of course if he was to press for prosecution with you youd no doubt bring all of that out in your defence that should be enough to warn him off when they came to travel arrangements elena said that she didnt know yet if she could travel back with lorena theres something very important that i might have to stay for she paused only for a second before adding im hoping to meet up with the son i havent seen in twentyodd years he got separated from me at birth she originally wasnt going to explain to crowley but it struck her that he might think it odd to let lorena travel back alone especially given what she might have to face if she was staying they arranged that shed take lorena to the nearest british embassy crowley would make the travel arrangements directly with them from that point either theyll send someone or we will quite honestly id fly over myself and hold her hand all the way if it might make her brave enough to go through with this and help us nail ryall elena got the first hint of antipathy between crowley and ryall or maybe it was just the tape shed played but everything else filed and sorted the problem was back before them whether a tenyearold girl could help them succeed where the system had failed ryall had probably been molesting her for years dragging her down into a deep hypnotic sleep so that he could do what he liked with her his eager hands travelling all over as her small body lay inert her steady breathing suddenly fractured more hesitant but only part of her subconscious registering what he was doing and hed probably done the same with mikaya for years before that elena shuddered with revulsion at the thought and now as they finally revealed to lorena what her subconscious had kept trapped for so long they wanted her to lay inert for ryall one more night so that they could get the proof to nail him elena rubbed her forehead and glanced towards her hotel room door lorena was downstairs no doubt still swapping stories over the bar with alphonse in the end only lorena could decide if she could possibly face that throw the decision back to a tenyear old girl the rest of them were hopeless the system crowley and most of all herself strung out from pills stress and lack of sleep she was the last one balanced enough to decide ill talk to lorena and see what she thinks elena was still in the same position minutes later hands clasped anxiously together chewing lightly at the back of her knuckles wondering how on earth she was even going to begin to broach this topic with lorena ive got some good news and some bad when the phone rang again it was staffsergeant michel chenouda mrs waldren ive got some good news i was planning this all for tonight if were going to do this we should move quick one thing i argued in your favour is that youve just arrived nobody knows about you as time goes on that advantage could be lost i was thinking say ten oclock tonight is that okay yes yes i think so youll have to come on your own so can you make arrangements for your daughter by then you wont be returning till tomorrow morning yes uh i have a friend she can stay with fine now its a few hours run a twohour flight by small plane and the car drive each end and as soon as you start heading out of the city youll have to wear a blackedout headset secrecy is absolute on this nobodys to know where he is funicelli listened to them go through the last of the arrangements then phoned roman fourteen minutes later roman was alongside him in his car as he replayed the tape they were five blocks away from the montclaire on rue berri no point in keeping up the lookout the police might run a sweep before coming by to pick her up theyd return later and start following roman checked his watch as the tape ran to an end just over four hours huh were going to have to move fast funicelli nodded thoughtfully he hit stop and rewound you should listen to the conversation she had just before right roman was still thinking about the tight time schedule and the flight particularly the flight that could give them problems tracking and following it took him a moment to detach to what was happening on tape he smirked almost as slyly as when he first heard chenouda had given her the green light sounds like shes a bit of a player herself some scam with the young girl and the british police and shed told chenouda it was her daughter but he didnt have the mind space to throw it around much his thoughts were quickly back with his own problems maybe roubilliard would be able to help with this flight dilemma in half of roubilliards distribution territory in the northern reaches of quebec light aircraft were one of the main modes of transport roman raised roubilliard on the phone he knew at least half a dozen guys with small planes but probably the best bet is a guy i know with a farm up near chibougamau mainly because right now hes here in montreal for a couple of days flew down yesterday is he someone youd trust some heavy stuff could go down yeah hes run more than a few kilos for me in with the seed packets and farm supplies okay get back to you roman was on the phone almost constantly the next hour jeanpaul frank massenat and twice more to roubilliard who by then had in turn confirmed arrangements with their pilot for that night mel desmarais only ninetyfour minutes from chenoudas call to the hotel and theyd worked out every last detail two and a half hours left until she was picked up at the hotel roman met up with massenat forty minutes later and they grabbed some kebabs and falafels from a takeaway on st laurent and sat eating them in a side street in romans bmw waiting funicelli had gone to hire a car for them to follow her no familiar registrations in sight and would join them again at pm roman made one last call just before massenat arrived to gianni cacchione it was a call that he knew one day hed have to make but events had brought things forward once georges was hit the genie was out of the bottle he felt strangely empty morose after putting down the phone hed weighed this from every side so many times that he thought hed worked the guilt through long ago jeanpaul had cast him aside showed little thought for him while pursuing his foolhardy plans hed brought this on himself maybe it was just that with jeanpaul gone there would be no more challenge nothing more to strive for hed miss the banter and confrontation playing in the shadows which he did so well from now on hed be in the spotlight you think everythings going to go okay massenat asked yeah its not that heavy rain slanted against the windscreen and roman broke off from the repeated tapping of one finger against the steering wheel as he peered up at the night sky just not the best night to be flying so go easy on the falafel and the hot salsa i aint brought a change of suit art its jeanpaul i need a favour art giacomelli in chicago listened thoughtfully as jeanpaul explained his dilemma things got that bad between you huh well its just i dont know whether i can trust him with this or not theres always been some bad feeling between him and georges and im afraid that in the heat of the moment he might do something rash its important to me that this is done right jeanpaul could hear the slow draw and exhalation of a cigar or cigarette being smoked giacomellis end faint smacking of the lips as giacomelli chewed it over a second longer i can help jeanpaul no problem there but its very short notice three and a half hours im not going to be able to send one of my own guys the closest that could make it is a guy i know works out of toronto dave santagata santa dave as hes known is he good can he handle something like this yeah one of the best ive used him a lot young keen but not hotheaded cool professional all the way he aint earned the catchphrase santa always delivers for nothing dont worry hell keep roman in check they made the arrangements santa dave would catch the next shuttle flight from toronto and should arrive with half an hour to spare hed call jeanpaul directly from the airport by which time jeanpaul said hed have phoned roman and told him he had one more along for the ride jeanpaul looked up at simone as he hung up his mouth skewed slightly is that okay do you feel better now about things simone ruffled her hair i dont know i dont know she thought again of georges panic that night in the restaurant about roman then the abduction and now it was roman being sent to get georges out of the clutches of the rcmp perhaps someone else riding shotgun like this would make it okay but still she felt uneasy she shook her head cant we use someone else apart from roman who who jeanpaul held out both hands i cant go myself even when the family was more involved with crime i never get involved with such things with security let alone now and massenat on his own without romans direction would be useless like sending in a sheepdog without its owner simone didnt answer she cast her eyes back down shaking her head again slightly jeanpaul could tell that she was distraught anxious but he didnt know what else he could do she looked better than in the panicky first hours after georges disappearance but not much her hair was tidier but still lank her mascara smudged where shed rubbed at her left eye and her face was tight with tension he wished he could just reach out to her as he used to when she was a young girl gently stroke her hair and say its okay its okay and shed look up at him with big eyes and immediately trust and that would be the end of it but she was older now time had moved on and past him without him hardly noticing or had he just been too busy taking care of business it seemed only yesterday she was a little girl still he might have been able to get away with reaching out to her but these problems with roman and georges seemed to have put an extra barrier between them that was difficult to reach across he felt a sudden pang of fear again a tight constriction in his chest that he might lose her over this in a way he had as much to lose as her if it all went wrong before the call to art giacomelli hed laid out clearly how he saw everything they both desperately needed georges back to talk with him jeanpaul felt sure that georges going into the wpp was purely as a result of the abduction jeanpaul wanted to reassure that hed had nothing to do with that and hopefully then go ahead with his original plans of getting georges away to cuba for a while and simone no doubt wanted to let georges know her feelings whether their relationship had any future which jeanpaul sensed simone hadnt even got clear yet in her own mind one area hed batted on georges behalf she felt stung at receiving no call felt that it was a clear indication of how georges felt and hed defended that it was probably more to do with the rigors of the programme they wouldnt allow him to call no matter the excuse jeanpaul shook his head in sympathy with her i dont think roman would dare play renegade on this one he wouldnt be able to face me if he did he swears blind that he had nothing to do with the abduction that it was down to gianni cacchione but even if it was roman he was playing under the table where nobody would know and he could get away with blaming cacchione now hes out in the open with nobody else to blame he wouldnt dare take the risk and with giacomellis man looking over his shoulder he wont even get the chance simone looked up slowly i hope so i hope youre right and for a moment with her eyes fixed on his it was easy to believe she was a child again blindly trusting things hadnt really changed that much jeanpaul reflected just with each passing year everything became more complex the explanations longer in order to gain that same trust elena looked down at the streetlamp lightbars playing across her lap as the squad car made its way through the city and she recalled uncle christos in the taxi the day before she flew out streetlight and shadow playing alternately across his face as hed told her only half the truth about her father and shed in turn told everyone else only half the truth now you see it now you dont shadow games and now ryall with lorena close your eyes trust me elena closed her eyes and bit at her lip she wished she could be as brave as lorena shed left her at the british embassy over two hours ago and the parting had been emotional tearful at first lorena had been in shock and very hesitant when elena told her what had been revealed at lowndes last session then explained crowleys plan shed agreed with lowndes and crowley to spare lorena from actually hearing the tape she just told her that some things in the session pointed to her being right about ryall molesting her but very quickly their roles became a reversal of what elena had expected and it was lorena telling her not to worry she could handle it if thats how it has to be i can do it dont worry once again one of those kodak moments when lorena was suddenly old beyond her years drawing from some deep inner resolve that had helped her endure the dark days of the orphanages and sewers shed survived a thousand rats down there this was just one more rat returning from the embassy after leaving lorena elena nursed a scotch up at the bar with alphonse in order to steady her nerves and after a while felt she had everything under control again but gradually images started to bombard her baring her soul to gordon fainting in the orphanage uncle christos and her mother on the phone turning her world upside down about her father the donatiens telling her that they didnt think shed be able to see her son it was on the news didnt you see and it was all going to end here now in only a few hours within half an hour of the squad car coming to pick her up she was in pieces again a two hour meeting to explain away a lifetime she was back again to frantically working out what she would say where would she even start would she open with how sorry she was or just plough into explaining then apologise later would she hug him first or again wait till later and the moment felt right or if she felt the same as right now would she just stare at him dumbly with her whole body shaking too numb to put into words the nightmare shed been through to finally get to see him then break down into tears and weep out her catharsis on his shoulder before she could even utter a single word elena kept her eyes closed for a moment and listened to her own breathing as she sunk deeper down into her own private darkness trying to keep it even get her nerves steady again theyd be hitting the city outskirts soon and shed have to put on the blackedout headset shed have a couple more hours then for her own private contemplation wished she could be so brave she thought she might get some images from the chine to guide her tell her what to do but there was no longer anything there only darkness she was on her own fuck you fuck you fuck you roman hissed into his mobile hed already pressed end call from speaking to jeanpaul he gave the phone one last clench before tucking it back in his inside pocket we got company he said in a flat tone to massenat yeah i gathered either its marias mother or someone else youre not to keen on look frank leave the fucking jokes to me okay roman was slow in pulling his stare from massenat to look blankly ahead again through the car windscreen his temples ached with tension and he wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead with the back of one hand some fucking bright torpedo from toronto jeanpaul wants to ride along with us santafuckingsomething one of giacomellis golden boys oh right the silence following said it all they had a problem roman cursed jeanpaul either he suspected something or just wanted to make doubly sure everything went right all these years of being pushed deeper into the background but this was the final insult when it came to something important one of giacomellis pet school monitors sent along to keep tabs on him roman had protested but not too strongly that would have made jeanpaul all the more suspicious roman said that he already had one of roubilliards best along to fill the last place on the plane jeanpaul fired back that they didnt come any better than this guy and besides they were relying on roubilliard too much as it was the pilot plus a few more of his men at the other end when they discovered the planes destination anyway it was all cut and dried art has already agreed to send him and i wouldnt want to let him down hed be upset let down upset roman felt the extra pressure like a leaden shoulder yoke giacomelli wasnt the sort of person you upset jeanpaul probably thought he was being clever the perfect dilemma to keep him in check dont think of stepping out of line because now youll not only be putting my nose out of joint but art giacomellis as well but jeanpaul had no idea the extent of that dilemma jeanpauls death would be bad news as it was to giacomelli though hed put that down to cacchione but one of giacomellis own going down was quite another thing and giacomelli would no doubt then also link the two and point the finger at roman roman was careful to shield his worries when forty minutes later he greeted santa dave but with each passing minute of weighing his options in between his nerves had pulled tauter one more thing to worry about just when he didnt need it and no simple solution that he could see if he had any remaining doubt or guilt about what he was doing it went in that moment once jeanpaul was gone he wouldnt have to worry any more about dancing to his tune thirtyfive minutes later they were rolling following an unmarked rcmp grey buick century with elena waldren accompanied by two plainclothed officers roman didnt recognize no michel chenouda visible as they took the turnoff for the pont victoria funicelli realized they were probably heading for st hubert airport it took just under thirty minutes to get there funicelli was happy that it wasnt one of the major airports better and closer access to the perimeter fence and less aircraft activity he observed patiently through nightsight binoculars for almost twenty minutes before he saw them emerge and head towards a plane a piper saratoga okay gotya number is sxr roman relayed the number immediately to guy campion waiting the last thirty minutes in a phone kiosk two blocks from dorchester boulevard he made a note of the number and type of aircraft but had to return to his office to make the enquiry an access code number had to be given by computer to get the information from the atc central computer but it was generic for the main server at dorchester boulevard campion was confident that it couldnt be traced he keyed in the aircraft type registration number and place and time of departure and asked for its destination two minutes later it came up on screen cochrane northern ontario campion left the building to make the return call said only those few words and hung up the whole exercise from romans first call had taken only twelve minutes roman phoned roubilliard with the destination after a moment consulting a map the closest chapter roubilliard could see were the lightning bars based in timmins about fifty minutes bikeride away ive done a bit of business with them before but best thing is i phone and see if theyre up for it the other option is a team i know well based in la sarre but its almost two hours away mmmm cutting it too fine to their plane landing roman mulled let me know how you go with the timmins guys they were close to meeting up with mel desmarais at point aux trembles airfield by the time roubilliard called back with the news that he had a green light from the lightning bars their head honcho a guy called jake kirkham says that hell go himself with two men sounded keen dont think they get too much excitement up there in timmins theyll watch for the aircraft landing and follow from there so maybe a couple of hours to get back to you with where theyve gone yeah looks like it roman checked his watch their own flight would probably be about fifty minutes to an hour behind so theyd learn the final destination halfway through forty minutes or so to check the lay of the land and prepare then theyd move in catch you later with the quickfire volley of calls back and forth romans adrenalin was racing the feeling that he was in control in the hot seat his left hand tapped repeatedly on his thigh beating out the rhythm of the mounting nervous tension in his body as they swung into the point aux trembles airfield a figure waved as the car headlamps fell on him trench coat with fur collar wild wavyred hair and beard and a large silver crucifix dangling from one ear all we need the fucking red baron roman remarked bringing a chuckle from the car to help ease the tension the plane behind desmarais looked hardly big enough to carry the five of them and the wind was still sharp flurrying tree branches and desmarais hair in its wake there was only one thing left to make that control complete roman thought looking at santa dave ahead of him as they got in the small plane thered been too much else going on for them to exchange anything more than a few words but now he needed to draw santa dave out more get him to open up like an undertaker measuring try and weigh up whether or not he could get away with taking out santa dave without at the same time making a coffin for himself courtesy of giacomelli there wasnt much time left now for roman to decide what to do barry crowley sent sally to escort lorena from montreal she had the best french in his department and he felt it was a task more suited to a womans touch but apart from light incidental conversation about what food or drinks lorena wanted or the inflight movie sally felt stuck for conversation normally with an abduction or missing person shed have been able to ask if they were looking forward to returning home although crowley hadnt gone into detail hed shared enough that she knew there was some problem with things at home crowley had a plan afoot to tackle it which also involved sending a couple of officers to see lorenas sister at durham university it was a subject to be avoided so all that was left was to ask a few tame questions about what shed seen in montreal and whether she liked the big brown bear in a mounties uniform sally had brought for her at the airport during the twohour wait for the return flight yes hes very nice and very big probably the biggest teddy bear ive ever had lorena looked down wistfully for a second though i havent had one for a couple of years now right sally nodded and smiled the measure of how much crowley knew about tenyear old girls tastes his own daughter was only seven and he probably thought the fluffy toy stage lasted until they were young teenagers but he had made a strong point of her picking one up and also to make sure that it was large something that could have been given to her by the canadian police rather than mrs waldren and could sit taking pride of place in her bedroom bear in a mounties uniform was ideal crowley was worried that if ryall thought it was from elena waldren he wouldnt let lorena keep it though while sally had tiptoed around whether lorena was looking forward to returning home she suddenly realized that the mention of the bear was a reminder of what the girl had yet to face lorena was doing a good job of putting on a brave face but as she looked ahead towards the movie screen sally could clearly see the shadows working beneath the surface the girl was petrified sally didnt know what else to say so after a moment just reached across and gently clasped lorenas hand dont worry im sure everything will be okay thirtythree and shes already left claude donatiens asked yes just about forty minutes ago michel glanced through his office window to the squad room clock seventy percent of the staff had already left but a faint hubbub rose from those remaining hed made so many calls in the past few hours that some of the activity had spilled over shes staying overnight and returning tomorrow and youre sure thats shell bring a message for us yes sure that was the deal made messages for both you and his fiancee michel had been more concerned with georges fastgrowing coldturkey with simone but hed extended it to cover his parents as well in only a few months georges could start to feel the same way about them the ideal halfway house georges gets to meet his longlost mother and gets messages to his lovedones as well two birds with one stone and who better for poignancy to pass on the messages michel dropped his voice a note there was just too much danger attached to either yourselves or simone seeing georges this was the best compromise i felt we could make i hope you understand our position yes i i understand i just hope she keeps to what was agreed and brings the message im sure she will listening to the strain in claude donatiens voice michel wondered how much he really did understand or any parent could after the note nothing but wilderness no contact at all it was a pretty poor substitute a single note to fill the space of the long years theyd never see him again michel felt a twinge in his chest at what hed done but then what other option had there been with georges dead that loss would have been more final and heartrending ive already spoken to georges about the message and its very important to him and ive also got one of my men there to remind him im sure it wont get forgotten there was a faint buzz and crackle on the line towards the end and claude said that he was sorry i didnt quite catch that last part we had a telephone engineer call a couple of days back about a fault but it seems worse than ever i said ive got one of my men there as well so im sure the message wont michel stopped midtrack a lightning bolt running through him what was that you said a telephone engineer michels voice was suddenly high and strained yes uuh called a couple of days back maybe three claude stumbled slightly with the fresh sharpness to michels tone i thought i told you to let me know if anything unusual happened anyone called to your house out of the blue michels voice was raised he was almost shouting a couple of heads turned form the squad room yes but but this happened before you told us before it had even been announced about georges attempted abduction and him testifying how long before well uh the day before maybe two days the lightning bolt ran deeper through hit the pit of his stomach he felt physically sick and his hands were shaking so hard that for a moment he feared he might drop the receiver he should have realized hed marked the announcement of georges testifying as the pivotal point but georges had already been missing two days and his stepparents home was a logical place for him to make contact michel slowly closed his eyes there was still a chance he might be wrong he answered i dont know yet to claude quizzing whats wrong ive got a few calls to make he signed off hastily looked up bell canadas number and dialled straight out giving them the beaconsfield address and approximate time to check their records for an engineer calling they said it would take five minutes or so theyd phone him straight back michel burst out of his office like a whirlwind he spotted maury in the corner and signalled him grab a guy from dauphins department who knows anything remotely about electronics and head out with him to this address in beaconsfield michel hastily wrote down the donatiens address and if hes got anyone else spare they should at the same time head here to check michel wrote down the montclaire hotel address underneath and ripped the page from the notepad im looking for telephone bugs planted at each like now pronto so separate cars to each if dauphine can spare anyone maury grabbed his jacket from his chairback as michel whirled away one of his office lines was ringing michel grabbed it on the third ring it was bell canada no they had no record of a call made at that address or indeed in that street in the last week last noted service call in that street was eighteen days ago at number michels stomach sank like an express elevator and for a moment he felt dizzy his legs unsteady his own voice sounded distant as he said thanks and hung up maury was only halfway down the corridor and already he knew most of the answer but it was enough to alert s to stop elena waldren before she got there or get a message to the safehouse by the time maury got out to beaconsfield to fully confirm a phone bug it could already be too late but when he got hold of the s control room operator she advised him that she didnt have any of that information on her computer the only people who had that information or could authorise contact were superintendent mundy and inspector graydon then put me through to one of them theyre not available right now inspector graydons on a weeks break but i might be able to get a message to superintendent mundy later on tonight if its urgent michel ascertained what she meant by later then asked her name he eased a weary sigh look constable fuller or melanie whatever youd prefer in two hours it will be too late its that simple the mark that mundy and your department have gone to so much trouble to protect will be dead unless you can somehow get a message to mundy right now or find some other way to contact the safehouse or the team heading out there now to warn them she started stumbling under the pressure i im sorry im doing the best i can with what i have the operation is top securitycoded and theres just no other information on screen i know i know michel backed off a step clutching at his hair hed simply got the stonewall protection he wanted and there wasnt a single frame of reference he could think of to guide her two s men who apparently made up next months guard shift had flown up from ottawa to pick elena waldren up from her hotel and escort her all the way no idea where they were flying from and no names nor were any exchanged in the few conversations hed had with the safe house that was the whole ethos of the operation constable fuller drew fresh breath all i can do is try and raise mundy he says that hes not available but i dont whether that means he simply cant be contacted or just doesnt want to be if he starts shouting ill blame you thanks but quick huh every second counts on this i think ive got that clear ill phone you back in ten minutes if i cant raise him on his phone or bleeper sooner if i can so just the four jobs huh yeah santagata shrugged and then this one now romans mind was racing four contracts didnt show much of an allegiance but then if they were key contracts santa dave could be one of giacomellis stars all pretty much the same as this one the same backing up the other three hits they fell silent again roman kept his gaze straight ahead watching wisps of mist drift past the planes window as they battled through the night sky hed asked the questions nonchalantly as if it was only of passing interest and he didnt want to press too hard or ask too many questions santagata might latch on that he was angling at something guys like santagata usually had natural antennae for warning signs its what kept them alive roman could feel santa daves eyes on him for a moment before he looked back ahead again roman tried to ease the tension in his body massenat was wedged between him and santagata at the back of the aircraft with funicelli in the front with desmarais but for a moment roman worried that with the repetitive tapping of one heel and his hand on the same thigh santagata might pick up that it was more than just due to the rough flight and what lay ahead of them the questions had been sporadic not only to make them not so obvious but because for the first half hour the flight had been very bumpy on the worst parts as the plane lurched and tossed and rattled they all fell deathly silent nobody felt like talking except for desmarais who whooped excitedly just like riding a wild bronco at calgary the sight of four tough guys gripped with whiteknuckle fever seemed to tickle desmarais roman felt like saving an extra bullet for him then the weather settled a little there was still the occasional bumpy flurry but not so wild it was mainly crossborder jobs in canada santagata added after a moment art was always worried about me flying back out or crossing the border straight after a hit especially as i became known i think otherwise hed have used me more right roman nodded solemnly he felt the tingle rise up through his body until it reached his fingertips santagata had said it as if to explain why giacomelli hadnt used him more but at the same time hed signed his own death warrant roman knew every hit giacomelli had made in canada and none of them were major santa dave was dispensable giacomelli wouldnt stretch that far to make amends especially not with himself and cacchione later declared as a team giacomelli wouldnt risk that level of confrontation over a lone hitman but having made the decision the only question was when hed originally planned to do it later he could claim that santagata simply got caught in the crossfire with the rcs but thered be too much going on then too much else to think about roman chewed at his lip and felt santagatas eyes on him again briefly glancing sideways and meeting them only for a second dark almost black eyes shielded even more with the weak cabin light difficult to read into had santagata picked up on something some invisible electrical signal that ran between them hes planning to kill you so make sure to take him out first or had it been a doublebluff all along santagata at the same time measuring him for a drop jeanpaul never really had believed him about not abducting and trying to kill georges and maybe this was the payoff after all thats what santagata did most hits not playing chaperone he felt the sudden pressure of it all like a powderkeg the bumpy flight santagatas eyes on him intermittently what lay ahead and the contingencies yet to cover his nerves wound so tight with it all that his whole body was shaking almost in time with this tincan rattling through the night and all because he couldnt bear living in his brothers shadow a day longer if he didnt make the jesus the bottom dropped out of his stomach as the plane fell sickeningly a sharp shudder as the plane hit the bottom of the drop followed by some heavy tilting and swaying then it rose again as swiftly until romans stomach was at the edge of his throat here goes again desmarais commented wrestling with the joystick they saw sheet lightning out to their right about five miles away the small plane bobbed and swayed but just before the next sharp drop roman noticed one advantage santagata was no longer paying him any attention his eyes were fixed stonily ahead the drop was longer this time the shudder so hard as it bottomed out that the cabin lights flickered off roman decided in that instant to take his chance he simply might not get as good a chance later in the darkness he leant forward and as the lights flickered back on he already had the out of his garter strap and pointed at santagatas face santagata took a second to focus on the gun distant lightning flickered against one side of his face what the fuck is this massenat between them leant back with his hands held by his shoulders a this aint nothing to do with me gesture roman smiled slowly you know those bond films where hes got a gun pointed at the bad guy but he darent fire it in case one of them gets sucked out of the plane roman steadied the thats the one advantage of these lowflying shitheaps we dont have that to worry about roman squeezed the trigger as santagata lurched and reached across still he would have got the shot off cleanly but at that second came another sharp drop the cabin lights flickering off again then santagatas hand was on his arm pushing it away roman struggled to point back at santagatas face santagata was strong straining hard and roman had to bring his left arm up to get any movement back that way he darent risk another shot on the offchance too many danger points it could hit the cabin lights flickered back on and he saw a patch of santagatas hair matted with blood a trickle running down his forehead hed grazed the skull with the first shot santagata reached for his gun with his other hand roman didnt notice but massenat did he pinned down the gun arm then whipped his elbow sharply back into santagatas stomach santagata keened forward with the blow heavily winded all the strength went from santagatas body in that same instant and roman wrenched his arm free as santagatas grip loosened roman grabbed santagatas hair and pulled his face back up straight so its goodbye mr chips santagatas eyes had barely refocused on him as he put the gun by santagatas left eyesocket and pulled the trigger santagatas head flew back with the impact and roman was left with some hair in his hand he wiped it disdainfully on his seat desmarais halfturned his face as red as his hair you guys wanna pull stunts like that least you could do is fucking warn me roman smiled drolly his breathing still ragged just imagine its still the fucking calgary stampede but now the cowboys are shooting in the air roman was glad that something could rattle desmarais it was his turn to gloat at the fear in desmarais face they sat out the rest of the turbulence in silence santagatas body intermittently doublelit by bursts of lightning then desmarais dropped twothousand feet so that roman and massenat could risk opening the door to get rid of the body never did like paying fucking excess baggage roman remarked as it sailed out massenat chuckled briefly but the silence was quickly back theyd weathered one storm but there was a tougher one yet ahead and now they were one man down eight minutes later jake kirkham called theyd seen the plane land and the car had just left the airfield two men and a woman inside ill call again when theyve reached the safehouse let us know what you want us to do then when ss melanie fuller phoned back after only seven minutes michel thought she had good news but no mundy hadnt responded to his bleeper message yet it was something else i thought i should pass on straightaway one of the guys here with a high clearance pass was able to access a bit more information he says that its a sector operation threeman monthly rotation guard team still pretty basic info im afraid but it might help sector wheres that northern ontario an oblong block stretching between hearst james bay and iroquois falls sixty miles from the quebec border okay all michel wanted to do was race to a map but it was immaterial hed already decided that if they didnt raise mundy fast he was heading out there ill call you back as soon as ive got something on mundy if he doesnt phone within the next few minutes well start trawling his regular haunts michel said that hed probably be on the move soon at least make a start on heading to sector he gave his mobile number and signed off hed spent the last seven minutes pacing the floor of his office and the squad room like a caged lion the door open between the two and spent only another minute continuing pacing before diving for the phone to make the arrangements to head out there sea king helicopter would be the fastest way one could be brought up from the rcmp and army airbase on montreal island within minutes all thats needed is a nearby roofpad michel got christine hebert to arrange the roofpad and liaise back with the airbase and two minutes later she confirmed that shed laid everything on with the westlaurent towers just three blocks away and the choppers already left said they should land there in about six minutes michel managed to get everything together with a minute to spare breakneck run along the dorchester boulevard corridors and down the three blocks with an ert team of four with him still shouting and filling in details as they went he was breathless as they rose in the elevator to the roofpad his heart pounded hard and heavy no call back still on mundys whereabouts he glanced at his watch they wouldnt get there for a good hour and a half after elena waldrens arrival he shook his head theyd probably be too late raising mundy and phoning the safehouse to warn them was still the best bet emergency response team art giacomelli looked at the numbers on the computer screen they hadnt moved for the last fifty minutes something was wrong seriously wrong he phoned jeanpaul and said that he had concerns about santa dave he didnt explain exactly why just asked jeanpaul to phone roman and find out where they were at that moment and then ask to speak to santagata maybe its nothing but ill know for sure from what roman tells you phone me straight back jeanpaul made the call roman answered after the second ring and jeanpaul asked how it was going fine everything running to plan we just landed ten minutes back roman sounded slightly out of breath agitated and you found out the location yeah its about a halfhour run away where did you end up where are you now some dead and alive place called cochrane northern ontario it meant nothing to jeanpaul one advantage of canadas wilds i suppose if you want to hide someone away a seconds pause then jeanpaul asked for santagata to be put on theres just a small thing i need to clarify with him he uh he cant come to the phone right now hes taking a leak in the bushes long flight and too much coffee roman chuckled hesitantly apart from the hesitation jeanpaul could clearly hear the engine noise and rush of them on the move not stopped by the roadside roman was lying i really need to speak to him roman jeanpaul pressed as soon as hes finished taking a leak ill get him to phone you roman didnt trouble to mask his annoyance that is if he gets a chance with all weve got on the line clicked off abruptly jeanpaul dialled straight back to giacomelli and relayed how the call had gone bad news giacomelli said on the back of a heavy sigh giacomelli explained why four years ago santagata had a hit contract on someone he knew problem was the guy was always on the move but santagata knew him well enough to be able to buy him a present without making him suspicious so he buys him one of those satellite watches you know the ones where you can move from one country to the next and it always shows the right time cause its linked to a satellite but it also tells you exactly where you are within ten fucking yards its that accurate and if you know the watchs serial number which santa dave did theres a website where you can find out exactly where it is so he knew where the mark was made the hit then took the watch back giacomelli drew hard on his cigar so tonight he arranged to phone me every couple of hours to bring me up to date which hes now twenty minutes over in doing and he wore the watch and gave me its serial number and for the last fifty minutes it hasnt moved from near a place called holtyre a good hundred and fifty miles from where roman says he is now so either santa daves thrown the watch out the plane window in disgust cause the batterys flat or hes gone with it let us know if you can remember anything the two police officers had left over an hour ago but still the words bounced around in mikaya ryalls mind remember that was half the problem shed never been able to remember a single thing clearly enough so that she could say yes my stepfather molested me he came to my room on this night and touched me here here and here it was all just shadows dreamlike fragments but those shadows had haunted every other moment of her life since it all seemed so real but when she tried to recall she could only remember it happening in her dreams nothing she could pass on or tell to anyone else theyd think her mad but the shadows would leap out and became all so vivid and real again each time a boy touched her or tried to kiss her shed shiver and shrink away in panic terrified shed been called frigid and cold and weird and a couple of times a lesbian a few of the boys shed really liked and shed reach out to them tearfully and want to explain but how could she when the images were only in her dreams the tears streamed down her face as she cut through the bedsheet with the scissors trying to make sure she kept the strip even as she went and now young lorena as well mikaya kicked herself that maybe she should have been bolder earlier and said he was molesting her then try and fill in the gaps later but each time she ran it all over in her mind there were always too many questions she wouldnt be able to answer which nights where did he touch you what did he say why didnt you say anything try and stop him she shook her head even now with the answer to why her and lorena werent able to respond and fight back they still werent able to do anything concrete they were still trying to get her and lorena to recall something from being awake from real life rather than dreams sorry i just cant help you i wish i could nothing was going to stop him now she wiped at her tears with the back of one hand and started cutting the second strip even if she could remember anything it was too late too late she would never be the same again she wanted children loved children but what would she do lay there with teeth gritted her whole body trembling until the boy had finished and if she wanted more children a proper marriage night after night of the same it was unthinkable a living hell and now shed let lorena down too by not speaking out she was suffering the same probably it would be too late for lorena as well shed go the same way as her all lorena had left to cling to was the hope that one day the dreams would fade maybe shed be luckier for mikaya they hadnt and she knew now with certainty that they never would her vision blurred with tears she looked up thoughtfully to the handle of the high latch window wondering if it would hold her weight shed have to be quick her dorm friends had gone to the student union bar to give her time alone with the policemen but theyd be back soon patrick mundy regularly had eight to nine hours a week to himself that were sacrosanct offlimits to any contact from his department no matter how urgent his regular cardgame golf round and going to watch the senators play but the last two months hed added another few weekly offlimit hours since he started dating suzie harrigan twelve years his junior and class all the way long auburn hair and large hazel eyes with sweeping lashes that could melt greenland audrey hepburn and then some mundy was in love but this would be the third time up to bat for him he wanted to put in the time to make sure that she was the right one he didnt want to spend his early retirement in lawyers offices sorting out yet more alimony so when he was with her his mobile and pager were switched off she had his undivided attention not that it would have made much difference where theyd gone tonight clair de lune popular with highflyers and government ministers mobiles and pagers were strictly offlimits otherwise the restaurant would have been a cacophony of endless bleeps and rings what few were brought along and left switched on bleeped and rung without anyone paying them attention behind the closed door of a back cloakroom as they left the restaurant the air was brisk mundy wrapped suzies coat around her in his own coat pocket his bleeper light flashed but he hadnt yet looked at it nor had any intention of doing so mundy was strict with his time alone with her nothing like being dragged away on emergencies every other date to give a taste of things to come and kill all hopes for a future relationship where do you fancy tonight he asked the glue pot or the laurier they usually went to one or the other after dinner short nightcap at the hotel laurier piano lounge or a longer session listening to live blues she mulled it over for only a second mmmm the glue pot she pecked him on the cheek melanie fuller was still on switchboard so most of the calls to track down mundy had fallen to her s colleague brian cole he called clair de lune twentyfive minutes into his roster fourteenth on his list yes he was here earlier but im sorry youve just missed him an effete faintly french accent that sounded faked when did he leave cole pressed about ten minutes ago do you know where he might have gone im sorry we make a habit of not chasing our clients from the restaurant to ask where they might be going mocking tone the accent more exaggerated the phone was put down abruptly cole turned and passed the news to melanie she sighed heavily and ran one hand through her hair keep trying keep trying she checked her watch it could take him fifteen or twenty minutes to get home so itd be worth another try there soon if not start working through bars and clubs if romans going to make a move itll probably be tonight once all of this has gone down he knows hed have you to face do you want me to send someone over no its okay i doubt thered be time anyway true but take my advice jeanpaul either get some protection over there fast or leave the house dont just sit there like a sitting duck jeanpaul said okay to put giacomellis mind at rest but hanging up he couldnt think of anyone he could call in fast roman always took care of that side of things and the last thing he felt like doing was running scared from his own house it would feel too much like defeat like waving the white flag at roman admittance that when it came to the crunch the old ways held sway all of his new aspirations amounted to nothing but then he started to became uneasy agitated was that the pool filtration system some pigeons alighting from the roof or something else raphaels footsteps upstairs or were they coming from another part of the house he suddenly started to feel the isolation of the big house feel vulnerable he went into his study and took out the sigsauer mm from the top drawer he was aware of his own breathing falling heavy but kept his listening honed beyond it for out of place sounds some faint music now he could pick up drifting from raphaels room looking out across the dining room and through the windows a light was on in his mother lillians apartment at the end of the courtyard he closed his eyes and gripped the gun tight his hands were shaking his pulse racing hard some flight away from crime this was a hitman probably moving in and he hoped to brave it out when he hadnt fired a gun in years and he wasnt alone in the house a fine epitaph that would be to all his noble hopes and aspirations raphael walking in to see his father or his adversary in a pool of blood the other with their gun freshly smoking maybe his father had been right all along as much as you might wish to escape the past the past will never allow you that escape maybe thats how it was meant to end his punishment for being so naive blindly foolish roman had probably been playing him all along and now hed won the game with roman already closing in nothing he could do to save georges probably georges could have been trusted all along and georges had in turn looked up to and trusted him and hed repaid by turning his back he might as well have fed georges to roman with his own hands hed lose simone without question shed never forgive him and if he tried now to stand this last bit of feeble ground at the same time he turned his back on everything hed aimed for he lost either way game set match he snapped himself quickly out the thought of raphael and his mother being there when anything happened overrode all else he raced up the stairs and rapped sharply on raphaels door swinging it open loud wave of techno with a faint beepbeep backdrop raphael weve got to go leave the house what ill just finish this game and now raphael this second raphael saw a look of panic on his fathers face he hadnt seen before then he noticed the gun he swiftly turned off the game and the music grabbed his coat and fell in step behind his father back down the corridor by the time they hit the stairs they were at a run well just pick up your grandma and head off whats happening long story long story jeanpaul said it almost in time with his laboured breathing well grab a cappuccino somewhere and then i can explain lillian was slower more reluctant to leave without explanation and jeanpaul had to blurt out that their lives could be in danger to finally light a fire under her he gestured with his gun as if to say why in hell do you think im carrying this we must leave this second he grabbed keys to the cadillac on the way out more space more protection than his new sports jag and seconds later they were swinging out of the driveway brief pause to open the electronic gates and then jeanpaul turned right on boulevard gouin heading for the city cacchiones men lorenzo and nunzio petrilli lorry and high noon werent cacchiones first choice but they were all he could get at short notice theyd been competent enough on a couple of past jobs and there were two of them if one fucked up hopefully the other would cover the petrillis had arrived outside the boulevard gouin mansion just eight minutes ago and were still checking out the perimeter railings and the house beyond to finalise their plan when the double gates opened and jeanpauls cadillac swung out they were startled and it took a second for them to kick into action lorenzo fumbled before finally firing up the car then swung around and started to close some of the long gap that had opened up two hundred yards along jeanpaul turned left into avenue christophe colomb he was oblivious to the car lights trailing a steady fifty yards behind as he took out his mobile suddenly hed thought of how he might be able to help georges the most unlikely of calls but it was all he could think of he tapped out the number and a womans voice answered royal canadian mounted police dorchester boulevard staffsergeant michel chenouda please thirtyfour lorena held her breath for a moment listening the faint muffled voices shed heard downstairs had stopped her stepparents had stopped talking sound of footsteps on the stairs now mr ryall or mrs ryall after a second she could pick out that the step was lighter mrs ryall she settled back again and eased out her breath probably mr ryall wouldnt come to her room this first night hed wait a few days but the waiting would be almost as bad as the fear that he might come in at any minute she was tired very tired shed slept on the flight but only a couple of hours and now it was three or four in the morning shed lost track but she felt almost too afraid to fall asleep in case mr ryall did come to her room maybe once shed heard his footsteps come up the stairs and head for his room she could relax a little but then several times hed come out of his room without warning an hour or two later to see her it was almost like he knew instinctively the best time to visit when she was at her most drowsy her defences weak but what would she do she couldnt stay awake every night waiting she remembered in the sewers when patrika died for several nights after theyd laid awake for hours listening out if the waters might be rising again but after a few nights they were exhausted and would have slept through anything what had dr lowndes said when he starts counting down put other numbers and thoughts in your head act as if youre succumbing falling under but all the time keep your mind alert resist if she didnt get sleep then her mind simply wouldnt be alert enough to be able to resist she held her breath again for a second listening footsteps starting up the stairs heavier this time mr ryall she swallowed hard looking over at the large mountie bear shed positioned it where they told her looking straight at her and the bed perhaps it would have been better if they hadnt told her anything about it all theyd tried to put her mind at rest dont worry as soon as he starts touching you well be there thats the whole idea to stop him touching you once and for all she said she could do it but now as the moment was upon her her nerves were racing out of control her whole body had broken out in a sweat mr ryall was bound to notice her fear her bodys trembling footsteps moving closer creaking some boards among the top steps she closed her eyes feigning sleep the darkness felt welcoming her tiredness threatening to suck her under maybe she should just sleep through it all wake up when it was over if he came in and started counting down just let herself sink under let it all stay in the darkness and shadows like every other night where it belonged she just didnt think she could bare being awake for a second while his hands moved over her body her breath froze suspended as the footsteps reached the top of the stairs then released again as she heard them start moving away towards his bedroom but after a few paces they paused turned and started heading towards her derek bell watched the bluegrey images on a monitor less than a mile from the ryalls he adjusted the dials for a second with the directional mike he had to work hard to cut down the background hiss finally it was clear the fall of lorenas breathing the faint rustle of bedsheets rush job but that was often how he liked them more of a challenge hed only had forty minutes turnaround to get everything planted and the bear sewn back up again the lens was in the cap band the mike in the belt he noticed lorena look over directly for a moment and silently prompted get used to not looking act as if im not here her eyes shifted towards the door after a second then finally flickered shut faint sound of footsteps from the corridor they receded for a moment before turning and becoming more prominent again bell watched lorenas eyes flicker open again fleetingly then shut again the footsteps were now in the room moving closer closer and bell clearly saw ryall his back at first then more of his profile bell adjusted the focus slightly his hand staying expectantly by the dials ryall leant over and touched lorenas hair starting to lightly stroke bells pulse was suddenly in his throat he thought hed been in for a long few nights but now he began to wonder you poor girl ryall mumbled under his breath youve been through so much bell tweaked the volume up a bit so much such an ordeal the hand continued stroking now gently tracing across lorenas brow as ryall sat on the side of the bed lorenas eyes stayed closed though bell knew that she was feigning sleep only as ryalls hands traced down and started gently stroking one cheek and her neck did she finally flicker her eyes slowly open probably sensing that it was too much for her to sleep through good girl good girl bell thought keep this up and well get the bastard bell was leant forward intently following each small movement beads of sweat shiny on his forehead in the glow from the screen but as lorenas eyes looked up ryalls hand suddenly paused hovering an inch above her cheek had he sensed something was wrong seen something in her eyes to alert him or was he just deciding count her down into a deep sleep so that his hand could continue its journey or return another night the heavy rotor blades cut through the night sky michel felt its rhythm driving him on pumping his adrenalin the energy of the motion and the five men sat expectantly with him rifles and automatics at the ready was the only thing to make him feel positive he found it hard to escape the feeling that they were heading there after the event it would all be for nothing the cavalry turning up after the last indian arrow had hit custer they must be at least an hour behind roman and his men roman might spend some time checking the lay of the land and finalising a plan but an hour michel slowly closed his eyes the dull thud of the rotor pumping almost in time with his pulse and there was no doubt now that roman was on his way hed had maury on the radiophone only minutes ago phone bugs at both the donatiens and at a switching box outside the montclaire roman knew every last detail ontario border ten miles ahead the pilot announced okay michel opened his eyes nodding hed purposely asked for the alert theyd hit sector only twentyfive minutes after the border and if there was still nothing still from mundy theyd have to start circling more time lost to roman michel asked to be patched through again to melanie fuller hed already spoken to her twice in the last eighty minutes theyd been airborne no she confirmed she still hadnt heard anything from mundy we just missed him at a restaurant by minutes but he didnt head home so now its down to bars and clubs but its more difficult no checkin reservations weve either got to eyeball him or find his car so theres a team out there checking every possible dive and every patrol cars alerted well be crossing the border any minute so times tight now michel had to raise his voice to be heard above the rotor i know i know dont worry the second ive located mundy ill be back to you michels gloom his sense of despondency settled like a fast descending cloak in the silence following four miles now to the border the pilot announced well be crossing any second but the cloak was heavy difficult to shake off this time six men on a hellbent mission to nowhere probably hed known all along theyd be too late but he needed all of this activity so that he could reassure himself later that hed done everything he could because unlike the men with him he knew that he was mostly to blame the setup so that he could push donatiens into the witness protection programme making sure that donatiens birth mother could see him and take a message to simone to keep him there if you tell a lie at every stage hed pushed the envelope and now this was the payback theyd get there and thered be nothing left to do but pick through the bodies see first hand the result of michel visibly jolted as the radiophone went again thinking it was news on mundy but it was phil reeves at dorchester boulevard strangest call just come in michel why what is it jeanpaul lacaille has just phoned hes on the other line right now wants to speak to you michel was stunned into silence and after a second reeves prompted do you want me to tell him youre too busy to talk right now michel snapped himself back no no its okay ill take it darkness constant allenveloping darkness elena tried to think of it like the solitude shed sought in the chine an escape from all the madness outside god knows shed seen more than her fair share these past days and for a while that worked she could retreat into her own thoughts continue spinning around what she might say to georges but the bumpy flight did little to help her already jaded nerves and as the darkness continued the long minutes stretching into hours the journey seemed to be taking forever her unease returned this was different this was a forced darkness an imposed solitude in the chine she was always free to make her way back up to the light in that moment it suddenly struck her why lorena had run in panic from the chine shed spent half her life in forced darkness with the sewers and the orphanages and now ryall eyes clenched tight shut behind the visor elena said a silent prayer that it all went well with crowley and she was suddenly piqued at her own rising paranoia all she risked was rejection nonacceptance if she said the wrong thing probably all she deserved having blanked georges from her mind for a lifetime it paled in comparison to what lorena faced she should be rejoicing not chewing her fingernails shed finally got what she wanted isnt that what the whole nightmare had been about perhaps her anxiety was as much because of that passage than what was to come a sense of a lifetimes odyssey coming to a close shed get her few hours in the spotlight with georges to try and make good and then that was it and she wasnt just performing for herself she couldnt help sense her father riding along with her hed been unable to track georges down make amends before he died now it was down to her to make amends for both of them forced darkness but as they hit the last stage of their journey driving from the plane michel chenoudas chilling account from their last conversation was suddenly back with her how georges had been blindfolded in the back of a van and would have been killed if they hadnt intervened probably that journey wouldnt have felt far different from this elena thought settling back for a moment into the darkness and the thrum of the wheels on the road she shuddered at what that must have been like going through this same forced solitude thinking that at any second you were about to die but as it struck her that in part she was grappling for an empathy link a reminder of the chasm she faced with little idea of how to even start crossing it she pushed the contemplation away brian cole weaved through the tables of the busy jazz club on the small stage a trio were running through a passable instrumental rendition of jobims girl from ipanema he thought for a moment he could see mundy in the far corner but as he got closer and could get a clearer view it wasnt him only nine clubs they thought mundy could get away with visiting at his age but each one took time to search theyd split the list between two of them this was now the third on coles list bars and cocktail lounges presented more of a problem theyd made a list of twenty but there were probably a dozen more they could have added the other two in their team were busy working through them the only advantage was that they could rush in a quick scan and rush out again it wasnt until cole started down the steps of his next club that his mobile rang his colleague tim had found mundy at the glue pot hes here with me now ill pass you over tim was almost shouting to be heard above the noise of the club mundy came on with a gruff what is this clearly irritated at the intrusion and cole sneaked a quick glance at his watch as he explained the problem almost an hour and a half into their search he wondered whether theyd still be in time come on come on roman rubbed his hands together and stomped his feet to fight off the cold he wore a lined bomber jacket it was still bitter at night in montreal but where they were now felt a good ten degrees colder and with the waiting around it was starting to cut through more to his bones funicelli studied the house through the nightsight binoculars two lights on that he could see one at the side upstairs which also shone through at the front onto the veranda probably the main lounge and the other downstairs at the back they hadnt been able to check the far side of the house although the lake wrapping around was iced over theyd have been too visible but they couldnt see any reflected glow on the lake surface thirtyfive minutes now theyd been waiting for the two men escorting the english woman to leave an hour and twenty minutes since jake kirkham had followed them there maybe roman was wrong he thought theyd be heading off to a local hotel or if it was a brief meeting heading back with the woman but maybe they were staying the night the house looked big but was it big enough to take them all these places usually had a tight spec enough room for the guards and the main subject with not a lot to spare and already they might have to make room for the woman funicelli had placated that maybe it didnt matter with the gas he was using it was going to knock all of them out anyway but it was the panicky few minutes between them cutting the telephone and power lines and putting in the gas that roman was worried about with only three or four men one would see to the generator and they wouldnt dream of leaving less than two guarding georges or risk sending someone out alone on reconnaissance but with another two theyd have the extra manpower to check for anything suspicious roman had decided to wait but now the cold and his impatience were getting the better of him maybe youre right roman muttered under his breath maybe we should take all the fuckers out at the same time yeah funicelli nodded mechanically still checking through the binoculars massenat was to romans side with desmarais and jake kirkham hanging a couple of yards back as if they were only peripherally involved with whatever the three decided roman had quickly set the tone on first greeting when kirkham glanced at the blood splatters on one shoulder and arm and asked what happened i cut myself shaving as kirkhams eyes shifted to the heavier splatters on massenats collar and chest roman added with the same wry smile hes got the same razor the message was clear dont pry were here to get a job done not answer twenty fucking questions kirkhams other two goons theyd left over a mile away at the start of the dirt track leading to the lakeside funicelli had given them simple instructions on exactly where and how to cut the electricity and telephones to the house one advantage in the wilds everything ran overhead but they looked like two rejects from waynes world roman seriously wondered if they could manage even that without frying themselves wait funicelli announced breathlessly adjusting the sights shadow of figures moving across but as the car interior light flickered on with one door opening they became clearer looks like theyre leaving after all great roman stomped his feet again but now it was more to mark time four or five minutes to let them get down the track and clear then they could cut the lines and move in i know this call is going to seem strange to you but i didnt know what else to do michel listened as jeanpaul explained that his original plan had been to spirit georges away somewhere possibly cuba but hed suddenly discovered that roman had other plans thats why im phoning now i know thats where im heading now michel said and the line fell silent for a moment before jeanpaul got the impression that his call might have been wasted michel added but the one thing i dont know is exactly where the safe house is only the general area did roman mention anything to you jeanpaul was fazed for a second that chenouda didnt know the location uuh just some place called cochrane northern ontario but no exact address cochrane cochrane michel repeated gesturing towards stephan the ert constable with the map a moment while stephan traced one finger about on the map and then as it settled on one spot he held the map up towards michel okay weve got it weve got it such was his longingrained suspicion of the lacailles that for a second it struck him that jeanpaul could be giving him a false location but he could see clearly that cochrane was in sector another awkward pause then thanks i know it couldnt have been easy for you to call i owe you a drink for this yes you do jeanpaul agreed adding dryly and lifting the threat of a jail sentence from my head wouldnt be a bad idea either the line clicked off and michel looked towards the pilot time estimate for cochrane the pilot glanced at the map skewing his mouth as he mulled it over fifteen sixteen minutes michel tried to shake off his earlier despondency that theyd be too late still they needed to raise mundy to know the exact location that call finally came through ten minutes later michel breathlessly explained their dilemma and mundy said that hed phone through to warn them and call straight back but when mundys return call came he had crushing news subdued defeated tone as he told michel that the line was dead he couldnt get through michels stomach dropped like a stone his hopes fading again what about mobiles he asked frantically we dont use them for security reasons too easily tracked and monitored the secure line is the only line in and out and its already dead michel closed his eyes this time the image of them picking through the bodies was more vivid difficult to shake off but the hardest part michel knew already would be him living with what hed been responsible for ascending the stairs cameron ryall had been in two minds what to do it had been one of those days three days of being on the polices back every other hour over lorena with little or no positive feedback then suddenly out of the blue theyd phoned midafternoon to say she was on her way from canada ryall shook his head most of the police search had been centred on europe no wonder they hadnt found her and now they were fluffing about whether or not to press charges she did give lorena up voluntarily in the end and then weve got the problem of that original tape left and her explanation of why she took lorena what she thought might be happening with her mrs waldren took her to a couple of sessions in canada but nothing conclusive came out of that in the end which is why shes now returning her but if we did press charges no doubt all of that would come out in her defence the call had come through from crowley obviously turton found it all too awkward to tackle himself it was left to crowley to carefully tiptoe round words like molested or interfered with nothing conclusive ryall wondered just what had happened at those sessions in canada hed have thought that pressing charges against elena waldren would normally have been automatic maybe more had come out than they were making out enough at least for them to harbour strong doubts about proceeding against her his step was measured as he made his way up the thought was starting to rankle what had come out of those sessions what did they know probably now hed never know and did it really matter if it had been that serious or suspicious hed have been the one the police would be charging or at the least asking some very pointed questions his step was a shade lighter as he reached the top hed been in two minds but finally decided not to go to lorenas room let her rest for a few days settle in but a few paces along he suddenly paused having second thoughts he listened out faint shuffle of movement from nicola in their bedroom shed hit the gin and pills even heavier with the nervous anticipation of lorenas return shed be zonked out within minutes besides shed never interfered had never dared in all of the eleven years since hed discovered her secret he remembered the one time shed caught him by accident with mikaya she just turned from the doorway after a second without saying anything the mounting neurosis of her carrying the burden of his secret on top of her own showed mainly with her increasing diet of pills and alcohol it was all that kept her going pathetic but ryall was long past caring the most important thing was that she wouldnt disturb him and lorenas first night back after such an ordeal it was just the time that any father would browsoothe reassure he turned and started towards lorenas room his mouth suddenly dry with anticipation and hed desperately missed her missed the gentle feel of her skin at his fingertips the soft even fall of her breath on his cheek as hed lean over lightly trace one finger across her closed eyelids just before he counted her back awake she was totally his in that moment he had control over practically her every breath he stood stock still for a second controlling his own breathing now as he looked down at lorena then his hand visibly trembling he reached out and lightly touched her hair and in that moment it suddenly struck him how he might find out what had happened in the sessions in canada bells every nerveend was as taut as pianowire as he watched the images on screen and as ryall started to talk and count lorena down into a hypnotic sleep he punched the air with a fist yes yes got you you bastard first night back but you just couldnt wait seven eight feeling drowsier now every limb in your body feeling totally relaxed drifting deeper deeper bell was on the edge of his seat as ryall hit nine and ten then reached out and lightly stroked lorenas cheek and passed the same hand twice only inches in front of her eyes then silence stone silence bell couldnt tell whether lorena was in a real sleep or not had lowndes advice about mentally counting down other numbers worked bell watched ryalls hand it had made contact again at her shoulder and traced down her arm a few inches then stopped some trivia about the trip and canada and the rough time shed been through to which bell didnt pay much attention he was too busy watching where ryalls hand might travel next then suddenly he tuned in to where the conversation was heading and when you were there you saw a doctor a psychiatrist what did you talk to him about bells whole body went rigid ryall was digging for what had happened in the sessions if lorena was really under at any second shed spill the beans the whole operation would be over before it had started about my time at the orphanages the sewers and patrika and about my family i see your family so what did he ask you about them oh jesus bell swallowed hard he tapped one finger repeatedly on the desk by the screen could hardly bare the tension of everything hanging on what lorena said next his eyes were back on ryalls hand it had moved a fraction to lower on her arm the thumb spread and touching the edge of her breast but was it enough probably not could be construed as innocent come on bell hissed move that hand lower and then he suddenly stopped could hardly believe he was egging ryall on because he feared they might only have seconds left and it suddenly hit him that if ryall uncovered their game realized that they were trying to entrap him lorena could be in danger he glanced anxiously at the phone wondering whether to call crowley and stop it all now except that they wouldnt get there in time if the game was up ryall would know everything within the next couple of minutes different things he he seemed worried if i was happy with them happy with them happy with them but what did he ask you in particular about them crunch time bells stomach sank their only hope was if lorena wasnt really under could bluff and lie her way through ryalls hand was on the move again it traced tantalisingly down her arm and across coming to rest on her stomach still not enough he he asked me if anything bad was happening to me anything i didnt like what sort of bad things what did he ryall suddenly broke off looking towards the door as the telephone started ringing late for anyone to be calling but then this was the night his stepdaughter had returned maybe a relative or wellwisher bells pulse raced doubletime was lorena awake and fending ryall off or relating accurately how the session had gone with the danger of fms lowndes would probably have avoided directly prompting about ryall molesting her but within a few questions ryall would unearth the truth the telephone stopped ringing either theyd given up or nicola ryall had answered and as ryall looked down again at lorena and finished his question bell leant closer to the screen his eyes only inches away following every small movement the delicate flicker behind her closed eyes her gentle moistening with her tongue as she spoke his hands were balled tight in fists and he unclenched one and lightly touched the screen come on little angel be awake be awake but he couldnt tell either way jeanpaul noticed the car trailing in his rearview mirror soon after hanging up on chenouda two cars behind a steady fifty yards but he was sure it was the same car hed seen follow him into avenue papineau from gouin hed since taken two more turns and it was still with him a mile further on along st denis just to make sure jeanpaul took the next right at rue jarry then left again onto st laurent heading towards the city centre it followed at each turn the same steady distance behind except for the last turn when almost a hundred yards grew between them when they had to wait for a car to pass before pulling out no doubt left they were trailing him why are we trailing around like this raphael asked from the back i though we were going to le piemontais yes we are we are jeanpaul wrenched his eyes from the mirror hed frightened them to get them out of the house but he didnt want to panic them now hed told lillian where they were heading when shed impatiently asked as soon as theyd started moving but his eyes couldnt help being drawn back to the car as he noticed it swing out and overtake the two cars in between closing the gap again to fifty yards as lorenzo petrilli cut back in from overtaking the last car nunzio asked do you think hes made us i dont know i then as he noticed jeanpaul glance once more in the mirror yeah yeah looks like it i think he must have had some kind of warning the way he left the house like his ass was on fire and he made us too easily nunzio looked at his brother for a second not sure if he was just making excuses for following too obviously but what he said made sense he shrugged whatever were going to have to make our move sooner rather than later closer to downtown its going to get more difficult lorenzo nodded right now they could make the hit and swing on to one of the cross highways and get away easily downtown thered be more junctions before they could get clear and more police cars lorenzo put his foot down closing the gap towards jeanpauls car jeanpauls palms were damp on the steering wheel as he watched the car move closer behind surely they werent going to make a move with his son and mother with him theyd wait until he was alone but as he watched the car edge closer still that hope began to fade with his repeated glances in the mirror this time raphael picked up on his consternation whats wrong your uncle has sent someone to have me killed and lillian would be even more destroyed at discovering this cain and abel drama between her two beloved sons all he said was what i was worried about earlier then towards lillian beside him in the front he hissed under his breath cacchione the name meant something to her but not the boy thats what it had been about all along changing their lives so that his son didnt have to live in the shadows like hed had to but now his son was in the middle of it all in the end the shadows had reached out to him anyway jeanpauls jaw worked tight cursing roman hed been so eager that everything else had quickly gone to the wind hed broken the golden rule never involve other family jeanpaul took the gun out of his jacket and held it in his lap as the car edged closer only twenty yards behind now feeling raphaels eyes on him anxiously his father the great protector in reality he hadnt fired a gun in years and roman knew that too hed be an easy target the car moved closer twelve yards ten and at that moment its full beam came on washing them in light sudden flash image of him and roman together as children playing in the garden on a sunny day as their father called out to them happier days but it faded quickly to the raw reality of the car pressing close behind almost imagining roman in the back seat goading them on jeanpaul put his foot down trying to put some distance between them streetlights and neon flickered past more rapidly he had to concentrate hard on the road ahead a car edged out suddenly at a turning just ahead and he blared his horn and swerved around it he gained some distance but it was shortlived checking his mirror they were rapidly closing the gap again fifteen yards then back to twelve again he checked his speedo seventy and edging up jeanpaul was shaking hard his palms clammy on the wheel if they pulled alongside what was he going to do if he put the window down to get a shot at them hed be all the more vulnerable and he wasnt even sure he could get in a good shot and control the car with one hand at this speed the lights ahead changed to orange but he kept his foot down hard screaming through as it turned to red the car behind stayed with him a couple of cars beeping at it as they started across the intersection watch out lillian shouted as a bike with a weak taillight loomed suddenly on the inside shed been remarkably restrained so far normally she complained if he was doing mph over on a downtown shopping trip jeanpaul swung a yard out to clear it and felt the back drift slightly at this speed he risked killing them all anyway the cadillac was heavy difficult to control if he had to swerve or make last second adjustments he wished now hed brought the jag theyd have been cramped and had less protection but he could have weaved in and out easier and sped away and probably lost them heavy it suddenly gave him the spark of an idea as the car started to close the gap again this time jeanpaul let them he didnt speed up to try and gain distance but at the same time he had one eye on the car lights coming towards them okay i think weve got him now lorenzo announced as he closed the distance down to only five yards he tapped one finger on the steering wheel as he waited on a car passing then swung quickly out and accelerated the next approaching lights were some distance away and didnt seem to be moving that fast nunzio opened the side window and the airrush filled the car he levelled his gun the cadillac glass was only slightly tinted he could pick jeanpaul out clearly he thought he had him with a clean shot when the cadillac suddenly pulled forward a few yards nunzio looked across as lorenzo frantically pulled level again eyes darting between the cadillac and the traffic ahead and suddenly the shot was there again clean clear nunzio levelled his gun at jeanpauls head and eased the trigger a heavy kick and the cadillac seemed to swing away a fraction with the impact but as nunzio focused on the starburst where the bullet had hit he saw that it hadnt penetrated bullet proof glass the side of jeanpauls mouth curled in a smile nunzio levelled his gun again come on come on lorenzo screamed glancing across and suddenly registering what had happened a couple more in the same spot should do it but quick huh lorenzos eyes were fixed back on the lights ahead faint sweat beads popping on his forehead he could see now that it was a large truck but theyd still be able to swing back in time nunzio got aimed squareon again but then the cadillac suddenly swung in towards them at the last second startling him it swerving away or pulling forward again would have been the natural reaction he squeezed off the shots anyway saw two more star bursts appear to the right of the first just before jeanpauls face loomed inches away and the cadillac crunched against them they drifted away a few yards and lorenzo juggled frantically with the wheel pulling them back in his eyes opened wider the truck was bearing down hard its airhorn blaring but they should still make it in time he accelerated to cut in front of jeanpaul but at that instant the cadillac swung towards them again another shot squeezed off by nunzio and lorenzo had anticipated this time by turning his wheel back in just before impact but it was no contest the cadillac was almost twice their cars weight and the shunt was much harder this time they careened wildly towards the truck as lorenzo tried to make a last second compensation with the wheel too sharp what the the back swung around and they slued totally out of control the screeching of tyres and airbrakes filled the air the truck driver had expected them to cut in or even if they pulled over slightly thered have still been room for him to pass so he was late braking the car fishtailed at the last moment and he hit it broadside staving in the drivers side and carrying it along for ten yards before the momentum rolled it over it turned through coming to rest on its roof the driver finally managed to come to a halt five yards short of the mangled wreck he jumped out not sure whether to advance closer or get clear the driver he could see had been killed instantly but he was trying to judge whether there was any movement from the passenger when the spilt petrol igniting made the decision for him the flames quickly leapt higher and he was only eight paces into his sprint away when the whole thing blew jeanpaul had pulled over fifty yards down on the far side and theyd got out of the car jeanpaul braced one hand on the cadillac roof as they looked on his father had bought the car in the midst of their battles with the cacchiones it hadnt been able to save pascal but his father would have been smiling on at them now if he could see the good use it had been put to something from the past to allow them to escape to the future somehow fitting as the explosion came he could see for a second the excitement reflected in raphaels eyes the stock reaction of the videogame generation then as it dawned on the boy how close theyd come to death themselves his face crumpled and he pulled in close as his father hugged him tight lillian gently clasped jeanpauls hand over raphaels shoulder but still the circle wasnt complete jeanpaul reminded himself if roman got to georges simone never would be reaching out for his hand thirtyfive so many emotions elena knew already what he looked like from photos at the donatiens so she found herself studying other things the way he moved the inflection in his voice the way he looked at her and smiled what few smiles there were shed spun so much around in her head of what to say that in the end she was tonguetied she just stood there stuttering how are you then realizing shed already said that on greeting added hastily its so good to see you at last and she wasnt even sure whether to hug him whether that would be too bold presumptuous so in the end she was rooted stock still blinking like an idiot she was still adjusting after her hours in the darkness and as hed finally advanced a step smiling hesitantly possibly in response to how awkward and nervous she must have looked they embraced but it was still slightly stiff almost formal far from the emotional catharsis shed envisioned she could feel the barriers of three decades without contact with that first touch they wouldnt be torn down in the first minutes or even in the few hours she had but as they sat down and someone called russell offered her coffee at least they started to make progress she hesitatingly started to explain but as she faltered at one point not sure where to head next the questions started coming my father what was he like and your father how old did you say you were when it all happened where did you live then were you long at the orphanage did you look around much so you found out through my stepfathers brother i havent seen him since i was a child whats he like now at first she was glad of the questions she no longer had to think of what to say next to explain but at some point they started to feel slightly mechanical as if she was at a job interview georges gauging if she was good enough material to actually be his mother or if she could score enough points for him ever to be able to forgive her she could clearly pick up the anger in his undertone on some words and shed already started to become uncertain again fumble slightly her hand trembling on her coffee cup as she sipped at it when the crunch question came you having to give me away i can understand you were so young but why didnt you try and find me in the years since he shook his head and looked down morosely his eyes slowly lifting again to meet hers challengingly all those years why and she started to stumble through the rest her blanking it from her mind her work with orphaned children to try and bury the guilt telling herself all along that hed have gone to a good home somewhere until ryall and lorena but as she got to that point and her thoughts turned again to what lorena was now facing and the nightmare odyssey that had brought her here lowndes the stephanous the orphanage tears streaming on the phone to her mother when she learnt the truth about her father all those years wasted not only with her son lost from her but harbouring a grudge that was longsince misplaced her eyes started filling shed got so much wrong for so long that was a loss that shed never make good on let alone in these few hours now as her body started gently quaking and she dabbed at the tears with the back of one hand he moved closer and hugged her again then im sorry im sorry to push you so he gently patted her back its just just that i felt i needed to know no no its okay she sniffled back got more control you have every right to know and within the space of the time theyd been talking she felt that his embrace was suddenly different more open welcoming maybe there was hope yet that shed be able to break down the barriers as they broke from the embrace and georges surveyed her face saw the shadows of the years of pain and guilt in her eyes that was the first moment he could truly say he warmed to her hed spent the first forty minutes clinging tight to his own long builtup resentment for anything else to filter through but it came more through admiration than any emotional bond or love maybe that would come later in that moment he appreciated and admired what shed gone through to try and see him she could so easily have just shrugged and turned her back on him for the other half of her life saved herself the grief he smiled ruefully explains one thing you father being a hotshot banker hed always had trouble relating to nicholas stephanous weakspirited defeatism wondering how he could possibly be of the same blood but he wondered now if that too was what had made him look up so to jeanpaul the image of the proper patriarch in his mind inescapably entwined with money and power oh i see elena was a second late catching on she remembered the donatiens telling her that georges was in banking their hands were the last thing to part and there was an awkward lull for a second elena glanced towards the glass sliding doors and the veranda inky blackness beyond only a faint moon picking out part of the lake and the ring of trees beyond her eyes had been naturally drawn there upon first walking in a relief from the stark roomlight after her hours in the dark well now you know a bit about me such as it is she lightly chewed her bottom lip turning back towards georges i heard quite a bit about you from your stepparents the donatiens theyre very proud but there was a lot we she suddenly froze at that moment all the lights went out allenveloping blackness the distant moonlight on the lake the only visible light almost like being back inside the blackened visor except that now she could hear her sons uncertain breathing along with her own faint sound of footsteps and movement from deeper in the house and after five seconds some weak emergency lights came on and russells voice trailed from near the top of the stairs looks like a general power outage the lights on a minute ago at a cabin to the west seem to have gone too steves just sorting out the generator should be up and running in a few minutes behind them chacs head had peeped out of the kitchen okay keep us posted then with a brief nod towards them he went back in she relaxed again but as she continued talking she could see that georges was still on edge eyes darting listening out for every small noise downstairs he was hardly listening to what she was saying what was that he asked at one point tuning back in just i was saying how difficult it must be for you now with your fiancee simone you obviously still have strong feelings for her sergeant chenouda mentioned a note that more alarming noises suddenly rose heavy scuffing footsteps and muffled shouting then a bang that they were still pondering whether or not was connected with the generator starting when russells repeated shouts rang up the stairs gas gas get out oouuu his pounding footsteps petered out halfway up stumbling georges jumped up his eyes narrowing you brought them here didnt you you brought them here chac was already three steps out of the kitchen gun drawn come on we gotta go what she was disorientated for a second then suddenly her heart was in her throat as it dawned on her what georges meant the threat that was upon them nono she pleaded reaching out to him but as she rose she felt her knees buckle something sweet in her nostrils and at the back of her mouth her head suddenly light and georges was already out of reach heading towards the veranda doors she wondered for a moment whether this was like the day at the baie du febvre convent and she was just fainting with the upset or maybe she was still lying on the convent floor waiting to come around and everything that had happened in between had been a cruel nightmare but as she saw chac crumple only two yards away choking for breath and georges sink to his knees as he opened the terrace doors she knew different the house was rapidly filling with gas she saw him get the door half open and partially raise to try and stagger out but at that moment she felt the solid punch of the carpet on one cheek and everything spun into blackness she didnt see whether he made it nicola ryalls hand was shaking as she put down the phone a shaking that became more pronounced as she reached for the bedside drawer and the gun im sorry to call so late its about your daughter mikaya it was an antique gun a pre world war luger she tried to remember how the end screwtop worked put there to make it look like a replica and avoid licensing problems unscrewed or pulled out like a stopper shes okay now stable but a minute later with her roommates returning and it would have been too late she fumbled for a second and in the end pulled it out she checked it for ammunition almost dropping it at one point with her hand shaking so wildly it was fully loaded hed always said it was in case of burglars and she remembered him mentioning that hed testfired in the fields at the back last summer still were sure that it was a real suicide attempt not just a cry for help your daughter had no idea her friends would be arriving back at that time the call was from one of mikayas tutors whod gone to the hospital with her mikaya was heavily sedated and asleep now but there might be the chance to talk with her in four or five hours time suicide nicola thought of all those years she could have done something at least tried to stand up to him but at every turn shed pushed it away took another pill or shot of gin my god shed even seen him with mikaya one night but still tried to convince herself that nothing was really happening that with the heavy shadows she just thought shed seen more than she really had she raised the gun slowly towards her all the time the veiled threat that hed spill her little secret well just live our own lives do our own things from hereon in no questions asked hed stopped sleeping with her soon after hed discovered she couldnt have children but still it must have been a shock to him coming home unexpectedly a day early from a business trip to find her in bed with another woman a strange sly smile had crossed his face though she wasnt to fully fathom why until later when they adopted mikaya a lesbian scandal would be like a napalm bomb dropped amongst her little village knitting circle of church fete organisers and charity dogooders and he knew it he had the hold over her he wanted she blinked for a second at the gun barrel as it came to eye level then slowly turned it towards her as she held it out by her head still she should have said something should have done something her precious villagecircle reputation in exchange for what had now happened with mikaya she closed her eyes shaking her head all those years mikaya must have silently suffered a feeble pathetic tradeoff and poor lorena was no doubt now suffering the same each time the pain wormed deeper the pills and gin needed to numb it increased she was at her limit she couldnt face the pain or guilt a second longer she levelled the gun by her right temple her hand shaking so wildly that she was worried she might miss at even those few inches she remembered hearing about a famous political couple where the wife had developed lesbian preferences later in their marriage theyd stayed married for the sake of image and the husband had responded by playing away from home except that unlike his wife it surfaced and hit the headlines for a while that had made nicola feel better about herself not such a freak but it was little consolation now and the husbands playing away had been with twentysomethings not little girls a slow tear trailed at the corner of one eye and she scrunched her eyes tighter shut as she tensed her finger against the trigger her pulse pumping a wild tattoo no other way out no other too much pain gently squeezing thinking how poor mikaya must have felt in that same moment but at the last second she suddenly eased her finger her held breath rushing out in one her eyes blinked slowly open again shed been a coward all the way through and now this was the cowards final way out if she pulled the trigger still she wouldnt be doing anything shed be making a pathetic gesture not a stand hed just look at her body and sneer the final proof that she never had the guts to stand up to him worse still poor lorena would be left alone with him thered be nothing left then to stop him she lowered the gun and where was he now lorenas first night back and still he hadnt been able to resist sneaking along to her room she got to her feet her legs shaking and her head so light that she thought she might topple over for a second then with a brief pause to get her head clear and a last swallow of resolve she started her way uncertainly towards lorenas room romans breath rasped heavily as he ran around to the front of the house echoing back at him within the gas mask the nightsight vision also took some getting used too a strange greygreen with a slight blur left in the wake of any movement with the jolting as he ran almost everything ahead had a blurred edge everything had gone well at first theyd got to the back of the house before the generator came back on funicelli had cut a whole in the back door glass pane slipped the latch and slid three gas pellets into the downstairs corridor the gas should have hit the s guards in the rooms each side and seeped upstairs about the same time but a guard from one of the rooms came out only seconds after the pellets had been thrown perhaps hed heard their faint skittering along the floor even through the closed door and instantly he was heading for the stairs and shouting a door opened the other side with another two guards who decided to head in their direction at the back but didnt make it far one collapsed halfway along the corridor and the other staggering managed to get one hand on the door before roman decided it was too close for comfort he stepped from the shadows and shot the guard through the face from two foot away immediately the guard fell romans ears were keened sharp to movement upstairs footsteps at the front of the house the sound of a door sliding open and when he heard the faint creaking of boards on the front deck he started sprinting around the rest followed five or six yards behind by the time hed got around to the front of the house and could pick out shapes clearly from his jolting greygreen vision the running figure was at least seven yards clear of the bottom of the veranda steps on the far side heading towards the nearby trees and bushes donatiens at any second hed be lost amongst them roman steadied for a second levelled and fired and saw georges duck down for a second and disappear amongst the foliage roman wasnt sure whether georges had been hit or was ducking to weave through the branches roman ran on his breath fell hard almost deafening inside the gas mask and as he realized it was smothering practically every other sound he ripped it off and threw it no danger of gas this far from the house and listening out for georges movements was now the best guide the tree foliage was too thick for him to see much no fallen body in sight as roman hit the trees hed either missed or only clipped georges but as roman started pushing and weaving his way through it suddenly struck him that it was immaterial georges wasnt going anywhere the trees stretched for no more than forty yards before hitting the edge of the lake wrapping around then there was at least a hundred yards of frozen lake before the next landfall as soon as georges started to cross it roman would have a clear shot at him he wouldnt be able to get away georges struggled to get his head clear hed been close to blackout by the veranda door and had taken deep breaths of the cold nightair finally managing to raise and stagger out he gradually picked up stride but still his head was fuzzy his step uncertain hed stumbled and almost fallen down the last few veranda steps in his haste then at the edge of the trees when he heard someone behind and a shot zipped through the leaves only a foot away again he almost stumbled as his legs turned to jelly with fear a nightmare race he desperately needed to gain more distance but the more his lungs gaspingly pumped his run rather than cleared his head still hazy and spinning from the gas the closer he came to blackingout he thrashed his way frantically through the branches and shrubs as another shot zipped closeby he realized that his pursuer was either firing blind towards the sound of his movements or had caught a momentary glimpse of him georges stumbled on saw the clearing ahead but as he burst through and came to the edge of the frozen lake he stopped it was too long a distance for him to be in the open vulnerable it was then that he noticed the small jetty with a power boat and snowmobile thirty yards to his right sound of rapid footsteps tree branches flaying behind him he bolted towards the jetty his breath rasped heavy he had to strain his hearing to pick up the position of his pursuer his chest ached with the effort and his legs threatened to give out again in the last few yards he practically fell on the snowmobile frantically fumbling button deadcentre on the handle bars pullchord to the right sound of his pursuer flaying through the last few bushes georges pressed the button and pulled the chord but it didnt start his pursuer appeared through the bushes and with the gas mask now removed georges could see that it was roman there was a suspended moment between them georges watching through his breath vapour as roman orientated and finally fixed on him georges pulled again and this time the engine roared to life but roman was already raising his gun aiming georges revved quickly leapt on and started speeding away the first bullet whistled close by when hed gone barely five yards but the second hit georges felt it like a mule kick to his left shoulder spinning his steering off for a second before he straightened again the third came quickly afterwards hitting the metal at the back of the snowmobile and the fourth whistled clear again by which time he prayed he was too distant for a clear shot still he kept in the same hunched forward position for at least another seventy yards teeth gritted against the pain of his shattered shoulder before he raised up slightly and risked a look back at romans position it took him a moment to pick out the figure in the weak moonlight gun held limply at his side breath heavy on the air as he stared bemusedly towards him georges couldnt resist smiling then laughing and as he sped along the ice in no time it became a raucous whoop for joy with the sudden release of tension over half a mile to the far ring of trees and by then georges thought nothing of the slight jolt at first but it was the crack and heavier tilting as the snowmobile landed from the bump hed hit snowcovered tree branch or whatever that was more worrying then as one of the skis caught against the edge of the ice suddenly everything was spinning and georges felt the solid thud of the ice against his side and the snowmobile jamming against his left leg he lay there for a second breathless trying to orientate but as he felt his trapped leg getting wet and saw the snowmobile tilt further and start to slide away from him he suddenly realized with panic what had happened the ice had cracked and he was sinking through it he frantically tried to scramble away as the snowmobile slipped deeper into the water but its sheer weight tilted the severed ice block to a sharper angle and georges felt himself sliding inexorably with it the water was like an icy hatchet hitting his groin georges clawed desperately at the ice but it was like trying to grip onto wet glass the icy water rose swiftly taking georges breath away and at the last second he thrashed his arms against the water to stay buoyant but the suction of the snowmobile submerging seemed to draw him under as well and he felt the water fill his mouth and lap over his head for a second before his flailing arms were able to bring him back up again he spluttered and spat grappling desperately for the first solid ice edge he grabbed on to one block but it moved he bobbed down again for a bit only just managing to keep his mouth clear of the water eyes frantically scanning as he thrashed around he could feel his body rapidly numbing all sensation going from his nerveends if he didnt get out fast he wouldnt make it he grappled on to one more loose chunk before finally connecting with a solid edge but as he started to lever out his spirits sank he could see that roman was only fifty yards away and fast closing hed obviously started his sprint as soon as he saw the snowmobile get into trouble if he didnt hurry hed get clear only to be a sitting target the pain was excruciating with his wounded shoulder he had to lever and slither mostly on his right side he was breathless with the strain before finally sliding his torso onto the ice like a landed seal but as soon as he raised up and put weight on his left leg he felt it buckle and the pain shoot up through his body then remembered it getting jammed under the snowmobile georges felt any last hope slip away in that second and as he hobbled pathetically away and heard romans footfall rapidly closing in behind he wished he hadnt bothered he should have just let himself sink back below the icy water at least hed have robbed roman of the satisfaction of shooting him thirtysix faint flicker of the eyes just for a second ryall leant in closer are you awake lorena after a second uncertainly no the eyes perfectly still again no movement but ryall wasnt totally satisfied her answers had started to become evasive werent really telling him anything and as he straightened up from leaning over and let out a sigh he was sure her eyes had flickered open momentarily and shed had to think for a second about her answer now but her eyes hadnt opened to look at him more at something over the far end of the room he turned following where shed been looking the mountie bear from canada he studied it for a moment perched on a dressing table at the far end of the room then started moving closer towards it obscured in heavy shadow it was difficult to pick out much of its detail at the other end bell tensed as he watched ryall peer towards him moving closer oh shit he glanced again towards the phone wondering whether to call and abort but he felt rooted to the screen afraid to move even for a second in case he missed something ryall came to within two yards then suddenly turned back again ryall was sure hed seen lorenas eyes flicker back shut again as he turned as if she was curious where he was heading what he was looking at whats the game lorena he asked moving back towards her no response her body and her eyelids suddenly frozen deathly still i know youre awake so we can stop playing now lorena bell leapt for the phone punched out the numbers it rang once twice for gods sakecome on he banged his fist against the phone table all thats left now is for you to tell me ryall leant over lorenas inert body he trailed a finger gently up her neck and moved close until he was only inches away could feel her soft breath against his face and for a second it would have been easy to believe she really was under his control like every other night his voice lowered to a chilling whisper tell me tell me whats the game lorenas closed eyelids pulsed a moments trembling uncertainty which ryall could feel too through her body then he watched in satisfaction as her eyes finally snapped open it wasnt my idea wasnt my idea the phone answered halfway through the third ring and bell was immediately passed on to a duty sergeant he frantically outlined the problem his eyes still fixed on the screen six feet away lorena now sitting up eyes wide her head shaking as she pointed straight ahead at the camera lens the sergeant said that crowley had gone off duty over two hours ago but well phone him at home straightaway and mobilise at the same time ryall was now joining her in staring at the camera this time with undisguised hostility then his voice came over strongly as he gripped lorena by the shoulders shaking her what have you done what have you done but for gods sake hurry theres probably not much time left we should have a squad car there in no more than six or seven minutes bell leapt back in front of the screen the second he hung up his hand trembling uncontrollably as he reached out towards the screen again hold on angel hold on well be there soon but he felt totally out of control it was strange able to watch every small movement but unable to do anything like watching a sepia horror film which had suddenly spun in the wrong direction and hed had to phone someone else to stop the reels and as he saw ryall throw lorena back against the bed and move towards the camera his face a mask of fury he realized theyd probably be too late he knew what was coming next ryall would rip the bear apart and destroy the camera and it would be lights out he wouldnt see what happened when ryall turned his rage back towards lorena but two paces away from the camera with ryalls hand distorted as he reached out ryall suddenly stopped turning towards the side what what the hell are you doing what have you done what have you done the first sound that nicola ryall heard as she reached for the door handle as she swung it open he was moving rapidly away from the bed seemed to be interested in something at the far end of the room then stopped as he noticed her by the open door eyes falling quickly to the gun as he asked her what the hell she was doing a condescending indignant sneer she raised the gun a fraction higher and pointed it at him just dont move it sounded good on the movies but coming from her particularly with the tremor in her voice it sounded lame pathetic ryall gave it the derision it deserved what are you going to shoot me you one eyebrow raised his mouth curled into a smile anyway that thing doesnt even work she hesitated only for a second she was sure it was a bluff yes it does i tried it out only a few months back she lied and as she saw his face drop she knew that it did work she decided to pile it on im getting quite good with it now now he looked seriously worried and raised his hands a bit she relished the moment the unfamiliar sense of power over him making her slightly giddy she should have tried this earlier shed hardly ever been able to take control over her own life let alone anyone elses ryall met her gaze stonily and shifted a foot back towards lorena before nicola waggled the gun at him i said dont move a frozen moment between them then the phone ringing just then it was about mikaya she tried to take her own life what his eyebrows knitted is she okay she is now heavy sigh that quickly turned to a sneer as if you should care youre the cause of it she shook her head her hand tensing on the gun i let you get away with it with mikaya for all those years but not now with lorena not any longer his eyes fixed back on the gun he leered nervously you dont have the guts i wouldnt bank on it she moved a step closer ryall could still pick up the tremor in her voice he was sure that when it came to the crunch shed bottle out but he wasnt sure enough to take the risk he desperately needed a distraction his eyes darted uncertainly sweat beads raising on his forehead the bear he forced a strained smile anyhow you shoot me theyll get it all on film theyll know it wasnt selfdefence he pointed theyve got a camera in the bear what nicola glanced towards it incredulously camera in the bear she was the one meant to be on pills and alcohol cant you think of a better bluff than that but as soon as she said it she realized it was almost too ridiculous to be a bluff no no really what do you think i was doing when you walked in i was going to rip the bear apart and smash the camera he was insistent sounded convincing and nicola glanced towards lorena for confirmation lorena just numbly nodded and looking at her wideeyed and fearful at this drama being played out nicola suddenly had something else to give her pause for thought as much as he might be a monster lorena seeing her stepfather shot in front of her was quite another thing so why dont i just finish the job now and destroy the camera he said or better still since youre such a good shot why dont you shoot it out nicola looked between him and the bear he was leering challengingly as if this was some kind of test between them if she backed down once again hed have the edge go on he taunted youre the crack shot after all she levelled the gun at the bear but as the shaking of her gun hand became more pronounced almost out of control the game was all but over he could see through the bluff in that second see her for the sham she was the pathetic quivering wreck shed become fifteen seconds of control in fifteen years in the end all hed allowed her his leer became wider you havent even got the stomach to shoot a toy bear let alone me she gritted her teeth hard struggling to control her trembling determined to prove him wrong as ryall saw her focus her aim and tense to squeeze the trigger he made his move lunging towards lorena the gun swung sharply around the shot zipping above him and smashing through the window behind hed jumped down low most of his body shielded by the bed as he scrambled on the floor and grappled his arms around lorena from behind as he raised again he had her pinned tight against him a complete body shield his eyes jousted with nicolas for a second as if pressing home who was in control now move away from the door or ill snap her neck he pulled his forearm tighter around lorenas throat to demonstrate at the other end of the camera bell was on a knifes edge his heart like a jackhammer as he watched events unfold as the gun had pointed at the camera hed been screaming no no its a trick a trick if youre going to shoot anything shoot him now he was muttering under his breath be careful be careful just hold him off dont try anything the cavalry will be there any minute bell watched nicola hesitate for a second then finally move aside a couple of feet as ryall edged towards her and backed half a step at a time towards the door with lorena gripped tight to him as nicola followed they were gone from camera vision all bell was left with was the sound nicola had moved aside almost mechanically afraid that he might harm lorena or just following his command the way shed become programmed to all these years only as he edged towards the top of the stairs did the thought hit her where are you going with her i dont know yet ill decide that once im in the car ryalls eyes shifted nervously downstairs theyd know about the hypnosis from the tape but had he touched lorena anywhere he shouldnt hed got so used to touching lorena where he liked when she was under that he just couldnt recall theyll be here soon here who she squinted as if she was having trouble focusing he nodded towards lorenas bedroom the bear theyve been taping tired tone tedium of the long years of having to explain every last detail to cut through her drink and pills stupor for nicola everything suddenly gelled in that instant all she had to do was hold him up a couple of minutes she raised the gun more confidently then youre not leaving that condescending sneer again you hardly had the stomach to shoot the bear and both you and i know that youre not a good enough shot to get me without also hitting lorena his eyes focused on her gun hand which started to shake more under his stare she found his confidence infuriating a few words and she felt her own confidence blow to the wind like dandelion seeds exactly why hed got away with everything for so long with mikaya and now lorena shed let them down and now even with a gun in her hand there was nothing she could do to stop him she put her other arm up trying to steady the gun with both hands but still it shook and wavered wildly youre pathetic ryall grinned at the spectacle go back and practice shooting at the bear then when youre ready in a couple of years let me know she tried to face him off a moment longer but finally crumbled lowering the gun he was right she was pathetic a hopeless wreck of a woman on the edge shed been crazy to even think she had the strength to but as he turned to the stairs with a last indignant pathetic and she caught the pleading look in lorenas eyes a fresh spark suddenly rose a red raw anger that made her eyes sting anger and disgust at the shell of a woman shed become at what hed made her shed done nothing to help mikaya but she couldnt let him go off now with lorena if she didnt do something now she never would one last chance of redemption and in that moment there was a window of opportunity he turned slightly to take the first step on the stairs his guard down fleetingly as he thought shed given up the ghost she raised the gun and fired in the same motion before his eyes could settle on her and steal her confidence away again but at the last second hed halfturned towards her perhaps catching the gun raising in the corner of his eye and as she saw the splay of red on his side and at the same time on lorenas nightdress it looked like shed caught lorena as well then watched in horror as they were thrown down the stairs lorena almost directly under him as they tumbled down they landed with a sickening thud at the bottom and nicola closed her eyes for a second hardly daring to look before finally rushing down she knelt a yard away from the tangle of their bodies lorena bloodsoaked halftrapped under his chest no movement from either of them she tentatively reached out then retracted halfway her nerve had suddenly gone again and so she just stayed in the same position chewing at the knuckles of her gun hand and rocking back and forth on her haunches as she looked on at their bodies at bells end hed been keened sharply to every small sound after the gunshot praying that he might hear lorenas voice nothing but silence for a full minute then as he honed in closer his ear less than an inch from the speaker he finally picked up something nicola ryall muttering what have i done what have i done punctuated by gentle weeping the searchbeam of the helicopter raced across the landscape ahead of them how far now michel asked they knew from mundy that the exact location was halfway between cochrane and a place called fraserdale two or three miles no more trees lakes trees lakes they knew the house was on the edge of a lake but michel couldnt tell one from another hundreds of miles of the same vista stretching out across northern quebec and ontario i think thats it the pilot said after a moment nodding to one side he tilted the helicopter starting to circle in and then as they straightened the searchbeam hit the house no signs of life at first not even any lights on michels hands clenched tight again the image hit of picking through the bodies then michel spotted a figure in front of the house and another running along the lakeside there something there he pointed the man by the house looked up at them anxiously as he was caught in the beam but the man at the lakeside seemed to have half his attention on something deeper out in the lake where was he heading michel pondered aloud dont know lets look see the pilot swung back and pointed the beam towards the lake at first they didnt see anything and he had to tilt the beam to reach further out before it finally picked up the two figures facing each other at the centre of the frozen lake so what now georges gasped for breath i think you know roman smiled as he levelled the gun oh but one thing just before you go i had nothing to do with that abduction and attempted hit on you thats not to say i didnt plan to kill you but i think your friend and mine chenouda knew that and decided to try and get you into the programme georges shook his head his first reaction was to disbelieve roman but then why would he bother to lie at this moment so many sidegames that hed never been aware of but there was one that did now prey on his mind i cant believe that jeanpaul is responsible for this now has ordered you to kill me it goes against everything he believes in yep youre right there his idea was to get you away to cuba soft fool that he is georges glared hard hell have you for breakfast when you get back i dont think so as we speak now hes being taken out he wont be having any more breakfasts what i i dont but as he saw the gloating satisfaction on romans face he knew that it wasnt a bluff his stomach dipped sickeningly but his first thought was for simone jeanpaul dead and now him shed never be able to face it he closed his eyes for a second and shuddered maybe theyd been wrong all along wasting their time in the end romans ways held sway but if he was going to die he might at least have one last swipe back jeanpaul was right about you all along no fucking brain the bullet the answer to everything roman glared back intensely his jaw set tight but georges met his stare evenly so if youre going to shoot me shoot me prove us all right what an absolute nobrainer you are romans smile rose slowly remembering venegas thats where you got it wrong college boy i aint going to shoot you roman wallowed in the quizzical surprise on georges face for a moment before lowering the gun to georges feet sometimes im a little more subtle than you might appreciate or for that matter jeanpaul he fired and the ice cracked a foot to georges side but the block didnt sever and as the echo of the shot died they suddenly heard the whirl of the helicopter roman looked over his shoulder momentarily distracted but it was hovering over the house one shot more and the block would break off he fired again but georges had anticipated and leapt a yard to one side as the ice block severed and sailed free roman aimed again at the ice then suddenly his eyes shifted uncertainly the engine tone of the helicopter had changed it was moving towards them baring down fast roman raised the gun towards georges brief apologetic smile sometimes subtleties have to be thrown to the wind in the helicopter michel had put a sniper called gilles on alert by the open side door as soon as they started moving towards the two figures within a short distance michel could make out that the far figure was georges but with the other wearing night goggles he couldnt make him out clearly but they could see the gun and they were close enough by then for the sound of the second shot to reach them oh god are we too late michel shouted try a shot try a shot hes shooting at the ice for some reason gilles tried to steady the rifle against the movement of the helicopter get the figure centre in his nightsight but were still too distant then as gilles saw the gun raise he realized there was little choice the figure moved wildly in his crosshairs with the vibrations it would be pot luck but if he didnt try it would be too late anyway gilles squeezed off the shot saw the figure jolt from his sights not sure if it had fallen away or it was the kick of the rifle youve got him michel announced excitedly seeing the figure sprawl a second before gilles could pick it up again in his sights but as gilles trailed the crosshairs back across the figure he could see that hed only clipped him a shoulder wound the hand was rising again with the gun though this time they were closer the shot cleaner he pumped two bullets in quick succession through the back clenched fist yes from michel but the elation was shortlived a highpowered calibre the bullets had gone straight through the body shattering the ice beneath a large iceblock had broken free the body sliding into the water as it tilted but at the far end of the block was georges he tottered unsteadily for a second before falling on his side and michel watched in horror as he slid in too with the tilt of the iceblock get us down fast he screamed we cant land on the ice it wont take us the pilot shouted back he pointed with his thumb someone will have to go down on the winch michel assessed for only a second before moving forward okay gilles leaned back from the open side door as a colleague hooked in michel and they started to wind him down the winch rope swayed and spun wildly with the wind from the rotors and michels view of georges below came and went a third of the way down he caught a glimpse of georges thrashing around in the dark water trying to grab on to a solid iceedge he was still there halfway down but as michel straightened from a half spin close to the ground georges had completely disappeared his stomach sank no no he hadnt come all this way for it to end like this he frantically waved to the helicopter to bring him down closer there was still a good five yards between the end of the rope and the ground as more winch rope was fed out its swing became even wider michel had to be careful where he landed in case he hit the broken ice and fell in as well and in the last few feet just before he finally made contact with a jolt he was sure he saw the brief bob of a head and part of an arm appear above the water he quickly unhooked ran breathlessly towards it but by the time he got to the edge of the broken ice georges had gone again he scanned frantically for movement bubbles anything but there was nothing but still black water no no he screamed falling to his knees knowing in that moment that if georges died hed never be able to forgive himself for what hed done he started hurriedly brushing away the snow to see through the ice still only blackness too dark to see through he waved to the helicopter to bring the searchlight in closer colleagues would pat him on the back console him that hed done his best but all the time hed know the dark truth know that if it wasnt for his obsession this would never have happened he might as well have pushed georges under with his own hands he clawed desperately at the snow his hands redraw and numb cant end like this cant and suddenly he thought he saw something a couple of feet to his right he clawed away more snow shrinking back slightly in shock as it finally became clear georges face only inches beneath the ice ghostly in the searchlight beam michel let out a gasp of relief though he wondered whether he was already too late georges had probably been under almost two minutes he banged on the ice but it didnt break he tried again but still it didnt budge oh jesus no no salt tears stung his eyes as he realized he couldnt get to georges getting so close but still not able to save him having to watch from only inches away as georges drowned before his eyes maybe that was his punishment and he noticed something else then georges body was shifting beneath the ice with a slight current he tried another smash with his fist with no luck then he had to clear more snow to see georges clearly again three more strikes in rapid succession michel grunting and screaming with each putting all his strength into it and with the last with still no icebreak michel felt the last of his strength go with it was about to roll over onto his back and give up give one last cry of frustration and then suddenly he remembered the snipers bullets michel took out his gun measuring hed have to be careful with georges body shifting with the current a few inches out and hed hit him but no time to clear away more snow he fired once twice just ahead of where he thought georges would be a crack appeared and he fired a third shot to break the block free he scrambled down reaching into the icy water nothing nothing he was frantic try another shot or clear some snow to see where georges was he started to clear with his other hand a glimpse of something though not very clear and a second later georges body connected he grappled on and yanked up hard pulling georges head and shoulders above the water a quick breath and then he yanked again putting all his weight into it until he had most of georges body solidly on the ice his breath vapour billowed hard in the freezing air as he leant over to resuscitate georges but at that moment he could see the iceblock they were on cracking with the weight he had to desperately grapple and slide the body again this time almost a full two yards before collapsing in a heap at georges side exhausted as only a foot away the iceblock gave way he was almost too out of breath to give mouthtomouth he had to furiously pull in every breath he gave out muttering repeatedly dont die on me now dont die on me as he intermittently lifted off and pressed against georges stomach and as the first coughs and splutters finally came from georges mouth michel rolled onto his back and let out a great whooping victory cry towards the night sky and the swaying beam of the helicopter above epilogue july th montreal canada jeanpaul slowly surveyed the large reception room from the head table the only one standing among the almost two hundred wedding guests its good to see the whole family together old friends some that i havent seen for a while his gaze fell on art giacomelli who puffed on his cigar and nodded in recognition and new found friends jeanpaul briefly acknowledged michel chenouda at the far table then looked more pointedly towards elena waldren only a few places away at the head table the reception was in the hotel de ville a spreading colonial style star dating from the s overlooking place jaques cartier the sixcourse dinner was finished the telegrams read and the only background sounds to jeanpauls speech were the unwrapping of truffles and petitfours the hovering waiters replenishing brandy and liqueur glasses and the gentle puff of cigar smoke sent twirling around rococo columns towards the high ceiling jeanpaul spoke about his joy at simones birth his eyes cast down for a second in memory of her mother clair and stephanie whom shed treated as a mother then he quickly lightened again with a few anecdotes from simones childhood and early teens before getting to the subject of georges ive trusted him with my business affairs these past few years and now my daughter im not sure which i should be more worried about murmur of laughter from the guests jeanpaul held one hand up slightly changing the mood again but not to make light of georges help what weve tried to achieve these past few years hasnt been easy some said all along that it was impossible and during that transition theres been some changes and transitions too in the family some of them painful there was the loss of my brother jeanpaul left a significant pause pascal my father and theres been some other close calls too as he looked towards georges and simone simones eyes watered he could have meant georges near death or the fear of losing her that hed told her about soon after the ambiguity wasnt lost on her either of the way hed mentioned his brother pascal hed vowed that hed never mention romans name again but to those not in the know he might have meant his brother roman with pascal mentioned separately no my friends that transition has at times not been easy jeanpaul pursed his lips tight and looked down for a second before looking up again to pick out giacomelli and chenouda but hopefully we got there in the end michel solemnly nodded his accord not been easy the understatement no doubt to pay homage without too heavily shadowing the day their entire rcmp gameplan had changed in the aftermath of romans death michel reflected frank massenat had turned crowns evidence and spilt everything he knew about romans side game with gianni cacchione and theyd also found out who was their internal leak guy campion now facing three to five for corruption michel was relieved that it wasnt anyone in his own department massenat would get a lighter sentence even though what hed passed on probably wouldnt be enough to successfully prosecute cacchione but apparently art giacomelli had spoken at length with carlos medeiros now that medeiros knew that cacchione had been duping him the past three years bets were being made that cacchione wouldnt last the year strange after all these years of pursuit of the lacailles michel had felt a sense of gratification when hed finally closed the investigation against jeanpaul lacaille in a last meeting pelletier and maitland had piped up about a few minor infractions that jeanpaul could probably still be nailed over but michel was quick to remind them that if it wasnt for that lastminute call from jeanpaul theyd have lost their main witness anyway and with the final rub of salt in maitlands wounds about the damage caused by his boy campion the issue was closed jeanpaul was quick to offer his thanks when he heard but michel brushed it off you did nothing wrong you were telling the truth all along just that with roman running interference in the middle it took us a while to realize it michel felt almost embarrassed how close to the edge his obsession had taken him if only jeanpaul knew when michel had gone to visit georges in the hospital georges had squinted up at him quizzically at one point you know roman said the strangest thing just before he died he said he had nothing to do with my abduction and planned hit he was trying to make out that you had something to do with it strange michel shrugged roman certainly was losing it towards the end he said that you probably knew he was about to kill me so did it to get me away to a safehouse and save my life michel smiled tightly back i already saved your life once so lets not get too carried away from the way georges stare lingered on him a second longer with a challenging wry smile he could see that georges wasnt convinced but that was probably as far as it would ever go an ambiguous secret held just between the two of them everything had settled back to normal at the rue sherbrooke club azy had phoned him to say that viana had returned from haiti within a week of romans death and hearing her account of events through azy his suspicion that roman had been about to kill georges was confirmed no more lingering doubt or guilt whether hed done the right thing getting georges away at michels side sandra gently squeezed his hand as jeanpaul came to the end of his speech the day had hopefully been as much a joy for them as it had been for him and with the announcement that thered be a firework display outside in forty minutes jeanpaul hoped that they enjoyed the rest of the evening and if you see anyone reaching nervously inside their jackets with the first bangs theyre nothing to do with me as a muted chuckle rose he closed his eyes briefly as if in penance not any more from now on theres only the future to look forward to a future that belongs to simone and georges michel squeezed back theyd started seeing each other socially outside of just when he went to pick the kids up nothing too serious just a dinner date now and then and functions like this but the kids lived in great hope it was almost as if his obsession had crowded out everything else in his life left no space for her and the kids and now that hed finally let it go shed somehow sensed it perhaps there was room for them again one step at a time and while his future looked far less bright and certain than simones and georges on this day as almost two hundred strong rose to join jeanpaul in toasting them maybe there was some hope for him too the starburst firework lit up the nightsky over the st lawrence elena watched it fadeout in raindroptears of light then another two dazzling bursts exploded in quick succession to its side bright sparks of hope among the darkness the guests had clustered two deep on the open balcony and the rest had gone downstairs in front of the hotel for a clear view elena had managed to get a front position on the balcony next to georges and simone the fireworks were being set off from a barge moored to the jetty elenas first night back in montreal two nights ago shed sat only fifty yards away on the terrace of the la maree restaurant having dinner with georges and simone theyd taken a horsedrawn buggy ride there and on the way georges had pointed out the basilica de notre dame where the wedding would take place the hotel for the reception then the river as he mentioned jeanpauls firework plans he got the idea apparently from the jeanbaptiste day displays now as they looked on wideeyed at the spectacular display georges commented looks like jeanpauls keeping to his promise of trying to outdo them then in a brief lull he smiled warmly and reached out and clasped elenas hand im so glad you could make it mom thats okay she felt her eyes mist and flickered them down slightly in acknowledgement she was about to say not half as glad as she was but it would have sounded trite im just sorry that it took me so long to get here georges grimaced tightly and gave one last reassuring grasp before letting go as if to say it doesnt matter youre here now mom only the second time now hed said it the first time had been at the end of the dinner at la maree as if shed finally earned the spurs to the term enough had now passed between them the donatiens were a few people away from them not close enough for odette to have heard though she probably wouldnt have minded shed spoken to them at length earlier and from the brief acknowledging smile now as she caught their eye they seemed to approve of this newfound affection between her and georges it had been a while in coming and while the main push had come initially from her in the end georges had worked equally towards it though this was only her first time back to montreal since the nightmare night of their first meeting shed stayed on an extra five days then while georges was in hospital and thered been hours on the telephone and a chain of letters between them since hed asked everything they hadnt covered at that first meeting more about her father her mother gordon her children which then also included lorena the other newfound member of her family lorena had looked worse than she actually was when crowleys men first arrived all of the blood was ryalls and she was unconscious from the fall but it was only mild concussion no skull fractures and the most serious result of the fall was a broken arm nicola ryall would face a manslaughter charge but with the mitigating circumstances would probably only get three years with the prosecution and the disclosure of her lesbianism thered been no hope of her keeping lorena elena and gordon had been granted fostering rights with the final adoption order expected within six months elena had visited nicola ryall twice since with lorena to assure her that she was free to visit lorena whenever she liked and nicola had freely admitted that even without the obstacles she wouldnt have made the bid to keep lorena she lacked the mental strength and ability to even cope with herself let alone anyone else it would take some time for those scars to heel georges seemed to have shown a special interest in lorenas progress maybe because like him what shed been through had been so tumultuous or perhaps because he shared with her being a newfound family member elena had seen her mother practically every other weekend since returning to england catching up on lost time and the first couple of meetings had been tearful shed gleaned the full story of how painful her fathers final years had been how deep his regrets had run shed reached over and consoled her mother at that point well at least i finally found him hopefully for both of us then theyd hit the metaxas harder that uncle christos had brought with him and started to laugh out loud as they dredged through fonder family memories and anecdotes they moved on the subject of her fathers last years wasnt raised again between them georges and simone were honeymooning in france and elenas promise to her mother that one day shed bring georges to her door for a reunion would be made good when they visited elena in only three weeks time on their way back maybe then the circle broken thirty years ago would once again be complete though there was nothing elena could do to make good on all those lost years not just with georges but with her father too that still left an empty gap inside elena and probably always would a warm summer breeze wafted against elenas skin stark contrast to the cold when shed last been here and the mayhem shed been through then also seemed a million miles away from this occasion now difficult to correlate the two but as the last of the fireworks died she found her eyes drawn into the darkness a momentary chill running through her as she recalled that night trapped within the darkened visor going to see georges she pushed the thought abruptly away tried to think of it like the warm and welcoming darkness of the chine on her last visit to the chine only a week ago lorena had asked to join her elena had been anxious at first that lorena would be nervous would run in panic from the smothering darkness like before but after an initial trembling that elena had felt in lorenas hand shed been fine maybe the ghosts that lorena always feared would come for her as darkness settled the sewers and patrika and then later ryall had finally gone from her mind for elena though while the chine still felt warm and welcoming a place where she could escape from the madness and pressures of the world outside the main magic had somehow gone and only now did she realize why she had no more secrets to share with the darkness
