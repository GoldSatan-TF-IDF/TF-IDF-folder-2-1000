the bourne supremacy kowloon the teeming final extension of china that is no part of the north except in spirit but the spirit runs deep and descends into the caverns of mens souls without regard for the harsh irrelevant practicalities of political borders the land and the water are one and it is the will of the spirit that determines how man will use the land and the water again without regard for such abstractions as useless freedom or escapable confinement the concern is only with empty stomachs with womens stomachs childrens stomachs survival there is nothing else all the rest is dung to be spread over the infertile fields it was sundown and both in kowloon and across victoria harbour on the island of hong kong an unseen blanket was gradually being lowered over the territorys daylight chaos the screeching aiyas of the street merchants were muted with the shadows and quiet negotiations in the upper regions of the cold majestic structures of glass and steel that marked the colonys skyline were ending with nods and shrugs and brief smiles of silent accommodation night was coming proclaimed by a blinding orange sun piercing an immense jagged fragmented wall of clouds in the west sharply defined shafts of uncompromising energy about to plunge over the horizon unwilling to let this part of the world forget the light soon darkness would spread across the sky but not below below the blazing lights of human invention would garishly illuminate the earth this part of the earth where the land and the water were anxious avenues of access and conflict and with the neverending everstrident nocturnal carnival other games would begin games the human race should have abandoned with the first light of creation but there was no human life then so who recorded it who knew who cared death was not a commodity a small motorboat its powerful engine belying its shabby exterior sped through the lamma channel heading around the coastline towards the harbour to a disinterested observer it was merely one more xiao wan ju a legacy to a first son from a once unworthy fisherman who had struck minor riches a crazy night of mahjong hashish from the triangle smuggled jewels out of macao who cared the son could cast his nets or run his merchandise more efficiently by using a fast propeller rather than the slow sail of a junk or the sluggish engine of a sampan even the chinese border guards and the marine patrols on and off the shores of the shenzhen wan did not fire on such insignificant transgressors they were unimportant and who knew what families beyond the new territories on the mainland might benefit it could be one of their own the sweet herbs from the hills still brought full stomachs perhaps filling one of their own who cared let them come let them go the small craft with its canvas cover enveloping both sides of the forward cockpit cut its speed and cautiously zigzagged through the scattered flotilla of junks and sampans returning to their crowded berths in aberdeen one after another the boat people shrieked angry curses at the intruder at its impudent engine and its more impudent wake then each became strangely silent as the rude interloper passed something under the canvas quieted their sudden bursts of fury the boat raced into the harbours corridor a dark watery path now bordered by the blazing lights of the island of hong kong on the right kowloon on the left three minutes later the outboard motor sank into its lowest register as the hull swerved slowly past two filthy barges docked at the godown and slid into an empty space on the west side of the tsim sha tsui kowloons crowded dollarconscious waterfront the strident hordes of merchants setting up their nightly tourist traps on the wharf paid no attention it was merely one more jigi coming in from the catch who cared then like the boat people out in the channel the stalls on the waterfront nearest the insignificant intruder began to quiet down excited voices were silenced amid screeching commands and countercommands as eyes were drawn to a figure climbing up the black oilsoaked ladder to the pier he was a holy man his shrouded figure was draped in a pure white caftan that accentuated his tall slender body very tall for a zhongguo ren nearly six feet in height perhaps little could be seen of his face however as the cloth was loose and the breezes kept pressing the white fabric across his dark features drawing out the whiteness of his eyes determined eyes zealous eyes this was no ordinary priest anyone could see that he was a heshang a chosen one selected by elders steeped in wisdom who could perceive the inner spiritual knowledge of a young monk destined for higher things and it did not hurt that such a monk was tall and slender and had eyes of fire such holy men drew attention to themselves to their personages to their eyes and generous contributions followed both in fear and in awe mostly fear perhaps this heshang came from one of the mystic sects that wandered through the hills and forests of the guangze or from a religious brotherhood in the mountains of faroff qing gaoyuan descendants it was said of a people in the distant himalayas they were always quite ostentatious and generally to be feared the most for few understood their obscure teachings teachings that were couched in gentleness but with subtle hints of indescribable agony should their lessons go unheeded there was too much agony on the land and the water who needed more so give to the spirits to the eyes of fire perhaps it would be recorded somewhere the whiterobed figure walked slowly through the parting crowds on the wharf past the congested star ferry pier and disappeared into the growing pandemonium of the tsim sha tsui the moment had passed the stalls returned to their hysteria the priest headed east on salisbury road until he reached the peninsula hotel whose subdued elegance was losing the battle with its surroundings he then turned north into nathan road to the base of the glittering golden mile that strip of strips where opposing multitudes shrieked for attention both natives and tourists alike took notice of the stately holy man as he passed crowded shop fronts and alleys bulging with merchandise threestory discos and topless cafes where huge amateurish billboards hawked oriental charms above stalls offering the steamed delicacies of the noonday dim sum he walked for nearly ten minutes through the garish carnival now and then acknowledging glances with a slight bow of his head and twice shaking it while issuing commands to the same short muscular zhongguo ren who alternately followed him then passed him with quick dancelike steps turning to search the intense eyes for a sign the sign came two abrupt nods as the priest turned and walked through the beaded entrance of a raucous cabaret the zhongguo ren remained outside his hand unobtrusively under his loose tunic his own eyes darting about the crazy street a thoroughfare he could not understand it was insane such outrageousness but he was the tudi he would protect the holy man with his life no matter the assault on his own sensibilities inside the cabaret the heavy layers of smoke were slashed by roving coloured lights most whirling in circles and directed towards a platform stage where a rock group ululated in deafening frenzy a frantic admixture of punk and far east shiny black tightfitting illfitting trousers quivered maniacally on spindly legs below black leather jackets over soiled white silk shirts open to the waist while each head was shaved around its skull at the temple line each face grotesque heavily made up to accentuate its essentially passive oriental character and as if to emphasize the conflict between east and west the jarring music would occasionally startlingly come to a stop as the plaintive strains of a simple chinese melody emerged from a single instrument while the figures remained rigid under the swirling bombardment of the spotlights the priest stood still for a moment surveying the huge crowded room a number of customers in varying stages of drunkenness looked up at him from the tables several rolled coins in his direction as they turned away while a few got out of their chairs dropping hong kong dollars beside their drinks and headed for the door the heshang was having an effect but not the effect desired by the obese tuxedoed man who approached him may i be of assistance holy one asked the cabarets manager through the sustained crescendos the priest leaned forward and spoke into the mans ear the managers eyes widened then he bowed and gestured towards a small table by the wall the priest nodded back in appreciation and walked behind the man to his chair as adjacent customers took uncomfortable notice the manager leaned down and spoke with a reverence he did not feel would you care for refreshment holy one goats milk if it is by chance available if not plain water will be more than sufficient and i thank you it is the privilege of the establishment said the tuxedoed man bowing and moving away trying to place a dialect he could not recognize it did not matter this tall whiterobed priest had business with the laoban and that was all that mattered he had actually used the laobans name a name seldom spoken in the golden mile and on this particular evening the powerful taipan was on the premises in a room he would not publicly acknowledge knowing but it was not the province of the manager to tell the laoban that the priest had arrived the berobed one had made that clear all was privacy this night he had insisted when the august taipan wished to see him a man would come out to find him so be it it was the way of the secretive laoban one of the wealthiest and most illustrious taipans in hong kong send a kitchen boy down the street for some fuckfuck mother goats milk said the manager harshly to a head boy on the floor and tell him to be damndamn quick the existence of his stinking offspring will depend upon it the holy man sat passively at the table his zealous eyes now gentler observing the foolish activity apparently neither condemning nor accepting but merely taking it all in with the compassion of a father watching errant yet precious children abruptly through the whirling lights there was an intrusion several tables away a bright campers match was struck and quickly extinguished then another and finally a third this last held under a long black cigarette the brief series of flashes drew the attention of the priest he moved his shrouded head slowly towards the flame and the lone unshaven coarsely dressed chinese drawing in the smoke their eyes met the holy mans nod was almost imperceptible barely a motion and was acknowledged by an equally obscure movement as the match went out seconds later the crudely dressed smokers table was suddenly in flames fire shot up from the surface spreading quickly to all the articles of paper on the surface napkins menus dim sum baskets isolated eruptions of potential disaster the disheveled chinese screamed and with a shattering crash overturned the table as waiters raced shrieking towards the flames customers on all sides leaped from their chairs as the fire on the floor narrow strands of pulsing blue flame inexplicably spread in rivulets around excited stamping feet the pandemonium grew as people rapidly slapped out the small fires with tablecloths and aprons the manager and his head boys gestured wildly shouting that all was under control the danger had passed the rock group played with even greater intensity attempting to draw the crowd back into its frenzied orbit and away from the area of diminishing panic suddenly there was a greater disturbance a more violent eruption two head boys had collided with the shabbily dressed zhongguo ren whose carelessness and outsized matches had caused the conflagration he responded with rapid wing chun chops rigid hands crashing into shoulder blades and throats as his feet hammered up into abdomens sending the two shiji reeling back into the surrounding customers the physical abuse compounded the panic the chaos the heavyset manager now roaring intervened and he too fell away stunned by a wellplaced kick to his ribcage the unshaven zhongguo ren then picked up a chair and hurled it into screaming figures near the fallen man as three other waiters rushed into the melee in defense of their zongguan men and women who only seconds ago were merely screaming now began thrashing their arms about pummeling anyone and everyone near by the rock group gyrated to its outer limits frantic dissonance worthy of the scene the riot had taken hold and the burly peasant glanced across the room at the single table next to the wall the priest was gone the zhongguo ren picked up a second chair and smashed it down across a nearby table splintering the wooden frame and swinging a broken leg into the crowd only moments to go but those moments were everything the priest stepped through the door far back in the wall near the entrance of the cabaret he closed it quickly adjusting his eyes to the dim light of the long narrow hallway his right arm was stiff beneath the folds of his white caftan his left diagonally across his waist also under the sheer white fabric down the corridor no more than twentyfive feet away a startled man sprang from the wall his right hand plunging beneath his jacket to yank a large heavycaliber revolver from an unseen shoulder holster the holy man nodded slowly impassively repeatedly as he moved forward with graceful steps appropriate to a religious procession amitafo amitafo he said softly over and over again as he approached the man everything is peaceful all is in peace the spirits will it jou matyeh the guard was beside a door he shoved the ugly weapon forward and continued in a guttural cantonese bred in the northern settlements are you lost priest what are you doing here get out this is no place for you amitafo amitafo get out now the guard had no chance swiftly the priest pulled a razorthin doubleedged knife from the folds at his waist he slashed the mans wrist half severing the hand with the gun from the guards arm then arced the blade surgically across the mans throat air and blood erupted as the head snapped back in a mass of shining red he fell to the floor a corpse without hesitation the killerpriest slid the knife into the cloth of his caftan where it held and from under the right side of his robe withdrew a thinframed uzi machine gun its curved magazine holding more ammunition than he would need he raised his foot and crashed it into the door with the strength of a mountain cat racing inside to find what he knew he would find five men zhongguo ren were sitting around a table with pots of tea and short glasses of potent whisky there were no written papers anywhere in sight no notes or memoranda only ears and watchful eyes and as each pair of eyes looked up in shock the faces were contorted with panic two welldressed negotiators plunged their hands inside their welltailored jackets while they spun out of the chairs another lunged under the table as the remaining two sprang up screaming and raced futilely into silkcovered walls spinning around in desperation seeking pardons yet knowing none would be forthcoming a shattering fusillade of bullets ripped into the zhongguo ren blood gushed from fatal wounds as skulls were pierced and eyes were punctured mouths torn apart bright red in muted screams of death the walls and the floor and the polished table glistened sickeningly with the bloody evidence of death everywhere it was over the killer surveyed his work satisfied he knelt down by a large stagnant pool of blood and moved his index finger through it he then pulled out a square of dark cloth from his left sleeve and spread it over his handiwork he rose to his feet and rushed out of the room unbuttoning the white caftan as he ran down the dim hallway the robe was open by the time he reached the door to the cabaret he removed the razorlike knife from the cloth and shoved it into a scabbard on his belt then holding the folds of cloth together his hood in place the lethal weapon secure at his side he pulled the door back and walked inside into the brawling chaos that showed no sign of lessening but then why should it he had left it barely thirty seconds ago and his man was well trained faai di the shout came from the burly unshaven peasant from canton he was ten feet away overturning another table and striking a match dropping it on the floor the police will be here any moment the bartender just reached a phone i saw him the killerpriest ripped the caftan away from his body and the hood from his head in the wild revolving lights his face looked as macabre as any in the frenzied rock group heavy makeup outlined his eyes white lines defining the shape of each and his face was an unnatural brown go in front of me he commanded the peasant he dropped his costume and the uzi on the floor next to the door while removing a pair of thin surgical gloves he shoved them into his flannel trousers for a cabaret in the golden mile to summon the police was not a decision easily arrived at there were heavy fines for poor management stiff penalties for endangering tourists the police knew these risks and responded quickly when they were taken the killer ran behind the peasant from canton who joined the panicked crowd at the entrance screaming to get out the coarsely dressed brawler was a bull bodies in front of him fell away under the force of his blows guard and killer burst through the door and into the street where another crowd had gathered shrieking questions and epithets and cries of bad joss misfortune for the establishment they threaded their way through the excited onlookers and were joined by the short muscular chinese who had waited outside he grabbed the arm of his defrocked charge and pulled him into the narrowest of alleys where he took two towels from under his tunic one was soft and dry the other encased in plastic it was warm and wet and perfumed the assassin gripped the wet towel and began rubbing it over his face sinking it around and into the sockets of his eyes and across the exposed flesh of his neck he reversed the cloth and repeated the process with even greater pressure scrubbing his temples and his hairline until his white skin was apparent he then dried himself with the second towel smoothed his dark hair and straightened the regimental tie that fell on the creamcoloured shirt under his dark blue blazer jau he ordered his two companions they ran and disappeared in the crowds and a lone welldressed occidental walked out into the strip of oriental pleasures inside the cabaret the excited manager was berating the bartender who had called the jing cha the fines would be on his fuckfuck head for the riot had inexplicably subsided leaving the customers bewildered head boys and waiters were mollifying the patrons patting shoulders and clearing away the debris while straightening tables and producing new chairs and dispensing free glasses of whisky the rock group concentrated on the current favorites and as swiftly as the order of the evening had been disrupted it was restored with luck thought the tuxedoed manager the explanation that an impetuous bartender had mistaken a belligerent drunk for something far more serious would be acceptable to the police suddenly all thoughts of fines and official harassment were swept away as his eyes were drawn to a clump of white fabric on the floor across the room in front of the door to the inner offices white cloth pure white the priest the door the laoban the conference his breath short his face drenched with sweat the obese manager raced between the tables to the discarded caftan he knelt down his eyes wide his breathing now suspended as he saw the dark barrel of a strange weapon protruding from beneath the folds of white and what made him choke on his barely formed terror was the sight of tiny specks and thin streaks of shiny undried blood soiling the cloth go hai matyeh the question was asked by a second man in a tuxedo but without the status conferred by a cummerbund in truth the managers brother and first assistant oh damn the christian jesus he swore under his breath as his brother gathered up the oddlooking gun in the spotted white caftan come ordered the manager getting to his feet and heading for the door the police objected the brother one of us should speak to them calm them do what we can it may be that we can do nothing but give them our heads quickly inside the dimly lit corridor the proof was there the slain guard lay in a river of his own blood his weapon gripped by a hand barely attached to his wrist within the conference room itself the proof was complete five bloodied corpses were in spastic disarray one specifically shockingly the focus of the managers horrified interest he approached the body and the punctured skull with his handkerchief he wiped away the blood and stared at the face we are dead he whispered kowloon is dead hong kong dead all is dead what this man is the vicepremier of the peoples republic successor to the chairman himself here look the first assistant brother lunged towards the body of the dead laoban alongside the riddled bleeding corpse was a black bandanna it was lying flat the fabric with the curlicues of white discoloured by blotches of red the brother picked it up and gasped at the writing in the circle of blood underneath jason bourne the manager sprang across the floor great christian jesus he cried his whole body trembling hes come back the assassin has come back to asia jason bourne hes come back the sun fell behind the sangre de cristo mountains in central colorado as the cobra helicopter roared out of the blazing light a giant fluttering silhouette and stuttered its way downward towards the threshold on the edge of the timberline the concrete landing pad was several hundred feet from a large rectangular house of heavy wood and thick beveled glass aside from generators and camouflaged communications disks no other structures were in sight tall trees formed a dense wall concealing the house from all outsiders the pilots of these highly maneuverable aircraft were recruited from the senior officer corps of the cheyenne complex in colorado springs none was lower than a full colonel and each had been cleared by the national security council in washington they never spoke about their trips to the mountain retreat the destination was always obscured on flight plans headings were issued by radio when the choppers were airborne the location was not on any public map and its communications were beyond the scrutiny of allies and enemies alike the security was total it had to be this was a place for strategists whose work was so sensitive and frequently entailed such delicate global implications that the planners could not be seen together outside government buildings or in the buildings themselves and certainly never inside adjacent offices known to have connecting doors there were hostile inquisitive eyes everywhere allies and enemies alike who knew of the work these men did and if they were observed together alarms would surely go out the enemy was vigilant and allies jealously guarded their own intelligence fiefdoms the doors of the cobra opened a frame of steel steps snapped to the ground as an obviously bewildered man climbed down into the floodlights he was escorted by a major general in uniform the civilian was slender middleaged and of medium height and dressed in a pinstripe suit white shirt and paisley tie even under the harsh decelerating wash of the rotor blades his careful grooming remained intact as though it were important to him and not to be abused he followed the officer and together they walked up a concrete path to a door at the side of the house which opened as both men approached however only the civilian went inside the general nodded giving one of those informal salutes veteran soldiers reserve for the nonmilitary and officers of their own rank nice to have met you mr mcallister said the general someone else will take you back youre not coming in asked the civilian ive never been in replied the officer smiling i just make sure its you and get you from point b to point c sounds like a waste of rank general it probably isnt observed the soldier without further comment but then i have other duties goodbye mcallister walked inside into a long paneled corridor his escort now a pleasantfaced welldressed husky man who had all the outward signs of internal security about him physically quick and capable and anonymous in a crowd did you have a pleasant flight sir asked the younger man does anybody in one of those things the guard laughed this way sir they went down the corridor passing several doors along both walls until they reached the end where there was a pair of larger double doors with two red lights in the upper left and right corners they were cameras on separate circuits edward mcallister had not seen devices like those since he left hong kong two years ago and then only because he had been briefly assigned to british intelligence mi special branch for consultations to him the british had seemed paranoid where security was concerned he had never understood those people especially after they awarded him a citation for doing minimal work for them in affairs they should have been able to cope with themselves the guard rapped on the door there was a quiet click and he opened the right panel your other guest sir said the husky man thank you so very much replied a voice the astonished mcallister instantly recognized it from scores of radio and television newscasts over the years its inflections learned in an expensive prep school and several prestigious universities with a postgraduate career in the british isles there was however no time to adjust the greyhaired impeccably dressed man with a lined elongated face that bespoke his seventyplus years got up from a large desk and walked gingerly across the room his hand extended mr undersecretary how good of you to come may i introduce myself im raymond havilland im certainly aware of who you are mr ambassador its a privilege sir ambassador without portfolio mcallister which means theres very little privilege left but theres still work i cant imagine any president of the united states within the past twenty years surviving without you some muddled through mr undersecretary but with your experience at state i suspect you know that better than i do the diplomat turned his head id like you to meet john reilly jacks one of those highly knowledgeable associates were never supposed to know about over at the national security council hes not so terrifying is he i hope not said mcallister crossing to shake hands with reilly who had got up from one of the two leather chairs facing the desk nice to meet you mr reilly mr undersecretary said the somewhat obese man with red hair that matched a freckled forehead the eyes behind the steelrimmed glasses did not convey geniality they were sharp and cold mr reilly is here continued havilland crossing behind the desk and indicating the vacant chair on the right for mcallister to make sure i stay in line as i understand it that means there are some things i can say others i cant and certain things that only he can say the ambassador sat down if that appears enigmatic to you mr undersecretary im afraid its all i can offer at this juncture everything thats happened during the past five hours since i was ordered to andrewsair force base has been an enigma ambassador havilland i have no idea why i was brought here then let me tell you in general terms said the diplomat glancing at reilly and leaning forward on the desk you are in a position to be of extraordinary service to your country and to interests far beyond this country exceeding anything you may have considered during your long and distinguished career mcallister studied the ambassadors austere face uncertain how to reply my career at the department of state has been fulfilling and i trust professional but it can hardly be called distinguished in the broadest sense quite frankly the opportunities never presented themselves one has presented itself to you now interrupted havilland and you are uniquely qualified to carry it out in what way why the far east said the diplomat with an odd inflection in his voice as though the reply might itself be a question youve been with the state department for over twenty years since you received your doctorate in far eastern studies at harvard youve served your government commendably with many years of outstanding foreign service in asia and since your return from your last post your judgements have proved to be extremely valuable in formulating policy in that troubled part of the world youre considered a brilliant analyst i appreciate what you say but there were others in asia many others who attained equal or higher ratings accidents of events and posting mr undersecretary lets be frank youve done well besides no one compares with you as a specialist in the internal affairs of the peoples republic of china i believe you played a pivotal role in the trade conferences between washington and peking also none of the others spent seven years in hong kong here raymond havilland paused then added finally no one else in our asian posts was ever assigned to or accepted by the british governments mi special branch in the territory i see said mcallister recognizing that the last qualification which seemed the least important to him had a certain significance for the diplomat my work in intelligence was minimal mr ambassador the special branchs acceptance of me was based more on its own disinformation i think is the word than any unique talent of mine those people simply believed the wrong set of facts and the sums didnt total it didnt take long to find the correct figures as i remember they put it they trusted you mcallister they still trust you i assume that trust is intrinsic to this opportunity whatever it is very much so its vital then may i hear what the opportunity is you may havilland looked over at the third participant the man from the national security council if you care to he added my turn said reilly not unpleasantly he shifted his heavy torso in the chair and gazed at mcallister with eyes still rigid but without the coldness they had displayed previously as though he was now asking for understanding at the moment our voices are being taped its your constitutional right to know that but its a twosided right you must swear to absolute secrecy concerning the information imparted to you here not only in the interests of national security but in the further and conceivably greater interests of specific world conditions i know that sounds like a comeon to whet your appetite but its not meant to be were deadly serious will you agree to the condition you can be prosecuted in a closed trial under the national security nondisclosure statutes if you violate the oath how can i agree to a condition like that when i have no idea what the information is because i can give you a quick overview and itll be enough for you to say yes or no if its no youll be escorted out of here and flown back to washington no one will be the loser go ahead all right reilly spoke calmly youll be discussing certain events that took place in the past not ancient history but not current by any means the actions themselves were disavowed buried to be more accurate does that sound familiar mr undersecretary im from the state department we bury the past when it serves no purpose to reveal it circumstances change judgements made in good faith yesterday are often a problem tomorrow we cant control these changes any more than the soviets or the chinese can well put said havilland not yet it isnt objected reilly raising a palm to the ambassador the undersecretary is evidently an experienced diplomat he didnt say yes and he didnt say no the man from the nsc again looked at mcallister the eyes behind the steelrimmed glasses were once again sharp and cold what is it mr undersecretary you want to sign on or do you want to leave one part of me wants to get up and leave as quickly as i can said mcallister looking alternately at both men the other part says stay he paused his gaze settling on reilly and added whether you intended it or not my appetite is whetted its a hell of a price to pay for being hungry replied the irishman its more than that the undersecretary of state spoke softly im a professional and if i am the man you want i really dont have a choice im afraid ill have to hear the words said reilly do you want me to repeat them it wont be necessary mcallister frowned in thought then spoke i edward newington mcallister fully understand that whatever is said during this conference he stopped and looked at reilly i assume youll fill in the particulars such as time and location and those present date place hour and minute of entry and identifications its all been done and logged thank you ill want a copy before i leave of course without raising his voice reilly looked straight ahead and quietly issued an order please note have a copy of this tape available for the subject upon his departure also equipment for him to verify its contents on the premises ill initial the copy go ahead mr mcallister i appreciate that with regard to whatever is said at this conference i accept the condition of nondisclosure i will speak to no one about any aspect of the discussion unless instructed to do so personally by ambassador havilland i further understand that i may be prosecuted at a closed trial should i violate this agreement however should such a trial ever take place i reserve the right to confront my accusers not their affidavits or depositions i add this for i cannot conceive of any circumstances where i would or could violate the oath ive just taken there are circumstances you know said reilly gently not in my book extreme physical abuse chemicals being tricked by men and women far more experienced than you there are ways mr undersecretary i repeat should a case ever be brought against me and such things have happened to others i reserve the right to face any and all accusers thats good enough for us again reilly looked straight ahead and spoke terminate this tape and pull the plugs confirm confirmed said a voice eerily from a speaker somewhere overhead you are now out proceed mr ambassador said the redhaired man ill interrupt only when i feel its necessary im sure you will jack havilland turned to mcallister i take back my previous statement he really is a terror after fortyodd years of service im told by a redheaded whippersnapper who should go on a diet when to shut up the three men smiled the aging diplomat knew the moment and the method to reduce tension reilly shook his head and genially extended his hands i would never do that sir certainly i hope not so obviously what say mcallister lets defect to moscow and say he was the recruiter the russkies would probably give us both dachas and hed be in leavenworth youd get the dacha mr ambassador id share a flat with twelve siberians no thank you sir hes not interrupting me very good im surprised none of those wellintentioned meddlers in the oval office ever tapped you for his staff or at least sent you to the un they didnt know i existed that status will change said havilland abruptly serious he paused staring at the undersecretary then lowered his voice have you ever heard the name jason bourne how could anyone posted in asia not have heard it answered mcallister perplexed thirtyfive to forty murders the assassinforhire who eluded every trap ever set for him a pathological killer whose only morality was the price of the kill they say he was an american is an american i dont know he faded from sight and that he was a defrocked priest and an importer whod stolen millions and a deserter from the french foreign legion and god knows how many other stories the only thing i do know is that he was never caught and our failure to catch him was a burden on our diplomacy throughout the far east was there any pattern to his victims none they were random across the board two bankers here three attaches there meaning ci a a minister of state from delhi an industrialist from singapore and numerous far too numerous politicians generally decent men their cars were bombed in the streets their flats blown up then there were unfaithful husbands and wives and lovers of various persuasions in various scandals he offered final solutions for bruised egos there was no one he wouldnt kill no method too brutal or demeaning for him no there wasnt a pattern just money the highest bidder he was a monster is a monster if hes still alive once more havilland leaned forward his eyes steady on the undersecretary of state you say he faded from sight just like that you never picked up anything any rumors or backstairs gossip from our asian embassies or consulates there was talk yes but none of it was ever confirmed the story i heard most often came from the macao police where bourne was last known to be they said he wasnt dead or retired but instead had gone to europe looking for wealthier clients if its true it might be only half the story the police also claimed informants told them that several contracts had gone sour for bourne that in one instance he killed the wrong man a leading figure in the malaysian underworld and in another it was said he raped a clients wife perhaps the circle was closing in on him and perhaps not what do you mean most of us bought the first half of the story not the second bourne wouldnt kill the wrong man especially someone like that he didnt make those kinds of mistakes and if he raped a clients wife which is doubtful he would have done so out of hatred or revenge he would have forced a bound husband to watch and then killed them both no most of us subscribed to the first story he went to europe where there were bigger fish to fry and murder you were meant to accept that version said havilland leaning back in his chair i beg your pardon the only man jason bourne ever killed in postvietnam asia was an enraged conduit who tried to kill him stunned mcallister stared at the diplomat i dont understand the jason bourne youve just described never existed he was a myth you cant be serious never more so those were turbulent times in the far east the drug networks operating out of the golden triangle were fighting a disorganized unpublicized war consuls vice consuls police politicians criminal gangs border patrols the highest and the lowest social orders all were affected money in unimaginable amounts was the mothers milk of corruption whenever and wherever a wellpublicized killing took place regardless of the circumstances or those accused bourne was on the scene and took credit for the kill he was the killer insisted a confused mcallister there were the signs his signs everyone knew it everyone assumed it mr undersecretary a mocking telephone call to the police a small article of clothing sent in the mail a black bandanna found in the bushes a day later they were all part of the strategy the strategy what are you talking about jason bourne the original jason bourne was a convicted murderer a fugitive whose life ended with a bullet in his head in a place called tarn quan during the last months of the vietnam war it was a jungle execution the man was a traitor his corpse was left to rot he simply disappeared several years later the man who executed him took on his identity for one of our projects a project that nearly succeeded should have succeeded but went off the wire off the what out of control that man that very brave man who went underground for us using the name jason bourne for three years was injured and the result of those injuries was amnesia he lost his memory he neither knew who he was nor who he was meant to be good lord he was between a rock and a hard place with the help of an alcoholic doctor on a mediterranean island he tried to trace his life his identity and here im afraid he failed he failed but the woman who befriended him did not fail shes now his wife her instincts were accurate she knew he wasnt a killer she purposely forced him to examine his words his abilities ultimately to make the contacts that would lead him back to us but we with the most sophisticated intelligence apparatus in the world did not listen to the human quotient we set a trap to kill him i must interrupt mr ambassador said reilly why asked havilland its what we did and were not on tape an individual made the determination not the united states government that should be clear sir all right agreed the diplomat nodding his name was conklin but its irrelevant jack government personnel went along it happened government personnel were also instrumental in saving his life somewhat after the fact muttered havilland but why asked mcallister he now leaned forward mesmerized by the bizarre story he was one of us why would anyone want to kill him his loss of memory was taken for something else it was erroneously believed that he had turned that he had killed three of his controls and disappeared with a great deal of money government funds totalling over five million dollars five million astonished the undersecretary slowly sank back into the chair funds of that magnitude were available to him personally yes said the ambassador they too were part of the strategy part of the project i assume this is where silence is necessary the project i mean its imperative answered reilly not because of the project in spite of what happened we make no apology for that operation but because of the man we recruited to become jason bourne and where he came from thats cryptic itll become clear the project please reilly looked at raymond havilland the diplomat nodded and spoke we created a killer to draw out and trap the most deadly assassin in europe carlos youre quick mr undersecretary who else was there in asia bourne and the jackal were constantly being compared those comparisons were encouraged said havilland often magnified and spread by the strategists of the project a group known as treadstone seventyone the name was derived from a sterile house on new yorks seventyfirst street where the resurrected jason bourne was trained it was the command post and a name you should be aware of i see said mcallister pensively then those comparisons growing as they did with bournes reputation served as a challenge to carlos thats when bourne moved to europe to bring the challenge directly to the jackal to force him to come out and confront his challenger very quick mr undersecretary in a nutshell that was the strategy its extraordinary brilliant actually and one doesnt have to be an expert to see that god knows im not you may become one and you say this man who became bourne the mythical assassin spent three years playing the role and then was injured shot interrupted havilland membranes in his skull were blown away and he lost his memory totally my god yet despite everything that happened to him and with the womans help she was an economist for the canadian government incidentally he came within moments of pulling the whole damn thing off a remarkable story isnt it its incredible but what kind of man would do this could do it the redheaded john reilly coughed softly the ambassador deferred with a glance were now reaching ground zero the big man said again shifting his bulk to look at mcallister if youve any doubts i can still let you go i try not to repeat myself you have your tape its your appetite i suppose thats another way you people have of saying there might not even be a trial id never say that mcallister swallowed his eyes meeting the calm gaze of the man from the nsc he turned to havilland please go on mr ambassador who is this man where did he come from his name is david webb hes currently an associate professor of oriental studies at a small university in maine and married to the canadian woman who literally guided him out of his labyrinth without her he would have been killed but then without him she would have ended up a corpse in zurich remarkable said mcallister barely audible the point is shes his second wife his first marriage ended in a tragic act of wanton slaughter thats when his story began for us a number of years ago webb was a young foreign service officer stationed in phnom penh a brilliant far east scholar fluent in several oriental languages and married to a girl from thailand hed met in graduate school they lived in a house on a riverbank and had two children it was an ideal life for such a man it combined the expertise washington needed in the area with the opportunity to live in his own museum then the vietnam action escalated and one morning a lone jet fighter no one really knows from which side but no one ever told webb that swooped down at low altitude and strafed his wife and children while they were playing in the water their bodies were riddled they floated into the riverbank as webb was trying to reach them he gathered them in his arms screaming helplessly at the disappearing plane above how horrible whispered mcallister at that moment webb turned he became someone he never was never dreamed he could be he became a guerrilla fighter known as delta delta said mr mcallister a guerrilla im afraid i dont understand theres no way you could havilland looked over at reilly then back at the man from state as jack made clear a moment ago were now at ground zero webb fled to saigon consumed with rage and ironically through the efforts of the cia officer named conklin who years later tried to kill him joined a clandestine operations outfit called medusa no names were ever used by the people in medusa just the greek letters of the alphabet webb became delta one medusa ive never heard of it ground zero said reilly the medusa file is still classified but weve permitted limited declassification in this instance the medusa units were a collection of internationals who knew the vietnam territories north and south frankly most of them were criminals smugglers of narcotics gold guns jewels all kinds of contraband also convicted murderers fugitives whod been sentenced to death in absentia and a smattering of colonials whose businesses were confiscated again by both sides they banked on us big uncle to take care of all their problems if they infiltrated hostile areas killing suspected viet cong collaborators and village chiefs thought to be leaning towards charlie as well as expediting prisonerofwar escapes where they could they were assassination teams death squads if you will and that says it as well as it can be said but of course well never say it mistakes were made millions stolen and the majority of those personnel wouldnt be allowed in any civilized army webb among them with his background his academic credentials he willingly became part of such a group he had an overpowering motive said havilland as far as he was concerned that plane in phnom penh was north vietnamese some said he was a madman continued reilly others claimed he was an extraordinary tactician the supreme guerrilla who understood the oriental mind and led the most aggressive teams in medusa feared as much by command saigon as by the enemy he was uncontrollable the only rules he followed were his own it was as if he had mounted his own personal hunt tracking down the man who had flown that plane and destroyed his life it became his war his rage the more violent it became the more satisfying it was for him or perhaps closer to his own death wish death the undersecretary of state left the word hanging it was the prevalent theory at the time interrupted the ambassador the war ended said reilly as disastrously for webb or delta as it did for the rest of us perhaps worse there was nothing left for him no more purpose nothing to strike out at to kill until we approached him and gave him a reason to go on living or perhaps a reason to go on trying to die by becoming bourne and going after carlos the jackal completed mcallister yes agreed the intelligence officer a brief silence ensued we need him back said havilland the softspoken words fell like an axe on hard wood carlos has surfaced the diplomat shook his head not europe we need him back in asia and we cant waste a minute someone else another target mcallister swallowed involuntarily have you spoken to him we cant approach him not directly why not he wouldnt let us through the door he doesnt trust anything or anyone out of washington and its difficult to fault him for that for days for weeks he cried out for help and we didnt listen instead we tried to kill him again i must object broke in reilly it wasnt us it was an individual operating on erroneous information and the government currently spends in excess of four hundred thousand dollars a year in a protection programme for webb which he scoffs at he believes its no more than a backup trap for carlos in the event the jackal unearths him hes convinced you dont give a damn about him and im not sure hes far off the mark he saw carlos and the fact that the face has not yet come back into focus for him isnt something carlos knows the jackal has every reason to go after webb and if he does youll have your second chance the chances of carlos finding him are so remote as to be practically nil the treadstone records are buried and in any case they dont contain current information as to where webb is or what he does come mr reilly said havilland testily look at his background and qualifications how difficult would it be hes got academia written all over him im not opposing you mr ambassador replied a somewhat subdued reilly i just want everything clear lets be frank webb has to be handled very delicately hes recovered a large portion of his memory but certainly not all of it however hes recalled enough about medusa to be a considerable threat to the countrys interests in what way asked mcallister perhaps it wasnt the best and it probably wasnt the worst but basically it was a military strategy in time of war a strategy that was unsanctioned unlogged and unacknowledged theres no official slate how is that possible it was funded and when funds are expended dont read me the book interrupted the obese intelligence officer were not on tape but ive got yours is that your answer no this is theres no statute of limitation on war crimes and murder mr undersecretary and murder and other violent crimes were committed against our own forces as well as allied personnel in the main they were committed by killers and thieves in the process of stealing looting raping and killing most of them were pathological criminals effective as medusa was in many ways it was a tragic mistake born of anger and frustration in a nowin situation what possible good would it do to open all the old wounds quite apart from the claims against us we would become a pariah in the eyes of much of the civilized world as i mentioned said mcallister softly reluctantly at state we dont believe in opening wounds he turned to the ambassador im beginning to understand you want me to reach this david webb and persuade him to return to asia for another project another target although ive never used the word in that context in my life before this evening and i assume its because there are distinct parallels in our early careers were asia men we presumably have insights where the far east is concerned and you think hell listen to me essentially yes yet you say he wont touch us thats where my understanding fades how can i do it well do it together as he once made the rules for himself well make them now its imperative because of a man you want killed neutralized will suffice it has to be done and webb can do it no jason bourne can we sent him out alone for three years under extraordinary stress suddenly his memory was taken from him and he was hunted like an animal still he retained the ability to infiltrate and kill im being blunt i understand that since were not on tape and on the chance that we still are the undersecretary glanced disapprovingly at reilly who shook his head and shrugged may i be permitted to know who the target is you may and i want you to commit this name to memory mr undersecretary hes a chinese minister of state sheng chou yang mcallister flushed angrily i dont have to commit it and i think you know that he was a fixture in the peoples republics economics group and we were both assigned to the trade conferences in peking in the late seventies i read up on him analyzed him sheng was my counterpart and i could do no less a fact i suspect you also know oh the greyhaired ambassador arched his dark eyebrows and dismissed the rebuke and what did your reading tell you what did you learn about him he was considered very bright very ambitious but then his rise in pekings hierarchy tells us that he was spotted by scouts sent out from the central committee some years ago at the fudan university in shanghai initially because he took to the english language so fluently and had a firm even sophisticated grasp of western economics what else he was considered promising material and after indepth indoctrination was sent to the london school of economics for graduate study it took how do you mean shengs an avowed marxist where the centralized state is concerned but he has a healthy respect for capitalistic profits i see said havilland then he accepts the failure of the soviet system hes ascribed that failure to the russian penchant for corruption and mindless conformity in the higher ranks and alcohol in the lower ones to his credit hes stamped out a fair share of those abuses in the industrial centres sounds like he was trained at ibm hes been responsible for many of the prcs new trade policies hes made china a lot of money again the undersecretary leaned forward in his chair his eyes intense his expression bewildered stunned was perhaps more accurate my god why would anyone in the west want sheng dead its absurd hes our economic ally a politically stabilizing factor in the largest nation on earth thats ideologically opposed to us through him and men like him weve reached accommodations without him whatever the course theres the risk of disaster im a professional china analyst mr ambassador and i repeat what you suggest is absurd a man of your accomplishments should recognize that before any of us the ageing diplomat looked hard at his accuser and when he spoke he did so slowly choosing his words carefully a few moments ago we were at ground zero a former foreign service officer named david webb became jason bourne for a purpose conversely sheng chou yang is not the man you know not the man you studied as your counterpart he became that man for a purpose what are you talking about shot back mcallister defensively everything ive said about him is on record records official most top secret and eyesonly evesonly the former ambassador asked wearily earsonly tongues only wagging as busily as tails wag tigers because an official stamp is placed on recorded observations and observed by men who have no idea where those records came from they are there and thats enough no mr undersecretary its not enough it never is you obviously have information i dont have said the state department man coldly if it is information and not disinformation the man i described the man i knew is sheng chou yang just as the david webb we described to you was jason bourne no please dont be angry im not playing games its important that you understand sheng is not the man you knew he never was then whom did i know who was the man at those conferences hes a traitor mr undersecretary sheng chou yang is a traitor to his country and when his treachery is exposed as it surely will be peking will hold the free world responsible the consequences of that inevitable error are unthinkable however theres no doubt as to his purpose sheng a traitor i dont believe you hes worshipped in peking one day hell be chairman then china will be ruled by a nationalist zealot whose ideological roots are in taiwan youre crazy youre absolutely crazy wait a minute you said he had a purpose no doubt as to his purpose you said he and his people intend to take over hong kong hes mounting a hidden economic blitzkrieg putting all trade all of the territorys financial institutions under the control of a neutral commission a clearing house approved by peking which means approved by him the instrument of record will be the british treaty that expires in his commission a supposedly reasonable prelude to annexation and control it will happen when the road is clear for sheng when there are no more obstacles in his path when his word is the only word that counts in economic matters it could be in a month or two months or next week you think peking has agreed to this protested mcallister youre wrong its its just crazy the peoples republic will never substantively touch hong kong it brokers sixty percent of its entire economy through the territory the china accords guarantee fifty years of a free economic zone status and sheng is a signator the most vital one but sheng is not sheng not as you know him then who the hell is he prepare yourself mr undersecretary sheng chou yang is the first son of a shanghai industrialist who made his fortune in the corrupt world of the old china chiang kaisheks kuomintang when it was obvious that maos revolution would succeed the family fled as so many of the landlords and warlords did with whatever they could transfer the old man is now one of the most powerful taipans in hong kong but which one we dont know the colony will become his and the familys mandate courtesy of a minister in peking his most treasured son its the ultimate irony the patriarchs final vengeance hong kong will be controlled by the very men who corrupted nationalist china for years they bled their country without conscience profiting from the labours of a starving disenfranchized people paving the way for maos revolution and if that sounds like communist bilge im afraid for the most part its embarrassingly accurate now a handful of zealots boardroom thugs led by a maniac want back what no international court in history would ever grant them havilland paused then spat out the single word maniacs but if you dont know who this taipan is how do you know its true any of it the sources are maximumclassified interrupted reilly but theyve been confirmed the story was first picked up in taiwan our original informer was a member of the nationalist cabinet who thought it a disastrous course that could only lead to a bloodbath for the entire far east he pleaded with us to stop it he was found dead the next morning three bullets in his head and his throat cut in chinese that means a traitor since then five other people have been murdered their bodies similarly mutilated its true the conspiracy is alive and well and coming from hong kong its insane more to the point said havilland it will never work if it had a prayer we might look the other way and even say godspeed but it cant itll blow apart as lin biaos conspiracy against mao zedong blew apart in seventytwo and when it does peking will blame american and taiwanese money in complicity with the british as well as the silent acquiescence of the worlds leading financial institutions eight years of economic progress will be shot to hell because a group of fanatics want vengeance in your words mr undersecretary the peoples republic is a suspicious turbulent nation and if i may add a few of my own from those accomplishments you ascribe to me a government quick to become paranoid obsessed with betrayal both from within and without china will believe that the world is out to isolate her economically choke her off from world markets and bring her to her knees while the russians grin across the northern borders she will strike fast and furiously impound everything absorb everything her troops will occupy kowloon the island and all of the burgeoning new territories investments in the trillions will be lost without the colonys expertise trade will be stymied a labour force of millions will be in chaos hunger and disease will be rampant the far east will be in flames and the result could touch off a war none of us wants to think about jesus christ mcallister whispered it cant happen no it cant agreed the diplomat but why webb not webb corrected havilland jason bourne all right why bourne because word out of kowloon is that hes already there what and we know hes not what did you say hes struck hes killed hes back in asia webb no bourne the myth youre not making one goddamned bit of sense i can assure you sheng chou yang is making a lot of sense how hes brought him back jason bournes skills are once more for hire and as always his client is beyond unearthing in the present case the most unlikely client imaginable a leading spokesman for the peoples republic who must eliminate his opposition both in hong kong and in peking during the past six months a number of powerful voices in pekings central committee have been strangely silent according to official government announcements several died and considering their ages its understandable two others were supposedly killed in accidents one in a plane crash one by of all things a cerebral hemorrhage while hiking in the shaoguan mountains if its not true at least its imaginative then another was removed a euphemism for disgrace lastly and most extraordinary the prcs vicepremier was murdered in kowloon when no one in peking knew he was there it was a gruesome episode five men massacred in the tsim sha tsui with the killer leaving his calling card the name jason bourne was etched in blood on the floor an impostors ego demanded that he be given credit for his kills mcallister blinked repeatedly his eyes darting aimlessly this is all so far beyond me he said helplessly then becoming the professional once again he looked steadily at havilland is there linkage he asked the diplomat nodded our intelligence reports are specific all of these men opposed shengs policies some openly some guardedly the vicepremier an old revolutionary and veteran of maos long march was especially vocal he couldnt stand the upstart sheng yet what was he doing secretly in kowloon in the company of bankers peking cant answer so face mercifully required that the killing never happened with his cremation he became a nonperson and with the killers calling card the name written in blood the second linkage is to sheng said the undersecretary of state his voice close to trembling as he nervously massaged his forehead why would he do it leave his name i mean hes in business and it was a spectacular kill now do you begin to understand im not sure what you mean for us this new bourne is our direct route to sheng chou yang hes our trap an impostor is posing as the myth but if the original myth tracks down and takes out the impostor hes in the position to reach sheng its really very simple the jason bourne we created will replace this new killer using his name once in place our jason bourne sends out an urgent alarm something drastic has happened that threatens shengs entire strategy and sheng has to respond he cant afford not to for his security must be absolute his hands clean hell be forced to show himself if only to kill his hired gun to remove any association when he does this time we wont fail its a circle said mcallister his words barely above a whisper as he stared at the diplomat and from everything youve told me webb wont walk near it much less into it then we must provide him with an overpowering reason to do so said havilland softly in my profession frankly it was always my profession we look for patterns patterns that will trigger a man frowning his eyes hollow and empty the ageing ambassador leaned back in his chair certainly he was not at peace with himself sometimes they are ugly realizations repugnant actually but one must weigh the greater good the greater benefits for everyone that doesnt tell me anything david webb became jason bourne for essentially one reason the same reason that propelled him into the medusa a wife was taken from him his children and the mother of his children were killed oh my god this is where i leave said reilly getting out of his chair marie oh christ marie it happened again a floodgate opened and i couldnt handle it i tried to my darling i tried so hard but i got totalled i got washed away and i was drowning i know what youll say if i tell you which is why i wont tell you even though i know youll see it in my eyes hear it in my voice somehow as only you know how youll say i should have come home to you should talk to you be with you and we could work it out together together my god how much can you take how unfair can i be how long can it go on this way i love you so much in so many ways that there are times i have to do it myself if only to let you off the goddamned hook for a while to let you breathe for a while without your nerves scraped to their roots while you take care of me but you see my love i can do it i did it tonight and im all right ive calmed down now im all right now and now ill come home to you better than i was i have to because without you there isnt anything left his face drenched with sweat his tracksuit clinging to his body david webb ran breathlessly across the cold grass of the dark field past the bleachers and up the cement path towards the university gym the autumn sun had disappeared behind the stone buildings of the campus its glow firing the early evening sky as it hovered over the distant maine woods the autumn chill was penetrating he shivered it was not what his doctors had had in mind regardless he had followed medical advice it had been one of those days the government doctors had told him that if there were times and there would be times when sudden disturbing images or fragments of memory broke into his mind the best way to handle them was with strenuous exercise his ecg charts indicated a healthy heart his lungs were decent though he was foolish enough to smoke and since his body could take the punishment it was the best way to relieve his mind what he needed during such times was equanimity whats wrong with a few drinks and cigarettes he had said to the doctors stating his genuine preference the heart beats faster the body doesnt suffer and the mind is certainly far more relieved theyre depressants had been the reply from the only man he listened to artificial stimulants that lead only to further depression and increased anxiety run or swim or make love to your wife or anybody else for that matter dont be a goddamned fool and come back here a basket case forget about you think of me i worked too hard on you you ingrate get out of here webb take up your life what you can remember of it and enjoy youve got it better than most people and dont you forget that or ill cancel our controlled monthly blowouts at the saloons of our choosing and you can go to hell and hell for you notwithstanding id miss them go david its time for you to go morris panov was the only person besides marie who could reach him it was ironic in a way for initially mo had not been one of the government doctors the psychiatrist had neither sought nor been offered security clearance to hear the classified details of david webbs background where the lie of jason bourne was buried nevertheless panov had forcefully inserted himself threatening all manner of embarrassing disclosures if he was not given clearance and a voice in the subsequent therapy his reasoning was simple for when david had come within moments of being blown off the face of the earth by misinformed men who were convinced he had to die that misinformation had been unwittingly furnished by panov and the way it had happened infuriated him he had been approached in panic by someone not given to panic and asked hypothetical questions pertaining to a possibly deranged deepcover agent in a potentially explosive situation his answers were restrained and equivocal he could not and would not give a diagnosis on a patient he had never seen but yes this was possible and that not unheard of but of course nothing could be considered remotely material without physical and psychiatric examination the key word was nothing he should have said nothing he later claimed for his words in the ears of amateurs had sealed the order for webbs execution jason bournes death sentence an act that was aborted only at the last instant through davids own doing while the squad of executioners were still in their unseen positions not only had morris panov come on board at the walter reed hospital and later at the virginia medical complex but he literally ran the show webbs show the son of a bitch has amnesia you goddamned fools hes been trying to tell you that for weeks in perfectly lucid english i suspect too lucid for your convoluted mentality they had worked together for months as patient and doctor and finally as friends it helped that marie adored mo good lord she needed an ally the burden david had been to his wife was beyond telling from those first days in switzerland when she began to understand the pain within the man who had taken her captive to the moment when she made the commitment violently against his wishes to help him never believing what he himself believed telling him over and over again that he was not the killer he thought he was not the assassin others called him her belief became an anchor in his own crashing seas her love the core of his emerging sanity without marie he was a loveless discarded dead man and without mo panov he was little more than a functioning vegetable but with both of them behind him he was brushing away the swirling clouds and finding the sun again which was why he had opted for an hour of running around the deserted cold track rather than heading home after his late afternoon seminar his weekly seminars often continued far beyond the hour when they were scheduled to end so marie never planned dinner knowing they would go out to eat their two unobtrusive guards somewhere in the darkness behind them as one was walking across the barelyvisible field behind him now the other no doubt inside the gym insanity or was it he had been driven to panovs strenuous exercise by an image that had suddenly appeared in his mind while grading papers in his office it was a face a face he knew and remembered and loved very much a boys face that aged in front of his inner screen coming to full portrait in uniform blurred imperfect but a part of him as silent tears rolled down his cheeks he knew it was the dead brother they had told him about the prisoner of war he had rescued in the jungles of tarn quan years ago amid shattering explosions and a traitor he had executed by the name of jason bourne he could not handle the violent fragmented pictures he had barely got through the shortened seminar pleading a severe headache he had to relieve the pressures accept or reject the peeling layers of memory with the help of reason which told him to go to the gym and run against the wind any strong wind he could not burden marie every time a floodgate burst he loved her too much for that when he could handle it himself he had to it was his contract with himself he opened the heavy door briefly wondering why every gymnasium entrance was designed with the weight of a portcullis he went inside and walked across the stone floor through an archway and down a whitewalled corridor until he reached the door of the faculty locker room he was thankful that the room was empty he was in no frame of mind to respond to small talk and if required to do so he would undoubtedly appear sullen if not strange he could also do without the stares he would probably provoke he was too close to the edge he had to pull back gradually slowly first within himself then with marie christ when would it all stop how much could he ask of her but then he never had to ask she gave without being asked webb reached the row of lockers his own was towards the end he was walking between the long wooden bench and the connecting metal cabinets when his eyes were suddenly riveted on an object up ahead he rushed forward a folded note had been taped to his locker he ripped it off and opened it your wife phoned she wants you to call her as soon as you can says its urgent ralph the gym custodian might have had the brains to go outside and shout to him thought david angrily as he spun the combination and opened the locker after rummaging through his limp trousers for change he ran to a pay telephone on the wall inserted a coin disturbed that his hand trembled then he knew why marie never used the word urgent she avoided such words hello what is it i thought you might be there said his wife mos panacea the one he guarantees will cure you if it doesnt give you cardiac arrest what is it david come home theres someone here you must see quickly darling undersecretary of state edward mcallister kept his own introduction to a minimum but by including certain facts let webb know he was not from the lower ranks of the department on the other hand he did not embellish his importance he was the secure bureaucrat confident that whatever expertise he possessed could weather changes in administrations if youd like mr webb our business can wait until you get into something more comfortable david was still in his sweatstained shorts and tshirt having grabbed his clothes from the locker and raced to his car from the gym i dont think so he said i dont think your business can wait not where you come from mr mcallister sit down david marie st jacques webb walked into the living room two towels in her hands you too mr mcallister she handed webb a towel as both men sat down facing each other in front of an unlit fireplace then moved behind her husband and began blotting his neck and shoulders with the second towel the light of a table lamp heightening the reddish tint of her auburn hair her lovely features in shadows her eyes on the man from the state department please go ahead she continued as weve agreed im cleared by the government for anything you might say was there a question asked david glancing up at her and then at the visitor making no attempt to disguise his hostility none whatsoever replied mcallister smiling wanly yet sincerely no one whos read of your wifes contribution would dare exclude her where others failed she succeeded that says it agreed webb without saying anything of course hey come on david loosen up sorry shes right webb tried to smile the attempt was not successful im prejudging and i shouldnt do that should i id say you have every right to said the undersecretary i know i would if i were you in spite of the fact that our backgrounds are very much alike i was posted in the far east for a number of years no one would have considered me for the assignment you undertook what you went through is light years beyond me beyond me too obviously not from where i stand the failure wasnt yours god knows now youre being kind no offence but too much kindness from where you stand makes me nervous then lets get to the business at hand all right please and i hope you havent prejudged me too harshly im not your enemy mr webb i want to be your friend i can press buttons that can help you protect you from what from something nobody ever expected lets hear it as of thirty minutes from now your security will be doubled said mcallister his eyes locked with davids thats my decision and ill quadruple it if i think its necessary every arrival on this campus will be scrutinized the grounds checked hourly the rotating guards will no longer be part of the scenery keeping you merely in sight but in effect will be very much in sight themselves very obvious and i hope threatening jesus webb sprang forward in the chair its carlos we dont think so said the man from state shaking his head we cant rule carlos out but its too remote too unlikely oh david nodded it must be if it was the jackal your men would be all over the place and out of sight youd let him come after me and take him and if im killed the cost is acceptable not to me you dont have to believe that but i mean it thank you but then what are we talking about your file was broken that is the treadstone file was invaded invaded unauthorized disclosure not at first there was authorization all right because there was a crisis and in a sense we had no choice then everything went off the wire and now were concerned for you back up please who got the file a man on the inside high inside his credentials were the best no one could question them who was he a british mi operating out of hong kong a man the cia has relied on for years he flew into washington and went directly to his primary liaison at the agency asking to be given everything there was on jason bourne he claimed there was a crisis in the territory that was a direct result of the treadstone project he also made it clear that if sensitive information was to be exchanged between british and american intelligence continue to be exchanged he thought it best that his request be granted forthwith he had to give a damn good reason he did mcallister paused nervously blinking his eyes and rubbing his forehead with extended fingers well jason bourne is back said mcallister quietly hes killed again in kowloon marie gasped she clutched her husbands right shoulder her large brown eyes angry frightened she stared in silence at the man from state webb did not move instead he studied mcallister as a man might watch a cobra what the hell are you talking about he whispered then raised his voice jason bourne that jason bourne doesnt exist anymore he never did you know that and we know that but in asia his legend is very much alive you created it mr webb brilliantly in my judgement im not interested in your judgement mr mcallister said david removing his wifes hand and getting out of the chair whats this mi agent working on how old is he whats his stability factor his record you must have run an uptodate trace on him of course we did and there was nothing irregular london confirmed his outstanding service record his current status as well as the information he brought us as chief of post for mi he was called in by the kowloonhong kong police because of the potentially explosive nature of events the foreign office itself stood behind him wrong shouted webb shaking his head then lowered his voice he was turned mr mcallister someone offered him a small fortune to get that file he used the only lie that would work and all of you swallowed it im afraid its not a lie not as he knew it he believed the evidence and london believes it a jason bourne is back in asia and what if i told you it wouldnt be the first time central control was fed a lie so an overworked over risked underpaid man can turn all the years all the dangers and nothing to show for it he decides on one opportunity that gives him an annuity for life in this case that file if that is the case it wont do him much good hes dead hes what he was shot to death two nights ago in kowloon in his office an hour after hed flown into hong kong goddamn it it doesnt happen cried david bewildered a man who turns backs himself up he builds a case against his benefactor before the act letting him know itll get to the right people if anything ugly happens its his insurance his only insurance he was clean insisted the state department man or stupid rejoined webb no one thinks that what do they think that he was pursuing an extraordinary development one that could erupt into widespread violence throughout the underworlds of hong kong and macao organized crime becomes suddenly very disorganized not unlike the tong wars of the twenties and thirties the killings pile up rival gangs instigate riots waterfronts become battlegrounds warehouses even cargo ships are blown up for revenge or to wipe out competitors sometimes all it takes is several powerful warring factions and a jason bourne in the background but since there is no jason bourne its police work not mi mr mcallister just said the man was called in by the hong kong police broke in marie looking hard at the undersecretary of state mi obviously agreed with the decision why was that its the wrong ballpark david was adamant his breath short jason bourne wasnt the creation of the police authorities said marie going to her husbands side he was created by us intelligence by way of the state department but i suspect mi inserted itself for a far more pressing reason than to find a killer posing as jason bourne am i right mr mcallister youre right mrs webb far more in our discussions these last two days several members of our section thought youd understand more clearly than we did lets call it an economic problem that could lead to serious political turmoil not only in hong kong but throughout the world you were a highly regarded economist for the canadian government you advised canadian ambassadors and delegations all over the world would you both mind explaining to the man who balances the chequebook around here these arent the times to permit disruptions in hong kongs marketplace mr webb even perhaps especially its illegal marketplace disruptions accompanied by violence give the impression of government instability if not far deeper instability this isnt the time to give the expansionists in red china any more ammunition than they have already come again please the treaty of answered marie quietly the lease runs out in barely a decade which is why the new accords were negotiated with peking still everybodys nervous everythings shaky and no one had better rock the boat calm stability is the name of the game david looked at her then back at mcallister he nodded his head i see ive read the papers and the magazines but its just not a subject that i know a hell of a lot about my husbands interests lie elsewhere explained marie to mcallister in the study of people their civilizations all right webb agreed so mine are with money and the constant exchange of money the expansion of it the markets and their fluctuations the stability or lack of it and if hong kong is nothing else its money thats more or less its only commodity it has little other reason for being its industries would die without it without priming the pump runs dry and if you take away the stability you have chaos added mcallister its the excuse for the old warlords in china the peoples republic marches in to contain the chaos suppress the agitators and suddenly theres nothing left but an awkward giant fumbling with the entire colony as well as the new territories the cooler heads in beijing are ignored in favour of more aggressive elements who want to save face through military control banks collapse far east trade is stymied chaos the prc would do that hong kong kowloon macao and all the territories are part of their socalled great nation under heaven even the china accords make that clear its one entity and the oriental wont tolerate a disobedient child you know that are you telling me that one man pretending to be jason bourne can do this can bring about this kind of crisis i dont believe you its an extreme scenario but yes it could happen you see the myth rides with him thats the hypnotic factor multiple killings are ascribed to him if only to distance the real killers from the scenes conspirators from the politically fanatic right and left using bournes lethal image as their own when you think about it its precisely the way the myth itself was created whenever anyone of importance anywhere in the south china area was assassinated you as jason bourne made sure the kill was credited to you at the end of two years you were notorious yet in fact you killed only one man a drunken informer in macao who tried to garrotte you i dont remember that said david the man from state nodded sympathetically yes i was told but dont you see if the killings are perceived as political and powerful figures lets say the crown governor or a prc negotiator anyone like that is assassinated the whole colony is in an uproar mcallister paused shaking his head in weary dismissal however this is our concern not yours and i can tell you we have the best men in the intelligence community working on it your concern is yourself mr webb and right now as a matter of conscience its mine you have to be protected that file said marie coldly should never have been given to anyone we had no choice we work closely with the british we had to prove that treadstone was over finished that your husband was thousands of miles away from hong kong you told them where he was shouted webbs wife how dare you we had no choice repeated mcallister again rubbing his forehead we have to cooperate when certain crises arise surely you can understand that what i cant understand is why there ever was a file on my husband said marie furious it was deep deep cover congressional funding of intelligence operations demanded it its the law get off it said david angrily since youre so up on me you know where i come from tell me where are all those records on medusa i cant answer that replied mcallister you just did said webb dr panov pleaded with you people to destroy all the treadstone records insisted marie or at the very least to use false names but you wouldnt even do that what kind of men are you i would have agreed to both said mcallister with sudden surprising force im sorry mrs webb forgive me it was before my time like you im offended you may be right perhaps there never should have been a file there are ways bullshit broke in david his voice hollow its part of another strategy another trap you want carlos and you dont care how you get him i care mr webb and you dont have to believe that either whats the jackal to me or the far east section hes a european problem are you telling me i spent three years of my life hunting a man who didnt mean a goddamned thing no of course not times change perspectives change its all so futile sometimes jesus christ loosen up david said marie her attention briefly on the man from state who sat pale in his chair his hands gripping the arms lets all loosen up then she held her husbands eyes with her own something happened this afternoon didnt it ill tell you later of course marie looked at mcallister as david sank back in his chair his face lined and tired older than it had been only minutes ago everything youve told us is leading up to something isnt it she said to the man from state theres something else you want us to know yes and its not easy for me please bear in mind that ive only recently been assigned with full clearance to mr webbs classified dossier including his wife and children in cambodia yes then say what you have to say please mcallister once again extended his thin fingers and nervously massaged his forehead from what weve learned what london confirmed five hours ago its possible that your husband is a target a man wants him killed but not carlos not the jackal said webb sitting forward no at least we cant see a connection what do you see asked marie sitting on the arm of davids chair what have you learned the mi officer in kowloon had a great many sensitive papers in his office any number of which would have brought high prices in hong kong however only the treadstone file the file on jason bourne was taken that was the confirmation london gave us its as though a signal was sent hes the man we want only jason bourne but why cried marie her hand gripping davids wrist because someone was killed answered webb quietly and someone else wants the account settled thats what weve been working on agreed mcallister nodding weve made some progress who was killed asked the former jason bourne before i answer you should know that all weve got is what our people in hong kong could dig up by themselves by and large its speculation theres no proof what do you mean by themselves where the hell were the british you gave them the treadstone file because they gave us proof that a man has killed in the name of treadstones creation our creation you they werent about to identify mis sources any more than we would turn over our contacts to them our people have worked around the clock probing every possibility trying to find out who the dead sixers main sources were on the assumption that one of them was responsible for his death they ran down a rumour in macao only it turned out to be more than a rumour i repeat said webb who was killed a woman answered the man from state the wife of a hong kong banker named yao ming a taipan whose bank is only a fraction of his wealth his holdings are so extensive hes been rewelcomed in beijing as an investor and consultant hes influential powerful beyond reach circumstances ugly but not unusual his wife was a minor actress who appeared in a number of locally made films and quite a bit younger than her husband she was also about as faithful as a mink in season if youll excuse please said marie go on nevertheless he looked the other way she was his young beautiful trophy she was also part of the colonys jet set which has its share of unsavoury characters one weekend its gambling for extraordinary stakes in macao next the races in singapore or flying over to the pescadores for the pistol games in backwater opium houses betting thousands on who will be killed as men face one another across tables spinning chambers and aiming at each other and of course theres a widespread use of drugs her last lover was a distributor his suppliers were in guangzhou canton his routes up the deep bay waterways east of the lok ma chau border according to reports its a wide avenue with lots of traffic interrupted webb why did your people concentrate on him on his operation because his operation as you so aptly term it was rapidly becoming the only one in town or on that avenue he was systematically cutting out his competitors bribing the chinese marine patrols to sink their boats and dispose of the crews apparently they were effective a great many bodies riddled with bullets ended up floating onto the mud flats and into the river banks the factions were at war and the distributor the young wifes lover was marked for execution under the circumstances he had to have been aware of the possibility he must have surrounded himself with a dozen bodyguards right again and that kind of security calls for the talents of a legend his enemies hired that legend bourne whispered david shaking his head and closing his eyes yes concurred mcallister two weeks ago the drug dealer and yao mings wife were shot in their bed at the lisboa hotel in macao it wasnt a pleasant kill their bodies were barely recognizable the weapon was an uzi machine gun the incident was covered up the police and government officials bribed with a great deal of money a taipans money and let me guess said webb in a monotone the uzi it was the same weapon used in a previous killing credited to this bourne that specific weapon was left outside a conference room in a cabaret in kowloons tsim sha tsui there were five corpses in that room three of the victims among the colonys wealthier businessmen the british wont elaborate they merely showed us several very graphic photographs this taipan yao ming said david the actresss husband hes the connection your people found isnt he they learned that he was one of mis sources his connections in beijing made him an important contributor to intelligence he was invaluable then of course his wife was killed his beloved young wife id say his beloved trophy interrupted mcallister his trophy was taken all right said webb the trophy is far more important than the wife ive spent years in the far east theres a phrase for it in mandarin i think but i cant remember how it goes ren you jiagian said david the price of a mans image as it were yes i guess thats it itll do so the man from mi is approached by his distraught contact the taipan and told to get the file on this jason bourne the assassin who killed his wife his trophy or in short words there might be no more information coming to british intelligence from his sources in beijing thats the way our people read it and for his trouble the sixer is killed because yao ming cant afford to have the slightest association with bourne the taipan has to remain unreachable untouchable he wants his revenge but not with any possibility of exposure what do the british say asked marie in no uncertain terms to stay away from the entire situation london was blunt we made a mess of treadstone and they dont want our ineptitude in hong kong during these sensitive times have they confronted yao mingy webb watched the undersecretary closely when i brought up the name they said it was out of the question in truth they were startled but that didnt change their stand if anything they were angrier untouchable said david they probably want to continue using him in spite of what he did marie broke in what he may have done and what he might do to my husband its a different world said mcallister softly you cooperated with them we had to interrupted the man from state then insist they cooperate with you demand it then they could demand other things from us we cant do that liars marie turned her head in disgust i havent lied to you mrs webb why dont i trust you mr mcallister asked david probably because you cant trust your government mr webb and you have very little reason to i can only tell you that im a man of conscience you can accept that or not accept me or not but in the meantime ill make sure youre safe you look at me so strangely why is that ive never been in this position thats why the chimes of the doorbell rang and marie shaking her head to their sound rose and walked rapidly across the room and into the foyer she opened the door for a moment she stopped breathing and stared helplessly two men stood side by side both holding up black plastic identification cases each with a glistening silver badge attached to the top each embossed eagle reflecting the light of the carriage lamps on the porch beyond at the curb was a second dark sedan inside could be seen the silhouettes of other men and the glow of a lighted cigarette other men other guards she wanted to scream but she did not edward mcallister climbed into the passenger seat of his own state department car and looked through the closed window at the figure of david webb standing in the doorway the former jason bourne stood motionless his eyes fixed rigidly on his departing visitor lets get out of here said mcallister to the driver a man about his own age and balding with tortoiseshell glasses breaking the space between his nose and his high forehead the car started forward the driver cautious on the strange narrow treelined street a block from the rocky beach in the small maine town for several minutes neither man spoke finally the driver asked how did everything go go replied the man from state as the ambassador might say all the pieces are in place the foundations there the logic there the missionary work is done im glad to hear it are you then im glad too mcallister raised his trembling right hand his thin fingers massaging his right temple no im not he said suddenly im goddamned sick im sorry and speaking of missionary work i am a christian mean i believe nothing so chic as being zealous or born again or teaching sunday school or prostrating myself in the aisle but i do believe my wife and i go to the episcopal church at least twice a month my two sons are acolytes im generous because i want to be can you understand that sure i dont have quite those feelings but i understand but i just walked out of that mans house hey easy whats the matter mcallister stared straight ahead the oncoming headlights creating shadows rushing across his face may god have mercy on my soul he whispered screams suddenly filled the darkness an approaching growing cacophony of roaring voices then surging bodies were all around them racing ahead shouting faces contorted in frenzy webb fell to his knees covering his face and neck with both hands as best he could swinging his shoulders violently back and forth creating a shifting target within the circle of attack his dark clothes were a plus in the shadows but would be no help if an indiscriminate burst of gunfire erupted taking at least one of the guards with him yet bullets were not always a killers choice there were darts lethal missiles of poison delivered by aircompressed weapons puncturing exposed flesh bringing death in a matter of minutes or seconds a hand gripped his shoulder he spun around arcing his arm up dislodging the hand as he side stepped to his left crouching like an animal you okay professor asked the guard on his right grinning in the wash of his flashlight what what happened isnt it great cried the guard on his left approaching as david got to his feet what kids with that kind of spirit it really makes you feel good to see it it was over the campus quad was silent again and in the distance between the stone buildings that fronted the playing fields and the college stadium the pulsing flames of a bonfire could be seen through the empty bleachers a football rally was reaching its climax and his guards were laughing how about you professor continued the man on his left do you feel better about things now what with us here and all it was over the selfinflicted madness was over or was it why was his chest pounding so why was he so bewildered so frightened something was wrong why does this whole parade bother me said david over morning coffee in the breakfast alcove of their old rented victorian house you miss your walks on the beach said marie ladling her husbands single poached egg over the single slice of toast eat that before you have a cigarette no really it bothers me for the past week ive been a duck in a superficially protected gallery it occurred to me yesterday afternoon what do you mean marie poured out the water and placed the pan in the kitchen sink her eyes on webb six men are around you four on your flanks as you said and two peering into everything in front and behind you a parade why do you call it that i dont know everyone in his place marching to a drumbeat i dont know but you feel something i guess so tell me those feelings of yours once saved my life on the guisan quai in zurich id like to hear it well maybe i wouldnt but i damn well better webb broke the yolk of his egg on the toast do you know how easy it would be for someone someone who looked young enough to be a student to walk by me on a path and shoot an air dart into me he could cover the sound with a cough or a laugh and id have a hundred ccs of strychnine in my blood you know far more about that sort of thing than i do of course because thats the way id do it no thats the way jason bourne might do it not you all right im projecting it doesnt invalidate the thought what happened yesterday afternoon webb toyed with the egg and toast on his plate the seminar ran late as usual it was getting dark and my guards fell in and we walked across the quad towards the parking lot there was a football rally our insignificant team against another insignificant team but very large for us the crowd passed the four of us kids racing to a bonfire behind the bleachers screaming and shouting and singing fight songs working themselves up and i thought to myself this is it this is when its going to happen if it is going to happen believe me for those few moments i was bourne i crouched and sidestepped and watched everyone i could see i was close to panic and said marie disturbed by her husbands abrupt silence my socalled guards were looking around and laughing the two in front having a ball enjoying the whole thing that disturbed you instinctively i was a vulnerable target in the centre of an excited crowd my nerves told me that my mind didnt have to whos talking now im not sure i just know that during those few moments nothing made sense to me then only seconds later as if to pinpoint the feelings i hadnt verbalized the man behind me on my left came up and said something like isnt it great or terrific to see kids with that kind of spirit makes you feel good doesnt it i mumbled something inane and then he said and these are his exact words how about you professor do you feel better about things now what with us here and all david looked up at his wife did feel better how me he knew what their job was interrupted marie to protect you im sure he meant did you feel safer did he do they that crowd of screaming kids the dim light the shadowy bodies obscure faces and hes joining in and laughing theyre all laughing are they really here to protect me what else i dont know maybe ive simply been where they havent maybe im just thinking too much thinking about mcallister and those eyes of his except for the blinking they belonged to a dead fish you could read into them anything you wanted to depending upon how you felt what he told you was a shock said marie leaning against the sink her arms folded across her breasts watching her husband closely it had to have had a terrible effect on you it certainly did on me thats probably it agreed webb nodding its ironic but as much as there are so many things i want to remember theres an awful lot id like to forget why dont you call mcallister and tell him what you feel what you think youve got a direct line to him both at his office and his home mo panov would tell you to do that yes mo would david ate his egg halfheartedly if theres a way to get rid of a specific anxiety do it as fast as you can thats what hed say then do it webb smiled about as enthusiastically as he ate his egg maybe i will maybe i wont id rather not announce a latent or passive or recurrent paranoia or whatever the hell they call it mo would fly up here and beat my brains out if he doesnt i might ni shi nuhaizi said david using the paper napkin as he got out of his chair and went to her and what does that mean my inscrutable husband and number eightyseven lover bitch goddess it means freely translated that you are a little girl and not so little and i can still take you three out of five on the bed where there are other things to do with you instead of beating you up all that in such a short phrase we dont waste words we paint pictures ive got to leave the class this morning deals with siams rama the second and his claims on the malay states in the early nineteenth century its a pain in the ass but important whats worse is theres an exchange student from moulmein in burma who i think knows more than i do siam asked marie holding him thats thailand yes its thailand now your wife your children does it hurt david he looked at her loving her so i cant be that hurt where i cant see that clearly sometimes i hope i never do i dont think that way at all i want you to see them and hear them and feel them and to know that i love them too oh christ he held her their bodies together in a warmth that was theirs alone the line was busy for the second time so webb replaced the phone and returned to w f vellas siam under rama iii to see if the burmese exchange student had been right about rama ips conflict with the sultan of kedah over the disposition of the island of penang it was confrontation time in the rarefied groves of academe the moulmein pagodas of kiplings poetry had been replaced by a smartass postgraduate student who had no respect for his betters kipling would understand that and torpedo it there was a brief rapid knock on his office door which opened before david could ask the caller in it was one of his guards the man who had spoken to him yesterday afternoon during the pregame rally among the crowds amid the noise in the middle of his fears hello there professor hello its jim isnt it no johnny it doesnt matter youre not expected to get our names straight is anything the matter just the opposite sir i dropped in to say goodbye for all of us the whole contingent everythings clean and youre back to normal weve been ordered to report to bonel to what sounds kind of silly doesnt it instead of saying come on back to headquarters they call it bonel as if anyone couldnt figure it out i cant figure it out baseonelangley were cia all six of us but i guess you know that youre leaving all of you thats about it but i thought i thought there was a crisis here everythings clean i havent heard from anybody i havent heard from mcallister sorry dont know him we just have our orders you cant simply come in here and say youre leaving without some explanation i was told i was a target that a man in hong kong wanted me killed well i dont know whether you were told that or whether you told yourself that but i do know weve got an aone legitimate problem in newport news we have to get briefed and get on it aone legitimate what about me get a lot of rest professor we were told you need it the man from the cia abruptly turned went through the door and closed it well i dont know whether you were told that or whether you told yourself that how about you professor do you feel better about things now what with us here and all parade charade where was mcallisters number where was it goddamit he had two copies one at home and one in his desk drawer no his wallet he found it his whole body trembling in fear and in anger as he dialled mr mcallisters office said a female voice i thought this was his private line thats what i was told mr mcallister is away from washington sir in these cases were instructed to pick up and log the calls log the calls where is he i dont know sir im from the secretarial pool he phones in every other day or so who shall i say called thats not good enough my name is webb jason webb no david webb i have to talk to him right away immediately ill connect you with the department handling his urgent calls webb slammed down the phone he had the number for mcallisters home he dialled it hello the voice of another woman mr mcallister please im afraid hes not here if you care to leave your name and a number ill give it to him when well he should be calling tomorrow or the next day he always does youve got to give me the number where he is now mrs mcallister i assume this is mrs mcallister i should hope so eighteen years worth who are you webb david webb oh of course edward rarely discusses business and he certainly didnt in your case but he did tell me what terribly nice people you and your lovely wife are as a matter of fact our older boy whos in prep school naturally is very interested in the university where you teach now in the last year or so his marks dropped just a touch and his aptitude tests werent the highest but he has such a wonderful enthusiastic outlook on life im sure hed be an asset mrs mcallister broke in webb i have to reach your husband now oh im terribly sorry but i dont think thats possible hes in the far east and of course i dont have a number where can reach him there in emergencies we always call the state department david hung up the phone he had to alert phone marie the line had to be free by now it had been busy for nearly an hour and there was no one his wife could talk with on the telephone for an hour not even her father her mother or her two brothers in canada there was great affection between them all but she was the maverick she was not the francophile her lather was not a homebody like her mother and although she adored her brothers not the rustic plainspoken folk they were she had found another life in the stratified layers of higher economics with a doctorate and gainful employment with the canadian government and at last she had married an american quei dommage the line was still busy goddamnit marie then webb froze his whole body for an instant a block of searing hot ice he could barely move but he did move and then he raced out of his small office and down the corridor with such speed that he pummelled three students and a colleague out of his path sending two into walls the others buckling under him he was a man suddenly possessed reaching his house he slammed on the brakes the car screeched to a stop as he leaped out of the seat and ran up the path to the door he stopped staring his breath suddenly no longer in him the door was open and on the angled indented panel was a hand print stamped in red blood webb ran inside throwing everything out of his way furniture crashed and lamps were smashed as he searched the ground floor then he went upstairs his hands two thin slabs of granite his every nerve primed for a sound a weight his killer instinct as clear as the red stains he had seen below on the outside door for these moments he knew and accepted the fact that he was the assassin the lethal animal that jason bourne had been if his wife was above he would kill whoever tried to harm her or had harmed her already prone on the floor he pushed the door of their bedroom open the explosion blew apart the upper hallway wall he rolled under the blast to the opposite side he had no weapon but he had a cigarette lighter he reached into his trouser pockets for the scribbled notes all teachers gather bunched them together spun to his left and snapped the lighter the flame was immediate he threw the fired wad far into the bedroom as he pressed his back against the wall and rose from the floor his head whipping towards the other two closed doors on the narrow upper floor suddenly he lashed out with his feet one crash after another as he lunged back onto the floor and rolled into the shadows nothing the two rooms were empty if there was an enemy he was in the bedroom but by now the bedspread was on fire the flames were gradually leaping towards the ceiling only seconds now now he plunged into the room and grabbing the flaming bedspread he swung it in a circle as he crouched and rolled on the floor until the spread was ashes all the while expecting an icecold hit in his shoulder or his arm but knowing he could overcome it and take his enemy jesus he was jason bourne again there was nothing his marie was not there there was nothing but a primitive stringdevice that had triggered a shotgun angled for a certain kill when he pushed the door open he stamped out the flames lurched for a table lamp and turned it on marie marie then he saw it a note lying on the pillow on her side of the bed a wife for a wife jason bourne she is wounded but not dead as mine is dead you know where to find me and her if you are circumspect and fortunate perhaps we can do business for i have enemies too if not what is the death of one more daughter webb screamed falling onto the pillows trying to mute the outrage and the horror that came from his throat pushing back the pain that swept through his temples then he turned over and stared at the ceiling a terrible brute passivity coming over him things unremembered suddenly came back to him things he had never revealed even to morris panov bodies collapsing under his knife falling under his gun these were not imagined killings they were real they had made him what he was not but they had done the job too well he had become the image the man that was not supposed to be hed had to hed had to survive without knowing who he was and now he knew the two men within him that made up his whole being he would always remember the one because it was the man he wanted to be but for the time being he had to be the other the man he despised jason bourne rose from the bed and went to the walkin closet where there was a locked drawer the third in his builtin bureau he reached up and pulled the tape from a key attached to the cupboard ceiling he inserted it in the lock and opened the drawer inside were two dismantled automatics four strings of thin wire attached to spools that he could conceal in his palms three valid passports in three different names and six plastique explosive charges that could blow apart whole rooms he would use one or all david webb would find his wife or jason bourne would become the terrorist no one ever dreamed of in his wildest nightmares he did not care too much had been taken from him he would endure no more bourne cracked the various parts in place and snapped the magazine of the second automatic both were ready he was ready he went back to the bed and lay down staring again at the ceiling the logistics would fall into place he knew that then the hunt would begin he would find her dead or alive and if she was dead he would kill kill and kill again whoever it was would never get away from him not from jason bourne barely in control of himself he knew that calm was out of the question his hand gripped the automatic while his mind cracked with surreal bursts of rapid gunfire one option after another slamming into his head above all he could not stay still he had to keep in motion he had to get up and move the state department the men at state he had known during his last months in the remote classified virginia medical complex those insistent obsessed men who questioned him relentlessly showing him photographs by the dozens until mo panov would order them to stop he had learned their names and written them down thinking that one day he might want to know who they were no reason other than visceral distrust such men had tried to kill him only months before yet he had never asked for their names nor were they offered except as harry bill or sam presumably on the theory that actual identities would simply add to his confusion instead he had unobtrusively read their identification tags and after they left wrote the names down and placed the pieces of paper with his personal belongings in the bureau drawer when marie came to see him which was every day he gave her those names and told her to hide them in the house hide them well later marie admitted that although she had done as he instructed she thought his suspicions were excessive a case of overkill but then one morning only minutes after a heated session with the men from washington david pleaded with her to leave the medical complex immediately run to the car drive to the bank where they had a safety deposit box and do the following insert a short strand of her hair in the bottom left border of the deposit box lock it get out of the bank and return two hours later to see if it was still there it was not she had securely fixed the strand of hair in place it could not have fallen away unless the deposit box had been opened she found it on the tiled floor of the bank vault how did you know she had asked him one of my friendly interrogators got hot and tried to provoke me mo was out of the room for a couple of minutes and he damn near accused me of faking of hiding things i knew you were coming and so i played it out i wanted to see for myself how far they would go how far they could go nothing had been sacred then and nothing was sacred now it was all too symmetrical the guards had been pulled his own reactions condescendingly questioned as if he were the one who had asked for the additional protection and not on the insistence of one edward canister then within hours marie was taken according to a scenario that had been detailed far too accurately by a nervous man with dead eyes and now this same mcallister was suddenly fifteen thousand miles away from his own selfdetermined ground zero had the undersecretary turned had he been bought in hong kong had he betrayed washington as well as the man he had sworn to protect what was happening whatever it was among the unholy secrets was code name medusa it had never been mentioned during the questioning never referred to its absence was startling it was as if the unacknowledged battalion of psychotics and killers had never existed its history had been wiped off the books but that history could be reinstated this was where he would start webb walked rapidly out of the bedroom and down the steps to his study once a small library off the hallway in the old victorian house he sat at his desk opened the bottom drawer and removed several notebooks and various papers he then inserted a brass letter opener and pried up the false bottom lying on the second layer of wood were other papers they were a vague mostly bewildering assortment of fragmented recollections images that had come to him at odd hours of the day and night there were torn scraps and pages from small notebooks and scissored pieces of stationery on which he had jotted down the pictures and words that exploded in his head it was a mass of painful evocations many so tortured that he could not share them with marie fearing the hurt would be too great the revelations of jason bourne too brutal for his wife to confront and among these secrets were the names of the experts in clandestine operations who had come down to question him so intensely in virginia davids eyes suddenly focused on the ugly heavycalibre weapon on the edge of the desk without realizing it he had gripped it in his hand and carried it down from the bedroom he stared at it for a moment then picked up the phone it was the beginning of the most agonizing infuriating hour of his life as each moment marie drifted farther away the first two calls were taken by wives or lovers the men he was trying to reach were suddenly not there when he identified himself he was still out of sanction they would not touch him without authorization and that authorization was being withheld christ he should have known hello is this the lanier residence yes it is william lanier please tell him its urgent a sixteen hundred alert my name is thompson state department just one minute said the woman concerned who is this asked a mans voice its david webb you remember jason bourne dont you a pause followed filled with laniers breathing why did you say your name was thompson that it was a white house alert i had an idea you might not talk to me among the things i remember is that you dont make contact with certain people without authorization theyre out of bounds you simply report the contact attempt then i assume you also remember that its highly irregular to call someone like me on a domestic phone domestic phone does the domestic prohibitive now include where you live you know what im talking about i said it was an emergency it cant have anything to do with me protested lanier youre a dead file in my office colour me deepdead interrupted david i didnt say that shot back the man from covert operations all i meant was that youre not on my schedule and its policy not to interfere with others what others asked webb sharply how the hell do i know are you telling me that youre not interested in what i have to tell you whether im interested or not hasnt anything to do with it youre not on any list of mine and thats all i have to know if you have something to say call your authorized contact i tried to his wife said he was in the far east try his office someone there will process you i know that and i dont care to be processed i want to talk to someone i know and i know you bill remember it was bill in virginia thats what you told me to call you you were interested to hell and back in what i had to say then that was then not now look webb i cant help you because i cant advise you no matter what you tell me i cant respond im not current on your status i havent been for almost a year your contact is he can be reached call state back im hanging up medusa whispered david did you hear me lanier medusa medusa what are you trying to tell me something ill blow it all apart do you read me ill expose the whole obscene mess unless i get some answers why dont you get yourself processed instead said the man from covert operations coldly or check yourself into a hospital there was an abrupt click and david perspiring hung up the phone lanier did not know about medusa if he had known he would have stayed on the phone learning whatever he could for medusa crossed the lines of policy and being current but lanier was one of the younger interrogators no more than or he was very bright but not a longterm veteran someone a few years older would probably have been given clearance told about the renegade battalion that was still held in deep cover webb looked at the names on his list and at the corresponding telephone numbers he picked up the phone helloa male voice is this samuel teasdale yeah thats right who are you im glad you answered the phone and not your wife the wifes standard where possible said teasdale suddenly cautious mines no longer available shes sailing somewhere in the caribbean with someone i never knew about now that you know my lifes story who the hell are you jason bourne remember webb i vaguely remember that name said david why are you calling me you were friendly down in virginia you told me to call you sam okay okay david youre right i told you to call me sam thats what i am

thats the one you should reach thats the person whos up to date on everything arent you up to date sam not about you no i remember the directive it was dropped on our desks a couple of weeks after you

the department and my directaccess contact has disappeared come on objected teasdale quietly suspiciously thats crazy it couldnt happen it happened yelled webb my wife happened what about your wife

who cleared the way who turned ive got an idea who it is but i need answers to nail him nail all of you if i have to hold it right there broke in teasdale angrily if youre trying to compromise me

which ill do the second i cut you loose ill also add that i got hit with a bucket of bullshit take care of that head of yours medusa cried webb no one wants to talk about codename medusa do they even today its way down deep in the vaults isnt it there was no click on the line this time teasdale did not hang up instead he spoke flatly no comment in his voice rumours he said like hoovers raw files raw meat good for stories over a few belts but not worth a hell of a lot im not a rumour sam i live i breathe i go to the toilet and i sweat like im sweating now thats not a rumour youve had your problems davey i was there i fought with medusa some people said i was the best or the worst its why i was chosen why i became jason bourne i wouldnt know about that we never discussed it so i wouldnt

until one day you decided to get rough i apologized said teasdale gently we all have bad days i told you about my wife im not interested in your wife im interested in mine and ill rip open medusa unless i get some answers some help im sure you can get whatever help you think you need if youll just call your contact at state hes not there hes gone then ask for his backup youll be processed processed jesus what are you a robot just a man trying to do his job mr webb and im afraid i cant do any more for you good night the click came and teasdale was off the phone there was another man thought david at fever pitch as he stared at the list squinting as the sweat filled his eye sockets an easy going man less abrasive than the others a southerner whose slow drawl was either a cover for a quick mind or the halting resistance to a job in which he felt himself uncomfortable there was no time for invention is this the babcock residence surely is replied a womans voice imbued with magnolia not our home of course as i always point out but we surely do reside here may i speak with harry babcock please may ah ask whos callin please he may be out in the garden with the kids but on the other hand he may have taken them over to the park its so well lit these days not like before and you just dont fear for your life as long as you stay a cover for quick minds both mr and mrs harry babcock my name is reardon state department theres an urgent message for mr babcock my instructions are to reach him as soon as possible its an emergency there was the bouncing echo of a phone being covered muffled sounds beyond harry babcock got on the line his speech slow and deliberate i dont know a mr reardon mr reardon all mah relays come from a particular switchboard that identifies itself are you a switchboard sir well i dont know if ive ever heard of someone coming in from a garden or from across the street in a park so quickly mr babcock remarkable isnt it i should be runnin in the olympics perhaps however i do know your voice i just cant place the name how about jason bourne the pause was brief a very quick mind now that name goes back quite a while doesnt it just about a year id say it is you isnt it david there was no question implied yes harry ive got to talk to you no david you should speak with others not me are you telling me im cut off good heavens thats so abrupt so discourteous id be more than delighted to hear how you and the lovely mrs webb are doing in your new life massachusetts isnt it maine of course forgive me is everything well as im sure you realize my colleagues and i are involved with so many problems we havent been able to stay in touch with your file someone else said you couldnt get your hands on it ah dont think anybody tried to i want to talk babcock said david harshly i dont replied harry babcock flatly his voice nearly glacial i follow regulations and to be frank you are cut off from men like me i dont question why things change they always change medusa said david we wont talk about me lets talk about medusa the pause was longer than before and when babcock spoke his words were now frozen this phone is sterile webb so ill say what i want to say you were nearly taken out a year ago and it would have been a mistake we would have sincerely mourned you but if you break the threads therell be no mournin tomorrow except of course your wife you son of a bitch shes gone she was taken you bastards let it happen i dont know what youre talking about my guards they were pulled every goddamned one of them and she was taken i want answers babcock or i blow everything apart now you do exactly as i tell you to do or therell be mournings you never dreamed of all of you your wives orphaned children try everything on for size im jason bourne remember youre a maniac thats what i remember with threats like those well send a team to find you medusa style try that on for size boy suddenly a furious hum broke into the line it was deafening highpitched causing david to thrust the phone away from his ear and then the calm voice of an operator was heard we are breaking in for an emergency go ahead colorado webb slowly brought the phone back to his ear is this jason bourne asked a man in a midatlantic accent the voice refined aristocratic im david webb of course you are but you are also jason bourne was said david mesmerized by something he could not define the conflicting lines of identity get blurred mr webb especially for one who has been through so much who the hell are you a friend be assured of that and a friend cautions one he calls a friend youve made outrageous accusations against some of our countrys most dedicated servants men who will never be permitted an unaccountable five million dollars to this day unaccounted for do you want to search me no more than id care to trace the labyrinthine ways your most accomplished wife buried the funds in a dozen european shes gone did your dedicated men tell you that you were described as being overwrought raving was the word that was used and making astonishing accusations relative to your wife yes relative to goddamn you she was taken from our house someones holding her because they want me are you sure ask that dead fish mcallister its his scenario right down to the note and suddenly hes on the other side of the world a note asked the cultured voice very clear very specific its mcallisters story and he let it happen you let it happen perhaps you should examine the note further why no matter it may all become clearer to you with help psychiatric help what we want to do all we can for you believe that youve given so much more than any man should and your extraordinary contribution cannot be disregarded even if it comes to a court of law we placed you in the situation and we will stand by you even if it means bending the laws coercing the courts what are you talking about screamed david a respected army doctor tragically killed his wife several years ago it was in all the papers the stress became too much the stresses on you were tenfold i dont believe this lets put it another way mr bourne im not bourne all right mr webb ill be frank with you thats a step up youre not a well man youve gone through eight months of psychiatric therapy theres still a great deal of your own life you cant remember you didnt even know your name its all in the medical records meticulous records that make clear the advanced state of your mental illness your compulsion for violence and your obsessive rejection of your own identity in your torment you fantasize you pretend to be people you are not you seem to have a compulsion to be someone other than yourself thats crazy and you know it lies crazy is a harsh word mr webb and the lies are not mine however its my job to protect our government from false vilification unfounded accusations that could severely damage the country such as your secondary fantasy concerning an unknown organization you call medusa now im sure your wife will come back to you if she can mr webb but if you persist with this fantasy with this figment of your tortured mind that you call medusa well label you a paranoid schizophrenic a pathological liar prone to uncontrollable violence and selfdeception if such a man claims his wife is missing who knows where that pathological trip could lead do i make myself clear david closed his eyes the sweat rolling down his face crystal clear he said quietly hanging up the phone paranoid pathological bastards he opened his eyes wanting to spend his rage by hurling himself against something anything then he stopped and stood motionless as another thought struck him the obvious thought morris panov mo panov would label the three monsters for what he knew they were incompetents and liars manipulators and selfserving protectors of corrupt bureaucracies and conceivably worse far worse he reached for the phone and trembling dialled the number that so often in the past had brought forth a calming rational voice that provided a sense of worth when webb felt there was very little of value left in him david how good to hear from you said panov with genuine warmth im afraid its not mo its the worst call ive ever made to you come on david thats pretty dramatic weve been through a lot listen to me yelled webb shes gone theyve taken her the words poured forth sequences lacking order the times confused stop it david commanded panov go back i want to hear it from the beginning when this man came to see you after your the memories of your brother what man from the state department yes all right yes mcallister that was his name go from there names titles positions and spell out the name of that banker in hong kong and for christs sake slow down webb again grabbed his wrist as it gripped the phone he started again imposing a false control on his speech but still it became strident tight involuntarily gathering speed finally he managed to get everything out everything he could recall knowing in horror that he had not remembered everything unknown blank spaces filled him with pain they were coming back the terrible blank spaces he had said all he could say for the moment there was nothing left david began mo panov firmly i want you to do something for me now what it may sound foolish to you even a little bit crazy but i suggest you go down the street to the beach and take a walk along the shore a half hour fortyfive minutes thats all listen to the surf and the waves crashing against the rocks you cant be serious protested webb im very serious insisted mo remember we agreed once that there were times when people should put their heads on hold god knows i do it more than a reasonably respected psychiatrist should things can overwhelm us and before we can get our act together we have to get rid of part of the confusion do as i ask david ill get back to you as soon as i can no more than an hour id guess and i want you calmer than you are now it was crazy but as with so much of what panov quietly often casually suggested there was truth in his words webb walked along the cold rocky beach never for an instant forgetting what had happened but whether it was the change of scene or the wind or the incessant repetitive sounds of the pounding ocean he found himself breathing more steadily every bit as deeply as tremulously as before but without the higher registers of hysteria he looked at his watch at the luminous dial aided by the moonlight he had walked back and forth for thirtytwo minutes it was all the indulgence he could bear he climbed the path through the dunes of wild grass to the street and headed for the house his pace quickening with every step he sat in his chair at the desk his eyes rigid on the phone it rang he picked it up before the bell had stopped mo yes it was damned cold out there thank you thank you what have you learned and then the extension of the nightmare began how long has marie been gone david i dont know an hour two hours maybe more whats that got to do with anything could she be shopping or did you two have a fight and perhaps she wanted to be by herself for a while we agreed that things are sometimes very difficult for her you made the point yourself what the hell are you talking about theres a note spelling it out blood a hand print yes you mentioned them before but theyre so incriminating why would anyone do that how do i know it was done they were done its all here did you call the police christ no its not for the police its for us for me cant you understand that what did you find out why are you talking like this because i have to in all the sessions in all the months we talked we never said anything but the truth to each other because the truth is what you have to know mo for gods sake its marie please david let me finish if theyre lying and theyve lied before ill know it and ill expose them i couldnt do anything less but im going to tell you exactly what they told me what the number two man in the far east section made specifically clear and what the chief of security for the state department read to me as the events were officially logged officially logged yes he said row called securitycontrol a little over a week ago and according to the log you were in a highly agitated state i called them thats right thats what he said according to the logs you claimed you had received threats your speech was incoherent that was the word they used and you demanded additional security immediately because of the classified flag on your file the request was bounced upstairs and the upper levels said give him what he wants cool him i cant believe this its only the middle david hear me out because im listening to you okay go on thats it easy stay cool no strike that word cool please do once the patrols were in place again according to the logs you called twice more complaining that your guards werent doing their job you said they were drinking in their cars in front of your house that they laughed at you when they accompanied you on the campus that they and here i quote theyre making a mockery of what theyre supposed to be doing i underlined that phrase a mockery easy david heres the end of it the end of the logs you made a last call stating emphatically that you wanted everyone taken away that your guards were your enemy they were the men who wanted to kill you in essence you had transformed those who were trying to protect you into enemies who would attack you and im sure that fits snugly into one of those bullshit psychiatric conclusions that had me converting or perverting my anxieties into paranoia very snugly said panov too snugly what did the number two in far east tell you panov was silent for a moment its not what you want to hear david but he was adamant they never heard of a banker or any influential taipan named yao ming he said the way things were in hong kong these days if there was such a person hed have the dossier memorized does he think i made it all up the name the wife the drug connection the places the circumstances the british reaction for christs sake i couldnt invent those things itd be a stretch for you agreed the psychiatrist softly then everything ive just told you youre hearing for the first time and none of it makes sense its not the way you recall things mo its all a lie i never called state mcallister came to the house and told us both everything ive told you including the yao ming story and now shes gone and ive been given a lead to follow why for christs sake what are they doing to us i asked about mcallister said panov his tone suddenly angry the fast east deputy checked with state posting and called me back they say mcallister flew into hong kong two weeks ago that according to his very precise calendar he couldnt have been at your house in maine he was here i think i believe you what does that mean among other things i can hear the truth in your voice sometimes when you cant also that phrase making a mockery of something isnt generally in the vocabulary of a psychotic in a highly agitated state certainly not in yours at your wildest im not with you someone saw where you worked and what you did for a living and thought hed add a little upgraded verbiage local colour in your case then panov exploded my god what are they doing locking me into a starting gate said webb softly theyre forcing me to go after whatever it is they want sons of bitches its called recruitment david stared at the wall stay away mo theres nothing you can do theyve got all their pieces in place im recruited he hung up dazed webb walked out of his small office and stood in the victorian hallway surveying the upturned furniture and the broken lamps china and glass strewn across the floor of the living room beyond then words spoken by panov earlier in the terrible conversation came to him theyre so incriminating approached the front door and opened it he forced himself to look at the hand print in the centre of the upper panel the dried blood dull and dark in the light of the carriage lamps then he drew closer and examined it it was the imprint of a hand but not a handprint there was the outline of a hand the impression the palm and the extended fingers but no breaks in the bloody form no creases or indentations that a bleeding hand pressed against hard wood would reveal no identifying marks no isolated parts of the flesh held in place so as to stamp its own particular characteristics it was like a flat coloured shadow from a piece of stained glass no planes other than the single impression a glove a rubber glove david drew his eyes away and slowly turned to the staircase in the middle of the hallway his thoughts haltingly centring on other words spoken by another man a strange man with a mesmerizing voice perhaps you should examine the note further it may all become clearer to you with help psychiatric help webb suddenly screamed the terror within him growing as he ran to the staircase and raced up the steps to the bedroom where he stared at the typewritten note on the bed he picked it up with sickening fear and carried it to his wifes dressing table he turned on the lamp and studied the print under the light if the heart within him could have burst it would have blown apart instead jason bourne coldly examined the note before him the slightly bent irregular rs were there as well as the ds the upper staves incomplete breaking off at the halfway mark bastards the note had been written on his own typewriter recruitment he sat on the rocks above the beach knowing he had to think clearly he had to define what was before him and what was expected of him and then how to outthink whoever was manipulating him above all he knew he could not give in to panic even the perception of panic a panicked man was dangerous a risk to be eliminated if he went over the edge he would only ensure the death of marie and himself it was that simple everything was so delicate violently delicate david webb was out of the question jason bourne had to assume control jesus it was crazy mo panov had told him to walk on the beach as webb and now he had to sit there as bourne thinking things out as bourne would think them out he had to deny one part of himself and accept the opposite strangely it was not impossible nor even intolerable for marie was out there his love his only love dont think that way jason bourne spoke she is a valuable possession taken from you get her back jason bourne spoke no not a possession my life jason bourne then break all the rules find her bring her back to you david webb i dont know how help me use me use what youve learned from me youve got the tools youve had them for years you were the best in medusa above all there was control you preached that you lived that and you stayed alive control such a simple word such an incredible demand webb climbed off the rocks and once again went up the path through the wild grass to the street and started back towards the old victorian house loathing its sudden frightening unfair emptiness as he walked a name flashed across his thoughts then it returned and remained fixed slowly the face belonging to that name came into focus very slowly for the man aroused hatred in david that was no less acute for the sadness he also evoked alexander conklin had tried to kill him twice and each time he had nearly succeeded and alex conklin according to his deposition as well as his own numerous psychiatric sessions with mo panov and what vague memories david could provide had been a close friend of foreign service officer webb and his thai wife and their children in cambodia a lifetime ago when death had struck from the skies filling the river with circles of blood david had fled blindly to saigon his rage uncontrollable and it was his friend in the central intelligence agency alex conklin who found a place for him in the illegitimate battalion they called medusa if you can survive the jungle training youll be a man they want but watch them every goddamned one of them every goddamned minute theyll cut your arm off for a watch those were the words webb recalled and he specifically recalled that they had been spoken by the voice of alexander conklin he had survived the brutal training and became delta no other name just a progression in the alphabet delta one then after the war delta became cain cain is for delta and carlos is for cain that was the challenge hurled at carlos the assassin created by treadstone a killer named cain would catch the jackal it was as cain a name the underworld of europe knew in reality was asias jason bourne that conklin had betrayed his friend a simple act of faith on alexs part could have made all the difference but alex could not find it within himself to provide it his own bitterness precluded that particular charity he believed the worst of his former friend because his own sense of martyrdom made him want to believe it it raised his own broken selfesteem convincing him that he was better than his former friend in his work with medusa conklins foot had been shattered by a land mine and his brilliant career as a field strategist was cut short a crippled man could not stay in the field where a growing reputation might take him up the ladders scaled by such men as alien dulles and james angleton and conklin did not possess the skills for the bureaucratic infighting demanded at langley he withered a once extraordinary tactician left to watch inferior talents pass him by his expertise sought only in secrecy the head of medusa always in the background dangerous someone to be kept at arms length two years of imposed castration until a man known as the monk a rasputin of covert operations sought him out because one david webb had been selected for an extraordinary assignment and conklin had known webb for years treadstone was created jason bourne became its product and carlos the jackal its target and for thirtytwo months conklin monitored this most secret of classified operations until the scenario fell apart with jason bournes disappearance and the withdrawal of over five million dollars from treadstones zurich account with no evidence to the contrary conklin presumed the worst the legendary bourne had turned life in the nether world had become too much for him and the temptation to come in from the cold with over five million dollars had been too alluring to resist especially for one known as the chameleon a multilingual deepcover specialist who could change appearances and lifestyles with so little effort that he could literally vanish a trap for an assassin had been baited and then the bait had vanished revealing a scheming thief for the crippled alexander conklin this was not only the act of a traitor but intolerable treachery considering everything that had been done to him his foot now no more than a painfully awkward dead weight surgically encased in stolen flesh a once brilliant career a shambles his personal life filled with a loneliness that only a total commitment to the agency could bring about a devotion not reciprocated what right had anyone else to turn what other man had given what he had given so his once close friend david webb became the enemy jason bourne not merely the enemy but an obsession he had helped create the myth he would destroy it his first attempt was with two hired killers on the outskirts of paris david shuddered at the memory still seeing a defeated conklin limp away his crippled figure in webbs gunsight the second try was blurred for david perhaps he would never recall it completely it had taken place at the treadstone sterile house on new yorks st street an ingenious trap mounted by conklin which was aborted by webbs hysterical efforts to survive and oddly enough the presence of carlos the jackal later when the truth was known that the traitor had no treason in him but instead a mental aberration called amnesia conklin fell apart during davids agonizing months of convalescence in virginia alex tried repeatedly to see his former friend to explain to tell his part of the bloody story to apologize with every fibre of his being david however had no forgiveness in his soul if he walks through that door ill kill him had been his words that would change now thought webb as he quickened his pace down the street towards the house whatever conklins faults and duplicities few men in the intelligence community had the insights and the sources he had developed over a lifetime of commitment david had not thought about alex in months he thought about him now suddenly remembering the last time his name came up in conversation mo panov had rendered his verdict i cant help him because he doesnt want to be helped hell carry his last bottle of sour mash up to that great big black operations room in the sky bombed out of his mercifully dead skull if he lasts to his retirement at the end of the year ill be astonished on the other hand if he stays pickled they may put him in a straitjacket and thatll keep him out of traffic i swear i dont know how he gets to work every day that pension is one hell of a survivaltherapy better than anything freud ever left us panov had spoken those words no more than five months ago conklin was still in place im sorry mo his survival oneway or the other doesnt bother me so far as im concerned his status is dead it was not dead now thought david as he ran up the steps of the oversized victorian porch alex conklin was very much alive whether drunk or not and even if he was preserved in bourbon he had his sources those contacts he had cultivated during a lifetime of devotion to the shadow world that ultimately rejected him within that world debts were owed and they were paid out of fear alexander conklin number i on jason bournes hit list he opened the door and once again stood in the hallway but his eyes did not see the wreckage instead the logician in him ordered him to go back into his study and begin the procedures there was nothing but confusion without imposed order and confusion led to questions he could not afford them everything had to be precise within the reality he was creating so as to divert the curious from the reality that was he sat down at the desk and tried to focus his thoughts there was the everpresent spiral notebook from the college shop in front of him he opened the thick cover to the first lined page and reached for a pencil he could not pick it up his hand shook so much that his whole body trembled he held his breath and made a fist clenching it until his fingernails cut into his flesh he closed his eyes then opened them forcing his hand to return to the pencil commanding it to do its job slowly awkwardly his fingers gripped the thin yellow shaft and moved the pencil into position the words were barely legible but they were there the university phone president and dean of studies family crisis not canada can he traced invent a brother in europe perhaps yes europe leave of absence brief leave of absence right away will stay in touch house call rental agent same story ask jack to check periodically he has key turn thermostat to mail fill out form at post office hold all mail newspapers cancel the little things the goddamned little things the unimportant daily trivia became so terribly important and had to be taken care of so that there would be no sign whatsoever of an abrupt departure without a planned return that was vital he had to remember it with every word he spoke questions had to be kept to a minimum the inevitable speculations reduced to manageable proportions which meant he had to confront the obvious conclusion that his recent bodyguards somehow led to his leave of absence to defuse the connection the most plausible way was to emphasize the short duration of that absence and to face the issue with a straightforward dismissal such as incidentally if youre wondering whether this has anything to do with well dont thats a closed book it didnt have much merit anyway he would know better how to respond while talking to both the universitys president and the dean their own reactions would guide him if anything could guide him if he was capable of thinking dont slide back keep going move that pencil fill out the page with things to do then another page and another passports initials on wallets or billfolds or shirts to correspond with the names being used airline reservations connecting flights no direct routes oh god to where marie where are you stop it control yourself you are capable you must be capable you have no choice so be what you once were feel ice be ice without warning the shell he was building around himself was shattered by the earsplitting sound of the telephone inches from his hand on the desk he looked at it swallowing wondering if he were capable of sounding remotely normal it rang again a terrible insistence in its ring you have no choice he picked it up gripping the receiver with such force that his knuckles turned white he managed to get out the single word yes this is the mobileair operator satellite transmission who what did you say i have a midflight radio call for a mr webb are you mr webb sir yes and then the world he knew blew up in a thousand jagged mirrors each an image of screaming torment david marie dont panic darling do you hear me dont panic her voice came through the static she was trying not to shout but could not help herself are you all right the note said you were hurt wounded im all right a few scratches thats all where are you over the ocean im sure theyll tell you that much i dont know i was sedated oh jesus i cant stand it they took you away pull yourself together david i know what this is doing to you but they dont do you understand what im saying they dont she was sending him a coded message it was not hard to decipher he had to be the man he hated he had to be jason bourne and the assassin was alive and well and residing in the body of david webb all right yes all right ive been going out of my mind your voice is being amplified naturally theyre letting me speak to you so youll know im alive have they hurt you not intentionally what the hell are scratches i struggled i fought and i was brought up on a ranch oh my god david please dont let them do this to you to me its you i know darling i think theyre testing you can you understand that again the message be jason bourne for both their sakes for both their lives all right yes all right he lessened the intensity of his voice trying to control himself when did it happen he asked this morning about an hour after you left this morning christ all day how they came to the door two men who im permitted to say theyre from the far east actually i dont know any more than that they asked me to accompany them and i refused i ran into the kitchen and saw a knife i stabbed one of them in the hand the handprint on the door i dont understand it doesnt matter a man wants to talk to you david listen to him but not in anger not in a rage can you understand that all right yes all right i understand the mans voice came on the line it was hesitant but precise almost british in its delivery someone who had been taught english by an englishman or by someone who had lived in the uk nevertheless it was identifiably oriental the accent was southern china the pitch the short vowels and sharp consonants sounding of cantonese we do not care to harm your wife mr webb but if it is necessary it will be unavoidable i wouldnt if i were you said david coldly jason bourne speaks he speaks the acknowledgement is the first step in our understanding what understanding you took something of great value from a man youve taken something of great value from me she is alive shed better stay that way another is dead you killed her are you sure about that bourne would not agree readily unless it served his purpose to do so we are very sure whats your proof you were seen a tall man who stayed in the shadows and raced through the hotel corridors and across fire escapes with the movements of a mountain cat then i wasnt really seen was i nor could i have been i was thousands of miles away bourne would always give himself an option in these times of fast aircraft what is distance the oriental paused then added sharply you cancelled your duties for a period of five days two and a half weeks ago and if i told you i attended a symposium on the sung and yuan dynasties down in boston which was very much in line with my duties i am startled interrupted the man courteously that jason bourne would employ such a lamentably feeble excuse he had not wanted to go to boston that symposium was light years away from his lectures but he had been officially asked to attend the request came from washington from the cultural exchange program and filtered through the universitys department of oriental studies christ every pawn was in place excuse for what for being where he was not large crowds mingling among the exhibits certain people paid to swear you were there thats ridiculous not to say patently amateurish i dont pay you were paid i was how through the same bank you used before in zurich the gemeinschaft in zurich on the bahnhofstrasse of course odd i havent received a statement said david listening carefully when you were jason bourne in europe you never needed one for yours was a threezero account the most secret which is very secret indeed in switzerland however we found a drafttransfer made out to the gemeinschaft among the papers of a man a dead man of course of course but not the man i supposedly killed certainly not but one who ordered that man killed along with a treasured prize of my employer a prize is a trophy isnt it both are won mr bourne enough you are you get to the regent hotel in kowloon register under any name you wish but ask for suite sixninezero say you believe arrangements were made to reserve it how convenient my own rooms it will save time itll also take me time to make arrangements here we are certain you will not raise alarms and will move as rapidly as you can be there by the end of the week count on both put my wife back on the line i regret i cannot do that for christs sake you can hear everything we say you will speak with her in kowloon there was an echoing click and he could hear nothing on the line but static he replaced the phone his grip so intense a cramp had formed between his thumb and forefinger he removed his hand and shook it violently his grip still intact he was grateful that the pain allowed him to reenter reality more gradually he grabbed his right hand with his left held it steady and pressed his left thumb into the cramp and as he watched his fingers spread free he knew what he had to do without wasting an hour on the allimportant unimportant trivia he had to reach conklin in washington the gutter rat who had tried to kill him in broad daylight on new yorks st street alex drunk or sober made no distinction between the hours of day and night nor did the operations he knew so well for there was no night and day where his work was concerned there was only the flat light of fluorescent tubes in offices that never closed if he had to he would press alexander conklin until the blood rolled out of the gutter rats eyes he would learn what he had to know knowing that conklin could get the information webb rose unsteadily from the chair walked out of his study and into the kitchen where he poured himself a drink grateful again that although his hand still trembled it did so less than before he could delegate certain things jason bourne never delegated anything but he was still david webb and there were several people on campus he could trust certainly not with the truth but with a useful lie by the time he returned to his study and the telephone he had chosen his conduit conduit for gods sake a word from the past he thought he had been free to forget but the young man would do what he asked the graduate students masters thesis would ultimately be graded by his adviser one david webb use the advantage whether its total darkness or blinding sunlight but use it to frighten or use it with compassion whatever worked hello james its david webb hi mr webb whered i screw up you havent jim things have screwed up for me and i could use a little extracurricular help would you be interested itll take a little time this weekend the game no just tomorrow morning maybe an hour or so if that then a little bonus in terms of your curriculum vitae if that doesnt sound too horseshit name it well confidentially and id appreciate the confidentiality i have to be away for a week perhaps two and im about to call the powers that be and suggest that you sit in for me its no problem for you its the manchu overthrow and the sinorussian agreements that sound very familiar today nineteenhundred to around nineteenosix said the masters candidate with confidence you can refine it and dont overlook the japanese and port arthur and old teddy roosevelt line it up and draw parallel thats what ive been doing can do will do ill hit the sources what about tomorrow i have to leave tonight jim my wifes already on her way have you got a pencil yes sir you know what they say about piling up newspapers and the mail so i want you to call the newspaper delivery and go down to the post office and tell them both to hold everything sign whatever you have to sign then call the scully agency here in town and speak to jack or adele and tell them to the masters candidate was recruited the next call was far easier than david expected as the president of the university was at a dinner party in his honour at the presidents residence and was far more interested in his forthcoming speech than in an obscure if unusual associate professors leave of absence please reach the dean of studies mr wedd im raising money damn it the dean of studies was not so easily handled david has this anything to do with those people who were walking around with you last week i mean after all old boy im one of the few people here who know that you were involved with some very hushhush things in washington nothing whatsoever doug that was nonsense from the beginning this isnt my brother was seriously injured his car completely written off ive got to get over to paris for a few days maybe a week thats all i was in paris two years ago the drivers are absolute maniacs no worse than boston doug and a hell of a lot better than cairo well i suppose i can make arrangements a week isnt that long and johnson was out for nearly a month with pneumonia ive already made arrangements with your approval of course jim crowther a masters candidate will fill in for me its material he knows and hell do a good job oh yes crowther a bright young man in spite of his beard never did trust beards but then i was here in the sixties try growing one it may set you free tit let that go by are you sure this hasnt anything to do with those people from the state department i really must have the facts david whats your brothers name what paris hospital is he in i dont know the hospital but marie probably does she left this morning goodbye doug ill call you tomorrow or the next day i have to get down to logan airport in boston david yes why do i feel youre not being entirely truthful with me webb remembered because ive never been in this position before he said asking a favour from a friend because of someone id rather hot think about david hung up the phone the flight from boston to washington was maddening because of a fossilized professor of pedantry david never did get the course who had the seat next to his the mans voice droned on throughout the flight it was only when they landed at national airport that the pedant admitted the truth ive been a bore but do forgive me im terrified of flying so i just keep chattering silly isnt it not at all but why didnt you say so its hardly a crime fear of peer pressure or scoffing condemnation i imagine ill remember that the next time im sitting next to someone like you webb smiled briefly maybe i could help thats kind of you and very honest thank you thank you so much youre welcome david retrieved his suitcase from the luggage belt and went outside for a taxi annoyed that the cabs were not taking single fares but insisting on two or more passengers going in the same direction his backseat companion was a woman an attractive woman who used body language in concert with imploring eyes it made no sense to him so he made no sense of her thanking her for dropping him off first he registered at the jefferson hotel on th street under a false name invented at the moment the hotel however was not an impulse it was a block and a half from conklins apartment the same apartment the cia officer had lived in for nearly twenty years when he was not in the field it was an address david made sure to get before he left virginia again instinct visceral distrust he had a telephone number as well but knew it was useless he could not phone conklin the onetime deep cover strategist would mount defences more mental than physical and webb wanted to confront an unprepared man there would be no warning only a presence demanding a debt that was owed and must now be paid david glanced at his watch it was ten minutes to midnight as good a time as any and better than most he washed changed his shirt and finally dug out one of the two dismantled guns from his suitcase removing it from the thick foillined bag he snapped the parts in place tested the firing mechanism and shoved the clip into the receiving chamber he held the weapon out and studied his hand satisfied that there was no tremor it felt clean and unremarkable eight hours ago he would not have believed he could hold a gun in his hand for fear he might fire it that was eight hours ago not now now it was comfortable a part of him an extension of jason bourne he left the jefferson and walked down th street turning right at the corner and noting the descending numbers of the old apartments very old apartments reminding him of the brownstones on the upper east side of new york there was a curious logic in the observation considering conklins role in the treadstone project he thought treadstone s sterile house in manhattan had been a brownstone an odd bulging structure with upper windows of tinted blue glass he could see it so clearly hear the voices so clearly without really understanding the incubating factory for jason bourne do it again who is the face whats his background his method of kill wrong youre wrong do it again whos this whats the connection to carlos damn it think there can be no mistakes a brownstone where his other self was created the man he needed so much now there it was conklins apartment he was on the first floor facing front the lights were on alex was home and awake webb crossed the street aware that a misty drizzle had suddenly filled the air diffusing the glare of the streetlamps halos beneath the orbs of rippled glass he walked up the steps and opened the door to the short foyer he stepped inside and studied the names under the mailboxes of the six flats each had a webbed circle under the name into which a caller announced himself there was no time for complicated invention if panovs verdict was accurate his voice would be sufficient he pressed conklins button and waited for a response it came after the better part of a minute yes whos there harry babcock heah said david the accent exaggerated ive got to see you alex harry what the hell sure sure come on up the buzzer droned broken off once a finger momentarily displaced david went inside and ran up the narrow staircase to the first floor hoping to be outside conklins door when he opened it he arrived less than a second before alex who with his eyes only partially focused pulled back the door and began to scream webb lunged clamping his hand across conklins face twisting the cia man around in a hammerlock and kicking the door shut he had not physically attacked a person for as long as he could remember with any accuracy it should have been strange even awkward but it was neither it was perfectly natural oh christ im going to take my hand away alex but if you raise your voice it goes back and you wont survive if it does is that clear david removed his hand yanking conklins head back as he did so youre one hell of a surprise said the cia man coughing and lurching into a limp as he was released you also call for a drink i gather its a pretty steady diet we are what we are answered conklin awkwardly reaching down for an empty glass on the coffee table in front of a large wellworn couch he carried it over to a copperplated dry bar against the wall where identical bottles of bourbon stood in a single row there were no mixers no water just an ice bucket it was not a bar for guests it was for the host in residence its gleaming metal proclaiming it to be an extravagance the resident permitted himself the rest of the living room was not in its class somehow that copper bar was a statement to what continued conklin pouring himself a drink do i owe this dubious pleasure you refused to see me in virginia said youd kill me and thats a fact thats what you said youd kill me if i walked through the door you said that youre drunk probably but then i usually am around this time do you want to start out with a lecture it wont do a hell of a lot of good but give it the old college try if you want to youre sick no im drunk thats what you said am i repeating myself ad nauseam sorry about that conklin replaced the bottle took several swallows from his glass and looked at webb i didnt walk through your door you came through mine but i suppose thats immaterial did you come here to finally carry out your threat to fulfil the prophecy to put past wrongs to rights or whatever you call it that rather obvious flat bulge under your jacket i doubt is a pint of whisky i no longer have an overriding urge to see you dead but yes i may kill you you could provoke that urge very easily fascinating how could i do that by not providing me with what i need and you can provide it you must know something i dont i know youve got twenty years in grey to black operations and that you wrote the book on most of them history muttered the cia man drinking its revivable unlike mine your memorys intact mines limited but not yours i need information i need answers to what for what they took my wife away said david simply ice in that simplicity they took marie away from me conklins eyes blinked through his fixed stare say that again i dont think i heard you right you heard and you bastards are somewhere deep down in the rotten scenario not me i wouldnt i couldnt what the hell are you saying maries gone shes in a plane over the pacific im to follow im to fly to kowloon youre crazy youre out of your mind you listen to me alex you listen carefully to everything i tell you again the words poured forth but now with a control he had not been able to summon with morris panov conklin drunk had sharper perceptions than most sober men in the intelligence community and he had to understand webb could not allow any lapses in the narrative it had to be clear from the beginning from that moment when he spoke to marie over the gymnasium phone and heard her say david come home theres someone here you must see quickly darling as he talked conklin limped unsteadily across the room to the couch and sat down his eyes never once leaving webbs face when david had finished describing the hotel around the corner alex shook his head and reached for his drink its eerie he said after a period of silence of intense concentration fighting the clouds of alcohol he put the glass down its as though a strategy was mounted and went off the wire off the wire out of control how i dont know went on the former tactician weaving slightly trying not to slur his words youre given a script that may or may not be accurate then the targets change your wife for you and its played out you react predictably but when you mention medusa youre told in no uncertain terms that youll be burned if you persist thats predictable its no way to prime a subject suddenly your wifes on a back burner and medusas the overriding danger someone miscalculated somethings off a wire something happened youve got whats left of tonight and tomorrow to get me some answers im on the seven p m flight to hong kong conklin sat forward shaking his head slowly and with his right hand trembling again reached for his bourbon youre in the wrong part of town he said swallowing i thought you knew you made a tight little allusion to the sauce im useless to you im off limits a basket case no one tells me anything and why should they im a relic webb nobody wants to have a goddamned thing to do with me im washed out and up and one more step ill be beyondsalvage which i believe is a phrase locked in that crazy head of yours yes it is kill him he knows too much maybe you want to put me there is that it feed him wake up the sleeping medusa and make sure he gets it from his own that would balance you put me there said david taking the gun out of the holster under his jacket yes i did agreed conklin nodding his head and gazing at the weapon because i knew delta and as far as i was concerned anything was possible id seen you in the field my god you blew a mans head off one of your own men in tarn quan because you believed you didnt know you believed he was radioing a platoon on the ho chi minh no charges no defence just another swift execution in the jungle it turned out you were right but you might have been wrong you could have brought him in we might have learned things but no not delta he made up his own rules sure you could have turned in zurich i dont have the specifics about tam quan but others did said david in quiet anger i had to get nine men out of there there wasnt room for a tenth who could have slowed us down or bolted giving away our position good your rules youre inventive so find a parallel here and for christs sake pull the trigger like you did with him our bona fide jason bourne i told you in paris to do it breathing hard conklin paused and leveled his bloodshot eyes at webb he spoke in a plaintive whisper i told you then and i tell you now put me out of it i dont have the guts we were friends alex shouted david you came to our house you ate with us and played with the kids you swam with them in the river oh my god lit was all coming back the images the faces oh christ the faces the bodies floating in circles of water arid blood control yourself reject them reject only now now that was in another country david and besides i dont think you want me to complete the line besides the wench is dead no id prefer you didnt repeat the line no matter what said conklin hoarsely swallowing most of his whisky we were both erudite werent we i cant help you yes you can you will get off it soldier theres no way debts are owed you call them in im calling yours sorry you can pull that trigger any time you want but if you dont im not putting myself beyondsalvage or blowing everything thats coming to me legitimately coming to me if im allowed to go to pasture i intend to graze well they took enough i want some back the cia officer got up from the couch and awkwardly walked across the room towards the copper bar his limp was more pronounced than webb ever remembered it his right foot no more serviceable than an encased stump dragged at an angle across the floor the effort painfully obvious the legs worse isnt it asked david curtly ill live with it youll die with it too said webb raising his automatic because i cant live without my wife and you dont give a goddamn do you know what that makes you alex after everything you did to us all the lies the traps the scum you used to nail us with you interrupted conklin filling his glass and staring at the gun not her kill one of us you kill us both but you wouldnt understand that i never had the luxury your lousy selfpity wouldnt let you you just want to wallow in it all by yourself and let the booze do the thinking there but for a fucking land mine goes the director or the monk or the grey fox the angleton of the eighties youre pathetic youve got your life your mind jesus take them away shoot pull the goddamn trigger but leave me something conklin suddenly swallowed his entire drink an extended rolling retching cough followed after the spasm he looked at david his eyes watery the red veins pronounced you think i wouldnt try to help if i could you son of a bitch he whispered huskily you think i like all that thinking i indulge myself in youre the one whos dense the one whos stubborn david you dont understand do you the cia man held the glass in front of him with two fingers and let it drop to the hard wood floor it shattered fragments flying in all directions then he spoke his voice a highpitched singsong as a sad smile crept across his lips beneath the rheumy eyes i cant stand another failure old friend and id fail believe me id kill you both and i just dont think i could live with that webb lowered the gun not with what youve got in your head not with what youve learned anyway ill take my chances my options are limited and i choose you to be honest i dont know anyone else also ive several ideas maybe even a plan but its got to be set up at high speed oh conklin held on to the bar to steady himself may i make some coffee alex black coffee had a sobering effect on conklin but nowhere near the effect of davids confidence in him the former jason bourne respected the talents of his past most deadly enemy and let him know it they talked until four in the morning refining the blurred outlines of a strategy basing it on reality but carrying it much further and as the alcohol diminished conklin began to function he began to give shape to what david had formulated only vaguely he perceived the basic soundness of webbs approach and found the words youre describing a spreading crisis situation mounted in the face of maries abduction then sending it off the wire with lies but as you said its got to be set off at high speed hitting them hard and fast with no let up use the complete truth first interrupted webb speaking rapidly i broke in here threatening to kill you i made accusations based on everything thats happened from mcallisters scenario to babcocks statement that theyd send out an execution team to find me to that anglicized voice of dry ice who told me to ceaseanddesist with medusa or theyd call me insane and put me back in a mental stockade none of it can be denied it did happen and im threatening to expose everything including medusa then we spiral off into the big lie said conklin pouring more coffee a breakaway so out of sight that it throws everything and everybody into a corkscrew turn such as i dont know yet well have to think about it its got to be something totally unexpected something that will unbalance the strategists whoever they are because every instinct tells me that somewhere they lost control if im right one of them will have to make contact then get out your notebooks insisted david start going back and reach five or six people who are logical contenders that could take hours even days objected the cia officer the barricades are up and id have to get around them we dont have the time you dont have the time there has to be time start moving theres a better way countered alex panov gave it to you mo yes the logs at state the official logs the logs webb had momentarily forgotten conklin had not in what way its where they started to build the new file on you ill reach internal security with another version at least a variation that will call for answers from someone if im right if its gone off the wire those logs are only an instrument they record they dont confirm accuracy but the security personnel responsible for them will send up rockets if they think the systems been tampered with theyll do our work for us still we need the lie alex said david leaning forward in his chair opposite the long worn couch a few moments ago you used the term breakaway it simply means a disruption in the scenario a break in the pattern i know what it means but how about using it here literally not breakaway but broke away theyre calling me pathological a schizophrenic that means i fantasize i sometimes tell the truth and sometimes not and im not supposed to be able to tell the difference its what theyre saying agreed conklin some of them may even believe it so why dont we take this way up really out of sight well say that marie broke away she reached me and im on my way to meet her alex frowned then gradually widened his eyes the creases disappearing its perfect he said quietly my god its perfect the confusion will spread like a brushfire in any operation this deep only two or three men know all the details the others are kept in the dark jesus can you imagine an officially sanctioned kidnapping a few at the core might actually panic and collide with each other trying to save their asses very good mr bourne oddly enough webb did not resent the name he merely accepted it without thinking listen he said getting to his feet were both exhausted we know where were heading so lets get a couple of hours sleep and go over everything in the morning you and i learned years ago the difference between a scratch of sleep and none at all are you going back to the hotel asked conklin no way replied david looking down at the pale drawn face of the cia man just get me a blanket im staying right here in front of the bar you also should have learned when not to worry about some things said alex rising from the couch and limping towards a closet near the small foyer if this is going to be my last hurrah one way or the other ill give it my best it might even sort things out for me conklin turned having taken a blanket and a pillow from the closet shelf i guess you could call it some kind of weird precognition but do you know what i did last night after work sure i do among other clues theres a broken glass on the floor no i mean before that what i stopped off at the supermarket and bought a ton of food steak eggs milk even that glue they call oatmeal i mean i never do that you were ready for a ton of food it happens when it does i go to a restaurant whats your point you sleep the couch is big enough im going to eat i want to think some more im going to cook a steak maybe some eggs too you need sleep two two and a half hoursll be fine then ill probably have some of that goddamned oatmeal alexander conklin walked down the corridor of the state departments th floor his limp lessened through sheer determination the pain more so because of it he knew what was happening to him there was a job facing him that he wanted very much to do well even brilliantly if that term had any relevance for him any longer alex realized that months of abusing the blood and the body could not be overcome in a matter of hours but something within him could be summoned it was a sense of authority laced with righteous anger jesus the irony a year ago he had wanted to destroy the man they called jason bourne now it was a sudden growing obsession to help david webb because he had wrongfully tried to kill jason bourne it could place him beyond salvage he understood that but it was right that the risk was his perhaps conscience did not always produce cowards sometimes it made a man feel better about himself and look better he considered he had forced himself to walk many more blocks than he should have letting the cold autumn wind in the streets bring a colour to his face that had not been there in years combined with a clean shave and a pressed pinstripe suit he had not worn in months he bore little resemblance to the man webb found last night the rest was performance he knew that too as he approached the sacrosanct double doors of the state departments chief of internal security little time was spent on formalities even less on informal conversation at conklins request read agency demand an aide left the room and he faced the rugged former brigadier general from the armys g who now headed states internal security alex intended to take command with his first words im not here on an interagency diplomatic mission general it is general isnt it im still called that yes so i dont give a damn about being diplomatic do you understand me im beginning not to like you i understand that that said conklin is the least of my concerns what does concern me however is a man named david webb what about him him the fact that you recognize the name so readily isnt very reassuring whats going on general do you want a megaphone spook said the exsoldier curtly i want answers corporal thats what you and this office are to us back off conklin when you called me with your socalled emergency and switchboard verification i did a little verifying myself that big reputation of yours is a little wobbly these days and i use the term on good advice youre a lush spook and no secrets been made about it so youve got less than a minute to say what you want to say before i throw you out take your choice the elevator or the window alex had calculated the probability that his drinking would be telegraphed he stared at the chief of internal security and spoke evenly even sympathetically general ill answer that accusation with one sentence and if it ever reaches anyone else ill know where it came from and so will the agency conklin paused his eyes clear and penetrating our profiles are often what we want them to be for reasons we cant talk about im sure you understand what i mean the state department man received alexs gaze with a reluctantly sympathetic one of his own oh christ i he said softly we used to give dishonourables to men we were sending out in berlin often at our suggestion agreed conklin nodding and its all well say on the subject okay okay i was out of line but i can tell you the profiles working i was told by one of your deputy directors that id pass out at your breath with you halfway across the room i dont even want to know who he is general because i might laugh in his face as it happens i dont drink alex had a childhood compulsion to cross his fingers somewhere out of sight or his legs or his toes but no method came to him lets get back to david webb he added sharply no quarter in his voice whats your beef my beef my goddamned life soldier somethings going on and i want to know what it is that son of a bitch broke into my apartment last night and threatened to kill me he made some pretty wild accusations naming men on your payroll like harry babcock samuel teasdale and william lanier we checked theyre in your covert division and still practising what the hell did they do one made it plain youd send out an execution team after him what kind of language is that another told him to go back to a hospital hes been in two hospitals and our combined very private clinic in virginia we all put him there and hes got a clean bill hes also got some secrets in his head none of us wants out but that man is ready to explode because of something you idiots did or let happen or closed your fucking eyes to he claims to have proof that you walked back into his life and turned it around that you set him up and took a hell of a lot more than a pound of flesh what proof asked the stunned general he spoke to his wife said conklin in a sudden monotone so she was taken from their home by two men who sedated her and put her on a private jet she was flown to the west coast you mean she was kidnapped youve got it and what should make you swallow hard is that she overheard the two of them talking to the pilot and gathered that the whole dirty business had something to do with the state department for reasons unknown but the name mcallister was mentioned for your enlightenment hes one of your undersecretaries from the fast east section this is nuts ill tell you whats more than nuts mine and yours in a crushed salad she got away during a refuelling stop in san francisco thats when she reached webb back in maine hes on his way to meet her god knows where but youd better have some solid answers unless you can establish the fact that hes a lunatic who may have killed his wife which i hope you can and that there was no abduction which i sincerely hope there wasnt hes certifiable cried the chief of states internal security i read those logs i had to someone else called about this webb last night dont ask me who i cant tell you what the hell is going on demanded conklin leaning across the desk his hands on the edge as much for support as for effect hes paranoid what can i say he makes things up and believes them thats not what the government doctors determined said conklin icily i happen to know something about that i dont damn it you probably never will agreed alex but as a surviving member of the treadstone operation i want you to reach someone who can say the right words and put my mind at ease somebody over here has opened up a can of worms we intend to keep a tight lid on conklin took out a small notebook and a ballpoint pen he wrote down a number tore off the page and dropped it on the desk thats a sterile phone a trace would only give you a false address his eyes were hard his voice firm the slight tremble even ominous its to be used between three and four this afternoon no other time have someone reach me then i dont care who it is or how you do it maybe youll have to call one of your celebrated policy conferences but i want answers we want answers you could be all wet you know i hope i am but if im not you people over here are going to get strung up hard because youve crossed over into offlimits territory david was grateful that there were so many things to do for without them he might plummet into a mental limbo and become paralysed by the strain of knowing both too much and too little after conklin left for langley he had returned to the hotel and started his inevitable list lists calmed him they were preliminaries to necessary activity and forced him to concentrate on specific items rather than on the reasons for selecting them brooding over the reasons would cripple his mind as severely as a land mine had crippled conklins right foot he could not think about alex either there were too many possibilities and impossibilities nor could he phone his once and former enemy conklin was thorough he was the best the exstrategist projected each action and its subsequent reaction and his first determination was that within minutes of his call to the state departments chief of internal security other telephones would be used and two specific phones undoubtedly tapped both his in his apartment and at langley therefore to avoid any interruptions or interceptions he did not intend to return to his office he would meet david at the airport later minutes before webbs flight to hong kong you think you got here without someone following you he had said to webb im not certain of that theyre programming you and when someone punches a keyboard he keeps his eye on the constant number will you please speak english or mandarin i can handle those but not that horseshit they could have a microphone under your bed i trust youre not a closet somethingorother there would be no contact until they met at the lounge at dulles airport which was why david now stood at a cashiers counter in a luggage store on wyoming avenue he was buying an outsized flight bag to replace his suitcase he had discarded much of his clothing things precautions were coming back to him among them the unwarranted risk of waiting in an airports luggage area and since he wanted the greater anonymity of economy class a carryon twosuiter might be disallowed he would buy whatever he needed wherever he was and that meant he had to have a great deal of money for any number of contingencies this fact determined his next stop a bank on th street a year before while the government probers were examining what was left of his memory marie had quietly rapidly withdrawn the funds david had left in zurichs gemeinschaft bank as well as those he had transferred to paris as jason bourne she had wired the money to the cayman islands where she knew a canadian banker and established an appropriately confidential account considering what washington had done to her husband the damage to his mind the physical suffering and near loss of life because men refused to hear his tries for help she was letting the government off lightly if david had decided to sue and in spite of everything it was not out of the question any astute attorney would go into court seeking damages upwards of million not roughly fiveplus she had speculated aloud about her thoughts on legal redress with an extremely nervous deputy director of the central intelligence agency she did not discuss the missing funds other than to say that with her financial training she was appalled to learn that so little protection had been given the american taxpayers hardearned dollars she had delivered this criticism in a shocked if gentle voice but her eyes were saying something else the lady was a highly intelligent highly motivated tiger and her message got through so wiser and more cautious men saw the logic of her speculations and let the matter drop the funds were buried under topsecret eyesonly contingency appropriations whenever additional money was needed a trip a car the house marie or david would call their banker in the caymans and he would credit the funds by wire to any of five dozen reciprocating banks in europe the united states the pacific islands and the far east from a pay phone on wyoming avenue webb placed a collect call mildly astonishing his friendly banker by the amount of money he needed immediately and the funds he wanted available in hong kong the collect call came to less than the money to over half a million dollars i assume that my dear friend the wise and glorious marie approves david she told me to call you she said she cant be bothered with trifles how like her the banks you will use are webb walked through the thick glass doors of the bank on th street spent twenty irritating minutes with a vicepresident who tried too hard to be an instant chum and walked out with forty in bills the rest a mix he then hailed a cab and was driven to an apartment in dc north west where lived a man he had known in his days as jason bourne a man who had done extraordinary work for the state departments treadstone the man was a silverhaired black who had been a taxi driver until one day a passenger left a hasselblad camera in his car and never put in a claim that was years ago and for several years the cabbie had experimented and had found his true vocation quite simply he was a genius at alteration his speciality being passports and drivers licences with photographs and i d cards for those who had come in conflict with the law in the main with felony arrests david had not remembered the man but under panovs hypnosis he had said the name improbably it was cactus and mo had brought the photographer to virginia to help jar a part of webbs memory there had been warmth and concern in the old black mans eyes on his first visit and although it was an inconvenience he had requested permission from panov to visit david once a week why cactus hes troubled sir i saw that through the lens a couple of years ago theres somethin missin in him but for all of that hes a good man i can talk to him i like him sir come whenever you like cactus and please cancel that sir stuff reserve the privilege for me sir my how times change i call one of my grandchildren a good nigger he wants to stomp on my head he should sir webb got out of the taxi asking the driver to wait but he refused david left a minimum tip and walked up the overgrown flagstone path to the old house in some ways it reminded him of the house in maine too large too fragile and too much in need of repair he and marie had decided to buy on the beach as soon as a year was up it was unseemly for a newly appointed associate professor to move into the most expensive district upon arrival he rang the bell the door opened and cactus squinting under a green eyeshade greeted him as casually as if they had seen each other several days ago you got hubcaps on your car david no car and no taxi it wouldnt stay musta heard all those unfounded rumours circulated by the fascist press me i got three machine guns in the windows come on in ive missed you why didnt you call this old boy your numbers not listed cactus musta been an oversight they chatted for several minutes in cactuss kitchen long enough for the photographer specialist to realize webb was in a hurry the old man led david into his studio placed webbs three passports under an angled lamp for close inspection and instructed his client to sit in front of an openlensed camera well make the hair light ash but not as blond as you were after paris that ash tone varies with the lighting and we can use the same picture on each of these lil dears with considerable differences still retaining the face leave the eyebrows alone ill mess with them here what about the eyes asked david no time for those fancy contacts they got you before but we can handle it theyre regular glasses with just the right tinted prisms in the right places you got blue eyes or brown eyes or spanish armada black if you want em get all three said webb theyre expensive david and cash only ive got it on me dont let it get around now the hair who down the street an associate of mine who had her own beauty shop until the gendarmes checked the upstairs rooms she does fine work come on ill take you over an hour later webb ducked out from under a hair dryer in the small welllighted cubicle and surveyed the results in the large mirror the beauticianowner of the odd salon a short black lady with neat grey hair and an appraisers eye stood alongside him its you but it aint you she said first nodding her head then shaking it a fine job ive got to say it it was thought david looking at himself his dark hair not only was far far lighter but matched the skin tones of his face also the hair itself seemed lighter in texture a groomed but much more casual look windblown the advertisements phrased it the man he was staring at was both himself and someone else who bore a striking resemblance but was not him i agree said webb its very good how much three hundred dollars replied the woman simply of course that includes five packets of custommade rinse powder with instructions and the tightest lips in washington the first will hold you for a couple of months the second for the rest of your life youre all heart david reached into his pocket for his leather money clip counted out the bills and gave them to her cactus said youd call him when we were finished no need to hes got his timing down hes in the parlour the parlour oh i guess its a hallway with a settee and a floor lamp but i do so like to call it a parlour sounds nice dont it the photo session went swiftly interrupted by cactuss reshaping his eyebrows with a toothbrush and a spray for the three separate shots and changing shirts and jackets cactus had a wardrobe worthy of a costume supply house and wearing in turn two pairs of glasses tortoiseshell and steelrimmed which altered his hazel eyes respectively to blue and brown the specialist then proceeded to insert the photos in place and under a large powerful magnifying glass skillfully stamped out the original state department perforations with a tool of his own design when he had finished he handed the three passports to david for his approval aint no customs jockey gonna pick on them said cactus confidently they look more authentic than they did before i cleaned em up which is to say i gave em a few creases and some ageing its terrific work old friend older than i can remember i know that what do i owe you oh hell i dont know it was such a little job and its been such a big year what with all the hasslin goin on how much cactus whats comfortable i dont figure youre on uncles payroll im doing very nicely thanks five hundreds fine call me a cab will you takes too long and thats if you can get one out here my grandsons waiting for you hell drive you wherever you want to go hes like me he dont ask questions and youre in a hurry david i can sense that come on ill see you to the door thanks ill leave the cash here on the counter fine removing the money from his pocket his back to cactus webb counted out six bills and left them in the darkest area of the studio counter at apiece the passports were a gift but to leave more might offend his old friend he returned to the hotel getting out of the car several blocks away in the middle of a busy intersection so that cactuss grandson could not be compromised where an address was concerned the young man as it happened was a senior at american university and although he obviously adored his grandfather he was just as obviously apprehensive about being any part of the old mans endeavors ill get out here said david in the stalled traffic thanks responded the young black his voice pleasantly calm his intelligent eyes showing relief i appreciate it webb looked at him why did you do it i mean for someone whos going to be a lawyer id think your antenna would work overtime around cactus it does constantly but hes a great old guy whos done a lot for me also he said something to me he said it would be a privilege for me to meet you that maybe years from now hed tell me who the stranger was in my car i hope i can come back a lot sooner and tell you myself im no privilege but theres a story to tell that could end up in the law books goodbye back in his hotel room david faced a final list that needed no items written out he knew them he had to select the few clothes he would take in the large flight bag and get rid of the rest of his possessions including the two weapons that in his outrage he had brought down from maine it was one thing to dismantle and wrap in foil the parts of a gun to be placed in a suitcase and quite another to carry weapons through a security gate they would be picked up he would be picked up he had to wipe them clean destroy the firing pins and trigger housings and drop them into a sewer he would buy a weapon in hong kong it was not a difficult purchase there was a last thing he had to do and it was difficult and painful he had to force himself to sit down and rethink everything that had been said by edward mcallister that early evening in maine everything they all had said in particular maries words something was buried somewhere in that highly charged hour of revelation and confrontation and david knew he had missed it was missing it he looked at his watch it was the day was passing quickly nervously he had to hold on oh god marie where are you conklin put down his glass of flat ginger ale on the scratched soiled bar of the seedy establishment on th street he was a regular patron for the simple reason that no one in his professional circles and what was left of his social one would ever walk through the filthy glass doors there was a certain freedom in that knowledge and the other patrons accepted him the gimp who always took off his tie the moment he entered limping his way to a stool by the pinball machine at the end of the bar and whenever he did the rocksglass filled with bourbon was waiting for him also the ownerbartender had no objections to alex receiving calls at the stillstanding antiquated booth against the wall it was his sterile phone and it was ringing now conklin trudged across the floor entered the old booth and closed the door he picked up the phone yes he said is this treadstone asked an oddsounding male voice i was there were you no i wasnt but im cleared for the file for the whole mess the voice thought alex how had webb described it anglicized midatlantic refined certainly not ordinary it was the same man the gnomes had been working they had made progress someone was afraid then im sure your memory corresponds with everything ive written down because i was there and i have written it down written it all down facts names events substantiations backups everything including the story webb told me last night then i can assume that if anything ugly happened your voluminous reportage will find its way to a senate subcommittee or a pack of congressional watchdogs am i right im glad we understand each other it wouldnt do any good said the man condescendingly if anything ugly happened i wouldnt care would it youre about to retire you drink a great deal i didnt always theres usually a reason for both of those things for a man of my age and competence could they be admittedly tied into a certain file forget it lets talk not before you say something a little closer treadstone was bandied about here and there its not that substantive all right medusa stronger said alex but not strong enough very well the creation of jason bourne the monk warmer missing funds unaccounted for and never recovered estimated to be around five million dollars zurich paris and points west there were rumours i need a capstone ill give it to you the execution of jason bourne the date was may twentythird in tarn quan and the same day in new york four years later on seventyfirst street treadstone conklin closed his eyes and breathed deeply feeling the hollowness in his throat all right he said quietly youre in the circle i cant give you my name what are you going to give me two words back off you think ill accept that you have to said the voice his words precise bourne is needed where hes going bourne alex stared at the phone yes jason bourne he cant be recruited in any normal way we both know that so you steal his wife from him goddamned animals she wont be harmed you cant guarantee that you dont have the controls youve got to be using second and third parties right now and if i know my business and i do theyre probably paid blinds so you cant be traced you dont even know who they are my god you wouldnt have called me if you did if you could reach them and get the verifications you want you wouldnt be talking to me the cultured voice paused then we both lied didnt we mr conklin there was no escape on the womans part no call to webb nothing you went fishing and so did i and we both came up with nothing youre a barracuda mr noname youve been where i am mr conklin right down to david webb now what can you tell me alex again felt the hollowness in his throat now joined with a sharp pain in his chest youve lost them havent you he whispered youve lost her fortyeight hours isnt permanent said the voice guardedly but youve been trying like hell to make contact accused conklin youve called in your conduits the people who hired the blinds and suddenly theyre not there you cant find them jesus you have lost control it did go off the wire someone walked in on your strategy and you have no idea who it is he played your scenario and took it away from you our safeguards are spread out objected the man without the conviction he had displayed during the past moments the best men in the field are working every district including mcallister in kowloon hong kong you know that i know mcallisters a damn fool but hes good at what he does and yes hes there were not panicked well recover recover what asked alex filled with anger the merchandise your strategys aborted someone else is in charge why would he give you back the merchandise youve killed webbs wife mr noname what the hell did you think you were doing we just wanted to get him over there replied the voice defensively explain things show him we need him then the man resumed his calm delivery and for all we know everythings still on the wire communications are notoriously bad in that part of the world the exculpa for everything in this business in most businesses mr conklin how do you read it now im the one whos asking very sincerely you have a certain reputation had noname reputations cant be taken away or contradicted only added to positively or negatively of course youre a font of unwarranted information you know that im also right its said you were one of the best how do you read it alex shook his head in the booth the air was close the noise outside his sterile phone growing louder in the seedy bar on th street what i said before someone found out what you people were planning mounting for webb and decided to take over for gods sake why because whoever it is wants jason bourne more than you do alex said and hung up it was when conklin walked into the lounge at dulles airport he had waited in a taxi down the street from webbs hotel and had followed david giving the driver precise instructions he had been right but there was no point in burdening webb with the knowledge two grey plymouths had picked up davids cab and alternately exchanged positions during the surveillance so be it one alexander conklin might be hanged and then again he might not people at state were behaving stupidly he had thought as he wrote down the licence numbers he spotted webb in a darkened back booth it is you isnt it said alex dragging his dead foot into the banquette do blonds really have more fun it worked in paris what did you find i found slugs under rocks who cant find their way up out of the ground but then they wouldnt know what to do with the sunlight would they sunlights illuminating youre not cut the crap alex i have to get to the gate in a few minutes in short words they worked out a strategy to get you over to kowloon it was based on a previous experience you can skip that said david why the man said they needed you not you webb they needed bourne because they say bournes already there i told you what mcallister said did he go into it no he wasnt going to give me that much but maybe i can use it to press them however he told me something else david and you have to know it they cant find their conduits so they dont know who the blinds are or whats happening they think its temporary but theyve lost marie somebody else wants you out there and hes taken over webb brought his hand to his forehead his eyes closed and suddenly in silence the tears fell down his cheeks im back alex back into so much i cant remember i love her so i need her so cut it out ordered conklin you made it clear to me last night that i still had a mind if not much of a body you have both make them sweat how be what they want you to be be the chameleon be jason bourne its been so long you can still do it play the scenario theyve given you i dont have any choice do it over the loudspeakers came the last call for flight to hong kong the greyhaired havilland replaced the phone in its cradle leaned back in his chair and looked across the room at mcallister the undersecretary of state was standing next to a huge revolving globe of the world that was perched on an ornamental tripod in front of a bookcase his index finger was on the southernmost part of china but his eyes were on the ambassador its done said the diplomat hes on the plane to kowloon its godawful replied mcallister im sure it appears that way to you but before you render judgement weigh the advantages were free now we are no longer responsible for the events that take place they are being manipulated by an unknown party which is us i repeat its godawful has your god considered the consequences if we fail were given free will only our ethics restrict us a banality mr undersecretary theres the greater good theres also a human being a man were manipulating driving him back into his nightmares do we have that right we have no choice he can do what no one else can do if we give him a reason mcallister spun the globe it whirled around as he walked towards the desk perhaps i shouldnt say it but i will he said standing in front of raymond havilland i think youre the most immoral man ive ever met appearances mr undersecretary i have one saving grace which supersedes all the sins i have committed i will go to any lengths indulge in all venalities to stop this planet from blowing itself up and that includes the life of one david webb known where i want him as jason bourne the mists rose like layers of diaphanous scarves above victoria harbour as the huge jet circled for the final approach into kai tak airport the early morning haze was dense the promise of a humid day in the colony below on the water the junks and sampans bobbed beside the outlying freighters the squat barges the chugging multitiered ferries and the occasional marine patrols that swept through the harbour as the plane descended into the kowloon airport the serried ranks of skyscrapers on the island of hong kong took on the appearance of alabaster giants reaching up through the mists and reflecting the first penetrating light of the morning sun webb studied the scene below as a man under a horrible strain and as one consumed by an eerily detached curiosity down there somewhere in the seething vastly overpopulated territory was marie that was uppermost in his thoughts and the most agonizing to think about yet another part of him was like a scientist filled with a cold anxiety as he peered into the clouded lens of a microscope trying to discern what his eye and his mind could understand the familiar and the unfamiliar were joined and the result was bewilderment and fear during panovs sessions in virginia david had read and reread hundreds of travel folders and illustrated brochures describing all the places the mythical jason bourne was known to have been it was a continuous often painful exercise in selfprobing fragments would come to him in flashes of recognition many were all too brief and confusing others prolonged his sudden memories astonishingly accurate the descriptions his own not those of travel agents manuals as he looked down now he saw much that he knew he knew but could not specifically remember so he looked away and concentrated on the day ahead he had wired the regent hotel in kowloon from dulles airport requesting a room for a week in the name of one james howard cruett the identity on cactuss refined blueeyed passport he had added i believe arrangements were made for our firm with respect to suite sixninezero if it is available arrival day is firm flight is not the suite would be available what he had to find out was who had made it available it was the first step towards marie and either before or after or during the process there were items to purchase some would be simple to buy others not but even finding the more inaccessible would not be impossible this was hong kong the colony of survival and it had the tools of survival it was also the one civilized place on earth where religions flourished but the only commonly acknowledged god of believers and nonbelievers alike was money as marie had put it it has no other reason for being the tepid morning reeked with the odors of a crowded rushing humanity the smells strangely not unpleasant kerbsides were being hosed ferociously steam rising from pavements drying in the sun and the fragrance of herbs boiling in oil wafted through the narrow streets from carts and concessions screeching for attention the noises accumulated they became a series of constant crescendos demanding acceptance and a sale or at least a negotiation hong kong was the essence of survival one worked furiously or one did not survive adam smith was outdone and outdated he could never have conceived of such a world it mocked the disciplines he projected for a free economy it was madness it was hong kong david held up his hand for a taxi knowing that he had done so before knowing the exit doors he had headed for after the prolonged drudgery of customs knowing he knew the streets through which the driver took him not really remembering but somehow knowing it was both a comfort and profoundly terrifying he knew and he did not know he was a marionette being manipulated on the stage of his own sideshow and he did not know who was the puppet or who the puppeteer it was an error said david to the clerk behind the oval marble counter in the centre of the regents lobby i dont want a suite id prefer something smaller a single or a double room will do but the arrangements have been made mr cruett replied the bewildered clerk using the name on webbs false passport who made them the youthful oriental peered down at a signature on the computer printout reservation it was authorized by the assistant manager mr liang then in courtesy i should speak with mr liang shouldnt i im afraid it will be necessary im not sure theres anything else available i understand ill find another hotel you are considered a most important guest sir i will go back and speak with mr liang webb nodded as the clerk reservation in hand ducked under the counter on the far left and walked rapidly across the crowded floor to a door behind the concierges desk david looked around at the opulent lobby which in a sense started outside in the immense circular courtyard with its sprays of tall gushing fountains and extended through the bank of elegant glass doors and across the marble floor to a semicircle of enormously high tinted windows that looked out over victoria harbour the evermoving tableau beyond was a hypnotic miseenscene for the open curving lounge in front of the wall of softcoloured glass there were dozens of small tables and leather settees mostly occupied with uniformed waiters and waitresses scurrying about it was an arena from which tourists and negotiators alike could view the panorama of the harbours commerce played out in front of the rising skyline of the island of hong kong in the distance the watery view outside was familiar to webb but nothing else he had never been inside the extravagant hotel before at least nothing of what he saw aroused any flashes of recognition suddenly his eyes were drawn to the sight of the clerk rushing across the lobby several steps ahead of a middleaged oriental obviously the regents assistant manager mr liang again the younger man ducked under the counter and quickly resumed his position in front of david his accommodating eyes as wide as they could be in anticipation seconds later the hotel executive approached bowing slightly from the waist as befitted his professional station this is mr liang sir announced the clerk may i be of service said the assistant manager and may i say it is a pleasure to welcome you as our guest webb smiled and shook his head politely it may have to be another time im afraid you are displeased with the accommodations mr cruett not at all id probably like them very much but as i told your young man i prefer smaller quarters a single or even a double room but not a suite however i understand there may not be anything available your wire specifically mentioned suite sixninety sir i realize that and i apologize it was the work of an overzealous sales representative webb frowned in a friendly quizzical manner and asked courteously incidentally who did make those arrangements i certainly didnt your representative perhaps offered liang his eyes noncommittal in sales he wouldnt have the authority no he said it was one of the companies over here we cant accept of course but id like to know who made such a generous offer surely mr liang since you personally authorized the reservation you can tell me the noncommittal eyes became more distant then blinked it was enough for david but the charade had to be played out i believe one of our staff our very large staff came to me with the request sir there are so many reservations we are so busy i really cant recall certainly there are billing instructions we have many honoured clients whose word on a telephone is sufficient hong kong has changed and always changing mr cruett it is possible your host wishes to tell you himself it would not be proper to intrude on such wishes your sense of trust is admirable backed by a billing code in the cashiers computer naturally liang attempted a smile it was false well since you have nothing else ill strike out on my own i have friends at the pen across the street said webb referring to the revered peninsula hotel that will not be necessary further arrangements can be made but your clerk said he is not the assistant manager of the regent sir liang briefly glared at the young man behind the counter my screen shows nothing to be available protested the clerk in defence be quiet liang instantly smiled as falsely as before aware that he had undoubtedly lost the charade with his command he is so young they are all so young and inexperienced but very intelligent very willing we keep several rooms in reserve for misunderstood occasions again he looked at the clerk and spoke harshly while smiling ting ruanji he continued rapidly in chinese every word understood by an expressionless webb listen to me you boneless chicken do not offer information in my presence unless i ask you you will be spit from the garbage shoot if you do it again now assign this fool room twozerotwo it is listed as hold remove the listing and proceed the assistant manager his waxen smile even more pronounced turned back to david it is a very pleasant room with a splendid view of the harbour mr cruett the charade was over and the winner minimized his victory with persuasive appreciation im most grateful said david his eyes boring into those of the suddenly insecure liang it will save me the trouble of phoning all over the city telling people where im staying he stopped his right hand partially raised a man about to continue david webb was acting on one of several instincts instincts developed by jason bourne he knew it was the moment to instil fear when you say a room with a splendid view i assume you mean you hao jingse de fangian am i right or is my chinese too foolish the hotel man stared at the american i could not have phrased it better he said softly the clerk will see to everything enjoy your stay with us mr cruett enjoyment must be measured by accomplishment mr liang thats either a very old or very new chinese proverb i dont know which i suspect its new mr cruett its too active for passive reflection which is the soul of confucius as im sure you know isnt that accomplishment you are too swift for me sir liang bowed if theres anything you need dont hesitate to reach me i hardly think that will be necessary but thank you frankly it was a long and dreadful flight so ill ask the switchboard to hold all calls until dinner time oh liangs insecurity became something far more pronounced he was a man afraid but surely if an emergency arises theres nothing that cant wait and since im not in suite sixninety the hotel can simply say im expected later thats plausible isnt it im terribly tired thank you mr liang thank you mr cruett the assistant manager bowed again searching webbs eyes for a last sign he found none and turned quickly nervously and headed back to his office do the unexpected confuse the enemy throw him off balance jason bourne or was it alexander conklin it is a most desirable room sir exclaimed the relieved clerk you will be most pleased mr liang is very accommodating said david i should show my appreciation as indeed i will for your help webb took out his leather money clip and unobtrusively removed an american bill he extended a handshake the bill concealed when does mr liang leave for the day the bewildered but overjoyed young man glanced to his right and left speaking as he did so in disjointed phrases yes you are most kind sir it is not necessary sir but thank you sir mr liang leaves his office every afternoon at five oclock i too leave at that hour i would stay of course if our management requested for i try very hard to do the best i can for the honour of the hotel im sure you do said webb and most capably my key please my luggage will arrive later due to a switch in flights of course sir david sat in the chair by the tinted window looking across the harbour at the island of hong kong names came to him accompanied by images causeway bay wanchai repulse bay aberdeen the mandarin and finally so clear in the distance victoria peak with its awesome view of the entire colony then he saw in his minds eye the masses of humanity meshing through the jammed colourful frequently filthy streets and the crowded hotel lobbies and lounges with their softly lit chandeliers of gold filigree where the welldressed remnants of the empire reluctantly mingled with the emerging chinese entrepreneurs the old crown and the new money had to find accommodation alleyways for some reason thronged and rundown alleyways came into focus figures raced through the narrow thoroughfares crashing into cages of small screeching birds and writhing snakes of various sizes wares of peddlers on the lowest rungs of the territorys ladder of commerce men and women of all ages from children to ancients were dressed in rags and pungent heavy smoke curled slowly upward filling the space between the decaying buildings diffusing the light heightening the gloom of the dark stone walls blackened by use and misuse he saw it all and it all had meaning for him but he did not understand specifics eluded him he had no points of reference and it was maddening marie was out there he had to find her he sprang up from the chair in frustration wanting to pound his head to clear the confusion but he knew it would not help nothing helped only time and he could not stand the strain of time he had to find her hold her protect her as she had once protected him by believing in him when he had not believed in himself he passed the mirror above the bureau and looked at his haggard pale face one thing was clear he had to plan and act quickly but not as the man he saw in the glass he had to bring into play everything he had learned and forgotten as jason bourne from somewhere within him he had to summon the elusive past and trust unremembered instincts he had taken the first step the connection was solid he knew that one way or another liang would provide him with something probably the lowest level of information but it would be a beginning a name a place or a drop an initial contact that would lead to another and still another what he had to do was to move quickly with whatever he was given not giving his enemy time to manoeuvre backing whomever he reached into positions of deliverandsurvive or besilentanddie and mean it but to accomplish anything he had to be prepared items had to be purchased and a tour of the colony arranged he wanted an hour or so of observing from the back seat of an automobile dredging up whatever he could from his damaged memory he picked up a large red leather hotel directory sat on the edge of the bed and opened it thumbing through the pages rapidly the new world shopping centre a magnificent storeyed open complex bringing under one roof the finest goods from the corners of the earth hyperbole notwithstanding the complex was adjacent to the hotel it would do for his purposes limousines available from our fleet of daimler motor cars arrangements can be made by the hour or the day for business or sightseeing please contact the concierge dial limousines also meant experienced chauffeurs knowledgeable in the ways of the confusing streets backstreets roads and traffic patterns of hong kong kowloon and the new territories and knowledgeable in other ways too such men knew the ins and outs and lower depths of the cities they served unless he was mistaken and instinct told him he was not an additional need would be covered he had to have a gun finally there was a bank in hong kongs central district that had certain arrangements with a sister institution thousands of miles away in the cayman islands he had to walk into that bank sign whatever was required of him and walk out with more money than any sane man would carry on his person in hong kong or anywhere else for that matter he would find some place to conceal it but not in a bank where business hours restricted its availability jason bourne knew promise a man his life and he will usually cooperate promise him his life and a great deal of money and the cumulative effect will lead to total submission david reached for the message pad and pencil next to the phone on the bedside table he started another list the little things loomed larger with every hour that passed and he did not have that many hours left it was almost eleven oclock the harbour now glistened in the nearnoon sun he had so many things to do before when he intended to station himself unobtrusively somewhere near the employees exit or down inside the hotel garage or wherever he learned he could follow and trap the waxenfaced liang his first connection three minutes later his list was complete he tore off the page got up from the bed and reached for his jacket on the desk chair suddenly the telephone rang piercing the quiet of the hotel room he had to close his eyes clenching every muscle in his arms and stomach so as not to leap for it hoping beyond hope for the sound of maries voice even as a captive he must not pick up the phone instinct jason bourne he had no controls if he answered the phone he would be the one controlled he let it ring as he walked in anguish across the room and went out the door it was ten minutes past noon when he returned carrying a number of thin plastic bags from various stores in the shopping centre he dropped them on the bed and began removing his purchases among the articles were a dark lightweight raincoat and a dark canvas hat a pair of grey sneakers black trousers and a sweater also black these were the clothes he would wear at night then there were other items a spool of pound tested fishing line with two palmsized eyehooks through which a threefoot section of line would be looped and secured at both ends a ounce paperweight in the shape of a miniature brass barbell one ice pick and a sheathed highly sharpened doubleedged hunting knife with a narrow inch blade these were the silent weapons he would carry both night and day one more item remained to be found he would find it as he examined his purchases his concentration narrowing down to the eyehooks and the fishing line he became aware of a tiny subtle blinking of light start stop start stop it was annoying because he could not find the source and as happened so often he had to wonder if there actually was a source or whether the intrusion was simply an aberration of his mind then his eyes were drawn to the bedside table sunlight streamed in the harbour windows washing over the telephone but the pulsating light was there in the lower lefthand corner of the instrument barely visible but there it was the message signal a small red dot that shone for a second went dark for a second and then resumed its signalling at those intervals a message was not a call he reflected he went to the table studied the instructions on the plastic card and picked up the phone he pressed the appropriate button yes mr cruett said the operator at her computerized switchboard theres a message for me he asked yes sir mr liang has been trying to reach you i thought my instructions were clear interrupted webb there were to be no calls until i told the switchboard otherwise yes sir but mr liang is the assistant manager the senior manager when his superior is not here which is the case this morning this afternoon he tells us it is most urgent he has been calling you every few minutes for the past hour i am ringing him now sir david hung up the phone he was not ready for liang or more properly put liang was not yet ready for him at least not the way david wanted him liang was stretched possibly on the edge of panic for he was the first and lowliest contact and he had failed to place the subject where he was meant to be in a wired suite where the enemy could overhear every word but the edge of panic was not good enough david wanted liang over the edge the quickest way to provoke that state was to permit no contact no discussion no exculpating explanations aimed at enlisting the subject to get the offender off the hook webb grabbed the clothes off the bed and put them into two bureau drawers along with the things he had taken out of his flight bag he stuffed the eyehooks and the fishing line between the layers of fabric he then placed the paperweight on top of a room service menu on the desk and shoved the hunting knife into his jacket pocket he looked down at the ice pick and was suddenly struck by a thought again born of a strange instinct a man consumed with anxiety would overreact when stunned by the unexpected sight of something terrifying the bold image would shock him deepening his fears david pulled out a handkerchief from his breast pocket reached down for the ice pick and wiped the handle clean gripping the lethal instrument in the cloth he walked rapidly to the small foyer estimated the eye level and plunged the pick into the white wall opposite the door the telephone rang then rang again steadily as if in a frenzy webb let himself out and ran down the hallway towards the bank of elevators he slipped into the next angled corridor and watched he had not miscalculated the gleaming metal panels slid apart and liang raced out of the middle elevator into webbs hallway david spun around the corner and dashed to the elevators then rapidly quietly walked to the corner of his own corridor he could see the nervous liang ringing his bell repeatedly finally knocking on the door with increasing persistence another elevator opened and two couples emerged laughing one of the men looked quizzically at webb then shrugged as the party turned left david returned his attention to liang the assistant manager was now frantic ringing the bell and pounding the door then he stopped and put his ear to the wood satisfied he reached into his pocket and withdrew a ring of keys webb snapped his head back out of sight as the assistant manager turned to look up and down the corridor while inserting a key david did not have to see he wanted only to hear he had not long to wait a suppressed guttural shriek was followed by the loud crash of the door the ice pick had had its effect webb ran back to his sanctuary beyond the last elevator again inching his body to the edge of the wall he watched liang was visibly shaken breathing erratically deeply as he repeatedly pressed his finger against the elevator button finally a bell pinged and the metal panels of the second elevator opened the assistant manager rushed inside david had no specific plan but he knew vaguely what he had to do for there was no other way of doing it he walked down the corridor rapidly past the elevators and ran the remaining distance to his room he let himself inside and picked up the bedside telephone pressing the digits he had committed to memory concierges desk said a pleasant voice which did not sound oriental it was probably indian am i speaking to the concierge asked webb you are sir not one of his assistants im afraid not is there a specific assistant you wished to speak with someone resolving a problem perhaps no i want to talk to you said david quietly i have a situation that must be handled in the strictest confidence may i count on yours i can be generous you are a guest in the hotel i am a guest and there is nothing untoward involved of course nothing that would damage the establishment only enhance its reputation for aiding cautious businessmen who wish to bring trade to the territory a great deal of trade i am at your service sir it was arranged that a daimler limousine with the most experienced driver available would pick him up in ten minutes at the ramped courtyard drive on salisbury road the concierge would be standing by the car and for his confidence would receive two hundred dollars american roughly fifteen hundred dollars hong kong there would be no individuals name assigned to the rental which was to be paid in cash for twentyfour hours only the name of a firm picked at random and mr cruett escorted by a floor boy could use a service elevator to the regents lower level where there was an exit that led to the new world centre with its direct access to the pickup on salisbury road the amenities and the cash disposed of david climbed into the back seat of the daimler he was encouraged to confront the lined tired face of a uniformed middleaged driver whose weary expression was only partially leavened by a strained attempt to be pleasant welcome sir my name is pakfei and i shall endeavour to be of excellent service to you you tell me where and i take you i know everything i was counting on that said webb softly i beg your words sir wo bushi luke said david stating that he was not a tourist but as i havent been here in years he continued in chinese i want to reacquaint myself how about the normal boring tour of the island and then a quick trip through kowloon i have to be back in a couple of hours or so and from here on lets speak english ahh your chinese is very good very high class but i understand everything you say yet only two zhongtou hours interrupted webb were speaking english remember and i dont want to be misunderstood but these two hours and your tip and the remaining twentytwo hours and that tip will depend on how well we get along wont it yes yes cried pakfei the driver as he gunned the daimlers motor and authoritatively careened out into the intolerable traffic of salisbury road i shall endeavour to provide very excellent service he did and the names and images that had come to david in the hotel room were reinforced by their actual counterparts he knew the streets of the central district recognized the mandarin hotel and the hong kong club and chater square with the colonys supreme court opposite the banking giants of hong kong he had walked through the crowded pedestrian lanes to the wild confusion that was the star ferry the islands continuous link to kowloon queens road hillier possession street the garish wanchai it all came back to him in the sense that he had been there been to those places knew them knew the streets even the shortcuts to take going from one place to another he recognized the winding road to aberdeen anticipated the sight of the gaudy floating restaurants and beyond the unbelievable congestion of junks and sampans of the boat people a massive floating community of the perpetually dispossessed he could even hear the clatter and slaps and shrieks of the mahjong players hotly contesting their bets under the dim glow of swaying lanterns at night he had met men and women contacts and conduits he reflected on the beaches of shek o and big wave and he had swum in the crowded waters of repulse bay with its huge ersatz statuary and the decaying elegance of the old colonial hotel he had seen it all he knew it all yet he could relate it all to nothing he looked at his watch they had been driving for nearly two hours there was a last stop to make on the island and then he would put pakfei to the test head back to chater square he said i have business at one of the banks you can wait for me money was not only a social and industrial lubricant but in large enough amounts it was a passport to manoeuvrability without it men running were stymied their options limited and those in pursuit frequently in limbo for the options were beyond their means to sustain the hunt and the greater the amount the more facile its release witness the struggle of the man whose resources permit him to apply for no more than a loan as compared with the relative ease another has with a line of credit of so it was for david at the bank in chater square accommodation was swift and professional an attache case was provided without comment for the transport of the funds and the offer of a guard to accompany him to his hotel was made should he feel more comfortable with one he declined signed the release papers and no further questions were asked he returned to the car in the busy street he leaned forward resting his left hand on the soft fabric of the front seat inches from the drivers head he held an american bill between his thumb and index finger pakfei he said i need a gun slowly the drivers head turned he gazed at the bill then turned further to look at webb gone was the forced ebullience the overweening desire to please instead the expression on his lined face was passive his sloped eyes distant kowloon he answered in the mongkok he took the hundred dollars the daimler limousine crawled through the congested street in mongkok an urban mass that had the unenviable distinction of being the most densely populated city district in the history of mankind populated it must be recorded almost exclusively by chinese a western face was so much a rarity that it drew curious glances at once hostile and amused no white man or woman was ever encouraged to go to mongkok after dark no oriental cotton club existed here it was not a matter of racism but the recognition of reality there was too little space for their own and they guarded their own as millennia of chinese had done from the earliest dynasties the family was all it was everything and too many families lived not so much in squalor but within the confines of a single room with a single bed and mats on coarse clean floors everywhere the multitude of small balconies attested to the demands of cleanliness as no one ever appeared on them except to hang continuous lines of laundry the tiers of these open balconies filled the sides of adjacent apartment houses and seemed to be in constant agitation as the breezes blew against the immense walls of fabric causing garments of all descriptions to dance in place by the tens of thousands further proof of the extraordinary numbers that inhabited the area nor was the mongkok poor lavishly manufactured colour was everywhere with bright red the predominant magnet enormous and elaborate signs could be seen wherever the eye roamed above the crowds advertisements that successively rose three storeys high lined the streets and the alleyways the chinese characters emphatic in their attempts to seduce consumers there was money in mongkok quiet money as well as hysterical money but not always legitimate money what there was not was excess space and what there was of it belonged to their own not outsiders unless an outsider brought in by one of their own also brought in money to feed the insatiable machine that produced a vast array of worldly goods and some not so much worldly as otherworldly it was a question of knowing where to look and having the price pakfei the driver knew where to look and jason bourne had the price i will stop and make a phone call said pakfei pulling behind a doubleparked truck i will lock you in and be quick is that necessary asked webb it is your briefcase sir not mine good lord thought david he was a fool he had not considered the attach case he was carrying over into the heart of mongkok as if it were his lunch he gripped the handle pulling the case to his lap and checked the hasps they were secure but if both buttons were jolted even slightly the lid would snap up he yelled at the driver who had climbed out of the car get me some tape adhesive tape it was too late the sounds of the street were deafening the crowds nothing less than a weaving human blanket and they were everywhere and suddenly everywhere became the windows of the daimler a hundred pairs of eyes peered in from all sides then contorted faces were pressed against the glass on all sides and webb was the core of a newly erupted street volcano he could hear the questioning shrieks of bin go ah and chong man tui roughly the english equivalent of who is it and a mouth thats full or as combined whos the big shot he felt like a caged animal being studied by a horde of beasts from another species perhaps vicious he held onto the case staring straight ahead and as two hands started clawing at the slight space in the upper window on his right he reached slowly down into his pocket for the hunting knife the fingers broke through jau screamed pakfei thrashing his way through the crowd this is a most important taipan and the police up the street will pour boiling oil on your genitals if you disturb him get away away he unlocked the door jumped in behind the wheel and yanked the door shut amid furious curses he started the engine gunned it then pressed his hand on the powerful horn and held it there raising the cacophony to unbearable proportions as the sea of bodies slowly reluctantly parted the daimler lurched in fits and starts down the narrow street where are we going shouted webb i thought we were there the merchant you will deal with has moved his place of business sir which is good for this is not a savoury district of the mongkok you should have called first that wasnt very pleasant back there if i may correct the impression of imperfect service sir said pakfei glancing at david in the rear view mirror we now know that you are not being followed as a consequence i am not being followed to where i drive you what are you talking about you go with your hands free into a large bank on chater square and you come out with your hands not free you carry a briefcase so webb watched the drivers eyes as they kept darting up at him no guard accompanied you and there are bad people who watch for such men as yourself often signals are sent from other bad people inside these are uncertain times so it was better to be certain in this instance and youre certain now oh yes sir pakfei smiled an automobile following us on a back street in the mongkok is easily seen so there was no phone call oh indeed there was sir one must always call first but it was very quick and i then walked back on the pavement without my cap of course for many metres there were no angry men in automobiles and none climbed out to run in the street i will now take you to the merchant much relieved im relieved too said david wondering why jason bourne had temporarily deserted him and i didnt even know i should have been worried not about being followed the dense crowds of the mongkok thinned out as the buildings became lower and webb could see the waters of victoria harbour behind high chainlink fences beyond the forbidding barricades were clusters of warehouses fronting piers where merchant ships were docked and heavy machinery crawled and groaned lifting huge boxcars into holds pakfei turned into the entrance of an isolated onestorey warehouse it appeared deserted asphalt everywhere and only two cars in sight the gate was closed a guard walked out of a small glassenclosed office towards the daimler a clipboard in his hand you wont find my name on a list said pakfei in chinese and with singular authority as the guard approached inform mr wu song that regent number five is here and brings him a taipan as worthy as himself he expects us the guard nodded squinting in the afternoon sunlight to catch a glimpse of the important passenger aiya screamed pakfei at the mans impertinence then he turned and looked at webb you must not misunderstand sir he said as the guard ran back to his telephone my use of the name of my fine hotel has nothing to do with my fine hotel in truth if mr liang or anyone else knew i mentioned its name in such business as this i would be relieved of my job it is merely that i was born on the fifth day of the fifth month in the year of our christian lord ill never tell said david smiling to himself thinking that jason bourne had not deserted him after all the myth that he once had been knew the avenues that led to the right contacts knew them blindly and that man was there inside david webb the curtained whitewashed room of the warehouse lined with locked horizontal display cases was not unlike a museum displaying such artifacts from past civilizations as primitive tools fossilized insects mystic carvings of religions past the difference here was in the objects these were exploding weapons that ran the gamut from the lowestcalibre handguns and rifles to the most sophisticated weapons of modern warfare thousandround automatic machine guns with spiralling clips on nearweightless frames to laserguided rockets to be fired from the shoulder an arsenal for terrorists two men in business suits stood guard one outside the entrance to the room the other inside as was to be expected the former bowed his apology and moved an electronic scanner up and down the clothes of webb and his driver then the man reached for the attach case david pulled it away shaking his head and gesturing at the wandlike scanner the guard had waved it over the surface of the case checking his dials as he did so private papers webb said in chinese to the startled guard as he walked into the room it took david nearly a full minute to absorb what he saw to shake off his disbelief he looked at the bold emblazoned no smoking signs in english french and chinese that were all over the walls and wondered why they were there nothing was exposed he walked over to the small arms display and examined the wares he clutched the attache case in his hand as though it were a lifeline to sanity in a world gone mad with instruments of violence huanying cried a voice followed by the appearance of a youngish looking man he came out of a panelled door in one of those tightfitting european suits that exaggerate the shoulders and hug the waist the rear panels of the jacket flowing like a peacocks tail the product of designers determined to be chic at the price of neutering the male image this is mr wu song sir said pakfei bowing first to the merchant and then to webb it is not necessary for you to give your name sir bu spat out the young merchant pointing at davids attaché case bu jing ya your client mr song speaks fluent chinese the driver turned to david as you heard sir mr song objects to the presence of your briefcase it doesnt leave my hand said webb then there can be no serious discussion of business rejoined wu song in flawless english why not your man checked it there are no weapons inside and even if there were and i tried to open it i have an idea id be on the floor before the lid was up plastic said wu song asking a question plastic microphones leading to recording devices where the metal content is so low as to be dismissed even by sophisticated machinery youre paranoid as they say in your country it goes with the territory your idioms as good as your english columbia university seventythree did you major in armaments no marketing aiya shrieked pakfei but he was too late the rapid colloquy had covered the movement of the guards they had walked across the room at the last instant lunging at webb and the driver jason bourne spun dislodging his attackers arm from around his shoulder clamping it under his own and twisting it further in place forcing the man down and smashing the attache case up into the orientals face the moves were coming back to him the violence was returning as it had returned to a bewildered amnesiac on a fishing boat beyond the shoals of a mediterranean island so much forgotten so much unexplained but remembered the man fell to the floor stunned as his partner turned in fury to webb after pummelling pakfei to the ground he rushed forward his hands held up in a diagonal thrust his wide chest and shoulders the base of his dual battering rams david dropped the attache case lurched to his right then spun again again to his right his left foot lashing up from the floor catching the chinese in the groin with such force that the man doubled over screaming webb instantly kicked out with his right foot his toe digging into the attackers throat directly beneath his jaw the man rolled on the floor gasping for air one hand on his groin the other gripping his neck the first guard started to rise bourne stepped forward and smashed his knee into the mans chest sending him halfway across the room where he fell unconscious beneath a display case the young arms merchant from columbia university was stunned his eyes explained he was witnessing the unthinkable expecting any moment that what he saw would be reversed his guards the victors then suddenly emphatically he knew it was not going to happen he ran in panic to the panelled door reaching it as webb reached him david gripped the padded shoulders spinning the merchant back across the floor wu song tripped over his twisting feet and fell he held up his hands pleading no please stop i cannot stand physical confrontation take what you will you cant stand what you heard me i get ill what the hell do you think all this is about yelled david sweeping his arm around the room i service a demand that is all take whatever you want but dont touch me please disgusted webb crossed to the fallen driver who was getting to his knees blood trickling from the corner of his mouth what i take i pay for he said to the arms merchant as he grabbed the drivers arm and helped him to his feet are you all right you ask for great trouble sir replied pakfei his hands trembling fear in his eyes it had nothing to do with you wu song knows that dont you wu i brought you here insisted the driver to make a purchase added david quickly so lets get it over with but first tie up those two goons use the curtains rip them down pakfei looked imploringly at the young merchant great christian jesus do as he says yelled wu song he will strike me take the curtains tie them you imbecile three minutes later webb held in his hand an oddlooking gun bulky but not large it was an advanced weapon the perforated cylinder that was the silencer was pneumatically snapped on reducing the decibel count of a gunshot to a loud spit but no more than a spit the accuracy unaffected at close range it held nine rounds clips released and inserted at the base of the handle in a matter of seconds there were three in reserve thirtysix shells with the fire power of a magnum available instantly in a gun half the size and weight of a colt remarkable said webb glancing at the bound guards and a quaking pakfei who designed it so much expertise was coming back to him so much recognition from where as an american it may offend you answered wu song but he is a man in bristol connecticut who realized that the company he works for designs for would never recompense him adequately for his invention through intermediaries he went on the closed international market and sold to the highest bidder you i do not invest i market thats right i forgot you service a demand precisely whom do you pay a numbered account in singapore i know nothing else im protected of course everythings on consignment i see how much for this take it my gift to you you smell i dont take gifts from people who smell how much wu song swallowed the list price is eight hundred american dollars webb reached into his left pocket and pulled out the denominations he had placed there he counted out eight bills and gave them to the arms merchant paid in full he said paid agreed the chinese tie him up said david turning to the apprehensive pakfei no dont worry about it tie him up do as he says you idiot then take the three of them outside along the side of the building by the car and stay out of sight of the gate quickly yelled song he is angry you can count on it agreed webb four minutes later the two guards and wu song walked awkwardly through the outside door into the blazing afternoon sunlight made harsher by the dancing reflections off the waters of victoria harbour their knees and arms were tied in the ripped cloth of the curtains so their movements were hesitant and uncertain silence was guaranteed by wads of fabric in the mouths of the guards no such precautions were needed for the young merchant he was petrified alone david put his retrieved attache case on the floor and walked rapidly around the room studying the displays in the cases until he found what he wanted he smashed the glass with the handle of his gun and picked around the shards for the weapons he would use weapons coveted by terrorists everywhere timer grenades each with the impact of a pound bomb how did he know where did the knowledge come from he removed six grenades and checked each battery charge how could he do that how did he know where to look what to press no matter he knew he looked at his watch he set the timers of each and ran along the display cases crashing the handle of his weapon into the glass tops and dropping into each a grenade he had one left and two cases to go he looked up at the trilingual no smoking signs and made another decision he ran to the panelled door opened it and saw what he thought he might see he threw in the final grenade webb checked his watch picked up the attache case and went outside making a point of being very much in control he approached the daimler at the side of the warehouse where pakfei seemed to be apologizing to his prisoners perspiring as he did so the driver was being alternately berated and consoled by wu song who wanted nothing more than to be spared any further violence take them over to the breakwater ordered david pointing to the stone wall that rose above the waters of the harbour wu song stared at webb who are you he asked the moment had come it was now webb again looked at his watch as he walked over to the arms merchant he gripped wu songs elbow and shoved the frightened chinese farther along the side of the building where softspoken words would not be overheard by the others my name is jason bourne said david simply jason bou the oriental gasped reacting as though a stiletto had punctured his throat his own eyes witnessing the final violent act of his own death and if you have any ideas about restoring a bruised ego by punishing someone say my driver get rid of them ill know where to find you webb paused for a single beat then continued youre a privileged man wu but with that privilege goes a responsibility for certain reasons you may be questioned and i dont expect you to lie i doubt that youre very good at lying anyway so we met ill accept that i even stole from you if you like but if you give an accurate description of me youd better be on the other side of the world and dead it would be less painful for you the columbia graduate froze his lower lip trembling as he stared at webb speechless david returned the look in silence nodding his head once he released wu songs arm and walked back to pakfei and the two bound guards leaving the panicked merchant to his racing thoughts do as i told you pakfei he said once more looking at his watch get them over to the wall and tell them to lie down explain that im covering them with my gun and will be covering them until we drive through the gate i think their employer will attest to the fact that im a reasonably proficient marksman the driver reluctantly barked the orders in chinese bowing to the arms merchant as wu song started ahead of the others awkwardly manoeuvring himself towards the breakwater some seventyodd yards away webb looked inside the daimler throw me the keys he shouted to pakfei and hurry up david snatched the keys from the air and climbed into the drivers seat he started the engine slipped the daimler into gear and followed the oddlooking parade across the asphalt directly behind the warehouse wu song and his two guards lay prostrate on the ground webb leaped out of the car the motor running and raced around the back to the other side his newly purchased weapon in his hand the silencer fixed get in and drive he shouted to pakfei quickly the driver jumped in bewildered david fired three shots spits that blew up the asphalt several feet in front of each captives face it was enough all three rolled in panic into the wall webb got into the front seat of the car lets go he said for a final time looking at his watch his gun out of the window aimed in the vicinity of the three prostrate figures now the gate swung back for the august taipan in the august limousine the daimler raced through and turned right into the speeding traffic on the duallane highway to mongkok slow down ordered david pull over to the side on the dirt these drivers are madmen sir they speed because they know that in minutes they will barely move it will be difficult to get back on the road somehow i dont think so it happened the explosions came one after another three four five six the isolated onestorey warehouse blew to the skies flames and deep black smoke filling the air above the land and the harbour causing automobiles and trucks and buses to come to screeching stops on the highway you shrieked pakfei his mouth gaping his bulging eyes on webb i was there we were there sir i am dead aiya no pakfei youre not said david youre protected take my word for that youll never hear from mr wu song again i suspect hell be on the other side of the world probably in iran teaching marketing to the mullahs i dont know who else would accept him but why how sir hes finished he dealt in whats called consignments which means he pays as his merchandise is sold are you following me i think so sir he has no more merchandise but it wasnt sold it just went away sir he kept wired rolls of dynamite and cases of explosive plastic in the back room they were too primitive to put in the display cases also too bulky sir i couldnt have a cigarette weave around the traffic pakfei i have to get back to kowloon as they entered the tsim sha tsui the movements of pakfeis constantly turning head intruded on webbs thoughts the driver kept looking at him what is it he asked i am not certain sir i am frightened of course you didnt believe what i told you that youve got nothing to be afraid of that is not it sir i think i must believe you for i saw what you did and i saw wu songs face when you spoke with him i think it is you i am frightened of but i also think this may be wrong for you did protect me it was in wu songs eyes i cannot explain dont bother said david reaching into his pocket for money are you married pakfei or have a girlfriend or a boyfriend it doesnt matter married sir i have two grown children who have notbad jobs they contribute my joss is good now itll be better go home and pick up your wife and children if you like and drive pakfei drive up into the new territories for many miles stop and have a fine meal in tuen mun or yuen long and then drive some more let them enjoy this fine automobile sir a xiao xin went on webb the money in his hand what we call in english a little white lie that doesnt hurt anybody you see i want the mileage on this car to approximate where youve driven me today and tonight where is that you drove mr cruett first up to lo wu and then across the base of the mountain range to lok ma chau those are checkpoints into the peoples republic yes they are agreed david removing two bills and then a third do you think you can remember that and make the mileage right most certainly sir and do you think added webb his finger on a fourth bill that you could say i left the car at lok ma chau and wandered up in the hills for an hour or so ten hours if you like sir i need no sleep one hour is fine david held out the in front of the drivers startled eyes and ill know if you dont live up to our agreement you have no concerns sir cried pakfei one hand on the wheel the other grasping the bills i shall pick up my wife my children her parents and my own as well this animal i drive is big enough for twelve i thank you sir i thank you drop me off around ten streets from salisbury road and get out of the area i dont want this car seen in kowloon no sir it is not possible we will be in lo wu in lok ma chau as far as tomorrow morning goes say whatever you like i wont be here im leaving tonight you wont see me again yes sir our contracts concluded pakfei said jason bourne his thoughts returning to a strategy that became clearer with each move he made and each move brought him closer to marie all was colder now there was a certain freedom in being what he was not play the scenario as it was given to you be everywhere at once make them sweat at an obviously disturbed liang walked rapidly out of the glass doors of the regent he looked anxiously around at the arriving and departing guests then turned to his left and hurried down the pavement towards the ramp leading to the street david watched him through the spraying fountains on the opposite side of the courtyard using the fountains as his cover webb ran across the busy area dodging cars and taxis he reached the ramp and followed liang down towards salisbury road he stopped midway to the street and turned angling his body and his face to the left the assistant manager had come to an abrupt halt his body lurching forwards as an anxious person in a hurry will do when he has suddenly remembered something or changes his mind it had to be the latter thought david as he cautiously shifted his head and saw liang rushing across the entrance drive towards the crowded pavement of the new world shopping centre webb knew he would lose him in the crowds if he did not hurry so he held up both hands stopping the traffic and raced diagonally down the ramp as horns bellowed and angry shrieks came from drivers he reached the pavement sweating anxious he could not see liang where was he the sea of oriental faces became a blur so much the same yet not the same where was he david rushed ahead muttering excuses as he collided with bodies and startled faces he saw him he was sure it was liang but not sure not really he had seen a darksuited figure turn into the entrance of the harbour walkway a long stretch of concrete above the water where people fished and strolled and performed their tai chi exercises in the early mornings yet he had seen only the back of a man if it was not liang would leave the street and lose him completely instinct not yours but bournes the eyes of jason bourne webb broke into a run heading for the arched entrance of the walkway the skyline of hong kong sparkled in the sunlit distance the traffic in the harbour bobbing furiously winding up the days labours on the water he slowed down as he passed under the arch there was no way back to salisbury road but through the entrance the walkway was a deadend intrusion on the waterfront and that raised a question as well as supplying an answer to another why had liang if it was liang boxed himself into a dead end what drew him to it a contact a drop a relay whatever it was it meant that the chinese had not considered the possibility that he was being followed that was the immediate answer david needed it told him what he had to know his prey was in panic the unexpected could only propel him into further panic jasons bournes eyes had not lied it was liang but the first question remained unanswered even compounded by what webb saw of the thousands upon thousands of public telephones in kowloon tucked away in crowded arcades and in recessed corners of darkened lobbies liang had chosen to use a pay phone on the inner wall of the walkway it was exposed in the open in the centre of a wide thoroughfare that was in itself a dead end it made no sense even the rankest amateur had basic protective instincts when in panic he sought cover liang reached into his pocket for change and suddenly as if commanded by an inner voice david knew that he could not permit that call to be made when it was made he had to make it it was part of his strategy a part that would bring him closer to marie the control had to be in his hands not others he began running heading straight towards the white plastic shell of the pay phone wanting to shout but knowing he had to get closer to be heard over the sounds of the windblown waterfront the assistant manager was dialling his hand dropped to his side he had finished somewhere a telephone was ringing liang roared webb get off that phone if you want to live hang up and get out of there the chinese spun around his face a rigid mask of terror you he shouted hysterically pressing his body back into the shell of white plastic no no not now not here gunfire suddenly filled the winds off the water staccato bursts that joined the myriad sounds of the harbour pandemonium swept over the walkway as people screamed and shrieked dropping to the ground or racing in all directions away from the terror of instant death aiya roared liang diving to the side of the telephone shell as bullets ripped into the wall of the walkway and cracked in the air overhead webb lunged towards the chinese crawling beside the hotel man his hunting knife out of its scabbard do not what are you doing liang screamed as david lying sideways gripped him by the front of his shirt and shoved the blade up into the managers chin breaking the skin drawing blood ahhee the hysterical cry was lost in the pandemonium of the walkway give me the number now dont do this to me i swear to you i did not know it was a trap its not a trap for me liang said webb breathlessly the sweat rolling down his face its for you me youre mad why me because they know im here now and youve seen me youve talked to me you made your phone call and they cant afford you any longer but why you were given a telephone number you did your job and they cant allow any traces that explains nothing maybe my name will its jason bourne oh my god whispered liang his face pale as he stared at david his eyes opaque glass his lips parted youre a trace said webb youre dead no no the chinese shook his head it cant be i dont know anyone only the number it is a deserted office in the new world centre a temporary telephone installed please the number is threefour four zero one do not kill me mr bourne for the love of our christian god do not do it if i thought the trap was for me thered be blood all over your throat not your chin threefour four zero one yes exactly the gunfire stopped as suddenly and as startlingly as it had begun the new world centres right above us isnt it one of those windows up there exactly liang shuddered unable to take his eyes off davids face then he shut them tight tears dripping beneath his lids as he shook his head violently i have never seen you i swear on the cross of holy jesus sometimes i wonder if im in hong kong or the vatican webb raised his head and looked around all along the walkway terrified people were hesitantly beginning to rise mothers clutched children men held women and men women and children got to their knees then their feet and suddenly formed a mass stampede towards the salisbury arch you were told to make your call from here werent you said david rapidly turning to the frightened hotel man yes sir why did they give you a reason yes sir for christs sake open your eyes yes sir liang did so looking away as he spoke they said they did not trust the guest who asked for suite sixninezero he was a man who might force another to convey lies therefore they wanted to observe me when i spoke to them mr bourne no i did not say that mr cruett i tried all day to reach you mr cruett i wanted you to know i was being pressed repeatedly mr cruett they kept phoning me wanting to know when i would place my call to them from here i kept saying you had not arrived what else could i do by trying to reach you so constantly you can see i was trying to warn you sir it is obvious is it not whats obvious is that youre a damn fool i am not equipped for this work why did you do it money sir i was with chiang with the kuomintang i have a wife and five children two sons and three daughters i have to get out they search backgrounds they give us incontestable labels with no appeals i am a learned man sir fudan university second in my class i owned my own hotel in shanghai but all that is meaningless now when beijing takes over i am dead my family is dead and now you say i am dead as of this moment what am i to do peking beijing wont touch the colony they wont change anything said david remembering the words marie had said to him that terrible evening after mcallister had left their house unless the crazies take over they are all crazy sir believe nothing else you dont know them maybe not but i know a few of you and frankly id rather not let who is without sin among you cast the first stone sir stones but not bags of silver from chiangs corruption right sir what are your three daughters names quickly they are they are wang wang sho forget it yelled david glancing down at the salisbury arch ni bushi ren youre not a man youre a pig stay well liangofthekuomintang stay well as long as they let you frankly i couldnt care less webb got to his feet prepared to throw himself down again at the first irregular flash of light from a window above on his left the eyes of jason bourne were accurate there was nothing david joined the stampede at the arch and slithered his way through the crowds to salisbury road he placed the call from a phone in a congested noisy arcade off nathan road he put his index finger in his right ear to hear more clearly wet said a male voice its bourne and ill speak english where is my wife wade tian ah it is said you speak our language in numerous dialects its been a long time and i want everything clearly understood i asked you about my wife liang gave you this number he didnt have a choice he is also dead i dont care what you do but if i were you id have second thoughts about killing him why he is lower than a worm because you picked a damn fool worse an hysterical one he talked to too many people a switchboard operator told me he was calling me every few minutes calling you i flew in this morning where is my wife liang the liar you didnt expect me to stay in that suite did you i had him switch me to another room we were seen talking together arguing with half a dozen clerks watching us you kill him therell be more rumours than any of us want the police will be looking for a rich american who disappeared his trousers are soiled said the chinese perhaps it is enough its enough now what about my wife i heard you i am not privileged with such information then put on someone who is now you will meet with others more knowledgeable when we will get back to you what room are you in ill call you youve got fifteen minutes you are giving me orders i know where you are which window which office youre sloppy with your rifle you should have corked the barrel sunlight reflects off metal thats basic in thirty seconds ill be a hundred feet from your door but you wont know where i am and you cant leave that phone i dont believe you try me youre not watching me now im watching you youve got fifteen minutes and when i call you back i want to talk to my wife shes not here if i thought she were youd be dead your head knifed from the rest of you and thrown out the window to join the other garbage in the harbour if you think im exaggerating check around ask people whove dealt with me ask your taipan the yao ming who doesnt exist i cannot make your wife appear jason bourne shouted the frightened minion get me a number where i can reach her either i hear her voice talking to me or theres nothing except for your headless corpse and a black bandanna across your bleeding neck fifteen minutes david hung up the phone and wiped the sweat from his face he had done it the mind and the words were jason bournes he had gone back in only vaguely remembered time and instinctively knew what to do what to say what to threaten there was a lesson somewhere appearance far outdistanced reality or was there a reality within him crying to come out wanting control telling david webb to trust the man inside him he left the oppressively crowded arcade and turned right on the equally congested pavement the golden mile of the tsim sha tsui was preparing for its nightly games and so would he he could return to the hotel now the assistant manager would be miles away conceivably booking a flight to taiwan if there was any truth at all in his hysterical statements webb would use the freight elevator to reach his room in case others were awaiting him in the lobby although he doubted it the shooting gallery that was a deserted office in the new world centre was not a command post and the marksman was not a commander but a relay now frightened for his life with each step david took down nathan road the shorter his breath became the louder his chest pounded twelve minutes from now he would hear maries voice oh god he wanted to hear it so he had to it was all that would keep him sane all that mattered your fifteen minutes are over said webb sitting on the edge of the bed trying to control his heartbeat wondering if the rapid echo could be heard as he heard it hoping it caused no tremor in his voice call fivetwo six five three five david recognized the exchange shes over in hong kong not kowloon she will be moved immediately ill call you back after ive spoken to her there is no need jason bourne knowledgeable men are there and they will speak with you my business is finished and you have never seen me i dont have to a photograph will be taken when you leave that office but you wont know from where or by whom youll probably see a number of people in the hallway or in an elevator or the lobby but you wont know which one has a camera with a lens that looks like a button on his jacket or an emblem on her purse stay well minion think nice thoughts webb depressed the telephone bar disconnecting the line he waited three seconds released it heard the dial tone and touched the buttons he could hear the ring christ he couldnt stand it wei this is bourne put my wife on the line as you wish david are you all right shouted webb on the edge of hysteria yes just tired thats all my darling are you all right have they hurt you have they touched you no david theyve been quite kind actually but you know how tired i get sometimes remember that week in zurich when you wanted to see the fraumunster and the museums and go out sailing on the limmat and i said i just wasnt up to it thered been no week in zurich only the nightmare of a single night when both of them nearly lost their lives he running the gauntlet of his wouldbe executioners in the steppdeckstrasse she nearly raped sentenced to death on a deserted riverfront in the guisan quai what was she trying to tell him yes i remember so you mustnt worry about me darling thank god youre here well be together soon theyve promised me that itll be like paris david remember paris when i thought id lost you but you came to me and we both knew where to go that lovely street with the dark green trees and the that will be all mrs webb broke in a male voice or should i say mrs bourne the man added speaking directly into the phone think david and be careful yelled marie in the background and dont worry darling that lovely street with the row of green trees my favourite tree ting zhi cried the male voice issuing an order in chinese take her away shes giving him information quickly dont let her speak you harm her in any way youll regret it for the rest of your short life said webb icily i swear to christ ill find you there has been no cause for unpleasantness up to this moment replied the man slowly his tone sincere you heard your wife she has been treated well she has no complaints somethings wrong with her what the hell have you done that she cant tell me it is only the tension mr bourne and she was telling you something no doubt in her anxiety trying to describe this location erroneously i should add but even if it were accurate it would be as useless to you as the telephone number she is on her way to another apartment one of millions in hong kong why would we harm her in any way it would be counterproductive a great taipan wants to meet with you yao ming like you he goes by several names perhaps you can reach an accommodation either we do or hes dead and so are you i believe what you say jason bourne you killed a close blood relative of mine who was beyond your reach in his own island fortress on lantau im sure you recall i dont keep records yao ming when tonight where you must understand hes very recognizable so it must be a most unusual place suppose i choose it unacceptable of course do not insist we have your wife david tensed he was losing the control he desperately needed name it he said the walled city we assume you know it of it corrected webb trying to focus what memory he had the filthiest slum on the face of the earth if i remember what else would it be it is the only legal possession of the peoples republic in all of the colony even the detestable mao zedong gave permission for our police to purge it but civil servants are not paid that much it remains essentially the same what time tonight after dark but before the bazaar closes between ninethirty and not later than fifteen minutes to ten how do i find this yao ming who isnt yao ming there is a woman in the first block of the open market who sells snake entrails as aphrodisiacs predominantly cobra go up to her and ask her where a great one is she will tell you the descending steps to use which alley to take you will be met i might never get there the colour of my skin isnt welcome down there no one will harm you however i suggest you not wear garish clothing or display expensive jewellery jewellery if you own a highpriced watch do not wear it theyd cut your arm off for a watch medusa so be it thanks for the advice one last thing do not think of involving the authorities or your consulate in a reckless attempt to compromise the taipan if you do your wife will die that wasnt necessary with jason bourne everything is necessary you will be watched ninethirty to ninefortyfive said webb replacing the phone and getting up from the bed he went to the window and stared out at the harbour what was it what was marie trying to tell him you know how tired i get sometimes no he did not know that his wife was a strong ontario ranch girl who never complained of being tired you mustnt worry about me darling a foolish plea and she must have realized it marie did not waste precious moments being foolish unless was she rambling incoherently itll be like paris david we both knew where to go that lovely street with the dark green trees no not rambling only the appearance of rambling there was a message but what what lovely street with dark green trees nothing came to him and it was driving him out of his mind he was failing her she was sending a signal and it eluded him think david and be careful dont worry darling that lovely street with the row of trees my favourite tree what lovely street what goddamned row of trees what favourite tree nothing made sense to him and it should make sense he should be able to respond not stare out a window his memory blank help me help me he cried silently to no one an inner voice told him not to dwell on what he could not understand there were things to do he could not willingly walk into the meeting ground of the enemys choosing without some foreknowledge some cards of his own to play i suggest you do not wear garish clothing it would not have been garish in any event thought webb but now it would be something quite opposite and unexpected during the months in which he had peeled away the layers of jason bourne one theme kept repeating itself change change change bourne was a practitioner of change they called him the chameleon a man who could melt into different surroundings with ease not as a grotesque a cartoon with fright wigs and nose putty but as one who could adapt the essentials of his appearance to his immediate environment so that those who had met the assassin rarely however in full light or standing close to him gave widely varying descriptions of the man hunted throughout asia and europe the details were always in conflict the hair was dark or light the eyes brown blue or speckled the skin pale or tanned or blotched the clothes well made and subdued if the rendezvous took place in a dimly lit expensive cafe or rumpled and illfitting if the meeting was held on the waterfront or in the lower depths of a given city change effortlessly with the minimum of artifice david webb would trust the chameleon within him free fall go where jason bourne directed after leaving the daimler he had gone to the peninsula hotel and taken a room depositing his attache case in the hotel safe hed had the presence of mind to register under the name of cactuss third false passport if men were looking for him they would flash the name he used at the regent it was all they had he packed what few clothes he needed in the flight bag and walked rapidly from his room using the service elevator to the street he did not check out of the regent if men were looking for him he wanted them to look where he was not once settled in the peninsula he had time for something to eat and to forage in several shops until nightfall by the time darkness came he would be in the walled city before ninethirty jason bourne was giving the commands and david webb obeyed them the walled city of kowloon has no visible wall around it but it is as clearly defined as if there were one made of hard high steel it is instantly sensed by the congested open market that runs along the street in front of the row of dark rundown flats shacks haphazardly perched on top of one another giving the impression that at any moment the entire blighted complex will collapse under its own weight leaving nothing but rubble where elevated rubble had stood but a deceptive strength is found as one walks down the short flight of steps into the interior of the sprawling slum below ground level cobblestoned alleyways that are in most cases tunnels traverse beneath the ramshackle structures in squalid corridors crippled beggars vie with halfdressed prostitutes and drug peddlers in the eerie wash of naked bulbs that hang from exposed wires along the stone walls a putrid dampness abounds all is decay and rot but there is the strength of time having hardened this decomposition petrifying it within the foul alleyways in no particular order or balance are narrow barely lit staircases leading to the vertical series of brokendown flats the average rising three storeys two of which are above ground inside the small dilapidated rooms the widest varieties of narcotics and sex are sold all is beyond the reach of the police silently agreed to by all parties for few of the colonys authorities care to venture into the bowels of the walled city it is its own selfcontained hell let it be outside in the open market that fills the garbagestrewn street where no traffic is permitted soiled tables piled high with rejected andor stolen merchandise are sandwiched between grimy stalls where pockets of vapour rise from huge vats of boiling oil in which questionable pieces of meat fowl and snake are continuously plunged then ladled out and placed on newspapers for immediate sale the crowds move under the weak light of dull streetlamps from one vendor to the next haggling in highpitched voices shrieking back and forth buying and selling then there are the kerb people bedraggled men and women without stalls or tables whose merchandise is spread out on the pavement they squatted behind displays of trinkets and cheap jewellery much of it stolen from the docks and woven cages filled with crawling beetles and fluttering tiny birds near the mouth of the strange foetid bazaar a lone muscular female sat on a low wooden stool her thick legs parted skinning snakes and removing their entrails her dark eyes seemingly obsessed with each thrashing serpent in her hands on either side were writhing burlap bags every now and then convulsing as the doomed reptiles struck out in hissing fury at one another enraged by their captivity clamped under the heavyset womans bare right foot was a king cobra its jet black body immobile and erect its head flat its small eyes steady hypnotized by the constantly moving crowds the squalor of the open market was a fitting barricade for the wallless walled city beyond rounding the corner at the opposite end of the long bazaar a dishevelled figure turned into the overflowing avenue the man was dressed in a cheap loosefitting brown suit the trousers too bulky the coat too large yet tight around the hunched shoulders a soft widebrimmed hat black and unmistakably oriental threw a constant shadow across his face his gait was slow as befitted a man pausing in front of various stalls and tables examining the merchandise but only once did he reach tentatively into his pocket to make a single purchase then too there was a stooped quality in his posture the frame of a man having been bent from years of hard labour in the field or on the waterfront his diet never sufficient for a body from which so much was extracted there was a sadness as well in this man a futility born of too little too late and too costly for the mind and the body it was the recognition of impotency pride abandoned for there was nothing to be proud of the price of survival had been too much and this man this stooped figure who haltingly bought a newspaper cone of fried questionable fish was not unlike many of the males in the marketplace one could say he was indistinguishable from them he approached the muscular woman who was tearing the intestines from a stillwrithing snake where is a great one asked jason bourne in chinese his eyes fixed on the immobile cobra the grease from the newspaper rolling over his left hand you are early replied the woman without expression it is dark but you are early i was summoned quickly do you question the taipans instructions he is fuckfuck cheap for a taipan she spat out in guttural cantonese what do i care go down the steps behind me and take the first alleyway to the left a whore will be standing fifteen twenty metres down she waits for the white man and will lead him to the taipan are you the white man i cannot tell in this light and your chinese is good but you do not look like a white man you do not wear a white mans clothes if you were me would you make a heavenly point of looking like a white man dressing like a white man if you were told to come down here i would make the point of a thousand devils that i was from the qing gaoyan said the woman laughing through half gone teeth especially if you carry money do you carry money our zhongguo ren you flatter me but no you lie white people lie with heavenly words about money very well i lie i trust your snake will not attack me for it fool he is old and has no fangs no poison but he is the heavenly image of a mans organ he brings me money will you give me money for a service yes aiya you want this old body you must have an axe in your trousers chop up the whore not me no axe just words said bourne his right hand slipping into his trousers pocket he withdrew a us bill and palmed it in front of the snake sellers face keeping it out of sight of the surrounding bargain hunters aiya aiya whispered the woman as jason pulled it away from her grasping fingers the dead snake dropped between her thick legs the service bourne repeated since you thought i was one of you i expect others will think so too all i want you to do is to tell anyone who asks you that the white man never showed up is that fair fair give me the money the service you bought snakes snakes what do i know of a white man he never appeared here here is your snake make love the woman took the bill bunched the entrails in her hand and shoved them into a plastic bag on which there was a designers signature it read christian dior remaining stooped bourne bowed rapidly twice and backed his way out of the crowd dropping the snake entrails in the kerb far enough away from a street light so as not to be noticed holding the dripping cone of foulsmelling fish he repeatedly mimed reaching for mouthfuls as he slowly made his way to the steps and descended into the steaming bowels of the walled city he looked at his watch spilling fish as he did so it was the taipans patrols would be moving into place he had to know the extent of the bankers security he wanted the lie that he had told a marksman in a deserted office above the harbour walkway to be the truth instead of being watched he wanted to be the one watching he would memorize each face each role in the command structure the rapidity with which each guard made a decision under pressure the communications equipment and above all discover where the weaknesses were in the taipans security david understood that jason bourne was taking over there was a point in what he was doing the bankers note had started with the words a wife for a wife only one word had to be changed a taipan for a wife bourne turned into the alleyway on his left and walked several hundred feet past sights he scrupulously ignored a resident of the walled city would do no less on a darkened staircase a woman on her knees performed the act for which she was being paid the man above her holding money in his hand over her head a young couple two obvious addicts in near frenzy were pleading with a man in an expensive black leather jacket a small boy smoking a marijuana cigarette urinated against the stone wall a beggar without legs clattered on his wheeled board over the cobblestones chanting bong ngo bong ngo a plea for alms and on another dimlylit staircase a welldressed pimp was threatening one of his whores with facial disfigurement if she did not produce more money david webb mused that he was not in disneyland jason bourne studied the alley as if it were a combat zone behind enemy lines the soldiers would be going to their posts the outer and the inner man turned around and started back the bankers whore was walking into position her bright red blouse unbuttoned barely covering her small breasts the traditional slit in her black skirt reached her thigh she was a caricature the white man was not to make a mistake point one accentuate the obvious something to remember subtlety was not a strong suit several yards behind her a man spoke into a handheld radio he caught up with the woman shook his head and rushed forward towards the end of the alley and the steps bourne stopped his posture sagging and turned into the wall the footsteps were behind him hurrying emphatic the pace quickening a second chinese approached and passed him a small middleaged man in a dark business suit tie and shoes polished to a high gloss he was no citizen of the walled city his expression was a mixture of apprehension and disgust ignoring the whore he glanced at his watch and raced ahead he had the look and demeanour of an executive ordered to assume duties he found distasteful a company man precise orderly the bottom line his motive for the figures did not lie a banker jason studied the irregular row of staircases the man must have come from one of them the sound of the footsteps had been abrupt and recent and judging by the pace they had begun no more than or feet away on the third staircase on the left or the fourth on the right in one of the flats above either staircase a taipan was waiting for his visitor bourne had to find out which and on what level the taipan must be surprised even shocked he had to understand whom he was dealing with and what his actions would cost him jason started up again now assuming a drunken walk the words of an old mandarin folk tune came to him me li hua cherng zhang liu yue he sang softly bouncing gently off the wall as he approached the whore i have money he said pleasantly his words in chinese imprecise and you beautiful woman have what i need where do we go nowhere fancy drunk get away from here bong ngo cheng bong ngo screeched the legless beggar clattering down the alley careening into the wall as he screamed cheng bong ngo jour yelled the woman get out of here before i kick your useless body off your board loo mi ive told you not to interfere with business this cheap drunk is business ill get you something better hes not my business darling hes an annoyance im waiting for someone then ill chop his feet shouted the grotesque figure pulling a cleaver from his board what the hell are you doing roared bourne in english shoving his foot into the beggars chest sending the halfman and his board into the opposite wall there are laws shrieked the beggar you attacked a cripple you are robbing a cripple sue me said jason turning to the woman as the beggar clattered away down the alley you talk english the whore stared at him so do you said bourne you speak chinese but you are not chinese in spirit perhaps ive been looking for you you are the man i am i will take you to the taipan no just tell me which staircase which level those are not my instructions theyre new instructions given by the taipan do you question his new instructions they must be delivered by his headhead man the small zhongguo ren in a dark suit he tells us everything he pays us for the taipan whom does he pay ask him yourself the taipan wants to know bourne reached into his pocket and pulled out a stack of folded bills he told me to give you extra money if you cooperated with me he thinks his head man may be cheating him the woman backed into the wall looking alternately at the money and at bournes face if you are lying why would i lie the taipan wants to see me you know that youre to bring me to him he told me to dress like this to behave this way to find you and watch his men how would i know about you if he hadnt told me up in the market you are to see someone i havent been there i came directly down here jason removed several bills were both working for the taipan here he wants you to take this and leave but youre not to go up in the street he held out the money the taipan is generous said the whore reaching for the bills which staircase asked bourne pulling the money back which level the taipan didnt know over there replied the woman pointing to the far wall the third steps the second level the money whos on the head mans payroll quickly in the market there is the snake bitch and the old thief selling bad gold chains from the north and the wok man with his dirty fish and meat thats all we talk that is all the taipans right hes being cheated hell thank you bourne unfolded another bill but i want to be fair besides the one with the radio how many others work for the head man three others also with radios said the whore her eyes fixed on the money her hand inching forward here take it and leave head that way and dont go up on the street the woman grabbed the bills and ran down the alley her high heels clicking her figure disappearing in the dim light bourne watched until she was out of sight then turned and walked rapidly out of the filthy passageway to the steps he again assumed his stooped appearance and climbed up into the street three guards and a headhead man he knew what he had to do and it had to be done quickly it was a taipan for a wife he found the first guard talking to the fishmonger talking anxiously with sharp stabbing gestures the noise of the crowd was an impediment the vendor kept shaking his head bourne chose a heavyset man near the guard he rushed forward shoving the unsuspecting onlooker into the guard and sidestepped as the taipans man recoiled in the brief melee that erupted jason pulled the bewildered guard aside hammered his knuckles into the base of the mans throat twisted him as he began to fall and slashed his rigid hand across the back of the guards neck at the top of the spine he dragged the unconscious man across the pavement apologizing to the crowd in chinese for his drunken friend he dropped the guard in the remains of a storefront took the radio and smashed it the taipans second man required no such tactics he was off to the side of the crowd by himself shouting into his radio bourne approached his sorry figure presenting no threat and he held out his hand as if he were a beggar the guard waved him away it was the last gesture he would remember for bourne gripped his wrist twisted it and broke the mans arm fourteen seconds later the taipans second guard lay in the shadows of a mound of garbage his radio thrown into the debris the third guard was in conference with the snake bitch to bournes satisfaction she too kept shaking her head as the fishmonger had done there was a certain loyalty in the walled city where bribes were concerned the man pulled out his radio but had no chance to use it jason ran up to him grabbed the ancient toothless cobra and thrust its flat head into the mans face his wideeyed gasp accompanied by a scream was all the reaction jason bourne needed the nerves in the throat are a magnificent network of immobilizing cordlike fibres connecting the body organs to the central nervous system bourne played upon them swiftly and once again dragged his victim through the crowd apologizing profusely as he left the unconscious guard on a dark patch of concrete he held the radio up to his ear there was nothing on the receiver it was one headhead man remained the small middleaged chinese in the expensive suit and polished shoes all but held his nose as he raced from one point to another trying to spot his men reluctant to make the slightest physical contact with the hordes gathered around the vendors stalls and tables his lack of height made it hard for him to see bourne watched where he was heading ran ahead of him then quickly turned around and sent his fist crashing into the executives lower abdomen as the chinese buckled over jason reached around the mans waist with his left arm picked him up and carried the limp figure to a section of the kerb where two men sat weaving passing a bottle back and forth he placed a wushu chop across the bankers neck and dropped him between his new companions through their haze the drunken men would make sure their new associate stayed unconscious for a considerable length of time there were pockets to ransack clothes and a pair of shoes to be removed all would bring a price whatever cash there was a bonus for their labours bourne no longer stooped gone was the chameleon he rushed across the street overflowing with humanity and raced down the steps and into the alley he had done it he had removed the praetorian guard a taipan for a wife he reached the staircase the third staircase in the right wall and yanked out the remarkable weapon he had purchased from an arms merchant in the mongkok as quietly as he could manage testing each step with a foot he climbed to the second level he braced himself outside the door balanced his weight lifted his left leg and smashed it into the thin wood the door crashed open he sprang through and crouched the weapon extended three men faced him forming a semicircle each with a gun aimed at his head behind them dressed in a white silk suit a huge chinese sat in a chair the man nodded to his guards he had lost bourne had miscalculated and david webb would die far more excruciating he knew maries death would soon follow let them fire thought david pull the triggers that would mercifully put him out of it he had killed the only thing that mattered in his life shoot goddamn you shoot welcome mr bourne said the large man in the white silk suit waving his guards aside i assume you see the logic of putting your gun on the floor and pushing it away from you theres really no alternative you know webb looked at the three chinese the man in the centre cracked the hammer back on his automatic david lowered the gun and shoved it forward you expected me didnt you he asked quietly getting to his feet as the guard on his right picked up the weapon we didnt know what to expect except the unexpected how did you do it are my people dead no theyre bruised and unconscious not dead remarkable you thought i was alone here i was told you travelled with your head man and three others not six i thought it was logical any more it seemed to me would be conspicuous thats why these men came early to make arrangements and have not left this hole since they arrived so you thought you could take me exchange me for your wife its obvious that she didnt have a damn thing to do with it let her go she cant hurt you kill me but let her go pi ge said the banker ordering two of the guards out of the flat they bowed and left quickly this man will remain he continued turning back to webb apart from the immense loyalty he has for me he doesnt speak or understand a word of english i see you trust your people i trust no one the financier gestured at a dilapidated wooden chair across the shabby room revealing as he did so a gold rolex on his wrist diamonds encrusted around its dial matching his bejewelled gold cufflinks sit down he ordered ive gone to great lengths and spent much money to bring about this conference your head man i assume it was your head man said bourne aimlessly studying every detail of the room as he walked over to the chair told me not to wear an expensive watch down here i guess you didnt listen to him i arrived in a soiled filthy kaftan with sleeves wide enough to conceal it as i look at your clothes im certain the chameleon understands youre yao ming webb sat down it is a name ive used you surely understand that the chameleon goes by many shapes and colours i didnt kill your wife or the man who happened to be with her i know that mr webb you what david shot up from the chair as the guard took a rapid step forward his gun levelled sit down repeated the banker dont alarm my devoted friend or we both may regret it you far more than me you knew it wasnt me and still youve done this to us sit quickly please i want an answer said webb sitting down because you are the true jason bourne that is why you are here why your wife remains in my custody and will remain so until you accomplish what i ask of you i talked to her i know you did i permitted it she didnt sound like herself even considering the circumstances shes strong stronger than i was during those lousy weeks in switzerland and paris somethings wrong with her is she drugged certainly not is she hurt in spirit perhaps but not in any other way however she will be hurt and she will die if you refuse me can i be clearer youre dead taipan the true bourne speaks thats very good its what i need spell it out i am being hounded by someone in your name began the taipan his voice hard his intensity mounting far more severely may the spirits forgive me than the loss of a young wife from all sides in all areas the terrorist this new jason bourne attacks he kills my people blows up shipments of valuable merchandise threatens other taipans with death if they do business with me his exorbitant fees come from my enemies here in hong kong and macao and up the deep bay water routes north into the provinces themselves you have a lot of enemies my interests are extensive so i was told were those of the man i didnt kill in macao oddly enough said the banker breathing hard and gripping the arm of his chair in an effort to control himself he and i were not enemies in certain areas our interests converged its how he met my wife how convenient shared assets as it were you are offensive theyre not my rules replied bourne his eyes cold levelled at the oriental get to the point my wifes alive and i want her back without a mark on her or a voice raised against her if shes harmed in any way whatsoever you and your zhongguo ren wont be any match for what ill mount against you you are not in a position to make threats mr webb webb isnt agreed the once most hunted man in asia and europe bourne is the oriental looked hard at jason nodding twice as his eyes dropped below webbs gaze your audacity matches your arrogance to the point its very simple very clear cut the taipan suddenly clenched his right hand into a fist then raised it and crashed it down on the fragile arm of the decrepit chair i want proof against my enemies he shouted his angry eyes peering out behind two partially closed walls of swollen flesh the only way ill get it is for you to bring me this all too credible impostor who takes your place i want him facing me watching me as he feels his life leaving him in agony until he tells me everything i must know bring him to me jason bourne the banker breathed deeply then added quietly then and only then will you be reunited with your wife webb stared at the taipan in silence what makes you think i can do it he said finally who better to trap a pretender than the original words said webb meaningless hes studied you hes analysed your methods your techniques he could not pass himself off as you if he had not find him trap him with the tactics you yourself created just like that youll have help several names and descriptions men i am convinced are involved with this new killer who uses an old name over in macao never it must not be macao theres to be no mention no reference whatsoever to the incident at the lisboa hotel it is closed finished you know nothing about it in no way can my person be associated with what you are doing you have nothing to do with me if you surface you are hunting a man who has assumed your mantle you are protecting yourself defending yourself a perfectly natural thing to do under the circumstances i thought you wanted proof it will come when you bring me the impostor shouted the taipan if not macao where then here in kowloon in the tsim sha tsui five men were slain in the back room of a cabaret among them a banker like myself a taipan my associate from time to time and no less influential as well as three others whose identities were concealed apparently it was a government decision ive never found out who they were but you know who the fifth man was said bourne he worked for me he took my place at that meeting had i been there myself your namesake would have killed me this is where you will start here in kowloon in the tsim sha tsui i will give you the names of the two known dead and the identities of many men who were the enemies of both now my enemies move quickly find the man who kills in your name and bring him to me and a last warning mr bourne should you try to find out who i am the order will be swift the execution swifter your wife will die then so will you give me the names theyre on this paper said the man who used the name yao ming reaching into the pocket of his white silk vest they were typed by a public stenographer at the mandarin there would be no point in trying to trace a specific typewriter a waste of time said bourne taking the sheet of paper there must be twenty million typewriters in hong kong but not so many taipans of my size and girth eh that ill remember im sure you will how do i reach you you dont ever this meeting never took place then why did it why did everything thats happened take place say i manage to find and take this cretin who calls himself bourne and its a damn big if what do i do with him leave him on the steps outside here in the walled city it could be a splendid idea drugged no one would pay the slightest attention beyond rifling his pockets id pay a lot of attention a prize for a prize taipan i want an ironclad guarantee i want my wife back what would you consider such a guarantee first her voice on the phone convincing me shes unharmed and then i want to see her say walking up and down a street under her own power with no one near her jason bourne speaks he speaks very well weve developed a high technology industry here in hong kong ask anyone in the electronics business in your country on the bottom of that page is a telephone number when and if and only when and if the impostor is in your hands call that number and repeat the words snake lady several times medusa whispered jason interrupting airborne the taipan arched his brows his expression noncommittal naturally i was referring to the woman in the bazaar like hell you were go on as i say repeat the words several times until you hear clicks triggering another number or numbers broke in bourne again something to do with the sounds of the phrase i believe agreed the taipan the sibilant s followed by a flat vowel and hard consonants ingenious wouldnt you say its called aurally receptive programming instruments activated by a voice print since youre not impressed do let me emphasize the condition under which the call may be made for your wifes sake i hope it impresses you the call is to be placed only when you are prepared to deliver the impostor within a matter of minutes should you or anyone else use the number and the code words without that guarantee ill know a trace is being put out over the lines in that event your wife will be killed and a dead disfigured white woman without identification dropped into the waters of the out islands do i make myself clear swallowing suppressing his fury despite the sickening fear bourne spoke icily the condition is understood now you understand mine when and if i make that call ill want to speak to my wife not within minutes but within seconds if i dont whoevers on the line will hear the gunshot and youll know that your assassin the prize you say youve got to have has just had his head blown away youll have thirty seconds your condition is understood and will be met id say the conference is over jason bourne i want my weapon one of the guards who left has it it will be given to you on your way out hell take my word for it he doesnt have to if you walked out of here he was to give it to you a corpse has no need of a gun what remain of the stately homes from hong kongs extravagant colonial era are high in the hills above the city in an area known as victoria peak named for the islands mountain summit the crown of all the territory here graceful gardens complement rosebordered paths that lead to gazebos and verandas from which the wealthy observe the splendorous of the harbour below and the out islands in the distance the residences that spring up from the most enviable views are subdued versions of the great houses of jamaica they are highceilinged and intricate rooms flow into one another at odd angles to take advantage of summer breezes during that long and oppressive season and everywhere there is polished carved wood surrounding and reinforcing windows made to withstand the winds and the rains of the mountain winter strength and comfort are joined in these minor mansions the designs dictated by climate one such house in the peak district however differed from the others not in size or strength or elegance nor in the beauty of its gardens which were rather more extensive than many of its neighbours nor in the impressiveness of its front gate and the height of the stone wall bordering the grounds part of what made it seem different was the sense of isolation that surrounded it especially at night when only a few lights burned in the numerous rooms and no sounds came from the windows or the gardens it was as if the house were barely inhabited certainly there was no sign of frivolity but what dramatically set it apart were the men at the gate and others like them who could be seen from the road patrolling the grounds beyond the wall they were armed and in fatigue uniforms they were american marines the property was leased by the united states consulate at the direction of the national security council to any inquiries the consulate was to comment only that during the next month numerous representatives of the american government and american industry would be flying into the colony at various undetermined times and security as well as the efficacy of accommodations warranted the lease it was all the consulate knew however selected personnel in british mi special branch were given somewhat more information as their cooperation was deemed necessary and had been authorized by london however again it was limited to an immediateneedtoknow basis also firmly agreed to by london those on the highest levels of both governments including the closest advisers to the president and the prime minister came to the same conclusion any disclosures regarding the true nature of the property in victoria peak could have catastrophic consequences for the far east and the world it was a sterile house the headquarters of a covert operation so sensitive that even the president and the prime minister knew few of the details only the objectives a small sedan drove up to the gate instantly powerful floodlights were tripped blinding the driver who brought his arm up to shield his eyes two marine guards approached on either side of the vehicle their weapons drawn you should know the car by now lads said the large oriental in the white silk suit squinting through the open window we know the car major lin replied the lance corporal on the left we just have to make sure of the driver who could impersonate me joked the huge major man mountain dean sir answered the marine on the right oh yes i recall an american wrestler my granddad used to talk about him thank you son you might have at least said your father may i proceed or am i impounded well turn off the lights and open the gate sir said the first marine by the way major thanks for the name of that restaurant in the wanchai its a class act and doesnt bust the bankroll but alas you found no suzie wing who sir never mind the gate if you please lads inside the house in the library which had been converted into an office undersecretary of state edward newington mcallister sat behind a desk studying the pages of a dossier under the glare of a lamp making checkmarks in the margins beside certain paragraphs and certain lines his attention was riveted the intercom buzzed and he had to force his eyes and his hand to the telephone yes he listened and replied send him in of course mcallister hung up and returned to the dossier in front of him the pencil in his hand on the top of the page he was reading were the words repeated in the same position on each page ultra maximum classified prc internal sheng chou yang the door opened and the immense major lin wenzu of british intelligence mi special branch hong kong walked in closed the door and smiled at the absorbed figure of mcallister its still the same isnt it edward buried in the words theres a pattern a line to follow i wish i could find it answered the undersecretary of state reading feverishly you will my friend whatever it is ill be with you in a moment take your time said the major removing the gold rolex wristwatch and the cufflinks he placed them on the desk and spoke quietly such a pity to give these back they add a certain presence to my presence you will however pay for the suit edward its not basic to my wardrobe but as ever in hong kong it was reasonable even for one of my size yes of course agreed the undersecretary preoccupied major lin sat down in the black leather chair in front of the desk remaining silent for the better part of a minute it was obvious that he could remain silent no longer is that anything i might help you with edward or more to the point is it anything that pertains to the job at hand something you can tell me about im afraid it isnt lin on all counts you will have to tell us sooner or later our superiors in london will have to tell us do what he asks they say keep records of all conversations and directives but follow his orders and advise him advise him there is no advice but tactics a man in an unoccupied office firing four bullets into the wall of the harbour walk six into the water and the rest blanks thank god there were no cardiac arrests and weve created the situation you want now that we can understand i gather everything went very well there was a riot if thats what you mean by very well its what i mean mcallister leaned back in his chair the slender fingers of his right hand massaging his temples score one my friend the authentic jason bourne was convinced and he made his moves incidentally you will pay for the hospitalization of one man with a broken arm and two others who claim they are still in shock with extremely painful necks the fourth is too embarrassed to say anything bournes very good at what he does what he did hes lethal edward you handled him i gather thinking every second hed make another move and blow that filthy room apart i was petrified the mans a maniac incidentally why is he to stay out of macao its an odd restriction theres nothing he cant do from here the killings took place here the impostors clients are obviously here in hong kong not macao as usual that is no answer lets put it another way and this much i can tell you actually you already know it since you played the role tonight the lie about our mythical taipans young wife and lover having been murdered in macao any thoughts on it an ingenious device said lin frowning few acts of vengeance are as readily understood as an eye for an eye in a sense its the basis of your strategy what i know of it what do you think webb would do if he found out it was a lie he couldnt you made it clear the killings were covered up you underestimate him once in macao hed turn over every piece of garbage to learn who this taipan is hed question every bellhop every maid probably threaten or bribe a dozen hotel personnel at the lisboa and most of the police until he learned the truth but we have his wife and that is not a lie he will act accordingly yes but in a different dimension whatever he thinks now and certainly he must have suspicions he cant know know for certain if he digs in macao however and learns the truth he will have proof that hes been deceived by his government how specifically because the lie was delivered to him by a senior official of the state department namely me and by his lights at best he was betrayed before that much we do know i want a man at all times at immigration in macao around the clock hire people you can trust and give them photographs but no information offer a bonus for anyone who spots him and calls you it can be done but he wouldnt risk it he believes the odds are against him one informer in the hotel or at police headquarters and his wife dies he wouldnt take the chance and we cant take that chance however remote if he found out that hes being used again betrayed again he might come unhinged do things and say things that would have unthinkable consequences for us all frankly if he heads for macao he could become a terrible liability rather than the asset we think weve created termination asked the major simply i cant use that word i dont think youll have to i was very convincing i slammed my hand on the chair and raised my voice most effectively your wife will die i yelled he believed me i should have trained for the opera you did well it was a performance worthy of akim tamiroff who please i went through this at the gate i beg your pardon forget it in cambridge they said id meet people like you i had a don in oriental history who said you cant let go any of you you insist on keeping secrets because the zhongguo ren are inferior they cannot comprehend is that the case here yang guizi good lord no then what are we doing the obvious i understand we recruit a man whos in the unique position of hunting a killer because the killer is impersonating him impersonating the man he was but to go to such lengths kidnapping his wife involving us these elaborate and frankly dangerous games we play truthfully edward when you gave me the scenario i myself questioned london follow orders they repeated above all keep silent well as you said a moment ago its not good enough we should be told more without knowledge how can special branch assume responsibility for the moment the responsibilitys ours the decisions ours londons agreed to that and they wouldnt have agreed if they werent convinced it was the best way to go everything must be contained theres no room whatsoever for leakage or miscalculation incidentally those were londons words mcallister leaned forward clasping his hands together his knuckles white from the grip ill tell you this much lin i wish to god it wasnt our responsibility especially with me near the centre not that i make the final decisions but id rather not make any im not qualified i wouldnt say that edward youre one of the most thorough men ive ever met you proved that two years ago youre a brilliant analyst you dont have to possess the expertise yourself as long as you take your orders from someone who does all you need is understanding and conviction and conviction is written all over your troubled face you will do the right thing if it is given to you to execute thank you i guess what you wanted was accomplished tonight so youll soon know if your resurrected hunter retains his old skills during the coming days we can monitor events but thats all we can do theyre out of our hands this bourne begins his dangerous journey he has the names then the authentic names edward among the most vicious members of the hong kongmacao underworld upperlevel soldiers who carry out orders captains who initiate deals and arrange contracts violent ones if there are any in the territory who have knowledge of this impostorkiller theyll be found on that list we start phase two good mcallister unclasped his hands and looked at his watch good heavens i had no idea of the time its been a long day for you you certainly didnt have to return the watch and the cufflinks tonight i certainly knew that then why i dont wish to burden you further but we may have an unforeseen problem at least one we hadnt considered perhaps foolishly what is it the woman may be ill her husband sensed it when he talked with her you mean seriously we cant rule it out the doctor cant rule it out the doctor there was no point in alarming you i called in one of our medical staff several days ago hes completely reliable she wasnt eating and complained of nausea the doctor thought it might be anxiety or depression or even a virus so he gave her antibiotics and mild tranquillizers she has not improved in fact her condition has rapidly deteriorated shes become listless she has trembling seizures and her mind appears to wander none of this is like that woman i can assure you it certainly isnt said the undersecretary of state as he blinked his eyes rapidly his lips pursed what can we do the doctor thinks she should be admitted to hospital immediately for tests she cant be good christ its out of the question the chinese intelligence officer rose from the chair and approached the desk slowly edward he began calmly i dont know the ramifications of this operation but i can obviously piece together several basic objectives especially one im afraid i must ask you what happens to david webb if his wife is seriously ill what happens to your jason bourne if she dies i need her medical history and i want it just as fast as you can provide it major thats an order sir from a former lieutenant in her majestys medical corps hes the english doctor who examined me hes very civil but cold and i suspect a terribly good physician hes bewildered thats fine well get it for you there are ways you say she couldnt tell you the name of her doctor back in the united states thats the huge chinese whos always polite unctuous actually but rather sincere hes been nice to me as his men have been nice to me hes following orders theyre all following orders but they dont know why even in her lucid moments she draws a blank which is not encouraging it could be a defence mechanism indicating that she was aware of a progressive illness she wants to block out shes not that sort doctor shes a strong woman psychological strength is relative major often the strongest among us are loath to accept mortality the ego refuses it get me her history i must have it a man will call washington and people there will make other calls they know where she lives her circumstances and within minutes theyll know her neighbours someone will tell us well find her doctor i want everything on a satellite computer printout we have the equipment any transmission of information must be received at our offices then ill go with you give me a few minutes youre frightened arent you doctor if its a neurological disorder thats always frightening major if your people can work quickly perhaps i can talk to her doctor myself that would be optimum you found nothing in your examination only possibilities nothing concrete there is pain here and there isnt pain there ive ordered a cat scan in the morning you are frightened shitless major oh youre all doing exactly what i wanted you to do good god im hungry ill eat for five straight hours when i get out of here and i will get out david did you understand did you understand what i was telling you the dark trees are maple trees theyre so common darling so identifiable the single leaf is canada the embassy here in hong kong its the consulate thats what we did in paris my darling it was terrible then but it wont be terrible here ill know someone back in ottawa i instructed so many who were being posted all over the world your memory is clouded my love but mine isnt and you must understand david that the people i dealt with then are not so different from the people who are holding me now in some ways of course theyre robots but theyre also individuals who think and question and wonder why they are asked to do certain things but they follow a regimen darling because if they dont they get poor service reports which is tantamount to a fate worse than dismissal which rarely happens because it means no advancement limbo theyve actually been kind to me gentle really as if theyre embarrassed by what theyve been ordered to do but must carry out their assignments they think im ill and theyre concerned for me genuinely concerned theyre not criminals or killers my sweet david theyre bureaucrats in search of direction theyre bureaucrats david this whole incredible thing has government written all over it i know these are the sort of people i worked with for years i was one of them marie opened her eyes the door was closed the room empty but she knew a guard was outside she had heard the chinese major giving instructions no one was permitted in her room but the english doctor and two specific nurses the guard had met and who would be on duty until morning she knew the rules and with that knowledge she could break them she sat up jesus im hungry and was darkly amused at the thought of their neighbours in maine being questioned about her doctor she barely knew her neighbours and there was no doctor they had been in the university town less than three months starting with the late summer session for davids preparations and with all the problems of renting a house and learning what the new wife of a new associateprofessor should do or be and finding the stores and the laundry and the bedding and the linen the thousand and ten things a woman does to make a home there simply had been no time to think about a doctor good lord they had lived with doctors for eight months and except for mo panov she would have been content never to see another one above all there was david fighting his way out of his personal tunnels as he called them trying so hard not to show the pain so grateful when there was light and memory god how he attacked the books overjoyed when whole stretches of history came back to him balanced by the anguish of realizing it was only segments of his own life that eluded him and so often at night she would feel the mattress ripple and know he was getting out of bed to be by himself with his half thoughts and haunting images she would wait a few minutes and then go out into the hallway and sit on the steps listening and once in a great while it happened the quiet sobbing of a strong proud man in agony she would go to him and he would turn away the embarrassment and the hurt were too much she would say youre not fighting this yourself darling were fighting it together just as we fought before he would talk then reluctantly at first then expanding the words coming faster and faster until the floodgates burst and he would find things discover things trees david my favourite tree the maple tree the maple leaf david the consulate my darling she had work to do she reached for the cord and pressed the button for the nurse two minutes later the door opened and a chinese woman in her midforties entered her nurses uniform starched and immaculate what can i do for you my dear she said pleasantly in pleasantly accented english im dreadfully tired but im having a terrible time getting to sleep may i have a pill that might help me ill check with your doctor hes still here im sure it will be all right the nurse left and marie got out of bed she went to the door the illfitting hospital gown slipping down over her left shoulder and with the air conditioning the slit in the back bringing a chill she opened the door startling the muscular young guard who sat in a chair on the right yes mrs the guard jumped up shhh ordered marie her index finger at her lips come in here quickly bewildered the young chinese followed her into the room she walked rapidly to the bed and climbed on it but did not pull up the covers she sloped her right shoulder the gown slipped off held barely in place by the swell of her breast come here she whispered i dont want anyone to hear me what is it lady asked the guard his gaze avoiding maries exposed flesh instead focused on her face and her long auburn hair he took several steps forward but still kept his distance the door is closed no one can hear you i want you to her whisper fell below an audible level even i cant hear you mrs the man moved closer youre the nicest of my guards youve been very kind to me there was no reason to be otherwise lady do you know why im being held for your own safety the guard lied his expression noncommittal i see marie heard the footsteps outside drawing nearer she shifted her body the gown travelled down baring her legs the door opened and the nurse entered oh the chinese woman was startled it was obvious that her eyes appraised a distasteful scene she looked at the embarrassed guard as marie covered herself i wondered why you were not outside the lady asked to speak with me replied the man stepping back the nurse glanced quickly at marie yes if thats what he says this is foolish said the muscular guard going to the door and opening it the ladys not well he added her mind strays she says foolish things he went out the door and closed it firmly behind him again the nurse looked at marie her eyes now questioning do you feel all right she asked my mind does not stray and im not the one who says foolish things but i do as im told marie paused then continued when that giant of a major leaves the hospital please come and see me i have something to tell you im sorry i cannot do that you must rest here i have a sedative for you i see you have water youre a woman said marie staring hard at the nurse yes agreed the oriental flatly she placed a tiny paper cup with a pill in it on maries bedside table and returned to the door she took a last questioning look at her patient and left marie got off the bed and walked silently to the door she put her ear to the metal panel outside in the corridor she heard the muffled sounds of a rapid exchange obviously in chinese whatever was said and however the brief excited conversation was resolved she had planted the seed work on the visual jason bourne had emphasized and reemphasized during the hell they had gone through in europe its more effective than anything else people will draw the conclusions you want on the basis of what they see far more than from the most convincing lies you can tell them she went to the clothes closet and opened it they had left the few things they had bought for her in hong kong at the apartment but the slacks blouse and shoes she had worn the day they brought her to the hospital were hanging up it had not occurred to anyone to remove them why should they have they could see for themselves that she was a very sick woman the trembling and spasms had convinced them they saw it all jason bourne would understand she glanced at the small white telephone on the bedside table it was a flat selfcontained unit the panel of touch buttons built into the instrument she wondered although there was no one she could think of calling she went to the table and picked it up it was dead as she expected it would be there was the signal for the nurse it was all she needed and all she was permitted she walked to the window and raised the white shade only to greet the night the dazzling coloured lights of hong kong lit up the sky and she was closer to the sky than to the ground as david would say or rather jason so be it the door the corridor so be it she crossed to the washbasin the hospitalsupplied toothbrush and toothpaste were still encased in plastic the soap was also virginal wrapped in the manufacturers jacket the words guaranteeing purity beyond the breath of angels next there was the bathroom nothing much different except a dispenser of sanitary napkins and a small sign in four languages explaining what not to do with them she walked back into the room what was she looking for whatever it was she had not found it study everything youll find something you can use jasons words not davids then she saw it on certain hospital beds and this was one of them there is a handle beneath the baseboard that when turned one way or the other raises or lowers the bed this handle can be removed and often is when a patient is being fed intravenously or if a physician wants him to remain in a given position for example in traction a nurse can unlock and remove this handle by pressing in turning to the left and yanking it out as the coglock is released this is frequently done during visiting hours when visitors might succumb to a patients wishes to change position against the doctors wishes marie knew this bed and she knew this handle when david was recovering from the wounds he received at treadstone he was kept alive by intravenous feedings she had watched the nurses her soontobe husbands pain was more than she could bear and the nurses were obviously aware that in her desire to make things easier for him she might disrupt the medical treatment she knew how to remove the handle and once removed it was nothing less than a wieldy angle iron she removed it and climbed back into the bed the handle beneath the covers she waited thinking how different her two men were in one man her lover jason could be so cold and patient waiting for the moment to spring to shock to rely for survival upon violence and her husband david so giving so willing to listen the scholar avoiding violence at all costs because he had been there and he hated the pain and the anxiety above all the necessity to eliminate feelings to become a mere animal and now he was called upon to be the man he detested david my david hold on to your sanity i i love you so noises in the corridor marie looked at the clock on the bedside table sixteen minutes had passed she placed both her hands above the covers as the nurse entered lowering her eyelids as though she were drowsy all right my dear said the woman taking several steps from the door you have touched me i will not deny that but i have my orders very specific instructions about you the major and your doctor have left now what is it you wanted to tell me not now whispered marie her head sinking into her chin her face more asleep than awake im so tired i took the pill is it the guard outside hes sick he never touches me i dont care he gets me things im so tired what do you mean sick he likes to look at women he doesnt bother me when im asleep maries eyes closed the lids full zang said the nurse under her breath dirty dirty she spun on her heels walked out the door closed it and addressed the guard the woman is asleep do you understand me that is most heavenly fortunate she says you never touch her i never even thought about it dont think about it now i do not need lectures from you hag nurse i have a job to do see that you do it i will speak to major lin in the morning the woman glared at the man and walked down the corridor her pace and her posture aggressive you the harsh whisper came from maries door which was slightly ajar she opened it an inch farther and spoke that nurse who is she i thought you were asleep mrs said the bewildered guard she told me she was going to tell you that what shes coming back for me she says there are connecting doors to the other rooms who is she she what dont talk dont look at me shell see you she went down the hallway to the right you never can tell better a devil you know than one you dont you know what i mean i do not know what anybody means pleaded the guard talking softly emphatically to the opposite wall i do not know what she means and i do not know what you mean lady come inside quickly i think shes a communist from peking beijing i wont go with her marie pulled back the door then spun behind it the guard rushed in as the door slammed shut the room was dark only the light in the bathroom was on its glow diminished by the bathroom door which was nearly closed the man could be seen but he could not see where are you mrs be calm she will not take you anywhere the guard was not capable of saying anything further marie had crashed the iron handle across the base of his skull with the strength of an ontario ranch girl quite used to the bullwhip in a cattle drive the guard collapsed she knelt down and worked quickly the chinese was muscular but not large not tall marie was not large but she was tall for a woman with a hitch here and a tuck there the guards clothes and shoes fitted reasonably well for a fast exit but her hair was the problem she looked around the room study everything youll find something you can use she found it hanging from a chrome bar on the bedside table was a hand towel she pulled it off piled her hair on top of her head and wrapped the towel around it tucking the cloth within itself it undoubtedly looked foolish and could hardly bear close scrutiny but it was a turban of sorts stripped to his underpants and socks the guard moaned and began to raise himself then collapsed back into unconsciousness marie ran to the closet grabbed her own clothes and went to the door opening it cautiously no more than an inch two nurses one oriental the other european were talking quietly in the hallway the chinese was not the woman who had returned to hear her complaint about the guard another nurse appeared nodded to the two and went directly to a door across the hall it was a linen supply closet a telephone rang at the floor desk fifty feet down the hallway before the circular desk was a bisecting corridor an exit sign hung from the ceiling the arrow pointing to the right the two conversing nurses turned and started towards the desk the third left the linen closet carrying a handful of sheets the cleanest escape is one done in stages using whatever confusion there is marie slipped out of the room and ran across the hall to the linen closet she went inside and closed the door suddenly a womans roar of protest filled the hallway petrifying her she could hear heavy racing footsteps coming closer then more footsteps the guard yelled the chinese nurse in english where is that dirty guard marie opened the closet door less than an inch three excited nurses were in front of her hospital room they burst inside you you took off your clothes zang sile dirty man look in the bathroom you yelled the guard unsteadily you let her getaway i will hold you for my superiors let me go filthy man you lie you are a communist from beijing marie slipped out of the linen closet a stack of towels over her shoulder and ran to the bisecting corridor and the exit sign call major lin ive caught a communist infiltrator call the police he is a pervert out on the hospital grounds marie ran into the parking lot into the darkest area and sat breathless in the shadows between two cars she had to think she had to appraise the situation she could not make any mistakes she dropped the towels and her clothes and began going through the guards pockets looking for a wallet or a billfold she found it opened it and counted the money in the dim light there was slightly more than hong kong which was slightly less than american it was barely enough for a hotel room then she saw a credit card issued by a kowloon bank dont leave home without it if she had to she would present the card if she had to and if she could find a hotel room she removed the money and the plastic card put the wallet back into the pocket and began the awkward process of changing clothes while studying the streets beyond the hospital grounds to her relief they were crowded and those crowds were her immediate security a car suddenly raced into the parking lot its tyres screeching as it careened in front of the emergency door marie rose and looked through the automobile windows the heavyset chinese major and the cold precise doctor leaped out of the car and raced towards the entrance as they disappeared through the doors marie ran out of the parking lot and into the street she walked for hours stopping to gorge herself at a fast food restaurant until she could not stand the sight of another hamburger she went to the ladies room and looked at herself in the mirror she had lost weight and there were dark circles under her eyes yet withal she was herself but the damned hair they would be scouring hong kong for her and the first items of any description would be her height and her hair she could do little about the former but she could drastically modify the latter she stopped at a pharmacy and bought bobby pins and several clasps then remembering what jason had asked her to do in paris when her photograph appeared in the newspapers she pulled her hair back securing it into a bun and pinned both sides close to her head the result was a much harsher face heightened by the loss of weight and no makeup it was the effect jason david had wanted in paris no she reflected it was not david in paris it was jason bourne and it was night as it had been in paris why you do that miss asked a clerk standing near the mirror at the cosmetics counter you have such pretty hair very beautiful oh im tired of brushing it thats all marie left the pharmacy bought flat sandals from a vendor on the street and an imitation gucci bag from another the gs were upside down she had american left and no idea where she would spend the night it was both too late and too soon to go to the consulate a canadian arriving after midnight asking for a roster of personnel would send out alarms also she had not had time to figure out how to make the request where could she got she needed sleep dont make your moves when youre tired or exhausted the margin for error is too great rest is a weapon dont forget it she passed an arcade that was closing up a young american couple in blue jeans were bargaining with the owner of a tshirt stand hey come on man said the youthful male you want to make just one more sale tonight dont you i mean so you cut your profit a bit but its still a few dineros in your pocket right no dineros cried the merchant smiling only dollars and you offer too few i have children you take the precious food from their mouths he probably owns a restaurant said the girl you want restaurant authenticreal chinese food jesus youre right lacy my third cousin on my fathers side has an exquisite stand two streets from here very near very cheap very good forget it said the boy four bucks us for the six ts take it or leave it i take only because you are too strong for me the merchant grabbed the proffered bills and shoved the tshirts into a paper bag youre a wonder buzz the girl kissed him on the cheek and laughed hes still working on a four hundred per cent markup thats the trouble with you business majors you dont consider the aesthetics the smell of the hunt the pleasure of the verbal conflict if we ever get married ill be supporting you for the rest of my miserable life you great negotiator opportunities will present themselves recognize them act on them marie approached the two students excuse me she said speaking primarily to the girl i overheard you talking wasnt i terrific broke in the young man very agile replied marie but i suspect your friend has a point those tshirts undoubtedly cost him less than twentyfive cents apiece four hundred per cent said the girl nodding keystone should be so lucky key who a jewellers term explained marie its one hundred per cent im surrounded by philistines cried the young man im an art history major someday ill run the metropolitan just dont try to buy it said the girl turning to marie im sorry were not flakes were just having fun we interrupted you its most embarrassing really but my plane was a day late and i missed my tour into china the hotel is full and i wondered you need a place to crash interrupted the art history student yes i do frankly my funds are adequate but limited im a schoolteacher from maine economics im afraid dont be said the girl smiling im joining my tour tomorrow but im afraid thats tomorrow not tonight we can help you cant we lacy im sure we can our college has an arrangement with the chinese university of hong kong its not much on room service but the price is right said the young man three bucks us a night but holy roller are they antediluvian he means theres a certain puritan code over here the sexes are separated boys and girls together sang the art history major like hell they are he added marie sat on the campbed in the huge room under a foot ceiling she assumed it was a gymnasium all around her young women were asleep and not asleep most were silent but a few snored others lighted cigarettes and there were sporadic lurchings towards the bathroom where the fluorescent lights remained on she was among children and she wished she were a child now free of the terrors that were everywhere david i need you you think im so strong but darling i cant cope what do i do how do i do it study everything youll find something you can use jason bourne the rain was torrential pitting the sand snapping into the floodlights that lit up the grotesque statuary of repulse bay reproductions of enormous chinese gods angry myths of the orient in furious poses some rising as high as feet the dark beach was deserted but there were crowds in the old hotel up by the road and the anachronistic hamburger shop across the way they were strollers and dropins tourists and islanders alike who had come down to the bay for a latenight drink or something to eat and to look out at the forbidding statues repelling whatever malign spirits might at any moment emerge from the sea the sudden downpour had forced the strollers inside others waited for the storm to let up before heading home drenched bourne crouched in the foliage feet from the base of a fiercelooking idol halfway down the beach he wiped the rain from his face as he stared at the concrete steps that led to the entrance of the old colonial hotel he was waiting for the third name on the taipans list the first man had tried to trap him on the star ferry the agreedupon meeting ground but jason wearing the same clothes he had worn at the walled city had spotted the mans two stalking patrols it was not as easy as looking for men with radios but it had not been difficult either by the third trip across the harbour bourne not having appeared at the appointed window on the starboard side the same two men had passed by his contact twice each speaking briefly and each going to opposite positions their eyes fixed on their superior jason had waited until the ferry approached the pier and the passengers started en masse towards the exit ramp in the bow he had taken out the chinese on the right with a blow to the kidneys as he passed him in the crowd then struck the back of the mans head with the heavy brass paperweight the passengers rushed by in the dim light bourne then walked through the emptying benches to the other side he faced the second man jammed his gun into the patrols stomach and marched him to the stern he arched the man above the railing and shoved him overboard as the ships whistle blew in the night and the ferry pulled into the kowloon pier he then returned to his contact by the deserted window at midship you kept your word jason said im afraid im late you are the one who called the contacts eyes had roamed over bournes shabby clothes im the one you dont look like a man with the money you spoke of on the telephone youre entitled to that opinion bourne withdrew a folded stack of american bills denominations visible when rolled open you are the man the chinese had glanced quickly over jasons shoulders what is it that you want the man asked anxiously information about someone for hire who calls himself jason bourne you have reached the wrong person ill pay generously i have nothing to sell i think you do bourne had put away the money and pulled out his weapon moving closer to the man as the kowloon passengers streamed on board youll either tell me what i want to know for a fee or youll be forced to tell me for your life i know only this the chinese had protested my people will not touch him why not hes not the same man what did you say jason held his breath watching the man closely he takes risks he would never have taken before the chinese again looked beyond bourne sweat breaking out on his hairline he comes back after two years who knows what happened drink narcotics disease from whores who knows what do you mean risks that is what i mean he walks into a cabaret in the tsim sha tsui there was a riot the police were on their way still he enters and kills five men he could have been caught his clients traced he would not have done such a thing two years ago you may have your sequence backwards said jason bourne he may have gone in as one man and started the riot he kills as that man and leaves as another escaping in the confusion the oriental stared briefly into jasons eyes suddenly more frightened than before as he again looked at the shabby illfitting clothes in front of him yes i imagine that is possible he said tremulously now whipping his head first to one side then the other how can this bourne be reached i dont know i swear on the spirits why do you ask me these questions how repeated jason leaning into the man their foreheads touching the gun shoved into the orientals lower abdomen if you wont touch him you know where he can be touched where he can be reached now where oh christian jesus goddamn it not him bourne macao it is whispered he works out of macao that is all i know i swear it the man looked in panic to his right and left if youre trying to find your two men dont bother ill tell you said jason ones in a clump over there and i hope the other can swim those men are who are you i think you know bourne had answered go to the back of the ferry and stay there if you take one step forward before we dock youll never take another oh god you are i wouldnt finish that if i were you the second name was accompanied by an unlikely address a restaurant in causeway bay that specialized in classic french food according to yao mings brief notes the man acted as the manager but was actually the owner and a number of the waiters were as adept with guns as they were with trays the contacts home address was not known all his business was done at the restaurant and it was suspected that he had no permanent residence bourne had returned to the peninsula discarded his jacket and hat and walked rapidly through the crowded lobby to the elevator a welldressed couple had tried not to show their shock at his appearance he had smiled and muttered apologetically a company treasure hunt its kind of silly isnt it in his room he had permitted himself a few moments to be david webb again it was a mistake he could not stand the suspension of bournes train of thought im him again i have to be he knows what to do i dont he had showered the filth of the walled city and the oppressive humidity of the star ferry off him shaved away the shadow on his face and dressed for a late french dinner ill find him marie i swear to christ ill find him it was david webbs promise but it was jason bourne who shouted in fury the restaurant looked more like an exquisite rococo dining palace on pariss boulevard montaigne than a onestorey structure in hong kong intricate chandeliers hung from the ceiling the tiny bulbs dimmed encased candles flickered on tables with the purest linen and the finest silver and crystal im afraid we have no tables this evening monsieur the maitre said he was the only frenchman in evidence i was told to ask for jiang yu and say it was urgent bourne had replied showing a bill american do you think he might find something if this finds him i will find it monsieur the maitre subtly shook jasons hand receiving the money jiang yu is a fine member of our small community but it is i who select comprenezvous absolument bien you have the face of an attractive sophisticated man this way please monsieur the dinner was not to be had events occurred too quickly within minutes after the arrival of his drink a slender chinese in a black suit had appeared at his table if there was anything odd about him thought david webb it was in the darker colour of his skin and the larger slope of his eyes malaysian was in his bloodline stop it commanded bourne that doesnt do us any good you asked for me said the manager his eyes searching the face that looked up at him how can i be of service by sitting down first it is most irregular to sit with guests sir not really not if you own the place please sit down is this another tiresome intrusion by the bureau of taxation if so i hope you enjoy your dinner which you will pay for my records are quite clear and quite accurate if you think im british you havent listened to me and if by tiresome you mean that a half a million dollars is boring then you can get the hell out of my sight and ill enjoy my meal bourne leaned back in the booth and sipped his drink with his left hand his right was hidden who sent you asked the oriental of mixed blood as he sat down move away from the edge i want to talk very quietly yes of course jiang yu inched his way directly opposite bourne i must ask who sent you i must ask said jason do you like american movies especially our westerns of course american films are beautiful and i admire the movies of your old west most of all so poetic in retribution so righteously violent am i saying the correct words yes you are because right now youre in one i beg your pardon i have a very special gun under the table its aimed between your legs within the space of a second jason held back the cloth pulled up the weapon so the barrel could be seen and immediately shoved the gun back into place it has a silencer that reduces the sound of a fortyfive to the pop of a champagne cork but not the impact liao jie mu liao jie said the oriental rigid breathing deeply in fear you are with special branch im with no one but myself there is no half million dollars then theres whatever you consider your life is worth why me youre on a list bourne had answered truthfully for execution whispered the chinese gasping his face contorted that depends on you i must pay you not to kill me in a sense yes i dont carry half a million dollars in my pockets nor here on the premises then pay me something else what how much you confuse me information instead of money what information asked the chinese as his fear turned into panic what information would i have why come to me because youve had dealings with a man i want to find the one for hire who calls himself jason bourne no never did it happen the orientals hands began to tremble the veins in his throat throbbed and his eyes for the first time strayed from jasons face the man had lied youre a liar said bourne quietly pushing his right arm farther underneath the table as he leaned forward you made the connection in macao macao yes but no connection i swear on the graves of my family for generations youre very close to losing your stomach and your life you were sent to macao to reach him i was sent but i did not reach him prove it to me how were you to make contact the frenchman i was to stand on the top steps of the burnedout basilica of st paul on the calcada i was to wear a black kerchief around my neck and when a man came up to me a frenchman and remarked about the beauty of the ruins i was to say the following words cain is for delta if he replied and carlos is for cain i was to accept him as the link to jason bourne but i swear to you he never bourne did not hear the remainder of the mans protestations staccato explosions erupted in his head his mind was thrown back blinding white light filled his eyes the crashing sounds unbearable cain is for delta and carlos is for cain cain is for delta delta one is cain medusa moves the snake sheds his skin cain is in paris and carlos will be his they were the words the codes the challenges hurled at the jackal i am cain and i am superior and i am here come find me jackal i dare you to find cain for he kills better than you do youd better find me before i find you carlos youre no match for cain good god who halfway across the world would know those words could know them they were locked away in the deepest archives of covert operations they were a direct connection to medusa bourne had nearly squeezed the trigger of the unseen automatic so sudden was the shock of this incredible revelation he removed his index finger placing it around the trigger housing he had come close to killing a man for revealing extraordinary information but how how could it have happened who was the conduit to the new jason bourne that knew such things he had to come down he knew that his silence was betraying him betraying his astonishment the chinese was staring at him the man was inching his hand beyond the edge of the booth pull that back or your balls and your stomach will be blown away the orientals shoulder yanked up and his hand appeared on the table what i have told you is true the man said the frenchman never came to me if he had i would tell you everything so would you if you were me i protect only myself who sent you to make the contact who gave you the words to use that is honestly beyond me you must believe that all is done by telephone through second and third parties who know only the information they carry the proof of integrity is in the arrival of the funds i am paid how do they arrive someone has to give them to you someone who is a no one who is hired himself an unfamiliar host of an expensive dinner party will ask to see the manager i will accept his compliments and during our conversation an envelope will be slipped to me i will have ten thousand american dollars for reaching the frenchman then what how do you reach him one goes to macao to the kam pek casino in the downtown area it is mostly for the chinese for the games of fan tan and dai sui one goes to table five and leaves the telephone number of a macao hotel not a private telephone and a name any name not ones own naturally he calls you at that number he may or he may not you stay twentyfour hours in macao if he has not called you by then you have been turned down because the frenchman has no time for you those are the rules yes i was turned down twice and the single time i was accepted he did not appear at the calcada steps why do you think you were turned down why do you think he didnt show up i have no idea perhaps he has too much business for his master killer perhaps i said the wrong things to him on the first two occasions perhaps on the third he thought he saw suspicious men on the calcada men he believed were with me and meant him no good there were no such people naturally but there is no appeal table five the dealers said bourne the croupiers change constantly his arrangement is with the table a blanket fee i imagine to be divided and certainly he does not go to the kam pek himself he undoubtedly hires a whore from the streets he is very cautious very professional do you know anyone else whos tried to reach this bourne asked bourne ill know if youre lying i think you would you are obsessed which is not my business and you trapped me in my first denial no i do not sir that is the truth for i do not care to have my intestines blown away with the sound of a champagne cork you cant get much more basic than that in the words of another man i think i believe you believe sir i am only a courier an expensive one perhaps but a courier nevertheless your waiters are something else im told they have not been noticeably observant youll still accompany me to the door he had said and now there was the third name a third man in the downpour at repulse bay the contact had responded to the code ecoutez monsieur cain is for delta and carlos is for cain we were to meet in macao the man had shrieked over the telephone where were you busy said jason you may be too late my client has very little time and he is very knowledgeable he hears that your man moves elsewhere he is disturbed you promised him frenchman where does he think my man is going on another assignment of course hes heard the details hes wrong the man is available if the price is met call me back in several minutes i will speak to my client and see if matters are to be pursued bourne had called five minutes later consent was given the rendezvous set repulse bay one hour the statue of the war god halfway down the beach on the left towards the pier the contact would wear a black kerchief around his neck the code was to remain the same jason looked at his watch it was twelve minutes past the hour the contact was late and the rain was not a problem on the contrary it was an advantage a natural cover bourne had scouted every foot of the meeting ground forty feet in every direction that had a sight line to the statue of the idol and he had done so after the appointed time using up minutes as he kept his eyes on the path to the statue nothing so far was irregular there was no trap in the making the zhongguo ren came into view his shoulders hunched as he dashed down the steps in the downpour as if the shape of his body would ward off the rain he ran along the path towards the statue of the war god stopping as he approached the huge snarling idol he skirted the wash of the floodlights but what could briefly be seen of his face conveyed his anger at finding no one in sight frenchman frenchman bourne raced back through the foliage towards the steps checking once more before rendezvous reducing his vulnerability he edged his way around the thick stone post that bordered the steps and peered through the rain at the upper path to the hotel he saw what he hoped to god he would not see a man in a raincoat and hat came out of the rundown colonial hotel and broke into a fast walk halfway to the steps he stopped pulling something out of his pocket he turned there was a slight glow of light returned instantly by a corresponding tiny flash at one of the windows of the crowded lobby penlights signals a scout was on his way to a forward post as his relay or his backup confirmed communications jason spun around and retraced the path he had made through the drenched foliage frenchman where are you over here why did you not answer where straight ahead the bushes in front of you hurry up the contact approached the foliage he was an arms length away bourne sprang up and grabbed him spinning him around and pushing him farther into the wet bushes as he did so clamping his left hand over the mans mouth if you want to live dont make a sound thirty feet into the shoreline woods jason slammed the contact into the trunk of a tree whos with you he asked harshly slowly removing his hand from the mans mouth with me no one is with me dont her bourne pulled out his gun and placed it against the contacts throat the chinese crashed his head back into the tree his eyes wide his mouth gaping i dont have time for traps continued jason i dont have timer and there is no one with me my word in these matters is my livelihood without it i have no profession bourne stared at the man he put the gun back in his belt gripped the contacts arm and propelled him to the right be quiet come with me ninety seconds later jason and the contact had crawled through the soaking wet underbrush towards an area of the path some twentyodd feet to the west of the massive idol the downpour covered whatever noises might have been picked up on a dry night suddenly bourne grabbed the orientals shoulder stopping him up ahead the scout could be seen crouching hugging the border of the path a gun in his hand for a moment he crossed through a wash of the statues floodlight before he disappeared it was only for an instant but it was enough bourne looked at the contact the chinese was stunned he could not take his eyes off the spot in the light where the scout had crossed his thoughts were coming to him rapidly the terror in him building it was in his stare si he whispered jiagian in short english words said jason speaking through the rain that mans an executioner s yes tell me what have you brought me everything answered the contact still in shock the first money the instructions everything a client doesnt send money if hes going to kill the man hes hiring i know said the contact softly nodding his head and closing his eyes it is me they want to kill his words to liang on the harbour walk had been prophetic thought bourne its not a trap for me its for you you did your job and they cant allow any traces they cant afford you any longer theres another up at the hotel i saw them signaling each other with flashlights its why i couldnt answer you for several minutes the oriental turned and looked at jason there was no selfpity in his eyes the risks of my profession he said simply as my foolish people say i will join my ancestors and i hope they are not so foolish here the contact reached into his inside pocket and withdrew an envelope here is everything have you checked it out only the money its all there i would not meet with the frenchman with less than his demands and the rest i do not care to know suddenly the man looked hard at bourne blinking his eyes in the downpour but you are not the frenchman easy said jason things have come pretty fast for you tonight who are you someone who just showed you where you stood how much money did you bring thirty thousand american dollars if thats the first payment the target must be someone impressive i assume he is keep it what what are you saying im not the frenchman remember i do not understand i dont even want the instructions im sure someone of your professional calibre can turn them to your advantage a man pays well for information that can help him he pays a hell of a lot more for his life why would you do this because none of it concerns me i have only one concern i want the man who calls himself bourne and i cant waste time youve got what i just offered you plus a dividend ill get you out of here alive if i have to leave two corpses here in the bay i dont care but youve got to give me what i asked for on the phone you said your client told you the frenchmans assassin was going someplace else where where is bourne you talk so rapidly i told you i havent time tell me if you refuse i leave and your client kills you take your choice shenzhen said the contact as if frightened at the name china theres a target in shenzhen one can assume that my wealthy client has sources in queens road whats that the consulate of the peoples republic a very unusual visa was granted apparently it was cleared on the highest authority in beijing the source did not know why and when he questioned the decision he was promptly removed from the section he reported this to my client for money of course why was the visa unusual because there was no waiting period and the applicant did not appear at the consulate both are unheard of still it was just a visa in the peoples republic there is no such thing as just a visa especially not for a white male travelling alone under a questionable passport issued in macao macao yes whats the entry date tomorrow the lo wu border jason studied the contact you said your client has sources in the consulate do you what you are thinking will cost a great deal of money for the risk is very great bourne raised his head and looked through the sheets of rain at the floodlit idol beyond there was movement the scout was searching for his target wait here he said the early morning train from kowloon to the lo wu border took barely over an hour the realization that he was in china took less than ten seconds long live the peoples republic there was no need for the exclamation point the border guards lived it they were rigid staring and abusive pummelling passports with their rubber stamps with the fury of hostile adolescents there was however an ameliorating support system beyond the guards a phalanx of young women in uniform stood smiling behind several long tables stacked with pamphlets extolling the beauty and virtues of their land and its system if there was hypocrisy in their postures it did not show bourne had paid the betrayed marked contact the sum of for the visa it was good for days the purpose of the visit was listed as business investments in the economic zone and was renewable at shenzhen immigration with proof of investment along with the corroborating presence of a chinese banker through whom the money was to be brokered in gratitude and for no additional charge the contact had given him the name of a shenzhen banker who could easily steer mr cruett to investment possibilities the said mr cruett being still registered at the regent hotel in hong kong finally there was a bonus from the man whose life he had saved in repulse bay the description of the man travelling under a macao passport across the lo wu border he was tall ib white skin light brown hair jason had stared at the information unconsciously recalling the data on his own government id card it had read ht wt ibs white male hair lt brn an odd sense of fear spread through him not the fear of confrontation he wanted that above all for he wanted marie back above everything instead it was the horror that he had somehow created a monster a stalker of death that came from a lethal virus he had perfected in the laboratory of his mind and body it had been the first train out of kowloon occupied in the main by skilled labour and the executive personnel permitted enticed into the free economic zone of shenzhen by the peoples republic in the hope of attracting foreign investments at each stop on the way to the border as more and more passengers boarded bourne had walked through the cars his eyes resting for an intense instant on each of the white males of whom there was a total of only fourteen by the time they reached lo wu none had even vaguely fitted the description of the man from macao the description of himself the new jason bourne would be taking a later train the original would wait on the other side of the border he waited now during the four hours that passed he explained times to inquiring border personnel that he was waiting for a business associate he had obviously misunderstood the schedule and had taken a far too early train as with people in any foreign country but especially in the orient the fact that a courteous american had gone to the trouble of making himself understood in their language was decidedly beneficial he was offered four cups of coffee seven hot teas and two of the uniformed girls had giggled as they presented him with an overly sweet chinese ice cream cone he accepted all to do otherwise would have been rude and since most of the gang of four had lost not only their faces but their heads rudeness was out except for the border guards it was the passengers emerged through the long fenced openair corridor after dealing with immigration mostly tourists mostly white mostly bewildered and awed to be there the majority were in small tour groups accompanied by guides one each from hong kong and the peoples republic who spoke acceptable english or german or french or reluctantly japanese for those particularly disliked visitors with more money than marx or confucius ever had jason studied each white male the many that were over six feet in height were too young or too old or too portly or too slender or too obvious in their limegreen and lemonyellow trousers to be the man from macao wai over there an older man in a tan gabardine suit who appeared to be a mediumsized tourist with a limp was suddenly taller and the limp was gone he walked rapidly down the steps through the middle of the crowd and ran into the huge parking lot filled with buses and tour vans and a few taxis each with a zhan offduty posted in the front windows bourne raced after the man dodging between the bodies in front of him not caring whom he pushed aside i was the man the man from macao hey are you crazy ralph he shoved me shove back what do you want from me do something hes gone the man in the gabardine suit jumped into the open door of a van a dark green van with tinted windows that according to the chinese characters belonged to a department called the chutang bird sanctuary the door slid shut and the vehicle instantly broke away from its parking space and careened around the vehicles into the exit lane bourne was frantic he could not let him go an old taxiwas on his right the motor idling he pulled the door open to be greeted by a shout zha screamed the driver shi ma roared jason pulling enough american money from his pocket to ensure five years of luxury in the peoples republic aiyar zou ordered bourne leaping into the front seat and pointing to the van which had swerved into the semicircle stay with him and you can start your own business in the zone he said in cantonese i promise you marie im so close i know its him ill take him hes mine now hes our deliverance the van sped out of the exit road heading south at the first intersection avoiding the large square jammed with tour buses and crowds of sightseers cautiously avoiding the endless stream of bicycles in the streets the taxi driver picked up the van on a primitive highway paved more with hard clay than asphalt the darkwindowed vehicle could be seen ahead entering a long curve in front of an open truck carrying heavy farm machinery a tour bus waited at the end of the curve swinging into the road behind the truck bourne looked beyond the van there were hills up ahead and the road began to rise then another tour bus appeared this one behind them shumchun said the driver bin do asked jason the shumchun water supply answered the driver in chinese a very beautiful reservoir one of the finest lakes in all china it sends its water south to kowloon and hong kong very crowded with visitors this time of year the autumn views are excellent suddenly the van accelerated climbing the mountain road pulling away from the truck and the tour bus cant you go faster get around the bus that truck many curves ahead try it the driver pressed his foot to the floor and swerved around the bus missing its bulging front by inches as he was forced back in line by an approaching army halftrack with two soldiers in the cabin both the soldiers and the tour guides yelled at them through open windows sleep with your ugly mothers screamed the driver filled with his moment of triumph only to be faced with the wide truck filled with farm machinery blocking the way they were going into a sharp right curve bourne gripped the window and leaned out as far as he could for a clearer view theres no one coming he yelled at the driver through the onrushing wind go ahead you can get around now the driver did so pushing the old taxi to its limits the tyres spinning on a stretch of hard clay which made the cab sideslip dangerously in front of the truck another curve now sharply to the left and rising steeper ahead the road was straight ascending a high hill the van was nowhere to be seen it had disappeared over the crest of the hill kuai shouted bourne cant you make this damn thing go faster it has never been this fast i think the fuckfuck spirits will explode the motor then what will i do it took me five years to buy this unholy machine and many unholy bribes to drive in the zone jason threw a handful of bills on the floor of the cab by the drivers feet theres ten times more if we catch that van now go the taxi soared over the top of the hill descending swiftly into an enormous glen at the edge of a vast lake that seemed to extend for miles in the distance bourne could see snowcapped mountains and green islands dotting the bluegreen water as far as the eye could see the taxi came to a halt beside a large red and gold pagoda reached by a long polished concrete staircase its open balconies overlooked the lake refreshment stands and curio shops were scattered about on the borders of the parking lot where four tour buses were standing with the dual guides shouting instructions and pleading with their charges not to get in the wrong vehicles at the end of their walks the darkwindowed van was nowhere to be seen bourne shifted his head swiftly looking in all directions where was it whats that road over there he asked the driver pump stations no one is permitted down that road it is patrolled by the army around the bend is a high fence and a guard house wait here jason climbed out of the cab and started walking towards the prohibited road wishing he had a camera or a guide book something to mark him as a tourist as it was the best he could do was to assume the hesitant walk and wideeyed expression of a sightseer no object was too insignificant for his inspection he approached the bend in the badly paved road he saw the high fence and part of the guardhouse then all of it a long metal bar fell across the road two soldiers were talking their backs to him looking the other way looking at two vehicles parked side by side farther down by a square concrete structure painted brown one of the vehicles was the darkwindowed van the other the brown sedan it began to move it was heading back to the gate bournes thoughts came rapidly he had no weapon it was pointless even to consider carrying one across the border if he tried to stop the van and drag the killer out the commotion would bring the guards their rifle fire swift and accurate therefore he had to draw the man from macao out of his own volition the rest jason was primed for he would take the impostor one way or the other take him back to the border and over one way or another no man was a match for him no eyes no throat no groin safe from an assault swift and agonizing david webb had never come to grips with that reality bourne lived it there was a way jason ran back to the beginning of the deserted bend in the road beyond the view of the gate and the soldiers he reassumed the pose of the mesmerized sightseer and listened the vans engine fell to idle the creaking meant the gate was being lifted only moments now bourne held his position in the brush by the side of the road the van rounded the turn as he timed his moves he was suddenly there in front of the large vehicle his expression terrified as he spun to the side beneath the drivers window and slammed the flat of his hand into the door uttering a cry of pain as if he had been struck perhaps killed by the van he lay supine on the ground as the vehicle came to a stop the driver leaped out an innocent about to protest his innocence he had no chance to do so jasons arm was extended he yanked the man by the ankle pulling him off his feet and sending his head crashing back into the side of the van the driver fell unconscious and bourne dragged him back to the rear of the van beneath the clouded windows he saw a bulge in the mans jacket it was a gun predictably considering his cargo jason removed it and waited for the man from macao he did not appear it was not logical bourne scrambled to the front of the van gripped the rubberized ledge to the drivers seat and lunged up his weapon at the ready sweeping the rear seats from side to side no one it was empty he climbed back out and went to the driver spat in his face and slapped him into consciousness aw he whispered harshly where is the man who was in here back there replied the driver in cantonese shaking his head in the official car with a man nobody knows spare my terrible life i have seven children get up in the seat said bourne pulling the man to his feet and pushing him to the open door drive out of here as fast as you can no other advice was necessary the van shot out of the shumchun reservoir careening around the curve into the main exit at such speed that jason thought it would go over the bank a man nobody knows what did that mean no matter the man from macao was trapped he was in a brown sedan inside the gate on the forbidden road bourne raced back to the taxi and climbed into the front seat the scattered money had been removed from the floor you are satisfied said the cabdriver i will have ten times what you dropped on my unworthy feet cut it charlie chan a cars going to come out of that road to the pump station and youre going to do exactly what i tell you do you understand me do you understand ten times the amount you left in my ancient undistinguished taxi i understand it could be fifteen times if you do your job come on move get over to the edge of the parking lot i dont know how long well have to wait time is money sir oh shut up the wait was roughly twenty minutes the brown sedan appeared and bourne saw what he had not seen before the windows were tinted darker than those of the van whoever was inside was invisible then jason heard the very last words he wanted to hear take your money back said the driver quietly i will return you to lo wu i have never seen you why that is a government car one of our governments official vehicles and i will not be the one who follows it wait a minute just wait a minute twenty times what i gave you with a bonus if it all comes out all right until i say otherwise you can stay way behind him im just a tourist who wants to look around no wait here ill show you my visa says im investing money investors are permitted to look around twenty times said the driver staring at jason what guarantee do i have that you will fulfill your promise ill put it on the seat between us youre driving you could do a lot of things with this car i wouldnt be prepared for i wont try to take it back good but i stay far behind i know these roads there are only certain places one can travel thirtyfive minutes later with the brown sedan still in sight but far ahead the driver spoke again they go to the airfield what airfield it is used by government officials and men with money from the south people investing in factories industry this is the economic zone im an investor said bourne my visa says so hurry up close in there are five vehicles between us and we agreed i stay far behind until i said otherwise its different now i have money im investing in china we will be stopped at the gate telephone calls will be made ive got the name of a banker in shenzhen does he have your name sir and a list of the chinese firms you are dealing with if so you may do the talking at the gate but if this banker in shenzhen does not know you you will be detained for giving false information your stay in china would be for as long as it takes to thoroughly investigate you weeks months i have to reach that car you approach that car you will be shot goddamn it shouted jason in english instantly reverting to chinese listen to me i dont have time to explain but ive got to see him this is not my business said the driver coldly warily get in line and drive up to the gate ordered bourne im a fare you picked up in lo wu thats all ill do the talking you ask too much i will not be seen with someone like you just do it said jason pulling the gun from his belt the pounding in his chest was unbearable as bourne stood by a large window looking out on the airfield the terminal was small and for privileged travellers the incongruous sight of casual western businessmen carrying attaché cases and tennis rackets unnerved jason because of the stark contrast to the uniformed guards standing about rigidly oil and water were apparently compatible speaking english to the interpreter who translated accurately for the officer of the guard he had claimed to be a bewildered executive instructed by the consulate on queens road in hong kong to come to the airport to meet an official flying in from beijing he had misplaced the officials name but they had met briefly at the state department in washington and would recognize each other he implied that the present meeting was looked upon with great favour by important men in the central committee he was given a pass restricting him to the terminal and lastly he asked if the taxi could be permitted to remain in case transport was needed later the request was granted if you want your money youll stay he had said to the driver in cantonese as he picked up the folded bills between them you have a gun and angry eyes you will kill jason had stared at the driver the last thing on earth i want to do is kill the man in that car i would only kill to protect his life the brown sedan with the dark opaque windows was nowhere in the parking area bourne walked as rapidly as he thought acceptable into the terminal to the window where he stood now his temples exploding with anger and frustration for outside on the field he saw the government car it was parked on the tarmac not fifty feet away from him but an impenetrable wall of glass separated him from it and deliverance suddenly the sedan shot forward towards a mediumsized jet several hundred yards north on the runway bourne strained his eyes wishing to christ he had binoculars then he realized they would have been useless the car swung around the tail of the plane and out of sight goddamn it within seconds the jet began rolling to the foot of the runway as the brown sedan swerved and raced back towards the parking area and the exit what could he do i cant be left this way hes there hes me and hes there hes getting away bourne ran to the first counter and assumed the attitude of a terribly distraught man the plane thats about to take off im supposed to be on it its going to shanghai and the people in beijing said i was to be on it stop it the clerk behind the counter picked up her telephone she dialled quickly then exhaled through her tight lips in relief that is not your plane sir she said it flies to guangdong where the macao border sir never it must not be macao the taipan had screamed the order will be swift the execution swifter your wife will die macao table five the kam pek casino if he heads for macao mr allister had said quietly he could be a terrible liability termination i cant use that word you will not you cannot tell me this shouted edward newington mcallister leaping out of his chair its unacceptable i cant handle it i wont hear of it youd better edward said major lin it happened its my fault added the english doctor standing in front of the desk in victoria peak facing the american every symptom she exhibited led to a prognosis of rapid neurological deterioration loss of concentration and visual focus no appetite and a commensurate drop in weight most significantly spasms when there was a complete lack of motor controls i honestly thought the degenerative process had reached a negative crisis what the hell does that mean that she was dying oh not in a matter of hours or even days or weeks but that the course was irreversible could you have been right i would like nothing better than to conclude that i was that my diagnosis was at least reasonable but i cant simply put i was dragooned you were hit figuratively yes where it hurts the most mr undersecretary my professional pride that bitch fooled me with a carnival act and she probably doesnt know the difference between a femur and a fever everything she did was calculated from her appeals to the nurse to clubbing and disrobing the guard all her moves were planned and the only disorder was mine christ ive got to reach havilland ambassador havilland asked lin his eyebrows arched mcallister looked at him forget you heard that i will not repeat it but i cant forget things are clearer londons clearer youre talking general staff and overlord and a large part of olympus dont mention that name to anyone doctor said mcallister ive quite forgotten it im not sure i even know who he is what can i say what are you doing everything humanly possible answered the major weve divided hong kong and kowloon up into sections were questioning every hotel thoroughly examining their registrations weve alerted the police and the marine patrols all personnel have copies of her description and have been instructed that finding her is the territorys priority concern my god what did you say how did you explain i was able to help here said the doctor in the light of my stupidity it was the least i could do i issued a medical alert by doing so we were able to enlist the help of paramedic teams whove been sent out from all the hospitals staying in radio contact for other emergencies of course theyre scouring the streets what kind of medical alert asked mcallister sharply minimum information but the sort that creates a stir the woman was known to have visited an unnamed island in the luzon strait that is off limits to international travellers for reasons of a rampant disease transmitted by unclean eating utensils by categorizing it as such interrupted lin our good doctor prevented any hesitation on the part of the teams to approach her and take her into custody not that there would be but every basket has its less than perfect fruit and we cannot afford any i honestly believe well find her edward we all know she stands out in a crowd tall attractive that hair of hers and over a thousand people looking for her i hope to god youre right but i worry she received her first training from a chameleon i beg your pardon its nothing doctor said the major a technical term in our business oh ive got to have the entire file all of it what edward they were hunted together in europe now theyre apart but still hunted what did they do then what will they do now a thread a pattern its always there said mcallister rubbing his right temple excuse me gentlemen i must ask you to leave i have a dreadful call to make marie bartered clothes and paid a few dollars for others the result was acceptable with her hair pulled back under a floppy widebrimmed sunhat she was a plainlooking woman in a pleated skirt and a nondescript grey blouse that concealed any outline of a figure the flat sandals lowered her height and the ersatz gucci purse marked her as a gullible tourist in hong kong exactly what she was not she called the canadian consulate and was told how to get there by bus the offices were in the asian house th floor hong kong she took the bus from the chinese university through kowloon and the tunnel over to the island she watched the streets carefully and got off at her stop she rode up in the elevator satisfied that none of the men riding with her gave her a second glance that was not the usual reaction she had learned in paris taught by a chameleon how to use the simple things to change herself the lessons were coming back to her i realize this will sound ridiculous she said in a casual humorously bewildered voice to the receptionist but a second cousin of mine on my mothers side is posted here and i promised to look him up that doesnt sound ridiculous to me it will when i tell you ive forgotten his name both women laughed of course weve never met and hed probably like to keep it that way but then id have to answer to the family back home do you know what section hes in something to do with economics i believe that would be the division of trade most likely the receptionist opened a drawer and pulled out a narrow white booklet with the canadian flag embossed on the cover heres our directory why dont you sit down and look through it thanks very much said marie going to a leather armchair and sitting down i have this terrible feeling of inadequacy she added opening the directory i mean i should know his name im sure you know the name of your second cousin on your mothers side of the family honey i havent the vaguest the receptionists phone rang she answered it turning the pages marie read quickly scanning down the columns looking for a name that would evoke a face she found three but the images were fuzzy the features not clear then on the twelfth page a face and a voice leaped up at her as she read the name catherine staples cool catherine icecold catherine stick staples the nicknames were unfair and did not give an accurate picture or appraisal of the woman marie had got to know catherine staples during her days with the treasury board in ottawa when she and others in her section briefed the diplomatic corps prior to their overseas assignments staples had come through twice once for a refresher course on the european common market the second of course for hong kong it was thirteen or fourteen months ago and although their friendship could not be called deep four or five lunches a dinner that catherine had prepared and one reciprocated by marie she had learned quite a bit about the woman who did her job better than most men to begin with her rapid advancement at the department of external affairs had cost her an early marriage she had forsworn the marital state for the rest of her life she declared as the demands of travel and the insane hours of her job were unacceptable to any man worth having in her midfifties staples was a slender energetic woman of medium height who dressed fashionably but simply she was a nononsense professional with a sardonic wit that conveyed her dislike of cant which she saw through swiftly and selfserving excuses which she would not tolerate she could be kind even gentle with men and women unqualified for the work they were assigned through no fault of their own but brutal with those who had issued such assignments regardless of rank if there was a phrase that summed up senior foreign service officer catherine staples it was toughbutfair also she was frequently very amusing in a selfdeprecating way marie hoped she would be fair in hong kong theres nothing here that rings a bell said marie getting out of the chair and bringing the directory back to the receptionist i feel so stupid do you have any idea what he looks like i never thought to ask im sorry im sorrier ill have to place a very embarrassing call to vancouver oh i did see one name it has nothing to do with my cousin but i think shes a friend of a friend a woman named staples catherine the great shes here all right although a few of the staff wouldnt mind seeing her promoted to ambassador and sent to eastern europe she makes them nervous shes top flight oh you mean shes here now not thirty feet away you want to give me your friends name and see if she has time to say hello marie was tempted but the onus of officialdom prohibited the shortcut if things were as marie thought they were and alarms had been sent out to friendly consulates staples might feel compelled to cooperate she probably would not but she had the integrity of her office to uphold embassies and consulates constantly sought favours from one another she needed time with catherine and not in an official setting thats very nice of you marie said to the receptionist my friend would get a kick out of it wait a minute did you say catherine yes catherine staples believe me theres only one im sure there is but my friends friend is christine oh lord this isnt my day youve been very kind so ill get out of your hair and leave you in peace youve been a pleasure hon you should see the ones who come in here thinking they bought a cartier watch for a hell of a good price until it stops and a jeweller tells them the insides are two rubber bands and a miniature yoyo the receptionists eyes dropped to the gucci purse with the inverted gs oh oh she said softly what nothing good luck with your phone call marie waited in the lobby of the asian house for as long as she felt comfortable then went outside and walked back and forth in front of the entrance for nearly an hour in the crowded street it was shortly past noon and she wondered if catherine even bothered to have lunch lunch would be a very good idea also there was another possibility an impossibility perhaps but one she could pray for if she still knew how to pray david might appear but it would not be as david it would be as jason bourne and that could be anyone her husband in the guises of bourne would be far more clever she had seen his inventiveness in paris and it was from another world a lethal world where a misstep could cost a person his life every move was premeditated in three or four dimensions what if i what if he the intellect played a far greater role in the violent world than the nonviolent intellectuals would ever admit their brains would be blown away in a world they scorned as barbarian because they could not think fast enough or deeply enough cogito ergonothing why was she thinking these things she belonged to the latter and so did david and then the answer was very clear they had been thrown back they had to survive and find each other there she was catherine staples walked marched out of the asian house and turned right she was roughly forty feet away marie started running pummelling off bodies in her path as she tried to catch up try never to run it marks you i dont care i must talk to her staples cut across the pavement there was a consulate car waiting for her at the kerb the maple leaf insignia printed on the door she was climbing inside no wait shouted marie crashing through the crowd grabbing the door as catherine was about to close it i beg your pardon cried staples as the chauffeur spun around in his seat a gun appearing out of nowhere please its me ottawa the briefings marie is that you yes im in trouble and i need your help get in said catherine staples moving over on the seat put that silly thing away she ordered the driver this is a friend of mine cancelling her scheduled lunch on the pretext of a summons from the british delegation a common occurrence during the roundrobin conferences with the peoples republic over the treaty foreign service officer staples instructed the driver to drop them at the beginning of food street in causeway bay food street encompassed the crushing spectacle of some restaurants within the stretch of two blocks traffic was prohibited on the street and even if it were not there was no way motorized transport could make its way through the mass of humanity in search of some four thousand tables catherine led marie to the service entrance of a restaurant she rang the bell and fifteen seconds later the door opened followed by the wafting odours of a hundred oriental dishes miss staples how good to see you said the chinese dressed in the white apron of a chef one of many chefs pleaseplease as always there is a table for you as they walked through the chaos of the large kitchen catherine turned to marie thank god there are a few perks left in this miserably underpaid profession the owner has relatives in quebec damn fine restaurant on st john street and i make sure his visa gets processed as they say damndamn quick she nodded at one of the few empty tables in the rear section it was near the kitchen door they were seated literally concealed by the stream of waiters rushing in and out of the swinging doors as well as by the continuous bustle taking place at the scores of tables throughout the crowded restaurant thank you for thinking of a place like this said marie my dear replied staples in her throaty adamant voice anyone with your looks who dresses the way youre dressed now and makes up the way youre made up doesnt care to draw attention to herself as they say thats putting it mildly will your lunch date accept the british delegation story without a thought to the contrary the mother country is marshalling its most persuasive forces beijing buys enormous quantities of muchneeded wheat from us but then you know that as well as i do and probably a lot more in terms of dollars and cents im not very current these days yes i understand staples nodded looking sternly yet kindly at marie her eyes questioning i was over here by then but we heard the rumours and read the european papers to say we were in shock cant describe the way those of us who knew you felt in the weeks that followed we all tried to get answers but we were told to let it alone drop it for your sake dont pursue it they kept saying its in her best interests to stay away of course we finally heard that you were exonerated of all charges christ what an insulting phrase after what you were put through then you just faded and no one heard anything more about you they told you the truth catherine it was in my interest our interests to stay away for months we were kept hidden and when we took up our civilized lives again it was in a fairly remote area and under a name few people knew the guards however were still in place we i married the man you read about in the papers of course he wasnt the man described in the papers he was in deep cover for the american government he gave up a great deal of his life for that awfully strange commitment and now youre in hong kong and you tell me youre in trouble im in hong kong and im in serious trouble may i assume that the events of the past year are related to your current difficulties i believe they are what can you tell me everything i know because i want your help i have no right to ask it unless you know everything i know i like succinct language not only for its clarity but because it usually defines the person delivering it youre also saying that unless i know everything i probably cant do anything i hadnt thought of it that way but youre probably right good i was testing you in the nouvelle diplomatic overt simplicity has become both a cover and a tool its frequently used to obscure duplicity as well as to disarm an adversary i refer you to the recent proclamations of your new country new as a wife of course im an economist catherine not a diplomat combine the talents that i know you have and you could scale the heights in washington as you would have in ottawa but then you wouldnt have the obscurity you so desire in your regained civilized life we must have that its all that matters i dont testing again you were not without ambition you love that husband of yours very much i want to find him i want him back stapless head snapped as her eyes blinked hes here somewhere its part of the story is it complicated very can you hold back and i mean that marie until we go some place where its quieter i was taught patience by a man whose life depended on it twentyfour hours a day for three years good god are you hungry famished thats also part of the story as long as youre here and listening to me may we order avoid the dim sum its oversteamed and overfried the duck however is the best in hong kong can you wait marie would you rather leave i can wait catherine my whole lifes on hold half an hour wont make any difference and if i dont eat i wont be coherent i know its part of the story they sat opposite each other in catherine stapless flat a coffee table between them sharing a pot of tea i think said catherine that ive just heard what amounts to the most blatant misuse of office in thirty years of foreign service on our side of course unless theres a grave misinterpretation youre saying you dont believe me on the contrary my dear you couldnt have made it up youre quite right the whole damn things full of illogical logic i didnt say that you didnt have to its there your husband is primed the possibilities implanted and then hes shot up like a nuclear rocket why i told you theres a man killing people who claims hes jason bourne the role david played for three years a killers a killer no matter the name he assumes whether its genghis khan or jack the ripper or if you will carlos the jackal even the assassin jason bourne traps for such men are planned with the consent of the trappers i dont understand you catherine then listen to me my dear this is an oldtime mind speaking remember when i went to you for the common market refresher with the emphasis on eastern trade yes we cooked dinners for each other yours was better than mine yes it was but i was really there to learn how to convince my contacts in the eastern bloc that i could use the fluctuating rates of exchange so that purchases made from us would be infinitely more profitable for them i did it moscow was furious catherine what the hell has that got to do with me staples looked at marie her gentle demeanour again underlined with firmness let me be clearer if you thought about it at all you had to assume that id come to ottawa to gain a firmer grasp of european economics so as to do my job better in one sense that was true but it wasnt the real reason i was actually there to learn how to use the fluctuating rates of the various currencies and offer contracts of the greatest advantage to our potential clients when the deutschmark rose we sold on the franc or the guilder or whatever it was built into the contracts that was hardly selfserving we werent looking for profits we were opening markets that had been closed to us the profits would come later you were very clear about exchange rate speculation you preached its evils and i had to learn to be something of a devil for a good cause of course all right you picked what brains i have for a purpose i didnt know about it had to be kept totally secret obviously but whats it got to do with anything ive told you i smell a bad piece of meat and this nose is experienced just as i had an ulterior motive to go to you in ottawa whoever is doing this to you has a deeper reason than the capture of your husbands impersonator why do you say that your husband said it first this is primarily and quite properly a police matter even an international police matter for interpols highly respected intelligence network theyre far more qualified for this sort of thing than state departments or foreign offices cias or mis overseas intelligence branches dont concern themselves with nonpolitical criminals everyday murderers they cant afford to my god most of those asses would expose whatever covers theyd managed to build if they interfered with police work mcallister said otherwise he claimed that the best people in us and uk intelligence were working on it he said the reason was that if this killer whos posing as my husband what my husband was in peoples eyes murdered a high political figure on either side or started an underworld war hong kongs status would be in immediate jeopardy peking would move quickly and take over using the pretext of the ninetyseven treaty the oriental doesnt tolerate a disobedient child those were his words unacceptable and unbelievable retorted catherine staples either your undersecretary is a liar or he has the iq of a fern he gave you every reason for our intelligence services to stay out of it to stay absolutely clean even a hint of covert action would be disastrous that could fire up the wild boys in the central committee regardless i dont believe a word he said london would never permit it not even the mention of special branchs name catherine youre wrong you werent listening the man who flew to washington for the treadstone file was british and he was mi good lord he was murdered for that file i heard you before i simply dont believe it above all else the foreign office would insist that this whole mess remain with the police and only the police they wouldnt let mi in the same restaurant with a detective third grade even on food street believe me my dear i know what im talking about these are very delicate times and no time for hankypanky especially the sort that has an official intelligence organization messing around with an assassin no you were brought here and your husband was forced to follow for quite another reason for heavens sake what cried marie shooting forward in her chair i dont know theres someone else perhaps who its quite beyond me silence two highly intelligent minds were pondering the words each had spoken catherine said marie finally i accept the logic of everything you say but you also said everything was rife with illogical logic suppose im right that the men who held me were not killers or criminals but bureaucrats following orders they didnt understand that government was written all over their faces and in their evasive explanations even in their concern for my comfort and wellbeing i know you think that the mcallister i described to you is a liar or a fool but suppose hes a liar and not a fool assuming these things and i believe them to be true were talking about two governments acting in concert during these very delicate times what then then theres a disaster in the making said senior foreign officer staples quietly and it revolves around my husband if youre right yes its possible isnt it i dont even want to think about it forty miles southwest of hong kong beyond the out islands in the south china sea is the peninsula of macao a portuguese colony in ceremonial name only its historical origins are in portugal but its modern freewheeling appeal to the international set with its annual grand prix and its gambling and its yachts is based on the luxuries and lifestyles demanded by the wealthy of europe regardless make no mistake it is chinese the controls are in peking never it must not be macao the order will be swift the execution swifter your wife will die but the assassin was in macao and a chameleon had to enter another jungle scanning the faces and peering into the shadowed corners of the small packed terminal bourne moved with the crowd out onto the pier of the macao hydrofoil a trip that took roughly an hour the passengers were divided into three distinct categories returning residents of the portuguese colony in the main chinese and silent professional gamblers a racial mix talking quietly when they talked at all continually glancing around to size up their competition and late night revellers boisterous tourists exclusively white many of them drunk in oddly shaped hats and loud tropical shirts he had left shenzhen and taken the three oclock train from lo wu to kowloon the ride was exhausting his emotions drained his reasoning stunned the impostorkiller had been so close if only he could have isolated the man from macao for less than a minute he could have got him out there were ways both their visas were in order a man doubled up in pain his throat damaged to the point of speechlessness could be passed off as a sick man a diseased man perhaps an unwelcome visitor whom they would gladly have let go but it was not to be not this time if only he could have seen him and then there was the startling discovery that this new assassin this myth that was no myth but a brutal killer had a connection in the peoples republic it was profoundly disturbing for chinese officials who acknowledged such a man would do so only to use him it was a complication david did not want it had nothing to do with marie and himself and the two of them were all he cared about all he cared about jason bourne bring in the man from macao he had gone back to the peninsula stopping at the new world centre to buy a dark waistlength nylon jacket and a pair of navy blue sneakers with heavy soles david webbs anxiety was overpowering jason bourne planned without consciously having a plan he ordered a light meal from room service and picked at it as he sat on the bed staring mindlessly at a television news programme then david lay back on the pillow briefly closing his eyes wondering where the words came from rest is a weapon dont forget it bourne woke up fifteen minutes later jason had purchased a ticket for the run at a booth in the mass transit concourse in the tsim sha tsui during the rush hour to be certain he was not being followed and he had to be absolutely certain he had taken three separate taxis to within a quarter of a mile of the macao ferry pier an hour before departure walking the rest of the way he had then begun a ritual he had been trained to perform the memory of that training was clouded but not the practice he had melted into the crowds in front of the terminal dodging weaving going from one pocket to another then abruptly standing motionless on the sidelines concentrating on the patterns of movement behind him looking for someone he had seen moments before a face or a pair of anxious eyes directed at him there had been no one yet maries life depended on the certainty so he had repeated the ritual twice again ending up inside the dimly lit terminal filled with benches that fronted the dock and the open water he kept looking for a frantic face for a head that kept turning a person spinning in place intent on finding someone again there had been no one he was free to leave for macao he was on his way there now he sat in a rear seat by the window and watched the lights of hong kong and kowloon fade into a glow in the asian sky new lights appeared and disappeared as the hydrofoil gathered speed and passed the out islands islands belonging to china he imagined uniformed men peering through infrared telescopes and binoculars not sure what they were looking for but ordered to observe everything the mountains of the new territories rose ominously the moonlight glancing off their peaks and accentuating their beauty but also saying this is where you stop beyond here we are different it was not really so people hawked their goods in the squares of shenzhen artisans prospered farmers butchered their animals and lived as well as the educated classes in beijing and shanghai usually with better housing china was changing not fast enough for the west and certainly it was still a paranoid giant but withal thought david webb the distended stomachs of children so prevalent in the china of years ago were disappearing many at the top of the inscrutable political ladder were fat but few in the fields were starving there had been progress he mused whether much of the world approved of the methods or not the hydrofoil decelerated its hull lowered into the water it passed through a space between the boulders of a manmade reef illuminated by floodlights they were in macao and bourne knew what he had to do he got up excused himself past his seat companion and walked up the aisle to where a group of americans a few standing the rest sitting were huddled around their seats singing an obviously rehearsed rendition of mr sandman boom boom boom boom mr sandman sing me a song boom boom boom boom oh mr sandman they were high but not drunk not obstreperous another group of tourists by the sound of their speech german encouraged the americans and at the end of the song applauded gut sehr gut wunderbar danke meine herren the american standing nearest jason bowed a brief friendly conversation followed the germans speaking english and the american replying in german that was a touch of home said bourne to the american hey a landsman that song also dates you pal some of those oldies are goldies right say are you with the group which group is that honeywellporter answered the man naming a new york advertising agency jason recognized as having branches worldwide no im afraid not i didnt think so therere only about thirty of us counting the aussies and i thought i pretty much knew everybody where are you from my names ted mather im from hps la office my names jim cruett no office i teach but im from boston beanburg let me show you your landsmann or is it stadtsmannl jim meet beantown bernie mather bowed again this time to a man slumped back in the seat by the window his mouth open his eyes closed he was obviously drunk and wore a red sox baseball cap dont bother to speak he cant hear bernard the brain is from our boston office you should have seen him three hours ago j press suit striped tie pointer in his hand and a dozen charts only he could understand but ill say this for him he kept us awake i think thats why we all had a few him too many what the hell its our last night heading back tomorrow late evening flight gives us time to recover why macao a mass itch for the tables you too i thought id give them a whirl christ that cap makes me homesick the red sox may take the pennant and until this trip i hadnt missed a game and bernie wont miss his hat the advertising man laughed leaning over and yanking the baseball cap off bernardthebrains head here jim you wear it you deserve it the hydrofoil docked bourne got off and went through immigration with the boys from honeywellporter as one of them as they descended the steep cement staircase down into the posterlined terminal jason with the visor of his red sox cap angled down and his walk unsteady he spotted a man by the left wall studying the new arrivals in the mans hand was a photograph and bourne knew the face on the photograph was his he laughed at one of ted mathers remarks as he held on to the weaving beantown bernies arm opportunities will present themselves recognize them act on them the streets of macao are almost as garishly lit as those of hong kong what is lacking is the sense of too much humanity in too little space and what is different different and anachronistic are the many buildings on which are fixed blazing modern signs with pulsating chinese characters the architecture of these buildings is very old spanish portuguese to be accurate but textbook spanish mediterranean in character it is as if an initial culture had surrendered to the sweeping incursion of another but refused to yield its first imprimatur proclaiming the strength of its stone over the gaudy impermanence of coloured tubes of glass history is purposely denied the empty churches and the ruins of a burntout cathedral exist in a strange harmony with overflowing casinos where the dealers and croupiers speak cantonese and the descendants of the conquerors were rarely seen it is all fascinating and not a little ominous it is macao jason slipped away from the honeywellporter group and found a taxi whose driver must have trained by watching the annual macao grand prix he was taken to the kam pek casino over the drivers objections lisboa for you not kam pek kam pek for chinee dai sui fan tan kam pek cheng net said bourne adding the cantonese please but saying no more the casino was dark the air was humid and foul and the curling smoke that spiralled around the shaded lights above the tables sweet and full and pungent there was a bar set back away from the games he went to it and sat down on a stool lowering his body to lessen his height he spoke in chinese the baseball cap throwing a shadow across his face which was probably unnecessary as he could barely read the labels of the bottles on the counter he ordered a drink and when it came he gave the bartender a generous tip in hong kong money mgoi said the aproned man thanking him hou said jason waving his hand establish a benign contact as soon as you can especially in an unfamiliar place where there could be hostility that contact could give you the opportunity or the time you need was it medusa or was it treadstone it did not matter that he could not remember he turned slowly on the stool and looked at the tables he found the dangling placard with the chinese character for five he turned back to the bar and took out his notebook and ballpoint pen he then tore off a page and wrote out the telephone number of a macao hotel he had memorized from the voyager magazine provided to passengers on the hydrofoil he printed a name he would recall only if it was necessary and added the following no friend of carlos he lowered his glass below the bar counter spilled the drink and held up his hand for another with its appearance he was more generous than before mgoi saai said the bartender bowing msa said bourne again waving his hand then suddenly holding it steady a signal for the bartender to remain where he was would you do me a small favour he continued in the mans language it would take you no more than ten seconds what is it sir give this note to the dealer at table five hes an old friend and i want him to know im here jason folded the note and held it up ill pay you for the favour it is my heavenly privilege sir bourne watched the dealer took the note opened it briefly as the bartender walked away and shoved it beneath the table the waiting began it was interminable so long that the bartender was relieved for the night the dealer was moved to another table and two hours later he was also replaced and two hours after that still another dealer took over table five the floor beneath him now damp with whisky jason logically ordered coffee and settled for tea it was ten minutes past two in the morning another hour and he would go to the hotel whose number he had written down and if he had to buy shares in its stock get a room he was fading the fading stopped it was happening a chinese woman in the slitskirted dress of a prostitute walked up to table five she sidestepped her way around the players to the right corner and spoke quickly to the dealer who reached under the counter and unobtrusively gave her the folded note she nodded and left heading for the door of the casino he does not appear himself of course he uses whores from the street bourne left the bar and followed the woman out in the dark street which had a number of people in it but was deserted by hong kong standards he stayed roughly fifty feet behind her stopping every now and then to look into the lighted store windows then hurrying ahead so as not to lose her dont accept the first relay they think as well as you do the first could be an indigent looking for a few dollars and know nothing even the second or the third youll recognize the contact hell be different a stooped old man approached the whore their bodies brushed and she shrieked at him while passing him the note jason feigned drunkenness and turned around taking up the second relay it happened four blocks away and the man was different he was a small welldressed chinese his compact body with its broad shoulders and narrow waist exuding strength the quickness of his gestures as he paid the seedy old man and began walking rapidly across the street was a warning to any adversary for bourne it was an irresistible invitation this was a contact with authority a fink to the frenchman jason dashed to the other side he was close to fifty yards behind the man and losing ground there was no point in being subtle any longer he broke into a run seconds later he was directly behind the contact the soles of his sneakers having dulled the sound of his racing feet ahead was an alleyway that cut between what looked like two office buildings the windows were dark he had to move quickly but move in a way that would not cause a commotion not give the night strollers a reason to shout or call for the police in this the odds were with him most of the people wandering around were more drunk or drugged than sober the rest weary labourers having finished their working hours anxious to get home the contact approached the opening of the alley now bourne rushed ahead to the mans right side the frenchman he said in chinese i have news from the frenchman hurry he spun into the alley and the contact stunned his eyes bulging had no choice but to walk like a bewildered zombie into the mouth of the alleyway now lunging from the shadows jason grabbed the mans left ear yanking it twisting it propelling the contact forward bringing his knee up into the base of the mans spine his other hand on the mans neck he threw him down into the bowels of the dark alley racing with him crashing his sneaker into the back of the contacts knee the man fell spinning in the fall and stared up at bourne you it is you then the contact winced in the dim light no he said suddenly calm deliberate you are not him without a warning move the chinese lashed his right leg out shoving his body off the pavement like a speeding trajectory in reverse he caught the muscles of jasons left thigh following the blow with his left foot pummelling it into bournes abdomen as he leaped to his feet hands extended and rigid his muscular body moving fluidly even gracefully in a semicircle and in anticipation what followed was a battle of animals two trained executioners each move made in intense premeditation each blow lethal if it landed with full impact one fought for his life the other for survival and deliverance and the woman he could not live without would not live without finally height and weight and a motive beyond life itself made the difference giving victory to one and defeat to the other entwined against the wall both sweating and bruised blood trickling from mouths and eyes bourne hammerlocked the contacts neck from behind his left knee jammed into the small of the mans back his right leg wrapped around the contacts ankles clamping them you know what happens next he whispered breathlessly spacing the chinese words for final emphasis one snap and your spine goes its not a pleasant way to die and you dont have to die you can live with more money than the frenchman would ever pay you take my word for it the frenchman and his killer wont be around much longer take your choice now jason strained the veins in the mans throat were distended to the point of bursting yesyes cried the contact i live not die they sat in the dark alleyway their backs against the wall smoking cigarettes it was established that the man spoke english fluently which he had learned from the nuns in a portuguese catholic school youre very good you know said bourne wiping the blood from his lips i am the champion of macao it is why the frenchman pays me but you bested me i am dishonoured no matter what happens no youre not its just that i know a few more dirty tricks than you do theyre not taught where you were trained and they never should be besides no one will ever know but i am young you are old i wouldnt go that far and i stay in pretty good shape thanks to a crazy doctor who tells me what to do how old do you think i am you are over thirty agreed old thanks you are also very strong very heavy but it is more than that i am a sane man you are not perhaps jason crushed out his cigarette on the pavement lets talk sensibly he said pulling money from his pocket i meant what i said ill pay you well wheres the frenchman everything is not in balance what do you mean balance is important i know that but i dont understand you there is a lack of harmony and the frenchman is angry how much will you pay me how much can you tell me where the frenchman and his assassin will be tomorrow night ten thousand american dollars aiya but only if you take me there it is across the border i have a visa for shenzhen its good for another three days it may help but it is not legal for the guangdong border then you figure it out ten thousand dollars american i will figure it out the contact paused his eyes on the money held out by the american may i have what i believe you call an instalment five hundred dollars thats all negotiations at the border will cost much more call me ill bring you the money call you where get me a hotel room here in macao ill put my money in its vault the lisboa no not the lisboa i cant go there somewhere else there is no problem help me to my feet no it would be better for my dignity if i did not need help so be it said jason bourne catherine staples sat at her desk the disconnected telephone still in her hand absently she looked at it and hung up the conversation she had just concluded astonished her as there was no canadian intelligence force currently operating in hong kong foreign service officers cultivated their own sources within the hong kong police for those times when accurate information was needed these occasions were invariably in the interests of canadian citizens residing in or travelling through the colony the problems ranged from those arrested to those assaulted from canadians who were swindled to those doing the swindling then too there were deeper concerns matters of security and espionage the former covering visits of senior government officials the latter involving means of protection against electronic surveillance and the gaining of sensitive information through acts of blackmail against consulate personnel it was quiet but common knowledge that agents from the eastern bloc and fanatically religious middle east regimes used drugs and prostitutes of both sexes for whatever the preferences of both sexes in a neverending pursuit of a hostile governments classified data hong kong was a needle and meat market and it was in this area that staples had done some of her best work in the territory she had saved the careers of two attaches in her own consulate as well as those of an american and three british photographs of personnel in compromising acts had been destroyed along with the corresponding negatives the extortionists banished from the colony with threats not simply of exposure but of physical harm in one instance an iranian consular official yelling in high dudgeon from his quarters at the gammon house accused her of meddling in affairs far above her station she had listened to the ass for as long as she could tolerate the nasal twang then terminated the call with a short statement didnt you know khomeini likes little boys all of this had been made possible through her relationship with a late middleaged english widower who after his retirement from scotland yard had opted to become chief of crown colonial affairs in hong kong at ian ballantyne had accepted the fact that his tenure at the yard was over but not the use of his professional skills he was willingly posted to the far east where he shook up the intelligence division of the colonys police and in his quiet way shaped an aggressively efficient organization that knew more about hong kongs shadow world than did any of the other agencies in the territory including mi special branch catherine and ian had met at one of those bureaucratically dull dinners demanded by consular protocol and after prolonged conversation laced with wit and appraisal of his table partner ballantyne had leaned over and said simply do you think we can still do it old girl lets try she had replied they had they enjoyed it and ian became a fixture in stapless life no strings or commitments attached they liked each other that was enough and ian ballantyne had just given the lie to everything undersecretary of state edward mcallister told marie webb and her husband in maine there was no taipan in hong kong named yao ming and his impeccable sources read very well paid in macao assured him there had been no double murder involving a taipans wife and a drug runner at the lisboa hotel there had been no such killings since the departure of the japanese occupation forces in there had been numerous stabbings and gunshot wounds around the tables in the casino and quite a few deaths in the rooms attributed to overdoses of narcotics but no such incident as described by stapless informer its a fabric of lies cathy old girl ian had said for what purpose i cant fathom my source is legitimate old darling what do you smell rancid odours my dear someone is taking a great risk for a sizeable objective hes covering himself of course one can buy anything over here including silence but the whole damn things fiction do you want to tell me more suppose i told you its washingtonoriented not uk id have to contradict you to go this far london has to be involved it doesnt make sense from your viewpoint cathy you dont know theirs and i can tell you this that maniac bourne has us all on a sticky wicket one of his victims is a man nobody will talk about i wont even tell you my girl will you if i bring you more information probably not but do try staples sat at her desk filtering the words one of his victims is a man nobody will talk about what did ballantyne mean what was happening and why was a former canadian economist in the centre of the sudden storm regardless she was safe ambassador havilland attaché case in hand strode into the office in victoria peak as mcallister bounced out of the chair prepared to vacate it for his superior stay where you are edward what news nothing im afraid christ i dont want to hear that im sorry wheres the retarded son of a bitch who let this happen mcallister blanched as major lin wenzu unseen by havilland rose from the couch against the back wall i am the retarded son of a bitch the chinaman who let it happen mr ambassador ill not apologize said havilland turning and speaking harshly its your necks were trying to save not ours well survive you wont im not privileged to understand you its not his fault protested the undersecretary of state is it yours shouted the ambassador were you responsible for her custody im responsible for everything here thats very christian of you mr mcallister but at the moment were not reading the scriptures in sunday school it was my responsibility broke in lin i accepted the assignment and i failed simply put the woman outsmarted us youre lin special branch yes mr ambassador ive heard good things about you im sure my performance invalidates them im told she also outsmarted a very able doctor she did confirmed mcallister one of the best in the territory an englishman added lin that wasnt necessary major any more than your slipping in the word chinaman in reference to yourself im not a racist the world doesnt know it but it hasnt time for that crap havilland crossed to the desk he placed the attaché case on top opened it and removed a thick manila envelope with black borders you asked for the treadstone file here it is needless to say it cannot leave this room and when youre not reading it lock it in the safe i want to start as soon as possible you think youll find something there i dont know where else to look incidentally ive moved to an office down the hall the safes in here feel free to come and go said the diplomat how much have you told the major only what i was instructed to tell him mcallister looked at lin wenzu hes complained frequently that he should be told more perhaps hes right im in no position to press my complaint edward london was firm mr ambassador naturally i accept the conditions i dont want you to accept anything major i want you more frightened than youve ever been in your life well leave mr mcallister to his reading and take a stroll as i was driven in i saw a large attractive garden will you join me it would be a privilege sir thats questionable but it is necessary you must thoroughly understand youve got to find that woman marie stood at the window in catherine stapless flat looking down at the activity below the streets were crowded as always and she had an overpowering urge to get out of the apartment and walk anonymously among those crowds in those streets walk around the asian house in the hope of finding david at least she would be moving staring hearing hoping not thinking in silence half going crazy but she could not leave she had given her word to catherine she had promised to stay inside admit no one and answer the phone only if a second immediate call was preceded by two previous rings it would be staples on the line dear catherine capable catherine frightened catherine she tried to hide her fear but it was in her probing questions asked too quickly too intensely her reactions to answers too astonished frequently accompanied by a shortness of breath as her eyes strayed her thoughts obviously racing marie had not understood but she did understand that stapless knowledge of the dark world of the far east was extensive and when such a knowledgeable person tried to conceal her fear of what she heard there was far more to the tale than the teller knew the telephone two rings silence then a third marie ran to the table by the couch and picked up the phone as the third bell began yes marie when this liar mcallister spoke to you and your husband he mentioned a cabaret in the tsim sha tsui if i recall am i right yes he did he said that an uzi thats a gun i know what it is my dear the same weapon was supposedly used to kill the taipans wife and her lover in macao wasnt that it thats it but did he say anything about the men who had been killed in the cabaret over in kowloon anything at all marie thought back no i dont think so his point was the weapon youre positive yes i am id remember im sure you would agreed staples ive gone over that conversation a thousand times have you learned anything yes no such killing as mcallister described to you ever took place at the lisboa hotel in macao it was covered up the banker paid nowhere near what my impeccable source has paid in more than money in the coveted impeccable stamp of his office which can lead to far greater profits for a very long time in exchange for information of course catherine what are you saying this is either the clumsiest operation ive ever heard of or a brilliantly conceived plan to involve your husband in ways he would never have considered certainly never agreed to i suspect its the latter why do you say that a man flew into kai tak airport this afternoon a statesman whos always been far more than a diplomat we all know it but the world doesnt his arrival was on all our printouts he demurred when the media tried to interview him claiming he was strictly on vacation in his beloved hong kong and hes never taken a vacation in his life mcallister ran out into the walled garden with its trellises and white wrought iron furniture and rows of roses and rockfilled ponds he had put the treadstone file in the safe but the words were indelibly printed on his mind where were they where was he there they were sitting on two concrete benches beneath a cherry tree lin leaning forward by his expression mesmerized mcallister could not help it he broke into a run out of breath when he reached the tree staring at the major from special branch mi lin when webbs wife took the call from her husband the call you terminated what exactly did she say she began talking about a street in paris where there was a row of trees her favourite trees i think she said replied lin bewildered she was obviously trying to tell him where she was but she was totally wrong she was totally right when i questioned you you also said that she told webb that things had been terrible on that street in paris or something like that thats what she said interrupted the major but that theyd be better over here that is what she said in paris a man was killed at the embassy a man who tried to help them both what are you trying to say mcallister interrupted havilland the row of trees is insignificant mr ambassador but not her favourite tree the maple tree the maple leaf canadas symbol there is no canadian embassy in hong kong but there is a consulate thats their meeting ground its the pattern its paris all over again you didnt alert friendly embassies consulates goddamn it exploded the undersecretary of state what the hell was i going to say im under an oath of silence remember sir youre quite right the rebuke is deserved you cannot tie all our hands mr ambassador said lin you are a person i respect greatly but a few of us too must be given a measure of respect if we are to do our jobs the same respect you just gave me in your telling me of this most frightening thing sheng chou yang incredible discretion must be absolute it will be said the major the canadian consulate said havilland get me the roster of its entire personnel the call had come at five oclock in the afternoon and bourne was ready for it no names were exchanged it is arranged said the caller we are to be at the border shortly before twentyone hundred hours when the guard changes shifts your shenzhen visa will be scrutinized and rubber stamps will fly but none will touch it once inside you are on your own but you did not come through macao what about getting back out if what you told me is true and things go right therell be someone with me it will not be me i will see you over and to the location after that i leave you that doesnt answer my question it is not so difficult as getting in unless you are searched and contraband is found there wont be any then i would suggest drunkenness it is not uncommon there is an airfield outside shenzhen used by special i know it you were on the wrong aeroplane perhaps that too is not uncommon the schedules are very bad in china how much for tonight four thousand hong kong and a new watch agreed some ten miles north of the village of gongbei the hills rise soon becoming a minor range of densely forested small mountains jason and his former adversary from the alley in macao walked along the dirt road the chinese stopped and looked up at the hills above another five or six kilometres and we will reach a field we will cross it and head up into the second level of woods we must be careful youre sure theyll be there i carried the message if there is a campfire they will be there what was the message a conference was demanded why across the border it could only be across the border that too was part of the message but you dont know why i am only the messenger things are not in balance you said that last night cant you explain what you mean i cannot explain it to myself could it be because the conference had to take place over here in china that is part of it certainly theres more wen fi said the guide questions that arise from feelings i think i understand and jason did he had had the same questions the same feelings when it became clear to him that the assassin who called himself bourne was riding in an official vehicle of the peoples republic you were too generous with the guard the watch was too expensive i may need him he may not be in the same post ill find him hell sell the watch good ill bring him another crouching they ran through the tall grass of the field one section at a time bourne following the guide his eyes constantly roving over their flanks and up ahead finding shadows in the darkness and yet not total darkness fast lowflying clouds obscured the moon filtering the light but every now and then shafts streamed down for brief moments illuminating the landscape they reached a rising stretch of tall trees and began making their way up the chinese stopped and turned both hands raised what is it whispered jason we must go slowly make no noise patrols the guide shrugged i do not know there is no harmony they crawled up through the tangled forest stopping at every screech of a disturbed bird and the subsequent flutter of wings letting the moments pass the hum of the woods was pervasive the crickets clicked their incessant symphony a lone owl hooted to be answered by another and small ferretlike creatures scampered through the underbrush bourne and his guide came to the end of the tall trees there was a second sloping field of high grass in front of them and in the distance were the jagged dark outlines of another climbing forest there was also something else a glow at the top of the next hill at the summit of the woods it was a campfire the campfire bourne had to hold himself in check stop himself from getting up and racing across the field and plunging into the woods scrambling up to the fire patience was everything now and he was in the dark environs he knew so well vague memories told him to trust himself told him that he was the best there was patience he would get across the field and silently make his way to the top of the forest he would find a spot in the woods with a clear view of the fire of the meeting ground he would wait and watch he would know when to make his move he had done it so often before the specifics eluded him but not the pattern a man would leave and like a cat stalking silently through the forest he would follow that man until the moment came again he would know that moment and the man would be his marie i wont fail us this time i can move with a kind of terrible purity now that sounds crazy i know but then its true i can hate with purity thats where i came from i think three bleeding bodies floating into a riverbank taught me to hate a bloody handprint on a door in maine taught me to reinforce that hate and never to let it happen again i dont often disagree with you my love but you were wrong in geneva wrong in paris i am a killer what is wrong with you whispered the guide his head close to jasons you do not follow my signal im sorry i was thinking so am i thank you for our lives you dont have to worry you can leave now i see the fire up there on the hill bourne pulled money from his pocket id rather go alone one man has less chance of being spotted than two suppose there are other men patrols you bested me in macao but i am not unworthy in this regard if there are such men i intend to find one in the name of jesus why i want a gun i couldnt risk bringing one across the border aiya jason handed the guide the money its all there nine thousand five hundred you want to go back in the woods and count it ive got a small flashlight one does not question the man who has bested one dignity would not permit such impropriety your words are terrific but dont buy a diamond in amsterdam go on get out of here its my territory and this is my gun said the guide taking a weapon from his belt and handing it to bourne as he took the money use it if you must the magazine is full nine shells there is no registry no trace the frenchman taught me you took this across the border you brought the watch i did not i might have dropped it into a garbage bag but then i saw the guards face i will not need it now thanks but i should tell you if youve lied to me ill find you count on it then the lies would not be mine and the money would be returned youre too much you bested me i must be honourable in all things bourne crawled slowly ever so slowly across the expanse of tall starched grass filled with nettles pulling the needles from his neck and forehead grateful for the nylon jacket that repelled them he instinctively knew something his guide did not know why he did not want the chinese to come with him a field with high grass was the most logical place to have sentries the fronds moved when hidden intruders crawled through them therefore one had to observe the swaying grass from the ground and go forward with the prevailing breezes and the sudden mountain winds he saw the start of the woods trees rising at the edge of the grass he began to raise himself to a crouching position then suddenly swiftly lowered his body and remained motionless ahead to his right a man stood on the border of the field a rifle in his hands watching the grass in the intermittent moonlight looking for a pattern of reeds that bent against the breezes a gust of wind swirled down from the mountains bourne moved with it coming to within ten feet of the guard half a foot by half a foot he crawled to the edge of the field he was now parallel with the man whose concentration was focused in front of him not on his flanks jason inched up so he could see through the reeds the guard looked to his left now bourne sprang out of the grass and rushing forward lunged at the man in panic the guard instinctively swung the butt of the rifle to ward off the sudden attack jason grabbed the barrel twisting it over the mans head and crashed it down on the exposed skull as he rammed his knee into the guards ribcage the sentry collapsed bourne quickly dragged him into the high grass out of sight with as few movements as possible jason removed the guards jacket and ripped the shirt from his back tearing the cloth into strips moments later the man was bound in such a way that with every move he tightened the improvised straps his mouth was gagged a torn sleeve wrapped around his head holding the gag in place normally as in previous times bourne instinctively knew it had been the normal course of similar events he would have lost no time racing out of the field and starting up through the woods towards the fire instead he studied the unconscious figure of the oriental below something disturbed him something not in harmony for a start he had expected the guard would be in the uniform of the chinese army for he all too vividly recalled the sight of the government vehicle in shenzhen and knew who was inside but it was not simply the absence of a uniform it was the clothes this man wore they were cheap and filthy rancid with the smell of greaseladen food he reached down and twisted the mans face opening his mouth there were few teeth black with decay what kind of guard was this what kind of patrol he was a thug no doubt experienced but a brute criminal contracted in the skid rows of the orient where life was cheap and generally meaningless yet the men at this conference dealt in tens of thousands of dollars the price they paid for a life was very high something was not in balance bourne grabbed the rifle and crawled out of the grass seeing nothing hearing nothing but the murmurs of the forest before him he got to his feet and raced into the woods he climbed swiftly silently stopping as before with every screech of a bird every flutter of wings each abrupt cessation of the cricket symphony he did not crawl now he crept on bent legs holding the barrel of the rifle a club if the need arose there could be no gunshots unless his life depended on them no warning to his quarry the trap was closing it was simply a matter of patience now patience and the final stalk when the jaws of the trap would snap shut he reached the top of the forest gliding noiselessly behind a boulder on the edge of the campsite silently he lowered the rifle to the ground withdrew from his belt the gun that the guide had given him and peered around the huge rock what he had expected to find below in the field he now saw a soldier standing erect in his uniform a sidearm strapped to his waist was roughly twenty feet to the left of the fire it was as if he wanted to be seen but not identified out of balance the man looked at his watch the waiting had begun it lasted the better part of an hour the soldier had smoked five cigarettes jason had remained still barely breathing and then it happened slowly subtly no heralding trumpets an entrance devoid of drama a second figure appeared he walked casually out of the shadows parting the final branches of the forest as he came into view and without warning bolts of lightning streaked down from the night sky burning searing into david webbs head numbing the mind of jason bourne for as the man came into the light of the fire bourne gasped gripping the barrel of the gun to keep from screaming or from killing he was looking at a ghost of himself a haunting apparition from years ago come back to stalk him no matter who was the hunter now the face was at once his face yet not his face perhaps the face as it might have been before the surgeons altered it for jason bourne like the lean taut body the face was younger younger than the myth he was imitating and in that youth was strength the strength of a delta from medusa it was incredible even the guarded catlike walk the long arms loose at the sides that were so obviously proficient in the deadly arts it was delta the delta he had been told about the delta who had become cain and finally jason bourne he was looking at himself but not himself yet withal a killer an assassin a crack in the distance intruded upon the sounds of the mountain forest the assassin stopped then spun away from the fire and dived to his right as the soldier dropped to the ground a deafening echoing staccato burst of gunfire erupted from the woods the killer rolled over and over on the campsite grass bullets ripping up the earth as he reached the darkness of the trees the chinese soldier was on one knee firing wildly in the assassins direction then the earshattering battle escalated not from one level to the next but in three separate stages the explosions were immense a first grenade destroyed the campsite followed by a second uprooting trees the dry windblown branches catching fire and finally a third hurled high in the air detonating with enormous force in the area of the woods from which the machine gun had been triggered suddenly flames were everywhere and bourne shielded his eyes moving around the boulder weapon in hand a trap had been set for the killer and he had walked into it the chinese soldier was dead his gun blown away as well as most of his body a figure suddenly raced from the left into the inferno that had been the campsite then whipped around and ran through the flames turning twice and seeing jason firing at him the assassin had doubled back in the woods hoping to trap and kill those who would kill him spinning bourne leaped first to his right then to his left then fell to the ground his eyes on the running man he got to his feet and sprang forward he could not let him get away he raced through the raging fires the figure ahead of him was weaving through the trees it was the killer the impostor who claimed to be the lethal myth that had enraged asia using that myth for his own purposes destroying the original and the wife that man loved bourne ran as he had never run before dodging trees and leaping over the underbrush with an agility that denied the years between medusa and the present he was back in medusa he was medusa and with every ten yards he closed the gap by five he knew the forests and every forest was a jungle and every jungle was his friend he had survived in the jungles without thinking only feeling he knew their curvatures their vines the sudden pits and the abrupt ravines he was gaining gaining and then he was there the killer only feet ahead of him with what seemed like the last breath in his body jason lunged bourne against bourne his hands were the claws of a mountain cat as he gripped the shoulders of the racing figure in front of him his fingers digging into the hard flesh and bone as he whipped the killer back his heels dug into the earth his right knee crashing up into the mans spine his rage was such that he consciously had to remind himself not to kill stay alive you are my freedom our freedom the assassin screamed as the true jason bourne hammerlocked his neck wrenching the head to his right and forcing the pretender down both fell to the ground bournes forearm jammed across the mans throat his left hand clenched repeatedly pounding the killers lower abdomen forcing the air out of the weakening body the face the ore where was the face that belonged to years ago to an apparition that wanted to take him back into a hell that memory had blocked out where was the face this was not it delta screamed the man beneath him what did you call me shouted bourne delta shrieked the writhing figure cain is for carlos delta is for cain goddamn you who danjou i am danjou medusa tam quan we have no names only symbols for gods sake paris the louvre you saved my life in paris as you saved so many lives in medusa i am danjou i told you what you had to know in paris you are jason bourne the madman who runs from us is but a creation my creation webb stared at the contorted face below at the perfectlygroomed grey moustache and the silver hair that swept back over the ageing head the nightmare had returned he was in the steaming infested jungles of tam quan with no way out and death all around them then suddenly he was in paris nearing the steps of the louvre in the blinding afternoon sunlight gunshots cars screeching crowds screaming he had to save the face beneath him save the face from medusa who could supply the missing pieces of the insane puzzle danjou whispered jason youre danjou if you will give me back my throat choked the frenchman i will tell you a story im sure you have one to tell me philippe danjou surveyed the wreckage of the campsite now a smoking ruin he crossed himself as he searched the pockets of the dead soldier removing whatever valuables he found well free the man below when we leave he said theres no other access to this place its why i posted him there and told him to look for what like you im from medusa fields of grass poets and consumers notwithstanding are both avenues and traps guerrillas know that we knew that you couldnt have anticipated me hardly but i could and did anticipate every countermove my creation might consider he was to arrive alone the instructions were clear but who could trust him least of all met youre ahead of me its part of my story youll hear it they walked down through the woods the elderly danjou gripping the trunks of trees and saplings to ease the descent they reached the field hearing the muted screams of the bound guard as they walked into the tall grass bourne cut the cloth straps with his knife and the frenchman paid him zow bar yelled danjou the man fled into the darkness he is garbage they are all garbage but they kill willingly for a price and disappear you tried to kill him tonight didnt you it was a trap yes i thought he was wounded in the explosions its why i went after him i thought hed doubled back to take you at the rear yes we would have done that in medusa its why i thought you were him jason suddenly shouted in fury what have you done its part of the story i want to hear it now theres a flat stretch of ground several hundred yards over there to the left said the frenchman pointing it used to be a grazing field but recently its been used by helicopters flying in to meet with an assassin lets go to the far end and rest and talk just in case what remains of the fire draws anyone from the village its five miles away still this is china the clouds had dispersed blown away with the night winds the moon was descending yet was still high enough for its light to wash the distant mountains with its light the two disparate men of medusa sat on the ground bourne lit a cigarette as danjou spoke do you remember back in paris that crowded cafe where we talked after the madness at the louvre sure carlos nearly killed us both that afternoon you nearly trapped the jackal but i didnt what about paris the cafe i told you then i was coming back to asia to singapore or hong kong perhaps the seychelles i think i said france was never good for me or to me after dien bien phu everything i had was destroyed blown up by our own troops the talk of reparations was meaningless hollow babbling from hollow men its why i joined medusa the only possible way to get back my own was with an american victory i remember said jason whats that got to do with tonight as is obvious i came back to asia since the jackal had seen me my route was circuitous which left me time to think i had to make a clear appraisal of my circumstances and the possibilities before me as i was fleeing for my life my assets were not extensive but neither were they pathetic i took the risk of returning to the shop in st honore that afternoon and frankly stole every sou in and out of sight i knew the combination of the safe and fortunately it was well endowed i could comfortably buy myself across the world out of carloss reach and live for many weeks without panic but what was i to do with myself the funds would run out and my skills so apparent in the civilized world were not such that they would permit me to live out the autumn of my life over here in the comfort that was stolen from me still i had not been a snake in the head of medusa for nothing god knows i discovered and developed talents i never dreamed were within me and found frankly that morality was not an issue i had been wronged and i could wrong others and nameless faceless strangers had tried to kill me countless times so i could assume the responsibility for the death of nameless faceless other strangers you see the symmetry dont you at one remove the equations became abstract i hear a lot of horseshit replied bourne then you are not listening delta im not delta very well bourne im not go on perhaps i am comment rien go on it struck me that regardless of what happened to you in paris whether you won or lost whether you were killed or spared jason bourne was finished and by all the holy saints i knew washington would never utter a word of acknowledgement or clarification you would simply disappear beyondsalvage i believe is the term im aware of it said jason so i was finished naturellement but there would be no explanations there could not be man dieu the assassin they invented had gone mad he had killed no there would be nothing strategists retreat into the darkest shadows when their plans go off the wire i think is the phrase im aware of that one too bien then you can comprehend the solution i found for myself for the last days of an older man im beginning to bien encore there was a void here in asia jason bourne was no longer but his legend was still alive and there are men who will pay for the services of such an extraordinary man therefore i knew what i had to do it was simply a matter of finding the right contender contender very well pretender if you wish and train him in the ways of medusa in the ways of the most vaunted member of that sounofficial criminal fraternity i went to singapore and searched the caves of the outcasts often fearing for my life until i found the man and i found him quickly i might add he was desperate he had been running for his life for nearly three years staying as they say only steps away from those hunting him he is an englishman a former royal commando who got drunk one night and killed seven people in the london streets while in a rage because of his outstanding service record he was sent to a psychiatric hospital in kent from which he escaped and somehow god knows how made his way to singapore he had all the tools of the trade they simply needed to be refined and guided he looks like me like i used to look far more now than he did the basic features were there also the tall frame and the muscular body they were assets it was merely a question of altering a rather prominent nose and rounding a sharper chin than i remembered you having as delta of course you were different in paris but not so radically that i could not recognize you a commando said jason quietly it fits who is he hes a man without a name but not without a macabre story replied danjou gazing at the mountains in the distance no name none he ever gave me that he would not contradict in the next breath none remotely authentic he guards that name as if it were the sole extension of his life its revelation inevitably leading to his death of course hes right the present circumstances are a case in point if i had a name i could forward it through a blind to the british authorities in hong kong their computers would light up specialists would be flown from london and a manhunt that i could never mount would be set in motion theyd never take him alive he wouldnt permit it and they wouldnt care to and thus my purpose would be served why do the british want him terminated suffice it to say that washington had its mayi lais and its medusa while london has a far more recent military unit led by a homicidal psychotic who left hundreds slaughtered in his wake few distinctions were made between the innocent and the guilty he holds too many secrets which if exposed could lead to violent eruptions of revenge throughout the mideast and africa practicality comes first you know that or you should he led asked bourne bewildered no mere foot soldier he delta he was a captain at twentytwo and a major at twentyfour when rank was next to impossible to obtain due to whitehalls service economies no doubt hed be a brigadier or even a full general by now if his luck had held out thats what he told you in periodic drunken rages when ugly truths would surface but never his name they usually occurred once or twice a month several days at a time when hed block out his life in a drunken sea of selfloathing yet he was always coherent enough before the outbursts came telling me to strap him down confine him protect him from himself he would relive horrible events from his past his voice hoarse guttural hollow as the drink took over he would describe scenes of torture and mutilation questioning prisoners with knives puncturing their eyes and their wrists slit ordering his captives to watch as their lives flowed out of their veins so far as i could piece the fragments together he commanded many of the most dangerous and savage raids against the fanatical uprisings of the late seventies and early eighties from yemen down to the bloodbaths in east africa in one moment of besotted jubilation he spoke of how idi amin himself would stop breathing at the mention of his name so widespread was his reputation for matching even surpassing amins strategy of brutality danjou paused nodding his head slowly and arching his brows in the gallic acceptance of the inexplicable he was subhuman is subhuman but for all that a highly intelligent socalled officer and a gentleman a complete paradox a total contradiction of the civilized man hed laugh at the fact that his troops despised him and called him an animal yet none ever dared to raise an official complaint why not asked jason stirred and pained at what he was hearing why didnt they report him because he always brought them out most of them out when the order of battle seemed hopeless i see said bourne letting the remark ride with the mountain breezes no i dont see he cried angrily as if suddenly unexpectedly stung command structure is better than that why did his superiors put up with him they had to know as i understood his rantings he got the jobs done when others couldnt or wouldnt he learned the secret we in medusa learned long ago play by the enemys most ruthless conditions change the rules according to the culture after all human life to others is not what it is to the judaeochristian concept how could it be for so many death is a liberation from intolerable human conditions breathing is breathing insisted jason harshly being is being and thinking is thinking added david webb hes a neanderthal no more than delta was at certain times and you got us out of how many dont say that protested the man from medusa cutting off the frenchman it wasnt the same but certainly a variationinsisted danjou ultimately the motives do not really matter do they only the results or dont you care to accept the truth you lived it once does jason bourne now live with lies at the moment i simply live from day to day from night to night until its over one way or another you must be clearer when i want to or have to replied bourne icily hes good then isnt he your commando major without a name good at what he does as good as delta perhaps better you see he has no conscience none whatsoever you on the other hand as violent as you were showed flashes of compassion something inside you demanded it spare this man you would say he is a husband a father a brother incapacitate him but let him live let him function later my creation your impostor would never do that he wants always the final solution death in front of his eyes what happened to him why did he kill those people in london being drunks not a good enough reason not where hes been it is if its a way of life you cant resign from you keep your weapon in place unless youre threatened otherwise you invite the threats he used no weapon only his hands that night in london what he stalked the streets looking for imagined enemies thats what i gathered from his ravings it was in their eyes hed scream its always in the eyes they know who i am what i am i tell you delta it was both frightening and tedious and i never got a name never a specific reference other than idi amin which any drunken soldier of fortune would use to further himself to involve the british in hong kong would mean involving myself and after all i certainly could not do that the whole things so frustrating so i went back to the ways of medusa do it yourself you taught us that delta you constantly told us ordered us to use our imagination thats what i did tonight and i failed as an old man might be expected to fail answer my question pressed bourne why did he kill those people in london for a reason as banal as it was pointless and entirely too familiar hed been rejected and his ego could not tolerate that rejection i sincerely doubt that any other emotion was involved as with all his indulgences sexual activity is simply an animal release no affection is involved for he has no capacity for it man dieu he was so right again what happened he had returned wounded from some particularly brutal duty in uganda expecting to take up where he left off with a woman in london someone i gather rather highborn as the english say a throwback to his earlier days no doubt but she refused to see him and hired armed guards to protect her house in chelsea after he called her two of those men were among the seven he killed that night you see she claimed his temper was uncontrollable and his bouts of drinking made him murderous which of course they did but for me he was the perfect contender in singapore i followed him outside a disreputable bar and saw him corner two murderous thugs in an alleyway contrebandiers who had made a great deal of money with a narcotics sale in that filthy waterfront cave and watched as he backed them against the wall slashing both their throats with a single sweep of his knife and removing the proceeds from their pockets i knew then that he had it all i had found my jason bourne i approached him slowly silently my hand extended holding more money than he had extracted from his victims we talked it was the beginning so pygmalion created his galatea and the first contract you accepted became aphrodite and gave it life bernard shaw would love you and i could kill you to what end you came to find him tonight i came to destroy him which is part of your story said david webb looking away from the frenchman at the whitelit mountains thinking of maine and the life with marie that had been so violently disrupted you bastard he suddenly shouted i could kill you have you any idea what youve done that is your story delta let me finish mine make it neat echo that was your name wasnt it echo the memories came back yes it was you once told saigon that you would not travel without old echo i had to be with your team because i could discern trouble with the tribes and the village chiefs that others could not which had little to do with my alphabetical symbol of course it was nothing mystic i had lived in the colonies for ten years i knew when the quansi were lying finish your story ordered bourne betrayal said danjou palms outstretched just as you were created i created my own jason bourne and just as you went mad my creation did the same he turned on me he became the reality that was my invention dismiss galatea delta he became frankensteins monster with none of that creatures torment he broke away from me and began to think for himself do for himself once his desperation left him with my inestimable help and a surgeons knife his sense of authority came back to him as well as his arrogance his ugliness he considers me a trifle thats what he called me a trifle an insignificant nonentity who used him who created him you mean he makes contracts on his own perverted contracts grotesque and extraordinarily dangerous but i traced him through you through jour arrangements at the kam pek casino table five the telephone number of a hotel in macao and a name a method of contact he finds convenient to maintain and why not its virtually securityproof and what can i do go to the authorities and say see here gentlemen theres this fellow im somewhat responsible for who insists on using arrangements i created so he can be paid for killing someone he even uses my conduit the zhongguo ren with the fast hands and faster feet danjou looked at jason so thats how you did it how you found this place delta hasnt lost his touch nestcepas is the man alive he is and ten thousand dollars richer hes a moneyhungry cochon but i can hardly criticize i used him myself i paid him five hundred to pick up and deliver a message that brought your creation here tonight so you could kill him what made you so sure hed come a medusans instinct and skeletal knowledge of an extraordinary liaison he has made a contact so profitable to him and so dangerous it could have all of hong kong at war the entire colony paralysed i heard that theory before said jason recalling mr allisters words spoken that early evening in maine and i still dont believe it when killers kill each other theyre the ones who usually lose they blow themselves away and informers come out of the woodwork thinking they might be next if the victims are restricted to such a convenient pattern certainly you are right but not when they include a powerful political figure from a vast and aggressive nation bourne stared at danjou china he asked softly the frenchman nodded five men were killed in the tsim sha tsui i know that four of those corpses were meaningless not the fifth he was the vicepremier of the peoples republic good god jason frowned the image of a car corning to him a car with its windows blacked out and an assassin inside an official government vehicle of the chinese government my sources tell me that the wires burned between government house and beijing practicality and face winning out this time after all what was the vicepremier doing in kowloon to begin with was such an august leader of the central committee also one of the corrupted but as i say that is this time no delta my creation must be destroyed before he accepts another contract that could plunge us all into an abyss sorry echo not killed taken and brought to someone else that is your story then asked danjou part of it yes tell me only what you have to know my wife was kidnapped and brought to hong kong to get her back and ill get her back or every goddamned one of you will die i have to deliver your sonofabitch creation and now im one step closer because youre going to help me and i mean really help me if you dont threats are unnecessary delta interrupted the former medusan i know what you can do ive seen you do it you want him for your reasons and i want him for mine the order of battle is joined catherine staples insisted that her dinner guest had another vodka martini demurring for herself as her glass was still half full its also half empty said the thirtytwoyearold american attaché smiling wanly nervously pushing his dark hair away from his forehead thats stupid of me catherine he added im sorry but i cant forget that you saw the photographs never mind that you saved my career and probably my life its those goddamned photographs no one else saw them except inspector ballantyne but you saw them im old enough to be your mother that compounds it i look at you and feel so ashamed so damned dirty my former husband wherever he is once said to me that there was absolutely nothing that could or should be considered dirty in sexual encounters i suspect there was a motive for his making the statement but i happen to think he was right look john put them out of your mind i have ill do my best a waiter approached the drink was ordered by signal since your call this afternoon ive been a basket case i thought more had surfaced that was a twentyfourhour period of pure outer space you were heavily and insidiously drugged on that level you werent responsible and im sorry i should have told you it had nothing to do with our previous business if you had i might have earned my salary for the last five hours it was forgetful and cruel of me i apologize accepted youre a great girl catherine i appeal to your infantile regressions dont bet too much money on that then dont you have a fifth martini its only my second a little flattery never hurt anyone they laughed quietly the waiter returned with john nelsons drink he thanked the man and turned back to staples i have an idea that the prospect of flattery didnt get me a free meal at the plume this place is out of my range mine too but not ottawas youll be listed as a terribly important person in fact you are thats nice no one ever told me im in a pretty good job over here because i learned chinese i figured that with all those ivy league recruits a boy from upper iowa college in old fayette big i ought to have an edge somewhere you have it johnny the consulates like you our outposted embassy row thinks very highly of you and they should if they do its thanks to you and ballantyne and only you two nelson paused sipped his martini and looked at staples over the rim of the glass he lowered his drink and spoke again what is it catherine why am i important because i need your help anything anything i can do not so fast johnny its deepwater time and i could be drowning myself if anyone deserves a lifeline from me its you apart from minor problems our two countries live next door to each other and basically like each other were on the same side what is it how can i help yout marie st jacques webb said catherine studying the attaches face nelson blinked his eyes roving aimlessly in thought nothing he said the name doesnt mean anything to me all right lets try raymond havilland oh now thats another barrel of pickled herring the attaché widened his eyes and cocked his head weve all been scuttlebutting about him he hasnt come to the consulate hasnt even called our head honcho who wants to get his picture in the papers with him after all havillands a class act kind of metaphysical in this business hes been around since the loaves and the fishes and he probably engineered the whole scam then youre aware that over the years your aristocratic ambassador has been involved with more than diplomatic negotiations nobody ever says it but only the naive accept his abovethefray posture you are good johnny merely observant i do earn some of my pay whats the connection between a name i do know and one that i dont i wish i knew do you have any idea why havilland is over here any rumours youve picked up ive no idea why hes here but i do know you wont find him at a hotel i assume he has wealthy friends im sure he does but hes not staying with them either oh the consulate quietly leased a house in victoria peak and a second marine contingent was flown over from hawaii for guard duty none of us in the uppermiddle ranks knew about it until a few days ago when one of those dumb things happened two marines were having dinner in the wanchai and one of them paid the bill with a temporary cheque drawn on a hong kong bank well you know servicemen and cheques the manager gave this corporal a hard time the kid said neither he nor his buddy had had time to round up cash and that the cheque was perfectly good why didnt the manager call the consulate and talk to a military attaché smart corporal broke in staples unsmart consulate said nelson the military boys had gone for the day and our hotshot security personnel in their limitless paranoia about secrecy hadnt rostered the victoria peak contingent the manager said later that the corporal showed a couple of ids and seemed like a nice kid so he took a chance that was reasonable of him he probably wouldnt have if the corporal had behaved otherwise again smart marine he did behave otherwise the next morning down at the consulate he read the riot act in all but barracks language in a voice so loud even i heard him and my office is at the end of the corridor from the reception room he wanted to know who the hell we civvies thought they were up there on that mountain and how come they werent rostered since theyd been there for a week he was one angry marine let me tell you and suddenly the whole consulate knew there was a sterile house in the colony you said that catherine i didnt but ill tell you exactly what the memorandum to all personnel instructed us to say the memo arrived on our desks an hour after the corporal had left having spent twenty minutes with some very embarrassed security clowns and what you were instructed to say is not what you believe no comment said nelson the house in victoria was leased for the convenience and security of travelling government personnel as well as representatives of us corporations doing business in the territory hogwash especially the latter since when does the american taxpayer pick up tabs like that for general motors and itt washington is actively encouraging an expansion of trade in line with our widening open door policy with respect to the peoples republic its consistent we want to make things easier more accessible and this place is crowded as hell try getting a decent reservation at two days notice it sounds like you rehearsed that no comment ive told you only what i was instructed to tell you should you bring the matter up which im sure you did of course i did i have friends in the peak who think the neighbourhoods going to seed what with all those corporal types hanging around staples sipped her drink havillands up there she asked placing the glass back on the table almost guaranteed almost our information officer her office is next to mine wanted to get some pr mileage out of the ambassador she asked the cg which hotel he was at and she was told that he wasnt then whose residence same answer well have to wait until he calls us if he does said our boss she cried on my shoulder but the order was firm no tracking him down hes up in the peak concluded staples quietly hes built himself a sterile house and hes mounted an operation which has something to do with this webb this marie st somebody webb st jacques yes do you want to tell me about it not now for your sake as well as mine if im right and anyone thought youd been given information you could be transferred to reykjavik without a sweater but you said you didnt know what the connection was that you wished you did in the sense that i cant understand the reasons for it if indeed it exists i only know one side of the story and its filled with holes i could be wrong catherine again drank a small portion of her whisky look johnny she continued only you can make the decision and if its negative ill understand i have to know if havillands being over here has anything to do with a man named david webb and his wife marie st jacques she was an economist in ottawa before her marriage shes canadian yes let me tell you why i have to know without telling you so much you could get into trouble if the connections there i have to go one way if its not i can turn a hundred and eighty degrees and take another route if its the latter i can go public i can use the newspapers radio television anything that can spread the word and pull her husband in which means hes out in the cold broke in the attaché and you know where she is but others dont as i said before youre very quick but if its the former if there is a connection to havilland which you believe there is no comment if i answered you id be telling you more than you should know i see its touchy let me think nelson picked up his martini but instead of drinking he put it down how about an anonymous phone call that i got such as a distraught canadian woman looking for information about her missing american husband why would she have called you shes experienced in government circles why not the consul general himself he wasnt in i was i dont want to disabuse you johnny but youre not next in line youre right and anyone could check the switchboard and find out i never got the call staples frowned then leaned forward there is a way if youre willing to lie a bit further its based on reality it happened and no one could say that it didnt what is it a woman stopped you in garden road when you were leaving the consulate she didnt tell you very much but enough to alarm you and she wouldnt go inside because she was frightened shes the distraught woman looking for her missing american husband you could even describe her start with her description said nelson sitting in front of mcallisters desk lin wenzu read from his notebook as the undersecretary of state listened although the description differs the differences are minor and easily achieved hair pulled back and covered by a hat no makeup flat shoes to reduce her height but not that much it is she and she claimed not to recognize the name of anyone in the directory who could be her socalled cousin a second cousin on her mothers side just farfetched yet specific enough to be credible according to the receptionist she was quite awkward even flustered she also carried a purse that was so obviously a gucci imitation that the receptionist took her for a backwoods hick pleasant but gullible she recognized someones name said mcallister if she did why didnt she ask to see him she wouldnt waste time under the circumstances she probably assumed that wed sent out an alert that she couldnt take the chance of being recognized not on the premises i dont think that would concern her edward with what she knows what shes been through she could be extremely convincing with what she thinks she knows lin she cant be sure of anything shell be very cautious afraid to make a wrong move thats her husband out there and take my word for it i saw them together shes extremely protective of him my god she stole over five million dollars for the simple reason that she thought quite correctly hed been wronged by his own people by her lights he deserved it they deserved it and let washington go to hell in a basket she did that havilland cleared you for everything she did that and got away with it who was going to raise his voice she had clandestine washington just the way she wanted it frightened and embarrassed both to the teeth the more i learn the more i admire her admire her all you like just find her speaking of the ambassador where is he having a quiet lunch with the canadian high commissioner hes going to tell him everything no hes going to ask for blind cooperation with a telephone at his table so he can reach london london will instruct the commissioner to do whatever havilland asks him to do its all been arranged he moves and shakes doesnt he theres no one like him he should be back any minute now actually hes late the telephone rang and mcallister picked it up yes no hes not here who yes of course ill talk to him the undersecretary covered the mouthpiece and spoke to the major its our consul general somethings happened said lin nervously getting out of his chair yes mr lewis this is mcallister i want you to know how much we appreciate everything sir the consulates been most cooperative suddenly the door opened and havilland walked into the room its the american consul general mr ambassador said lin i believe he was asking for you this is no time for one of his damned dinner parties just a minute mr lewis the ambassador just arrived im sure you want to speak with him mcallister extended the phone to havilland who walked rapidly to the desk yes jonathan what is it his tall slender body rigid his eyes fixed on an unseen spot in the garden beyond the large bay window the ambassador stood in silence listening finally he spoke thank you jonathan you did the right thing say absolutely nothing to anyone and ill take it from here havilland hung up and looked alternately at mcallister and wenzu our breakthrough if it is a breakthrough just came from the wrong direction not the canadian but the american consulate its not consistent said mcallister its not paris not the street with her favourite tree the maple tree the maple leaf thats the canadian consulate not the american and with that analysis are we to disregard it of course not what happened an attaché named nelson was stopped in garden road by a canadian woman trying to find her american husband this nelson offered to help her to accompany her to the police but she was adamant she wouldnt go to the police and neither would she go back with him to his office did she give any reasons asked lin she appeals for help and then refuses it just that it was personal nelson described her as highstrung overwrought she identified herself as marie webb and said that perhaps her husband had come to the consulate looking for her could nelson ask around and shed call him back thats not what she said before protested mcallister she was clearly referring to what had happened to them in paris and that meant reaching an official of her own government her own country canada why do you persist asked havilland thats not a criticism i simply want to know why im not sure somethings not right among other things the major here established the fact that she did go to the canadian consulate oh the ambassador looked at the man from special branch the receptionist confirmed it the description was close enough especially for someone trained by a chameleon her story was that she had promised her family she would look up a distant cousin whose last name she had forgotten the receptionist gave her a directory and she went through it she found someone she knew interrupted the undersecretary of state she made contact then theres your answer said havilland firmly she learned that her husband had not gone to a street with a row of maple trees so she took the next best course of action the american consulate and identified herself when she has to know people are looking for her all over hong kong giving a false name would serve no purpose the ambassador replied they both speak french she could have used a french word toile for instance it means web i know what it means but i think youre reaching her husband would have understood she would have done something less obvious mr ambassador interrupted lin wenzu slowly taking his eyes off mcallister hearing your words to the american consul general that he should say absolutely nothing to anyone and now fully understanding your concerns for secrecy i assume mr lewis has not been apprised of the situation correct major then why did he call you people frequently get lost here in hong kong a missing husband or a missing wife is not so uncommon for an instant havillands expression was creased with self doubt jonathan lewis and i go back a long time he said his voice lacking its usual authority he may be something of a bon vivani but hes no fool he wouldnt be here if he were and the circumstances under which the woman stopped his attaché well lewis knows me and he drew certain conclusions the diplomat turned to mcallister when he continued his authority gradually returned call lewis back edward tell him to instruct this nelson to stand by for a call from you id prefer a less direct approach but there isnt time i want you to question him question him on anything and everything you can think of ill be listening on the line in your office you agree then said the undersecretary somethings wrong yes answered havilland looking at lin the major saw it and i didnt id phrase it somewhat differently but its essentially what disturbs him the question is not why lewis called me its why an attaché went to him after all a highly agitated woman says her husbands missing but she wont go to the police wont enter the consulate normally such a person would be dismissed as a crank certainly on the surface its not a matter to bring to the attention of an overworked cg call lewis of course but first did things go smoothly with the canadian commissioner will he cooperate the answer to your first question is no things did not go smoothly as to the second he has no choice i dont understand havilland exhaled in weary irritation through ottawa hell provide us with a list of everyone on his staff whos had any dealings whatsoever with marie st jacques reluctantly thats the cooperation hes been instructed to deliver but he was damned testy about it to begin with he himself went through a twoday seminar with her four years ago and he ventured that probably a quarter of the consulate had done the same not that shed remember them but they certainly would remember her she was outstanding that was the way he put it shes also a canadian who was thoroughly messed up by a group of american assholes mind you he had no compunction at all using the word in some kind of mentally deranged black operation yes that was the phrase he used mentally deranged an idiotic operation mounted by these same assholes indeed he repeated it that has never been satisfactorily explained the ambassador stopped briefly smiling briefly as he coughed a short laugh it was all very refreshing he didnt pull a single punch and i havent been talked to like that since my dear wife died i need more of it but you did tell him it was for her own good didnt you that weve got to find her before any harms done to her i got the distinct impression that our canadian friend had serious doubts as to my mental faculties call lewis god knows when well get that list our maple leaf will probably have it sent by train from ottawa to vancouver and then on a slow freighter to hong kong where itll get lost in the mailroom in the meantime weve got an attaché who behaves very strangely he leaps over fences when no such jumps are required ive met john nelson sir said lin hes a bright lad and speaks a fair chinese hes quite popular with the consulate crowd hes also something else major nelson hung up the phone beads of perspiration had broken out on his forehead he wiped them off with the back of his hand satisfied that he had handled himself as well as he did all things considered he was especially pleased that he had turned the thrust of mcallisters questions against the questioner albeit diplomatically why did you feel compelled to go to the consul general your call would seem to answer that mr mcallister i sensed that something out of the ordinary had happened i thought the consul should be told but the woman refused to go to the police she even refused to come inside the consulate as i said it was out of the ordinary sir she was nervous and tense but she wasnt a ding dong a what she was perfectly lucid you could even say controlled in spite of her anxiety i see i wonder if you do sir i have no idea what the consul general told you but i did suggest to him that what with the house in victoria peak the marine guards and then the arrival of ambassador havilland he might consider calling someone up there you suggested it yes i did why i dont think it would serve any purpose for me to speculate on these matters mr mcallister they dont concern me yes of course youre right i mean yes all right but we must find that woman mr nelson ive been instructed to tell you that if you can help us it would be greatly to your advantage i want to help in any event sir if she reaches me ill try to set up a meeting somewhere and call you i knew i was right to do what i did to say what i did well wait for your call catherine was on target thought john nelson there was one hell of a connection so much of a connection that he did not dare use his consulate phone to call staples but when he did reach her he would ask her some very hard questions he trusted catherine but the photographs and their consequences notwithstanding he was not for sale he got up from his desk and headed for the door of his office a suddenly remembered dental appointment would suffice as he walked down the corridor towards the reception room his thoughts returned to catherine staples catherine was one of the strongest people he had ever met but the look in her eyes last night had conveyed not strength but a kind of desperate fear it was a catherine he had never seen before he diverted your questions to his own ends said havilland coming through the door the immense lin wenzu behind him do you agree major yes and that means he anticipated the questions he was primed for them which means someone primed him we never should have called him said mcallister quietly sitting behind the desk his nervous fingers once again massaging his right temple nearly everything he brought up was meant to provoke a response from me we had to call him insisted havilland if only to learn that he stayed in control i lost it you could not have behaved differently edward said lin to react other than you did would have been to question his motives in essence you would have threatened him and at the moment we dont want him to feel threatened agreed havilland hes getting information for someone and weve got to find out who it is and that means webbs wife did reach someone she knew and told that person everything mcallister leaned forward his elbows on the desk his hands tightly clasped you were right after all said the ambassador looking down at the undersecretary of state a street with her favourite maple trees paris the inevitable repetition its quite clear nelson is working for someone in the canadian consulate and whoever it is is in touch with webbs wife mcallister looked up then nelsons either a damn fool or a bigger damn fool by his own admission he knows at least he assumes that hes dealing with highly sensitive information involving an adviser to presidents dismissal aside he could be sent to prison for conspiring against the government hes not a fool i can assure you said lin then either someone is forcing him to do this against his win blackmail most likely or hes being paid to find out if theres a connection between marie st jacques and this house in victoria peak it cant be anything else frowning havilland sat down in the chair in front of the desk give me a day continued the major from mi perhaps i can find out if i can well pick up whoever it is in the consulate no said the diplomat whose expertise lay in covert operations you have until eight oclock tonight we cant afford that but if we can avoid a confrontation and any possible fallout we must try containment is everything try lin for gods sake try and after eight oclock mr ambassador what then then major we pull in our clever and evasive attaché and break him id much prefer to use him without his knowing it without risking alarms but the woman comes first eight oclock major lin ill do everything i can and if were wrong went on havilland as if lin wenzu had not spoken if this nelson has been set up as a blind and knows nothing i want all the rules broken i dont care how you do it or how much it costs in bribes or the garbage you have to employ to get it done i want cameras telephone taps electronic surveillance whatever you can manage on every single person in that consulate someone there knows where she is someone there is hiding her catherine its john said nelson into the pay phone on albert road how good of you to call answered staples quickly its been a trying afternoon but do lets have drinks one of these days itll be so good to see you after all these months and you can tell me about canberra but do tell me one thing now was i right in what i told you i have to see you catherine not even a hint i have to see you are you free i have a meeting in fortyfive minutes then later around five theres a place called the monkey tree in the wanchai on gloucester i know it ill be there john nelson hung up there was nothing else to do but go back to the office he could not stay away for three hours not after his conversation with undersecretary of state edward mcallister appearances precluded such an absence he had heard about mcallister the undersecretary had spent seven years in hong kong leaving only months before nelson had arrived why had he returned why was there a sterile house in victoria peak with ambassador havilland suddenly in residence above all why was catherine staples so frightened he owed catherine his career but he had to have a few answers he had a decision to make lin wenzu had all but exhausted his sources only one gave him pause for thought inspector ian ballantyne as he usually did answered questions with other questions rather than delivering concise answers himself it was maddening for one never knew whether the man from scotland yard knew something or not about a given subject in this case an american attaché named john nelson met the chap several times ballantyne had said bright sort speaks your lingo did you know that my lingo inspector well damn few of us did even during the opium wars interesting period of history wasnt it major the opium wars i was talking about the attache john nelson oh is there a connection with what inspector the opium wars if there is hes a hundred and fifty years old and his dossier says thirtytwo really that young but ballantyne had employed several pauses too many to satisfy lin if the old warhorse did know something he was not going to reveal it everyone else from the hong kong and kowloon police to the specialists who worked the american consulate gathering information for payment gave nelson as clean a bill of health as was respectable in the territory if nelson had a vulnerable side it was in his extensive and not too discriminate search for sex but insofar as it was heterosexual and he was single it was to be applauded not condemned one specialist told lin that he heard nelson had been warned to have himself medically checked on a fairly regular basis no crime the attache was a cocksman ask him to dinner the telephone rang lin grabbed it yes our subject walked to the peak tram and took a taxi to the wanchai he is in a cafe called the monkey tree i am with him i can see him its out of the way and very crowded said the major has anyone joined him no but he asked for a table for two ill be there as soon as i can if you have to leave ill contact you by radio youre driving vehicle seven are you not vehicle seven sir wait a woman is walking towards his table hes getting up do you recognize her its too dark here no pay the waiter disrupt the service but not obviously only for a few minutes ill use our ambulance and the siren until im a block away catherine i owe you so much and i want to help you in any way i can but i have to know more than what youve told me theres a connection isnt there havilland and marie st jacques i wont confirm that i cant confirm it because i havent spoken to havilland i did however speak to another man a man ive heard a lot about who used to be stationed here one hell of a brain and he sounded as desperate as you did last night i seemed that way to you last night said staples smoothing her greystreaked hair i wasnt aware of it hey come on not in your words maybe but in the way you talked the stridency was just below the surface you sounded like me when you gave me the photographs believe me i can identify johnny believe me we may be dealing with something neither of us should get near something way up in the clouds on which we i dont have the knowledge to make a proper decision i have to make a decision catherine nelson looked up for the waiter where are those goddamned drinks im not panting i am i owe you everything and i like you and i know you wouldnt use the photographs against me which makes it all worse i gave you all there were and we burned the negatives together so my debts real dont you see that jesus the kid was what twelve years old you didnt know that you were drugged my passport to oblivion no secretary of state in my future only secretary of kiddieporn one hell of a trip its over and youre being melodramatic i just want you to tell me if theres a connection between havilland and marie st jacques which i think you can do why is that so difficult i will know what to do then because if i do i have to tell havilland that i told you then give me an hour why because i do have several photographs in my vault at the consulate lied catherine staples nelson shot back in his chair stunned oh god i dont believe this try to understand johnny we all play hardball now and then because its in the best interests of our employers our individual countries if you like marie st jacques was a friend of mine is a friend of mine and her life became nothing in the eyes of selfimportant men who ran a covert operation that didnt give a holy damn about her and her husband they used them both and then tried to kill them both let me tell you something johnny i detest your central intelligence agency and your state departments sograndly named consular operations its not that they re bastards its that theyre such stupid bastards and if i sense that an operation is being mounted again using these two people whove been through so much pain i intend to find out why and act accordingly there can be no more blank cheques with their lives im experienced and theyre not and im angry enough no furious enough to demand answers oh christ the waiter arrived with their drinks and as staples looked up to signify thanks her eyes were drawn to a man by a telephone booth in the crowded outside corridor watching them she looked away whats it going to be johnny she continued confirm or deny confirmed whispered nelson reaching for his glass the house in victoria peak yes who was the man you spoke with the one who had been stationed here mcallister undersecretary of state mcallister good lord there was excessive movement in the outside corridor catherine shielded her eyes and turned her head slightly which widened her peripheral vision a large man entered and walked towards the telephone against the wall there was only one man like him in all of hong kong it was lin wenzu mi special branch the americans had enlisted the best but it could be the worst for marie and her husband youve done nothing wrong johnny said staples rising from her chair well talk further but right now im going to the ladies room catherine what hard ball very hard my darling staples walked past a shrinking wenzu who turned away she went into the ladies room waited several seconds then walked out with two other women and broke away continuing down the corridor and into the monkey trees kitchen without saying a word to the startled waiters and cooks she found the exit and went outside she ran up the alley into gloucester road she turned left her stride quickening until she found a phone booth inserting a coin she dialled hello marie get out of the flat my cars in a garage a block to your right as you leave the building its called mings the signs in red get there as quickly as you can ill meet you hurry catherine staples hailed a taxi the womans name is staples catherine staples said lin wenzu sharply into the phone on the corridor wall of the monkey tree raising his voice to be heard over the din insert the consulate disk and search it through the computer quickly i want her address and make damndamn sure its current the muscles of the majors jaw worked furiously as he waited listening the answer was delivered and he issued another order if one of our teams vehicles is in the area get on the radio and tell him to head over there if not dispatch one immediately lin paused again listening the american woman he said quietly into the phone theyre to watch for her if shes spotted close in and take her were on our way vehicle five respond repeated the radio operator speaking into a microphone his hand on a switch in the lower righthand corner of the console in front of him the room was white and without windows the hum of the air conditioning low but constant the whir of the filtering system even quieter on three walls there were banks of sophisticated radio and computer equipment above spotless white counters made of the smoothest formica there was an antiseptic quality about the room hardness was everywhere it might have been an electronics laboratory in a wellendowed medical centre but it was not it was another kind of centre the communications centre of mi special branch hong kong vehicle five responding shouted an outofbreath voice over the speaker i received your signal but i was a street away covering the thai we were right drugs go on scrambler ordered the operator throwing the switch there was a whistling sound that stopped as abruptly as it had started youre off the thai continued the radioman youre nearest get over to arbuthnot road the botanical gardens entrance is the quickest way he gave the address of catherine stapless building and ended with a final command the american woman watch for her take her aiya whispered the breathless agent from special branch marie tried not to panic imposing a control over herself she did not feel the situation was ludicrous it was also deadly serious she was dressed in catherines illfitting robe having taken a long hot bath and far worse having washed her clothes in stapless kitchen sink they were hanging over the plastic chairs on catherines small balcony and were still wet it had seemed so natural so logical to wash away the heat and the dirt of hong kong from herself as well as from the strangers clothes and the cheap sandals had raised blisters on the soles of her feet she had broken an ugly one with a needle and walking was difficult but she dared not walk she had to run what had happened catherine was not the sort of person to issue peremptory commands any more than she herself was especially with david people like catherine avoided the imperative approach because it only clouded a victims thinking and her friend marie st jacques was a victim now not to the degree that poor david was but a victim nevertheless move how often had jason said that in zurich and paris so frequently she still tensed at the word she dressed the wet clothes clinging to her body and rummaged through catherines closet for a pair of slippers they were uncomfortable but softer than the sandals she could run she had to run her hair oh christ the hair she ran to the bathroom where catherine kept a porcelain jar filled with hairpins and clasps in seconds she secured her hair on the top of her head walked rapidly back into the flats tiny living room found her foolish hat and jammed it on the wait for the elevator was interminable according to the lighted numbers above the panels both elevators jogged between floors and neither venturing above to the th floor preceding residents going out for the evening had programmed the vertical monsters delaying her descent avoid elevators whenever you can theyre traps jason bourne zurich marie looked up and down the hallway she saw the fire exit staircase door and ran to it out of breath she lunged into the short lobby composing herself as best she could to deflect the glances directed at her by five or six tenants some entering some leaving she did not count she could barely see she had to get out my cars in a garage a block to your right as you leave the building its called mings was it to the right or was it left out on the pavement she hesitated right or left right meant so many things left was more specific she tried to think what had catherine said right she had to go right it was the first thing that came to her mind she had to trust that your first reflections are the best the most accurate because the impressions are stored in your head like information in a data bank thats what your head is jason bourne paris she started running her left slipper fell off she stopped stooping down to retrieve it suddenly a car came careening around the gates of the botanical gardens across the wide street and like an angry heatsearching missile whipped to its left and zeroed in on her the automobile swerved in a semicircle screeching as it spun in the road a man leaped out and raced towards her there was nothing else to do she was cornered trapped marie screamed and screamed again and again as the chinese agent approached her hysteria mounting as the man politely but firmly took her by the arm she recognized him he was one of them one of the bureaucrats her screams reached a crescendo people stopped and turned in the street women gasped as startled hesitant men stepped haltingly forward others looking around frantically for the police several shouting for them by name please mrs cried the oriental trying to keep his voice controlled no harm will come to you allow me to escort you to my vehicle it is for your own protection help me shrieked marie as the astonished twilight strollers gathered into a crowd this mans a thief i he stole my purse my money hes trying to take my jewellery see here chap shouted an elderly englishman hobbling forward raising his walking stick ive sent a lad for the police but until they arrive by god ill thrash you please sir insisted the man from special branch quietly this is a matter for the authorities and i am with the authorities permit me to show you my identification easy mater roared a voice with an australian accent as a man rushed forward gently pushing the elderly briton aside and lowering his cane youre a grand fair dinkum old man but dont half bother yourself these punks call for a younger type the strapping australian stood in front of the chinese agent take yer hands off the lady punkhead and id be goddamned quick about it if i were you please sir this is a serious misunderstanding the lady is in danger and she is wanted for questioning by the authorities i dont see you in no uniform permit me to show you my credentials thats what he said an hour ago when he attacked me in garden road shouted marie hysterically people tried to help me then he lied to everyone then he stole my purse hes been following me marie knew that none of the things she kept screaming made sense she could only hope for confusion something that jason had taught her to use im not saying it agyne mate yelled the australian stepping forward tyke yer bloody hands off the lady please sir i cannot do that other officials are on their way oh they are are they you punkheads travel in gangs do you well youll be a pitiful sight for their eyes when they get here the australian grabbed the oriental by the shoulder spinning him to his left but as the man from special branch spun his right foot the toe of his leather shoe extended like a knifepoint whipped around crashing up into the australians abdomen the good samaritan from down under doubled over falling to his knees ill ask you again not to interfere sir do you now you slopeeyed son of a bitch the furious australian lunged up hurling his body at the oriental his fists pounding the man from special branch the crowd roared its approval its collective voice filling the street and maries arm was free then other sounds joined the melee sirens followed by three racing automobiles among them an ambulance all three swerved in their sudden turns as tyres screeched and the vehicles came to jolting stops marie plunged through the crowd and reached the inner pavement she started running towards the red sign a half block away the slippers had fallen off her feet the swollen shredded blisters burned sending shafts of pain up her legs she could not allow herself to think about pain she had to run run get away then the booming voice surged over and through the noises in the street and she pictured a large man roaring it was the huge chinese they called the major mrs web mrs webb i beg you stop we mean you no harm youll be told everything for gods sake stop told everything thought marie told lies and more lies suddenly people were rushing towards her what were they doing why then they raced past mostly men but not all men and she understood there was a panic in the street perhaps an accident mutilation death lets go see lets watch from a distance mind you opportunities will present themselves recognize them act on them marie suddenly whipped around crouching lunging through the still onrushing crowd to the kerb keeping her body as low as possible and ran back to where she had come so close to recapture she kept turning her head to her left watching hoping she saw him through the racing bodies the huge major ran past in the other direction with him was another man another welldressed man another bureaucrat the crowd was cautious as the ghoulish are always cautious inching forward but not so far as to get involved what they saw was not flattering to the chinese onlookers or to those who held the martial arts of the orient in mystical esteem the lithe strapping australian his language magnificently obscene was pummelling three separate assailants out of his personal boxing ring suddenly to the astonishment of everyone the australian picked up one of his fallen adversaries and let out a roar as loud as the immense majors fer christs syke will you cryzies cut this out yer not punkheads even i can tell that we were both snookered marie ran across the wide street to the entrance of the botanical gardens she stood under a tree by the gate with a direct line of sight to mings parking palace the major had passed the garage pausing at several alleyways that intersected arbuthnot road sending his subordinate down several of them constantly looking around for his support troops they were not to be had marie saw that for herself as the crowd dispersed all three were breathing hard and leaning against the ambulance led there by the australian a taxi drove up to mings no one at first got out then the driver emerged he walked into the open garage and spoke to someone behind a glass booth he bowed in thanks returned to the cab and spoke to his passenger cautiously his fare opened the door and stepped onto the kerb it was catherine she too walked into the wide opening far more rapidly than the driver and spoke into the glass booth shaking her head indicating that she had been told what she did not want to hear suddenly wenzu appeared he was retracing his steps obviously angered by the men who were meant to be tracing his steps he was about to cross the open garage he would see catherine carlos screamed marie assuming the worst knowing it would tell her everything delta the major spun around his eyes wide in shock marie raced into the botanical gardens it was the key cain is for delta and carlos will be killed by cain or whatever the codes were that had been spread through paris they were using david again it wasnt a probability any more it was the reality they it the united states government was sending her husband out to play the role that had nearly killed him killed by his own people what kind of bastards were they or conversely what kind of ends justified the means supposedly sane men would use to reach them now more than ever she had to find david find him before he took risks others should be taking he had given so much and now they asked for more demanded more in the cruellest way possible but to find him she had to reach catherine who was no more than a hundred yards away she had to draw out the enemy and get back across the street without the enemy seeing her jason what can i do she hid behind a cluster of bushes inching farther inside as the major ran through the gardens gates the immense oriental stopped and looked around with his squinting penetrating gaze then turned and shouted for a subordinate who had apparently emerged from an alley on arbuthnot road the second man had difficulty getting across the street the traffic was heavier and slower due to the stationary ambulance and two additional vehicles blocking the normal flow near the entrance to the gardens the major suddenly grew furious as he saw and understood the reasons for the growing traffic get those fools to move the cars he roared and send them over here no send one to the gates on albany road the rest of you come back here hurry the early evening strollers became more numerous men loosened the ties they had worn all day at their offices while women carried highheeled shoes in casual bags supplanting them with sandals wives wheeling baby carriages were joined by husbands lovers embraced and walked arm in arm among the rows of exploding flowers the laughter of racing children peeled across the gardens and the major held his place by the entrance gate marie swallowed the panic in her growing the ambulance and the two cars were being moved the traffic began to flow normally a crash near the ambulance an impatient driver had rammed the car in front of him the major could not help himself the proximity of the accident so close to his official vehicle forced him to move forward obviously to ascertain whether or not his men were involved opportunities will present themselves use them now marie raced around the far end of the bushes then dashed across the grass to join a foursome on the gravel path that led out of the gardens she glanced to her right afraid of what she might see but knowing she had to know her worst thoughts were borne out the huge major had sensed or seen the figure of a woman running behind him he paused for a moment uncertain unsure then broke into a rapid stride towards the gate a horn blew four short quick blasts it was catherine waving at her through the open window of a small japanese car as marie raced into the street get in shouted staples he saw me hurry marie jumped into the front seat as catherine gunned the small car and swerved out of line half on the pavement then swung back with a break in the accelerating traffic she turned into a side street and drove swiftly down it to an intersection where there was a sign with a red arrow pointing right central business district staples turned right catherine shouted marie he saw me worse said staples he saw the car a two door green mitsubishi shouted wenzu into his handheld radio the licence number is aorfive three five zero the zero could be a six but i dont think so it doesnt matter the first three letters will be enough i want it flashed on all points emergency status using the police telephone banks the driver and the passenger are to be taken into custody and there are to be no conversations with either party it is a government house matter and no explanations will be given get on this now staples turned into a parking garage on ice house street the newlylighted bright red sign of the mandarin could be seen barely a block away well rent a car said catherine as she accepted her ticket from the man in the booth i know several headboys at the hotel we park you park the grinning attendant obviously hoped for the former you park replied staples withdrawing several hong kong dollars from her purse lets go she said turning to marie and stay on my right in the shadows close to the buildings how are your feet id rather not say then dont theres no time to do anything about them now bear up old girl catherine stop sounding like c aubrey smith in drag whos that forget it i like old movies lets go marie hobbling the two women walked down the street to a side entrance of the mandarin they climbed the hotel steps and went inside theres a ladies room to the right past the line of shops said catherine i see the sign wait there ill be with you as soon as i can make arrangements is there a drug store here i dont want you walking around therell be descriptions out everywhere i understand that but can you walk around just a bit bad time of the month wo my feet vaseline skin lotion sandals no not sandals rubber thongs perhaps and peroxide ill do what i can but time is everything its been that way for the past year a terrible treadmill will it stop catherine im doing my damnedest to see to it youre a friend and a countryman my dear and im a very angry woman and speaking of such how many women did you encounter in the hallowed halls of the cia or its bumbling counterpart at the state department consular operations marie blinked trying to remember none actually there was a woman in paris theres always is dear go to the ladies room an automobile is a hindrance in hong kong said wenzu looking at the clock on the wall of his office in the headquarters of mi special branch it read therefore we must assume she intends driving webbs wife some distance hiding her and will not risk taxi records our eight oclock deadline has been rescinded the chase now takes its place we must intercept her is there anything we havent considered putting the australian in jail suggested the short welldressed subordinate firmly we suffered casualties in the walled city but his were a public embarrassment we know where hes staying we can pick him up on what charge obstruction to what end the subordinate shrugged angrily satisfaction thats all youve just answered your own question your pride is inconsequential stick to the woman the women youre right of course every garage the car hire agencies here on the island and in kowloon theyve all been contacted by the police correct yes sir but i must point out that the staples woman could easily call upon one of her friends her canadian friends and she would have a car we could not track we operate on what we can control not what we cant besides from what i knew before and what i have subsequently learned about foreign service officer staples i would say shes acting alone certainly not with official sanction she wont involve anyone else for the time being how can you be sure wenzu looked at his subordinate he had to choose his words carefully just a guess your guesses have a reputation for accuracy an inflated judgement common sense is my ally the telephone rang the majors hand shot out yes police central four droned a male voice we appreciate your cooperation central four a mings parking palace responded to our inquiry the mitsubishi aor has a space there leased on a monthly basis the owners name is staples catherine staples a canadian the car was taken out roughly thirtyfive minutes ago youve been most helpful central four said lin thank you he hung up and looked at his anxious subordinate we now have three new pieces of information the first is that the inquiry we sent out through the police was definitely sent out the second is that at least one garage wrote down the information and thirdly mrs staples leases her parking space by the month its a start sir there are three major and perhaps a dozen minor car hire agencies not counting the hotels which weve covered separately those are manageable statistics but of course the garages are not why not questioned the subordinate at most there are perhaps a hundred who wants to build a garage in hong kong when he could house a dozen shops businesses at maximum the police telephone banks have twenty to thirty operators they can call them all its not the numbers old friend its the mentality of the employees for the jobs are not enviable those who can write are too lazy or too hostile to bother and those who cant flee from any association with the police one garage responded a true cantonese it was the owner the owner should be told cried the parking boy in shrill chinese to the booth attendant at the garage on ice house street why i explained it to you i wrote it down for you because you go to school and write somewhat better than i do does not make you bossboss here you cannot write at all you were shitshit afraid you called for me when the man on the telephone said it was a police emergency you illiterates always run from the police that was the car the green mitsubishi i parked on level two if you wont call the police you must call the owner there are things they dont teach you in school boy with small organ they teach us not to go against the police it is bad joss i will call the police or better you may be their hero good after the two women return and i have a short talk with the driver what she thought she was giving me us two dollars but it was eleven one of the bills was a tendollar note she was very nervous very upset she is frightened she did not watch her money you said it was two dollars and now im being honest would i be honest with you if i did not have both our interests in my heart in what way i will tell this rich frightened american she spoke american that you and i have not called back the police on her behalf she will reward us on the spot very very generously for she will understand that she may not retrieve her car without doing so you may watch me from inside the garage by the other telephone after she pays i will send another boy for her car which he will have great trouble finding for i will give him the wrong location and you will call the police the police will arrive we will have done our heavenly duty and had a night of money like few other nights in this miserable job the parking boy squinted shaking his head youre right he said they dont teach such things in school and i suppose i do not have a choice oh but you do said the attendant pulling a long knife from his belt you can say no and i will cut out your talktalk tongue catherine approached the concierges desk in the mandarin lobby annoyed that she did not know either of the two clerks behind the counter she needed a favour quickly and in hong kong that meant dealing with a person one knew then to her relief she spotted the evening shifts number concierge he was in the middle of the lobby trying to mollify an excited guest she moved to the right and waited hoping to catch lee tengs eye she had cultivated teng sending numerous canadians to him when problems of convenience had seemed insurmountable he had always been paid handsomely yes may i be of help mrs said the young chinese clerk moving in front of staples ill wait for mr teng if you please mr teng is very busy mrs a very bad time for mr teng you are a guest of the mandarin mrs im a resident of the territory and an old friend of mr teng where possible i bring my business here so the desk gets the credit ohh the clerk responded to catherines nontourist status he leaned forward speaking confidentially lee teng has terrible joss tonight the lady goes to the grand ball at government house but her clothes go to bangkok she must think mr teng has wings under his jacket and jet engines in his armpits yes an interesting concept the lady just flew in yes mrs but she had many pieces of luggage she did not miss the one she misses now she blames first her husband and now lee teng wheres her husband in the bar he offered to take the next plane to bangkok but his kindness only made his wife angrier he will not leave the bar and he will not get to government house in a way that will make him pleased with himself in the morning bad joss all around perhaps i can be of assistance to you while mr teng does his best to calm everybody i want to rent a car and i need one as fast as you can get it for me aiya said the clerk it is seven oclock at night and the rental offices do little leasing in the evening hours most are closed im sure there are exceptions perhaps a hotel car with a chauffeur only if theres nothing else available as i mentioned im not a guest here and frankly im not made of money who among us asked the clerk enigmatically as the good christian book says somewhere i think sounds right agreed staples please get on the phone and do your best the young man reached beneath the counter and pulled out a plastic bound list of car rental agencies he went to a telephone several feet to his right picked it up and started dialling catherine looked over at lee teng he had steered his irate lady to the wall by a miniature palm in an obvious attempt to keep her from alarming the other guests who sat around the ornate lobby greeting friends and ordering cocktails he was speaking rapidly softly and by god thought staples he was actually getting her attention whatever her legitimate complaints mused catherine the woman was an ass she wore a chinchilla stole in just about the worst climate on earth for such delicate fur not that she foreign service officer staples ever had the problem of such a decision she might have if she had chucked the fso status and stuck with owen staples the son of a bitch owned at least four banks in toronto now not a bad sort really and to add to her sense of guilt owen had never remarried not fair owen she had run across him three years ago after her stint in europe while attending a britishorganized conference in toronto they had had drinks at the mayfair club in the king edward hotel not so unlike the mandarin actually come on owen your looks your money and you had the looks before your money why not there are a thousand beautiful girls within a fiveblock radius whod grab you once was enough cathy you taught me that i dont know but you make me feel oh i dont know somehow so guilty i left you owen but not because i wasnt fond of you fond of me you know what i mean yes i think so owen had laughed you left me for all the right reasons and i accepted your leaving without animus for likeminded reasons if you had waited five minutes longer i think i would have thrown you out id paid the rent that month you bastard not at all neither of us you had your ambitions and i had mine they simply werent compatible but that doesnt explain why you never remarried i just told you you taught me my dear taught you what that all ambitions were incompatible where they existed in our extremes yes you see i learned that i wasnt interested on any permanent basis in anyone who didnt have what i suppose youd call a passionate drive or an overriding ambition but i couldnt live with such a person day in and day out and those without ambition left something wanting in our relationships no permanency there but what about a family children i have two children owen had said quietly of whom im immensely fond i love them very much and their very ambitious mothers have been terribly kind even their subsequent respective husbands have been understanding while they were growing up i saw my children constantly so in a sense i had three families quite civilized if frequently confusing you the paragon of the community the bankers banker the man they said took a shower in a dickens nightshirt a deacon of the church i gave that up when you left at any rate it was simply statecraft on my part you practise it every day owen you never told me you never asked cathy you had your ambitions and i had mine but i will tell you my one regret if you want to hear it i do im genuinely sorry that we never had a child together judging by the two i have he or she would have been quite marvellous you bastard im going to cry please dont lets be honest neither of us has any regrets catherines reverie was suddenly interrupted the clerk lurched back from the telephone his hands triumphantly on the counter you have good joss mrs he cried the dispatcher at the apex agency on bonham strand east was still there and he has cars available but nobody to drive one here ill take a taxi write out the address staples looked around for the hotel drug store there were too many people in the lobby too much confusion where can i buy some skin lotion or vaseline sandals or thongs she asked turning to the clerk there is a newspaper stand down the hallway to the right mrs they have many of the items you describe but may i please have money as you must present a receipt to the dispatcher it is one thousand dollars hong kong whatever remains to be returned or additional monies to be added i dont have that much on me ill have to use a card so much the better catherine opened her purse and pulled out a credit card from an inside pocket ill be right back she said placing it on the counter as she started for the hallway on the right for no reason in particular she glanced over at lee teng and his distraught lady to her brief amusement the overdressed woman in the foolish fur was nodding appreciatively as teng pointed to the line of overpriced shops reached by climbing a staircase above the lobby lee teng was a true diplomat without question he had explained to the overwrought guest that she had an option that would both serve her needs and her nerves and hit her errant husband in his financial solar plexus this was hong kong and she could purchase the best and the most glittering and for a price everything would be ready in time for the grand ball at government house staples continued towards the hallway catherine the name was so sharply spoken staples froze please mrs catherine rigid staples turned it was lee teng who had broken away from his outraged now mollified guest what is it she asked frightened as the middleaged teng approached his face lined with concern sweat evident on his balding skull i saw you only moments ago i had a problem i know all about it so do you catherine i beg your pardon teng glanced at the counter oddly enough not at the young man who had helped her but at the other clerk who was at the opposite end of the desk the man was by himself with no guests in front of him but he was looking at his associate damn bad joss exclaimed teng under his breath what are you talking about asked staples come over here said the number concierge of the night shift as he pulled catherine to the side away from the sight of the counter he reached into his pocket and removed a perforated half page of paper on which there was a computer printout four copies of this were sent down from upstairs i managed to obtain three but the fourth is under the counter emergency government control a canadian woman by the name of mrs catherine staples may attempt to lease an automobile for personal use she is fiftyseven years of age with partially grey hair of medium height and a slender figure delay all proceedings and contact police central four wenzu had drawn a conclusion based on an observation thought catherine along with the knowledge that anyone who willingly drove a car in hong kong was either crazy or had a peculiar reason for doing so he was covering his bases quickly and completely the young man just got me a car over in bonham strand east he obviously hasnt read this he found you a rental at this hour hes writing up the credit charge now do you think hell see this it is not him that i worry about he is in training and i can tell him anything and he will accept what i say the other one not so he wants my job badly wait here stay out of sight teng walked to the counter as the clerk was anxiously looking around the layered credit card slips in his hand lee teng took the charges and put them in his pocket that wont be necessary he said our customer has changed her mind she found a friend in the lobby who will drive her oh then i should tell our associate not to bother as the amount is over the limit he is clearing it for me i am still somewhat unsure and he offered teng waved him shut as he crossed to the second clerk on the telephone at the other end of the counter you may give me the card and forget the call there are too many distressed ladies tonight for me this one has found other means of transportation certainly mr teng said the second clerk obsequiously he handed over the credit card apologized quickly to the operator on the line and hung up the telephone a bad night teng shrugged turning and heading back into the crowded lobbylounge he approached catherine pulling out his billfold as he did so if you are short of money i will cover it dont use this im not short at home or at the bank but i dont carry so much with me its one of the unwritten rules one of the better ones said teng nodding staples took the bills in tengs hand and looked up at the chinese do you want an explanation she asked its not required catherine whatever central four says i know you are a good person and if you are not and you run away and i never see my money again i am still many thousands hong kong to the better i shant run anywhere teng you will not walk either one of the chauffeurs owes me a good turn and hes in the garage now he will drive you to your car in bonham strand come ill take you down there theres someone else with me im taking her out of hong kong shes in the ladies room ill wait in the hallway do hurry sometimes i think the time passes more quickly when we are flooded with problems said the second somewhat older clerk to his younger associateintraining as he removed the halfpage computer printout from beneath the counter and unobtrusively shoved it into his pocket if you are right mr teng has barely experienced fifteen minutes since we came on duty two hours ago hes very good isnt he his lack of head hair helps him people look upon him as having wisdom even when he has no wise words to offer still he has a way with people i wish to be very much like him one day lose some hair said the second clerk in the meantime since there is no one bothering us i have to go to the toilet by the way just in case i ever need to know a rental agency open at this hour it was the apex on bonham strand east wasnt it oh yes that was very diligent of you i simply went by the list it was near the end some of us would have stopped before then you are to be commended you are too kind to an unworthy trainee i want only the best for you said the older clerk always remember that the older man left the counter he cautiously went past the potted palms until he saw lee teng the night concierge was standing at the foot of the hallway to the right it was enough he was waiting for the woman the clerk turned quickly and walked up the staircase to the line of shops with less dignity than was proper he was in a hurry and entered the first boutique at the top of the steps hotel business he said to the bored saleswoman as he grabbed the phone off the wall behind a glass counter of glistening precious stones he dialled police central four your directive sir regarding the canadian woman mrs staples do you have information i believe so sir but it is somewhat embarrassing for me to relay it why is that this is an emergency a government matter please understand officer i am only a minor employee and it is quite possible the night concierge did not recall your directive he is a very busy man what are you trying to say well officer sir the woman i overheard asking for the concierge bore a striking resemblance to the description in the government directive but it would be most embarrassing for me if it was learned that i called you you will be protected you may remain anonymous what is the information well sir i overheard with cautious ambivalent words the st assistant clerk did his best for himself and consequently the worst for his superior lee teng his final statements however were concise and without equivocation it is the apex car rental agency in bonham strand east i suggest you hurry as she is on her way there now the early evening traffic was less dense than the rush hour but still formidable it was the reason why catherine and marie looked uneasily at each other in the back seat of the mandarins limousine as the chauffeur rather than accelerating into the sudden wide space in front of him swung the enormous automobile into an empty section of the kerb in bonham strand east there was no sign of a rental agency on either side of the street why are we stopping asked staples sharply mr tengs instructions mrs answered the chauffeur turning around in the seat i will lock the car with the alarm on no one will bother you as the lights flash beneath all four door handles thats very comforting but id like to know why youre not taking us to the car i will bring the car to you mrs i beg your pardon mr tengs instructions he was very firm and he is making the proper phone call to the apex garage it is in the next block mrs i shall be back presently the chauffeur removed his hat and his jacket placed both on the seat switched on the alarm and climbed out what do you make of it asked marie raising her leg over her knee and holding tissues she had taken from the ladies room against the flat of her right foot do you trust this teng yes i do replied catherine her expression bewildered i cant understand it hes obviously being extra cautious but there are extra risks for himself and i dont know why as i told you back at the mandarin that computerized missive about me said government control those two words are not taken lightly in hong kong what in the world is he doing and why obviously i cant answer you said marie but i can make an observation what is it i saw the way he looked at you im not sure you did what id say hes very fond of you fond of me its one way to put it there are stronger ways of course staples turned away and looked out the window oh my god she whispered whats the matter a little while ago back at the mandarin and for reasons too unreasonable to analyse it started with a foolish woman in a chinchilla stole i thought about owen owen my former husband owen staples the banker owen staples thats my name and thats my boy was my boy in those days one stayed with the acquired name you never told me your husband was owen staples you never asked me my dear youre not making sense catherine i suppose not agreed staples shaking her head but i was thinking about the time owen and i met a couple of years ago in toronto we had drinks at the mayfair club and i learned things about him i never would have believed before i was genuinely happy for him despite the fact that the bastard nearly made me cry catherine for heavens sake whats that got to do with right now its got to do with teng we also had drinks one evening not at the mandarin of course but at a cafe on the waterfront in kowloon he said it wouldnt be good joss for me to be seen with him here on the island why not thats what i said you see he was protecting me then just as hes protecting me now and i may have misunderstood him i assumed he was simply looking after an additional source of income but i may have been terribly wrong in what way he said a strange thing that night he said he wished things were different that the differences between people were not so obvious and those differences not so disturbing to other people of course i accepted his banalities as a rather amateurish attempt at at statecraft as my former husband phrased it perhaps it was something else marie laughed quietly as their eyes locked dear dear catherine the mans in love with you christ in calgary i dont need this wenzu sat in the front seat of mi vehicle two his patient gaze on the entrance of the apex agency on bonham strand east everything was in order both women would be in his custody within a matter of minutes one of his men had gone inside and spoken to the dispatcher the agent had proffered his government identification and was shown the evenings records by the frightened employee the dispatcher indeed had a reservation for a mrs catherine staples but it had been cancelled the car in question assigned to another name the name of a chauffeur from the hotel and since mrs catherine staples was no longer leasing a car the dispatcher saw no reason to call police control four what was there to say and no certainly not no one else could pick up the car as it was reserved by the mandarin everything was in order thought wenzu victoria peak would feel an enormous sweep of relief the moment he reached the sterile house with his news the major knew the exact words he would say the women are taken the woman is taken across the street a man in shirtsleeves entered the agency door he appeared hesitant to lin and there was something a taxi suddenly drove up and the major bolted forward reaching for the door handle the hesitant man was forgotten be alert lads said lin into the microphone attached to the dashboard radio we must be as quick and as unobtrusive as possible no arbuthnot road can be tolerated here and no weapons of course ready now but there was nothing to be ready for the taxi drove away without disgorging anyone vehicle three said the major curtly get that license number and call the cab company i want them in radio contact find out exactly what their taxi was doing here better yet follow it and do as i tell you it could be the women i believe there was only a man in the back seat sir said the driver they could have ducked below the seat damned eyes a man you say yes sir i smell a rotten squid why major if i knew the stench would not be so strong the waiting continued and the immense lin began to perspire the dying sun cast both a blinding orange light through the windshield and pockets of dark shadows along bonham strand east its too long whispered the major to himself static erupted from the radio we have the report from the cab company sir go on the taxi in question is trying to find an import house on bonham strand east but the driver told his fare that the address must be on bonham strand west apparently his passenger is very angry he got out and threw money into the window only moments ago break away and return here ordered lin as he watched the garage doors opening across the street at the apex agency a car emerged turning left driven by the shirtsleeved man the sweat now rolled down the majors face something was not in order another order was being superimposed what was it that bothered him what was it him shouted lin to his startled driver sir a wrinkled white shirt but trousers creased like steel a uniform a chauffeur swing around follow him the driver held his hand on the horn breaking the line of traffic as he made a uturn while the major issued instructions to the backups ordering one to stay at the apex agency the others to take up the new chase aiya screamed the driver jamming on his brakes screeching to a stop as a huge brown limousine roared out of a side street blocking their way only the slightest contact had been made the government car barely touching the left rear door of the large automobile feng zi yelled the limousines chauffeur calling lins driver a crazy dog as he jumped out of his sedan to see if any damage had been done la lair shrieked the majors driver leaping out ready for combat stop it roared wenzu just get him out of here it is he who does not move sir tell him he must do so show him your identification all traffic came to a stop horns blared people in cars and in the streets yelled angrily the major closed his eyes and shook his head in frustration there was nothing he could do but get out of the car as another did from the limousine a middleaged chinese with a balding head i gather we have a problem said lee teng i know you

position warrants it my position warrants it i repeat why have you stopped us i believe it was your man who sped across the changing light not sol screamed wenzus driver then it is a matter for the courts said lee teng may we proceed not yet replied the major approaching the mandarins night concierge i repeat again a government directive was received at your hotel it stated clearly that a woman named staples might try to lease a car and you were to report the attempt to police central four then i repeat sir i have not been near my desk for well over an hour nor have i seen any such directive

bring her in to me she will claim harassment we will be breaking the laws of international diplomacy then break them just get her here in cleopatras carpet if you have to i havent any time to waste not a minute held firmly in check by two agents a furious catherine staples was led into the room in the house on victoria peak wenzu had opened the door he now closed it as staples faced ambassador raymond havilland and undersecretary of state edward mcallister it was in the morning the sun streaming through the large bay window overlooking the garden youve gone too far havilland said catherine her throaty voice icelike in its flat delivery i havent gone far enough where youre concerned mrs staples you actively compromised a member of the american legation you engaged in extortion to the grave disservice of my government you cant prove that because theres no evidence no photographs i dont have to prove it at precisely seven oclock last night the young man drove up here and told us everything a sordid little chapter isnt it damn fool hes blameless but youre not and since you bring up the word sordid theres nothing hes done that could match the filth of your own actions without missing a verbal beat catherine looked at the undersecretary of state i presume this is the liar called mcallister youre very trying said the undersecretary and youre an unprincipled lackey who does another mans dirty work i heard it all and its all disgusting but every thread was woven staples snapped her head towards havilland by an expert who gave you the right to play god any of you do you know what youve done to those two people out there do you know what youve asked of them we know said the ambassador simply i know she knows too in spite of the fact that i didnt have the heart to give her the final confirmation you mcallister when i learned it was you up here i wasnt sure she could handle it not at the moment but i intend to tell her you and your lies a taipans wife murdered in macao oh the symmetry of it all what an excuse to take another mans wife lies i have my sources and it never happened well get this straight im bringing her in to the consulate under the full protection of my government and if i were you havilland id be damned careful about throwing around alleged illegalities you and your goddamned people have lied to and manipulated a canadian citizen into a lifethreatening operation whatever the hell it is this time your arrogance is simply beyond belief i but i assure you its coming to a stop whether my government likes it or not im going to expose you all of you youre no better than the barbarians in the kgb well the american juggernaut of covert operations is going to be handed a bloody setback im sick of you the world is sick of you my dear woman shoutedthe ambassador losing the last vestiges of control in his sudden anger make all the threats you like but you will hear me out and if after youve heard what i have to say you wish to declare war you go right ahead as the song says my days are dwindling down but not millions of others id like to do what i can to prolong those other lives but you may disagree so declare your war dear lady and by christ you live with the consequences leaning forward in the chair bourne snapped the trigger housing out of its recess and checked the weapons bore under the light of the floorlamp above him it was a repetitive pointless exercise the bore was spotless during the past four hours he had cleaned danjous gun three times dismantling it three times and each time oiling each mechanism until each part of the dark metal glistened the process occupied his time he had studied danjous arsenal of weapons and explosives but since most of the equipment was in sealed boxes conceivably tripped against theft he let them be and concentrated on the single gun there was only so much pacing one could do in the frenchmans flat on the rua das lorchas overlooking macaos porto interiore or inner harbour and they had agreed he was not to go outside in daylight inside he was as safe as he could be anywhere in macao danjou who changed residences at will and whim had rented the waterfront apartment less than two weeks before using a false name and a lawyer he had never met who in turn employed arentor to sign the lease which the attorney sent by messenger to his unknown client by way of the checkroom at the crowded floating casino such were the ways of philippe danjou formerly echo of medusa jason reassembled the weapon depressed the shells in the magazine and cracked it up through the handle he got out of the chair and walked to the window the gun in his hand across the expanse of water was the peoples republic so accessible for anyone who knew the procedures arising from simple human greed there was nothing new under the sun since the time of the pharaohs where borders were concerned they were erected to be crossed one way or another he looked at his watch it was close to five oclock the afternoon sun was descending danjou had called him from hong kong at noon the frenchman had gone to the peninsula with bournes room key packed his suitcase without checking out and was taking the one oclock jetfoil back to macao where was he the trip took barely an hour and from the macao pier to the rua das lorchas was no more than ten minutes by cab but then predictability was not echos strong suit fragments of the medusa memories came back to jason triggered by the presence of danjou although painful and frightening certain impressions provided a certain comfort again thanks to the frenchman not only was danjou a consummate liar when it counted most and an opportunist of the first rank but he was extraordinarily resourceful above all the frenchman was a pragmatist he had proved that in paris and those memories were clear if he was delayed there was a good reason if he did not appear he was dead and this last was unacceptable to bourne danjou was in a position to do something jason wanted above all to do himself but dared not risk maries life in doing it it was risk enough that the trail of the impostor assassin had brought him to macao in the first place but as long as he stayed away from the lisboa hotel he trusted his instincts he would remain hidden from those looking for him looking for someone who even vaguely resembled him in height or build or colouring someone asking questions in the lisboa hotel one call from the lisboa to the taipan in hong kong and marie was dead the taipan had not merely threatened threats were too often a meaningless ploy he had used a far more lethal expedient after shouting and crashing his large hand on the arm of the fragile chair he had quietly given his word marie would die it was a promise made by a man who kept his promises kept his word yet for all that david webb sensed something he could not define there was about the huge taipan something a bit larger than life too operatic that had nothing to do with his size it was as if he had used his immense girth to advantage in a way that large men rarely do preferring to let only their sheer size do the impressing who was the taipan the answer was at the lisboa hotel and since he dared not go there himself danjous skills could serve him he had told the frenchman very little he would tell him more now he would describe a brutal double killing the weapon an uzi and say that one of the victims was a powerful taipans wife danjou would ask the questions he could not ask and if there were answers he would take another step towards marie play the scenario alexander conklin whose scenario david webb youre wasting time jason bourne find the impostor take him quiet footsteps in the outside hallway jason spun away from the window and raced silently to the wall pressing his back against it the gun levelled at the door where the swinging panel would conceal him a key was cautiously quietly inserted the door swung slowly open bourne crashed it back into the intruder spinning around and grabbing the stunned figure in the frame he yanked him inside and kicked the door shut the weapon aimed at the head of the fallen man who had dropped a suitcase and a very large package it was danjou thats one way to get your head blown off echo sacre bleu it is also the last time i will ever be considerate of you you dont see yourself delta you look as you did in tarn quan without sleep for days i thought you might be resting another memory briefly flashed in tarn quan said jason you told me i had to sleep didnt you we hid in the brush and you formed a circle around me and damn near gave me an order to get some rest it was purely a selfenlightened request we couldnt get ourselves out of there only you could you said something to me then what was it i listened i explained that rest was as much a weapon as any blunt instrument or firing mechanism man had ever devised i used a variation later it became an axiom for me im so glad you had the intelligence to listen to your elders may i please rise will you please lower that damned gun oh sorry we have no time said danjou getting up and leaving the suitcase on the floor he tore the brown paper off his package inside were pressed khaki clothes two belted holsters and two visored hats he threw them all on a chair these are uniforms i have the proper identifications in my pocket i am afraid i outrank you delta but then age has its privileges theyre uniforms of the hong kong police kowloon to be precise we may have our chance delta its why i was so long getting back kai tak airport the security is enormous just what the impostor wants in order to show hes better than you ever were theres no guarantee of course but id stake my life on it its the classic challenge for an obsessed maniac mount your forces ill break through them with one kill like that he reestablishes the legend of his utter invincibility its him im sure of it start from the beginning ordered bourne as we dress yes agreed the frenchman removing his shirt and unbuckling his trousers hurry i have a motor launch across the road four hundred horsepower we can be in kowloon in fortyfive minutes here this is yours man dieu the money ive spent makes me want to vomit the prc patrols said jason peeling off his clothes and reaching for the uniform theyll shoot us out of the water idiot certain known boats are negotiated with by radio in code there is after all honour among us how do you think we run our merchandise how do you think we survive we meet in coves at the chinese islands of teh sa wei and payments are made hurry what about the airport why are you so sure its him the crown governor assassination what shouted bourne stunned i walked from the peninsula to the star ferry with your suitcase its only a short distance and the ferry is far quicker than a taxi through the tunnel as i passed the kowloon police hill on salisbury road i saw seven patrol cars drive out at emergency speed one behind the other all turning left which is not to the godown it struck me as odd yes two or three for a local eruption but seven it was good joss as these people say i called my contact on the hill and he was cooperative it was also not much of an internal secret any longer he said if i stayed around id see another ten cars twenty vans all heading out to kai tak within the next two hours those i saw were the advance search teams they had received word through their underground sources that an attempt was to be made on the governors life specifics commanded bourne harshly buckling his trousers and reaching for the long khaki shirt that served as a jacket under the bulletladen holster belt the governor is flying in from beijing tonight with his own entourage from the foreign office as well as another chinese negotiating delegation there will be newspaper people television crews everyone both governments want full coverage there is to be a joint meeting tomorrow between all the negotiators and leaders of the financial sector the ninetyseven treaty yet another round in the endless verbosity about the accords but for all our sakes just pray they keep talking pleasantly the scenario said jason softly stopping all movement what scenario the one you yourself brought up the scenario that had the wires burning between peking and government house kill a governor for the murder of a vicepremier then perhaps a foreign secretary for a ranking member of the central committee a prime minister for a chairman how far does it go how many selected killings before the breaking point is reached how long before the parent refuses to tolerate a disobedient child and marches into hong kong christ it could happen someone wants it to happen danjou stood motionless holding the wide belt of the holster with its ominous strand of brasscapped shells what i suggested was no more than speculation based on the random violence caused by an obsessed killer who accepts his contracts without discrimination theres enough greed and political corruption on both sides to justify that speculation but what youre suggesting delta is quite different youre saying its a plan an organized plan to disrupt hong kong to the point that the mainland takes over the scenario repeated jason bourne the more complicated it gets the simpler it appears the rooftops of kai tak airport were swarming with police as were the gates and the tunnels the immigration counters and the luggage areas outside on the immense field of black tarmac powerful floodlights were joined by roving sharper searchlights probing every moving vehicle every inch of visible ground television crews uncoiled cables under watching eyes while interviewers standing behind sound trucks practised pronunciation in a dozen languages reporters and photographers were kept beyond the gates as airport personnel shouted through the amplifiers that ropedoff sections on the field would soon be available for all legitimate journalists with proper passes issued by the kai tak management it was madness and then the totally unexpected happened as a sudden rainstorm swept over the colony from the darkness of the western horizon it was yet another autumn deluge the impostor has good luck good joss as they say doesnt he said danjou as he and bourne in their uniforms marched with a phalanx of police through a covered walkway made of corrugated tin to one of the huge repair hangars the hammering of the rain was deafening luck had nothing to do with it replied jason he studied the weather reports from as far away as szechwan every airport has them he spotted it yesterday if not two days ago weathers a weapon too echo still he could not dictate the arrival of the crown governor on a chinese aircraft they are often hours late usually hours late but not days not usually when did the kowloon police get word of the attempt i asked specifically said the frenchman around eleventhirty this morning and the plane from peking was scheduled to arrive sometime this evening yes i told you that the newspaper and the television people were ordered to be here by nine oclock he studied the weather reports opportunities present themselves you grab them and this is what you must do delta think like him be him it is our chance what do you think im doing when we get to the hangar i want to break away can your ersatz identification make it possible i am a british sector commander from the mongkok divisional police what does that mean i really dont know but it was the best i could do you dont sound british who would know that out here at kai tak old chap the british ill avoid them my chinese is better than yours the zhongguo ren will respect it youll be free to roam i have to said jason bourne if its your commando i want him before anyone else spots him here now roped stanchions were moved out of the highdomed hangar by maintenance personnel in glossy yellow rain slickers then a truckload of the yellow coats arrived for the police contingents men caught them as they were thrown out of the rear of the van putting them on the police then formed several groups to receive instructions from their superiors order was rapidly emerging from the confusion compounded by the newly arrived bewildered troops and the problems caused by the sudden downpour it was the sort of order bourne distrusted it was too smooth too conventional for the job they faced ranks of brightly dressed soldiers marching forward were in the wrong place with the wrong tactics when seeking out guerrillas even one man trained in guerrilla warfare each policeman in his yellow slicker was both a warning and a target and he was also something else a pawn each could be replaced by another dressed the same way by a killer who knew how to assume the look of his enemy yet the strategy of infiltration for the purpose of a kill was suicidal and jason knew there was no such commitment on the part of his impostor unless unless the weapon to be used had a sound level so low the rain would eliminate it but even then the targets reaction could not be instantaneous a cordon would immediately be erected around the killing ground at the first sign of the governors collapse every exit blocked everyone in the vicinity ordered under guns to remain in place a delayed reaction a tiny air dart whose impact was no greater than a pinprick a minor annoyance to be swatted away like a bothersome fly as the lethal drop of poison entered the bloodstream to cause death slowly but inevitably time not a consideration it was a possibility but again there were too many obstacles to surmount too much accuracy demanded beyond the limits of an aircompressed weapon the governor would undoubtedly be wearing a protective vest and targeting the face was out facial nerves exaggerated pain and any foreign object making contact so close to the eyes produced an immediate and dramatic reaction that left the hands and the throat the first were too small and conceivably could be moving too fast the second was simply too limited an area a highpowered rifle on a rooftop a rifle of unquestioned accuracy with an infrared telescopic sight another possibility an all too familiar yellow slicker replaced by one worn by an assassin but again it was suicidal for such a weapon would produce an isolated explosion and to mount a silencer would reduce the accuracy of the rifle to the point where it could not be trusted the odds were against a killer on a rooftop the kill would be too obvious and the kill was everything bourne understood that especially under the circumstances danjou was right all the factors were in place for a spectacular assassination carlos the jackal could not ask for more nor could jason bourne reflected david webb to pull it off in spite of the extraordinary security would crown the new bourne king of his sickening profession then how which option would he use and after the decision was made what avenue of escape was most effective most possible one of the television trucks with its complicated equipment was too obvious a target for an escape the incoming aircrafts maintenance crews were checked and double and triple checked an outsider would be spotted instantly all the journalists would pass through electronic gates which picked up anything in excess of ten milligrams of metal and the rooftops were out how then youre cleared said danjou suddenly appearing at his side holding a piece of paper in his hand this is signed by the prefect of the kai tak police what did you tell him that you were a jew trained by the mossad in antiterrorist activities and posted to us in an exchange programme the word will be spread good god i dont speak hebrew who here does shrug and continue in your tolerable french which is spoken here but very badly youll get away with it youre impossible you know that dont you i know that delta when he was our leader in medusa told command saigon that he would not go out in the field without old echo i must have been out of my mind you were less in command of it then ill grant you that thanks a lot echo wish me luck you dont need luck said the frenchman you are delta you will always be delta removing the bright yellow rain slicker and the visored hat bourne walked outside and showed his clearance to the guards by the hangar doors in the distance the press was being herded through the electronic gates towards the roped stanchions microphones had been placed on the edge of the runway while police vans were joined by motorcycle patrols forming a tight semicircle around the press conference area the preparations were almost complete all the security forces in place the media equipment in working order the plane from peking had obviously begun its descent in the downpour it would land in a matter of minutes minutes jason wished could be extended there were so many things to look for and so little time to search where what everything was both possible and impossible which option would the killer use what vantage point would he zero in on for the perfect kill and how would he most logically escape from the killing ground alive bourne had considered every option he could think of and ruled each out think again and again only minutes left walk around and start at the beginning the beginning the premise the assassination of the governor conditions seemingly airtight with security police training guns from rooftops blocking every entrance every exit every staircase and escalator all in radio contact the odds were overwhelmingly against suicide yet it was these same heavily negative odds that the impostorkiller found irresistible danjou had been right again with one spectacular kill under these conditions an assassins supremacy would be established or reestablished what had the frenchman said with one kill like that he reestablishes the legend to its full invincibility who where how think look the downpour drenched his kowloon police uniform he continuously wiped the water from his face as he moved about peering at everyone and everything nothing and then the muted roar of the jet engines could be heard in the distance the jet from peking was making its final approach at the far end of the runway it was landing jason studied the crowd standing inside the roped stanchions an accommodating hong kong government in deference to peking and in the desire for full coverage had supplied ponchos and squares of canvas and cheap pocket raincoats for all who wanted them the kai tak personnel countered the medias demands for an inside conference by stating simply and wisely without explanation that it was not in the interests of security the statements would be short an aggregate of no more than five or six minutes certainly the fine members of the journalistic establishment could tolerate a little rain for such an important event the photographers metal cameras were passed through the gates but not all cameras took pictures a relatively simple device could be inserted and locked into a mount a powerful firing mechanism that released a bullet or a dart with the assistance of a telescopic viewfinder was that the way had the assassin taken that option expecting to smash the camera under his feet and take another from his pocket as he moved swiftly to the outskirts of the crowd his credentials as authentic as danjous and the antiterrorist from the mossad it was possible the huge jet dropped onto the runway and bourne walked quickly into the ropedoff area approaching every photographer he could see looking looking for a man who looked like himself there must have been two dozen men with cameras he became frantic as the plane from peking taxied towards the crowd the flood and searchlights now centred on the space around the microphones and the television crews he went from one photographer to the next rapidly ascertaining that the man could not be the killer then looking again to see if postures were erect faces cosmeticized again nothing no one he had to find him take him before anyone else found him the assassination was beside the point it was irrelevant to him nothing mattered except marie go back to the beginning target the governor conditions highly negative for a kill the target under maximum security undoubtedly protected by personal armour the whole security corps orderly disciplined the officers in tight command the beginning something was missing go over it again the governor the target a single kill method of the kill suicide ruled out everything but a delayedreaction device an air dart a pellet yet the demands of accuracy made such a weapon illogical and the loud report of a conventional gun would instantly activate the entire security force delay delayed action not reaction the beginning the first assumption was wrong the target was not just the governor not a single kill but multiple killings indiscriminate killings how much more spectacular how much more effective for a maniac who wanted to throw hong kong into chaos and the chaos would begin instantly with the security forces disorder escape bournes mind was racing as he roamed through the crowd in the downpour his eyes darting everywhere he tried to recall every weapon he had ever known a weapon that could be fired or released silently unobtrusively from a restricted densely populated area its effect delayed long enough for the killer to reposition himself and make a clean escape the only device that came to mind were grenades but he immediately dismissed them then the thought of timefused dynamite or plastique struck him these last were far more manageable in terms of delays and concealment the plastic explosives could be set in time spans of minutes and fractions of minutes rather than a few seconds only they could be hidden in small boxes or in wrapped packages even narrow briefcases or thicker cases supposedly filled with photographic equipment not necessarily carried by a photographer he started again going back into the crowd of reporters and photographers his eyes scanning the black tarmac below trousers and skirts looking for an isolated container that remained stationary on the hard asphalt logic made him concentrate on the rows of men and women nearest the ropedoff runway in his mind the package would be no more than twelve inches in length if it was thick twenty if it was an attaché case a smaller charge would not kill the negotiators of both governments the airfield lights were strong but they created myriad shadows darker pockets within the darkness he wished he had had the sense to carry a flashlight he had always carried one if only a penlight for it too was a weapon why had he forgotten then to his astonishment he saw flashlight beams crisscrossing the black floor of the airfield darting between the same trousers and skirts he had been peering beyond the security police had arrived at the same theory and why shouldnt they la guardia airport lod airport tel aviv rue de bac paris harrods london and half a dozen embassies from teheran to beirut why shouldnt they they were current he was not his thinking was slow and he could not allow that what where the enormous starship of the peoples republic came into view like a great silver bird its jet engines roaring through the deluge whirring down as it was manoeuvred into position on alien ground the doors opened and the english and chinese guards rushed down the steps and into position then the parade began the two leaders of the british and the chinese delegations emerged together they waved and walked in unison down the metal staircase one in the tailored clothes of whitehall the other in the drab rankless uniform of the peoples army they were followed by two lines of aides and adjutants occidentals and orientals doing their best to appear congenial with one another for the cameras the leaders approached the microphones and as the voices droned over the loudspeakers and through the rain the next minutes were a blur for jason a part of his mind was on the ceremony that was taking place under the floodlights the larger part on the final search for it would be final if the impostor was there he had to find him before the kill before the chaos but goddamn it where bourne moved out beyond the ropes on the far right to get a better view of the proceedings a guard objected jason showed the man his clearance and remained motionless studying the television crews their looks their eyes their equipment if the assassin was among them which one was he we are jointly pleased to announce that further progress has been made with regard to the accords we of the united kingdom we of the peoples republic of china the only true china on the face of the earth express a desire to find a mutual communion with those who wish the speeches were interspersed each leader giving support to his counterpart yet letting the world know there was still much to negotiate there was tension beneath the civility the verbal placebos and the plastic smiles and jason found nothing he could focus on nothing so he wiped the rain from his face and nodded to the guard as he ducked under the rope and moved once again back through the crowd behind the stanchions he threaded his way to the left side of the press conference suddenly bournes eyes were drawn to a series of headlights in the downpour that curved into the runway at the far end of the field and rapidly accelerated towards the stationary aircraft then as if on cue there was a swelling of applause the brief ceremony was over signified by the arrival of the official limousines each with a motorcycle escort driving up between the delegations and the ropedoff crowd of journalists and photographers police surrounded the television trucks ordering all but two preselected cameramen to get inside their vehicles it was the moment if anything was going to happen it would happen now if an instrument of death was about to be placed its charge to be exploded within the timespan of a minute or less it would have to be placed now several feet to his left he saw an officer of a police contingent a tall man whose eyes were moving as rapidly as his own jason leaned towards the man and spoke in chinese while holding out his clearance shielding it from the rain with his hand im the man from the mossad he yelled trying to be heard through the applause yes i know about you shouted the officer i was told were grateful youre here do you have a flashlight a torch yes of course do you want it very much here clear me ordered bourne lifting the rope gesturing for the officer to follow i havent time to show papers certainly the chinese followed reaching out and intercepting a guard who was about to stop jason by shooting him if necessary let him be hes one of us hes trained in this sort of thing the jew from the mossad it is he we were told thank you sir but of course he cant understand me oddly enough he does he speaks guangzhou hua in food street there is what they call a kosur restaurant that serves our dishes bourne was now between the row of limousines and the roped stanchions as he walked down the line his flashlight directed below on the black tarmac he gave orders in chinese and english shouting yet not shouting the commands of a reasonable man looking perhaps for a lost object one by one the men and women of the press moved back explaining to those behind them he approached the leading limousine the flags of great britain and the peoples republic were displayed respectively on the right and left indicating that england was the host china the guest the representatives rode together jason concentrated on the ground the exalted passengers were about to enter the elongated vehicle with their most trusted aides amid sustained applause it happened but bourne was not sure what it was his left shoulder touched another shoulder and the contact was electric the man he had grazed first lurched forward and then had swung back with such ferocity that jason was shoved offbalance he turned and looked at the man on the police escort motorcycle then raised his flashlight to see through the dark plastic oval of the helmet lightning struck sharp jagged bolts crashing into his skull his eyes riveted as he tried to adjust to the incredible he was staring at himself from only years ago the dark features beyond the opaque bubble were his it was the commando the impostor the assassin the eyes that stared back at him also showed panic but they were quicker than webbs a flattened rigid hand lashed out crashing into jasons throat cutting off all speech and thought bourne fell back unable to scream grabbing his neck as the assassin lurched off his motorcycle he rushed past jason and ducked under the rope get him take him marie the words were absent only hysterical thoughts screaming silently through bournes mind he retched exploding the chop in his throat and leaped over the rope plunging into the crowd following the path of fallenaway bodies that had been pummelled by the killer in his race to escape stop him only the last word emerged from jasons throat it was a hoarse whisper let me through two words were formed but no one was listening from somewhere near the terminal a band was playing in the downpour the path was closed there were only people people people find him take him marie hes gone hes disappeared let me through he screamed the words now clear but heeded by no one he yanked and pulled and bucked his way to the edge of the crowd another crowd facing him behind the glass doors of the terminal nothing no one the killer was gone killer the kill it was the limousine the lead limousine with the flags of both countries that was the target somewhere in that car or beneath that car was the timed mechanism that would blow it to the skies killing the leaders of both delegations result the scenario chaos takeover bourne spun around frantically looking for someone in authority twenty yards beyond the rope standing at attention as the british anthem was being played was an officer of the kowloon police clipped to his belt was a radio a chance the limousines had started their stately procession towards an unseen gate in the airfield jason yanked the rope pulling it up toppling a stanchion and started running towards the short erect chinese officer xun su he roared shemma replied the startled man instinctively reaching for his bolstered gun stop them the cars the limousines the one in front what are you talking about who are you bourne nearly struck the man in frustration mossad he screamed you are the one from israel ive heard listen to me get on that radio and tell them to stop get everyone out of that car its going to blow now through the rain the officer looked up into jasons eyes then nodded once and pulled the radio from his belt this is an emergency clear the channel and patch me to red star one immediately all the cars interrupted bourne tell them to peel away change cried the police officer alert all vehicles put me through and with his voice tense but controlled the chinese spoke clearly emphasizing each word this is colony five and we have an emergency with me is the man from the mossad and i relay his instructions they are to be complied with at once red star one is to stop instantly and order everyone out of the vehicle instructing them to run for cover all other cars are to turn to the left towards the centre of the field away from red star one execute immediately stunned the crowds watched as in the distance the engines roared in unison five limousines swung out of position racing into the outer darkness of the airport the first car screeched to a stop the doors opened and men leaped out running in all directions eight seconds later it happened the limousine called red star one exploded forty feet from an open gate flaming metal and shattered glass spiralled up into the downpour as the band music halted in midbreath peking pm above the northern suburbs of peking is a vast compound rarely spoken of and certainly not for public inspection the major reason is security but there is also an element of embarrassment in this egalitarian society for inside this sprawling forested enclave in the hills are the villas of chinas most powerful figures the compound is enclosed by a high wall of grey stone the entrances to the complex guarded by seasoned army veterans the dense woods within continuously patrolled by attack dogs and if one were to speculate on the social or political relationships cultivated there it should be noted that no villa can be seen from another for each structure is surrounded by its own inner wall and all personal guards are personally selected from years of obedience and trust the name when it is spoken is jade tower mountain which refers not to a geological mountain but to an immense hill that rises above the others at one time or another with the ebb and flow of political fortunes such men as mao zedong lin shaoqi lin biao and zhou enlai resided here among the residents now was a man shaping the economic destiny of the peoples republic the world press referred to him simply as sheng and the name was immediately recognizable his full name was sheng chou yang a brown sedan sped down the road fronting the imposing grey wall it approached gate number six and as though preoccupied the driver suddenly applied the brakes and the car sideslipped into the entrance stopping inches from the bright orange barrier that reflected the beams of the headlights a guard approached who is it you come to see and what is your name i will need your official identification minister sheng said the driver and my name is not important nor are my papers required please inform the ministers residence that his emissary from kowloon is here the soldier shrugged such replies were standard at jade tower mountain and to press further might result in a transfer from this heavenly duty where the leftover food was beyond ones imagination and even foreign beer was given for obedient and cooperative service still the guard used the telephone the visitor had to be admitted properly to do otherwise could bring one to kneel in a field and be shot in the back of the head the guard returned to the gatehouse and dialled the villa of sheng chou yang admit him quickly without going back to the sedan the guard pressed a button and the orange bar was raised the car raced in far too quickly over the gravel thought the guard the emissary was in a great hurry minister sheng is in the garden said the army officer at the door looking beyond the visitor his eyes darting about peering into the darkness go to him the emissary rushed through the front room filled with red lacquered furniture to an archway beyond which was a walled garden complete with four connecting lily ponds subtly lit with yellow lights beneath the water two intersecting paths of white gravel formed an x between the ponds and low black wicker chairs and tables were placed at the far end of each path within an oval setting seated alone at the end of the eastern leg by the brick wall was a slender man of medium height with closecropped prematurely grey hair and gaunt features if there was anything about him that might startle someone meeting him for the first time it was his eyes for they were the dark eyes of a dead man the lids never blinking even for an instant contrarily they were also the eyes of a zealot whose blind dedication was the core of his strength white heat was in the pupils lightning in the orbs these were the eyes of sheng chou yang and at the moment they were on fire w me he roared both hands gripping the black arms of the wicker chair who does this its all a lie minister we have checked with our people in tel aviv there is no such man as was described there is no agent from the mossad in kowloon what action did you take it is most confusing what action we are tracing an englishman in the mongkok whom no one seems to know about fools and idiots idiots and fools whom have you spoken with our key man in the kowloon police he is bewildered and im sorry to say i think he is frightened he made several references to macao and i did not like his voice he is dead i will transmit your instructions im afraid you cannot shang gestured with his left hand his right in shadows reaching beneath the low table come pay your obedience to the kuomintang he commanded the emissary approached the minister he bowed low and reached for the great mans left hand sheng lifted his right hand in it was a gun an explosion followed blowing the emissarys head away fragments of skull and tissue seared into the lily ponds the army officer appeared in the archway as the corpse sprang back under the impact into the white gravel dispose of him ordered sheng he heard too much learned too much presumed too much certainly minister and reach the man in macao i have instructions for him and they are to be implemented immediately while the fires in kowloon still light up the sky i want him here as the officer approached the dead courier sheng suddenly rose from the chair then walked slowly to the edge of the nearest pond his face illuminated by the lights beneath the water he spoke once againhis voice flat but filled with purpose soon all of hong kong and the territories he said staring at a lily pad soon thereafter all of china you lead minister said the officer watching sheng his eyes glowing with devotion we follow the march you promised has begun we return to our mother and the land will be ours again yes it will agreed sheng chou yang we cannot be denied i cannot be denied by noon of that paralysing day when kai tak was merely an airport and not an assassination field ambassador havilland had described to a stunned catherine staples the broad outlines of the sheng conspiracy with its roots in the kuomintang objective a consortium of taipans with a central leader whose son sheng was taking over hong kong and turning the colony into the conspirators own financial empire inevitable result the conspiracy would fail and the raging giant that was the peoples republic would strike out marching into hong kong destroying the accords and throwing the far east into chaos in utter disbelief catherine had demanded substantiation and by had twice read the state departments lengthy and topsecret dossier on sheng chou yang but she continued to strenuously object as the accuracy could not be verified at she had been taken to the radio room and by satellitescrambler transmission was presented with an array of facts by a man named reilly of the national security council in washington youre only a voice mr reilly staples had said how do i know youre not down at the bottom of the peak in the wanchai there was at that moment a pronounced click on the line and a voice catherine and the world knew very well was speaking to her this is the president of the united states mrs staples if you doubt that i suggest you call your consulate ask them to reach the white house by diplomatic phone and request a confirmation of our transmission ill hang on youll receive it at the moment i have nothing better to do nothing more vital shaking her head and briefly closing her eyes catherine had answered quietly i believe you mr president forget about me believe what youve heard its the truth its just so unbelievable inconceivable im no expert mrs staples and i never claimed to be but then neither was the trojan horse very believable now that may be legend and menelaus wife may have been a figment of a campfire storytellers imagination but the concept is valid its become a symbol of an enemy destroying his adversary from within menelaus dont believe the media ive read a book or two but do believe our people mrs staples we need you ill call your prime minister if it will help but in all honesty id rather not he might feel it necessary to confer with others no mr president containment is everything im beginning to understand ambassador havilland youre one up on me i dont always understand him perhaps its better that way sir at there was an emergency call highest priority to the sterile house in victoria peak but it was not for either the ambassador or undersecretary of state mcallister it was for major lin wenzu and when it came a frightening vigil began that lasted four hours the scant information was so electrifying that all concentration was riveted on the crisis and catherine staples telephoned her consulate telling the high commissioner that she was not well and would not attend the strategy conference with the americans that afternoon her presence in the sterile house was welcome ambassador havilland wanted the foreign service officer to see and understand for herself how close the far east was to upheaval how an inevitable error on either shengs or his assassins part could bring about an explosion so drastic that troops from the peoples republic could move into hong kong within hours bringing not only the colonys world trade to a halt but with it widespread human suffering savage rioting everywhere death squads from the left and the right exploiting resentments going back forty years racial and provincial factions pitted against one another and the military forces blood would flow in the streets and the harbour and as nations everywhere must be affected global war was a very real possibility he said these things to her as lin worked furiously on the telephone giving commands coordinating his people with the colonys police and the airports security it all had started with the major from mi cupping the phone and speaking in a quiet voice in that victorian room in victoria peak kai tak tonight the sinobritish delegations assassination the target is the governor they believe its jason bourne i cant understand it protested mcallister leaping from the couch its premature sheng isnt ready wed have got an inkling of it if he was an official statement from his ministry alluding to a proposed commission of some sort its wrong miscalculation asked the ambassador coldly possibly or something else a strategy we havent considered go to work major said havilland after issuing his last orders lin received a final order himself from havilland before heading to the airport stay out of sight major said the ambassador i mean that impossible replied lin with respect sir i must be with my men on the scene these are experienced eyes with equal respect continued havilland i must make it a condition of your getting through the outside gate why mr ambassador with your perspicacity im surprised you ask i have to i dont understand then perhaps its my fault major i thought id made it clear why we went to such extremes to bring our jason bourne over here accept the fact that hes extraordinary his record proves it he has his ears not only to the ground but theyre also locked into the four winds we must presume if the medical prognosis is accurate and portions of his memory continue to come back to him that he has contacts all over this part of the world in nooks and crannies we know nothing about suppose just suppose major that one of those contacts inform him that an emergencyalert has been sent out for kai tak airport tonight that a large security force has been gathered to protect the governor what do you think hed do be there answered lin wenzu softly reluctantly somewhere and suppose again that our bourne saw you forgive me but you are not easily overlooked the discipline of his logical mind logic discipline and imagination were always his means of survival would force him to find out precisely who you are need i say more i dont think so said the major the connection is made said havilland overriding wenzus words there is no taipan with a murdered young wife in macao instead there is a highly regarded field officer of british intelligence posing as a fictitious taipan having fed him yet another lie that echoes a previous lie he will know that once again he has been manipulated by government forces manipulated in the most brutal fashion possible the abduction of his wife the mind major is a delicate instrument his more delicate than most it can only take so much stress i dont even want to think about what he might do what we might be forced to do it was always the weakest aspect of the scenario and yet it was the core said wenzu an ingenious device interrupted mcallister obviously quoting few acts of vengeance are as readily understood as an eye for an eye your words lin if so you should not have chosen me to play your taipan insisted the major theres a crisis here in hong kong and youve crippled me its the same crisis facing all of us said havilland gently only this time we have a warning also lin who else could we have chosen what other chinese but the proven chief of special branch would have been cleared by london for what you were initially told to say nothing of what you know now set up your command post inside the airports tower the glass is dark in silence the huge major turned angrily and left the room is it wise to let him go asked mcallister as he the ambassador and catherine staples watched lin leave certainly answered the diplomat of covert operations i spent several weeks here with mi continued the undersecretary rapidly hes been known to disobey in the past only when the orders were given by posturing british officers with less experience than himself he was never reprimanded he was right just as he knows im right how can you be sure why do you think he said weve crippled him he doesnt like it but he accepts it havilland walked behind the desk and turned to catherine please sit down mrs staples and edward i should like to ask a favour of you and it has nothing to do with confidentiality you know as much as i do and youre probably more current and ill no doubt call for you if i need information however id like to talk with mrs staples alone by all means said the undersecretary gathering up papers on the desk as catherine sat down in a chair facing the diplomat ive a great deal of thinking to do if this kai tak thing isnt a hoax if its a direct order from sheng then hes conceived of a strategy we really havent considered and thats dangerous from every avenue every direction ive explored he has to offer up his clearinghouse his damned economic commission under stable conditions not unstable he could blow everything apart but hes not stupid hes brilliant whats he doing consider if you will broke in the ambassador frowning as he sat down the reverse of our approach edward instead of implanting his financial clearing house of assorted taipans during a period of stability he does so in instability but with sympathy the point being to restore order quickly no raging giant but rather a protective father caring for his emotionally disturbed offspring wanting to calm it down to what advantage it takes place rapidly thats all who would so closely examine a group of respected financiers from the colony put in place during a crisis after all they represent stability its something to think about mcallister held the papers in his hands and looked at havilland its too much of a gamble for him he said sheng risks losing control of the expansionists in the central committee the old military revolutionaries who are looking for any excuse to move into the colony a crisis based on violence would play right into their hands thats the scenario we gave webb and its a realistic one unless shengs own position is now strong enough to suppress them as you said yourself sheng chou yang has made china a great deal of money and if there was ever a basically capitalistic people its the chinese they have more than a healthy respect for money its an obsession they also have respect for the old men of the long march and it too is obsessive without those early maoists most of chinas younger leadership would be illiterate peasants breaking their backs in the field they revere those old soldiers sheng wouldnt risk a confrontation then theres an alternative theory that could be a combination of what were both saying we did not tell webb that a number of the more vocal leaders of pekings old guard havent been heard from in months and in several instances when the word was officially released this one or that had died of natural causes or a tragic accident and in one case was removed in disgrace now if our assumption is right that at least some of these silenced men are victims of shengs hired gun then hes solidified his position by elimination broke in mcallister westerners are all over peking the hotels are filled to capacity whats one more especially an assassin who could be anyone an attaché a business executive a chameleon and who better than the manipulative sheng to set up secret meetings between his jason bourne and selected victims any number of pretexts would do but primarily military hightech espionage the targets would leap at it if any of this is near the truth shengs much further along than we thought take your papers request anything you need from our intelligence people and mi study everything but find us a pattern edward if we lose a governor tonight we may be on our way to losing hong kong in a matter of days for all the wrong reasons hell be protected muttered mcallister heading for the door his face troubled im counting on it said the ambassador as the undersecretary left the room havilland turned to catherine staples are you really beginning to understand me he asked the words and their implications yes but not certain specifics replied catherine looking oddly at the door the undersecretary of state had just closed hes a strange man isnt he mcallister yes does he bother you on the contrary he lends a certain credibility to everything thats been said to me by you by that man reilly even by your president im afraid staples turned back to the ambassador im being honest i want you to be and i understand the wavelength youre on mcallisters one of the best analytical minds in the state department a brilliant bureaucrat who will never rise to the level of his own worth why not i think you know but if you dont you sense it hes a thoroughly moral man and that morality has stood in the way of his advancement had i been cursed with his sense of moral outrage i never would have become the man i am and in my defense i never would have accomplished what i have but i think you know that too you said as much when you came in here now youre the one being honest i appreciate it im glad i want the air cleared between us because i want your help marie and beyond said havilland what specifics disturb you what can i clarify this clearing house this commission of bankers and taipans sheng will propose to oversee the colonys financial policies let me anticipate interrupted the diplomat on the surface they will be disparate in character and position and eminently acceptable as i said to mcallister when we first met if we thought the whole insane scheme had a prayer wed look the other way and wish them great success but it doesnt have a chance all powerful men have enemies therell be skeptics here in hong kong and in peking jealous factions whove been excluded and theyll dig deeper than sheng expects i think you know what theyll find that all roads above and below ground lead to rome rome here being this taipan shengs father whose name your highly selective documents never mention hes the spider whose webs reach out to every member of that clearing house he controls them for gods sake who the hell is he i wish we knew said havilland his voice flat you really dont asked catherine staples astonished if we did life would be far simpler and i would have told you im not playing games with you weve never learned who he is how many taipans are there in hong kong how many zealots wanting to strike back at peking in any way they can in the cause of the kuomintang by their lights china was stolen from them their motherland the graves of their ancestors their possessions everything many were decent people mrs staples but many others were not the political leaders the warlords the landlords the immensely rich they were a privileged society that gorged themselves on the sweat and suppression of millions and if that sounds like a crock of todays communist propaganda it was a classic case of yesterdays provocation that gave rise to such bilge were dealing with a handful of obsessed expatriats who want their own back they forget the corruption that led to their own collapse have you thought of confronting sheng himself privately of course and his reaction is all too predictable he would feign outrage and tell us bluntly that if we pursue such despicable fantasies in an attempt to discredit him hell void the china accords claiming duplicity and move hong kong into pekings economic orbit immediately hed claim that many of the old line marxists in the central committee would applaud such a move and hed be right then he would look at us and probably say gentlemen you have your choice good day and if you made shengs conspiracy public the same thing would happen and he knows you know it said staples frowning peking would pull out of the accords blaming taiwan and the west for messing around the wests face is beet red with internal capitalistic corruption so the territory marches to a marxist drum actually they wouldnt have a choice and what follows is economic collapse thats the way we read it agreed havilland the solution theres only one sheng staples nodded her head hardball she said the most extreme act if thats what you mean thats obviously what i mean said catherine and maries husband this webb is intrinsic to the solution jason bourne is intrinsic to it yes because this impostor this assassin who calls himself bourne can be trapped by the extraordinary man he emulates as mcallister put it but not in that context he takes his place and pulls out sheng where he can implement the solution the extreme solution hell he kills him yes somewhere in china of course in china of course yes making it appear internal fratricide with no external connections peking cant blame anyone but unknown enemies of sheng within its own hierarchy in any case at that juncture if it happens its probably going to be irrelevant the world wont officially hear of shengs death for weeks and when the announcement is made his sudden demise will undoubtedly be attributed to a massive coronary or a cerebral haemorrhage certainly not to murder the giant does not parade its aberrations its conceals them which is precisely what you want naturally the world goes on the taipans are cut off from their source shengs clearinghouse collapses like a house of cards and reasonable men go forward honoring the accords to everyones benefit but were a long way from there mrs staples to begin with theres today tonight kai tak it could be the beginning of the end for we have no immediate countermeasures to put in place if i appear calm its an illusion born of years of concealing tension my two consolations at this moment are that the colonys security forces are among the best on earth and second the tragedy of death notwithstanding is that peking has been alerted to the situation hong kongs concealing nothing nor does it care to so in a sense it becomes both a joint risk and a joint venture to protect the governor how does that help if the worst happens for what its worth psychologically it may avert the appearance if not the fact of instability for the emergency has been labeled beforehand as an isolated act of premeditated violence not symptomatic of the colonys unrest above all its been shared both delegations have their own military escorts theyll be put to use so by such subtle points of protocol a crisis can be contained from what ive been told you dont need any lessons in containing crises or precipitating them either besides everything can go off the wire with one development that throws subtleties on to the garbage heap despite everything ive said im frightened to death theres so much room for error and miscalculation theyre our enemies mrs staples all we can do is wait and waiting is the hardest part the most draining i have other questions said catherine by all means as many as you like make me think make me sweat if you can it may help us both to take our minds off the waiting you just referred to my questionable abilities in containing crises but you added i think more confidently that i could also precipitate them im sorry i couldnt resist its a bad habit i assume you meant the attaché john nelson who oh yes the young man from the consulate what he lacks in judgement he makes up in courage youre wrong about the judgement asked havilland his thick eyebrows arched in mild astonishment really im not excusing his weaknesses but hes one of the finest people youve got his professional judgement is superior to that of most of your more experienced personnel ask anyone in the consulates whos been in conferences with him hes also one of the few who speak a damn good cantonese he also compromised what he knew was a highly classified operation said the diplomat curtly if he hadnt you wouldnt have found me you wouldnt have come within arms reach of marie st jacques which is where you are now an arms reach an arms reach havilland leaned forward his eyes angry questioning surely you wont continue to hide her probably not i havent decided my god woman after everything youve been told shes got to be here without her weve lost weve all lost if webb found out she wasnt with us that shed disappeared hed go mad youve got to deliver her thats the point i can deliver her any time it doesnt have to be when you say no thundered the ambassador when and if out jason bourne completes his assignment a series of telephone calls will be placed putting him in direct contact with his wife i wont give you a telephone number said staples matteroffactly i might as well give you an address you dont know what youre doing what do i have to say to convince you simple reprimand john nelson verbally suggest counseling if you wish but keep everything off the record and keep him here in hong kong where his chances for recognition are the best jesus christ exploded havilland hes a drug addict thats ludicrous but typical of the primitive reaction of an american moralist given a few key words please mrs staples he was drugged he doesnt take drugs his limit is three vodka martinis and he likes girls of course a few of your male attaches prefer boys and their limit is nearer six martinis but whos counting frankly i personally dont give a damn what adults do within the four walls of a bedroom i dont really believe that whatever it is affects what they do outside the bedroom but washington has this peculiar preoccupation with all right mrs staples nelson is reprimanded by me and the consul general will not be informed and nothing goes into his record are you satisfied were getting there call him this afternoon and tell him that also tell him to get his extracurricular act together for his own benefit that will be a pleasure is there anything else yes and im afraid i dont know how to put it without insulting you that hasnt fazed you it fazes me now because i know far more than i did three hours ago then insult me dear lady catherine paused and when she spoke her voice was a cry for understanding it was hollow yet vibrant and filled the room why why did you do it wasnt there another way i presume you mean mrs webb of course i mean mrs webb and no less her husband i asked you before have you any idea what youve done to them its barbaric and i mean that in the full ugliness of the word youve put both of them on some kind of medieval rack literally pulling their minds and their bodies apart making them live with the knowledge that they may never see each other again each believing that with a wrong decision one can cause the others death an american lawyer once asked a question in a senate hearing and im afraid i must ask it of you have you no sense of decency mr ambassador havilland looked wearily at staples i have a sense of duty he said his voice tired his face drawn i had to develop a situation rapidly that would provoke an immediate response a total commitment to act instantly it was based on an incident in webbs past a terrible thing that turned a civilized young scholar into the phrase used to describe him was the supreme guerrilla i needed that man that hunter for all the reasons youve heard hes here hes hunting and i assume his wife is unharmed and we obviously never intended anything else for her the incident in webbs past that was his first wife in cambodia you know then marie told me his wife and two children were killed by a lone jet fighter sweeping down along a river strafing the water where they were playing he became another man said havilland nodding his mind snapped and it became his war despite the fact that he had little or no regard for saigon he was venting his outrage in the only way he knew how fighting an enemy who had stolen his life from him he would usually take on only the most complex and dangerous assignments where the objectives were major the targets within the framework of command personnel one doctor said that in his mental warp webb was killing the killers who sent out other mindless killers i suppose it makes sense and by taking his second wife in maine you raised the spectre of his first loss the incident that turned him first into this supreme guerrilla then later as jason bourne the hunter of carlos the jackal yes mrs staples hunter interjected the diplomat quietly i wanted that hunter on the scene immediately i couldnt waste any time not a minute and i didnt know any other way to get immediate results hes an oriental scholar cried catherine he understands the dynamics of the orient a hell of a lot better than any of us the socalled experts couldnt you have appealed to him appealed to his sense of history pointing out the consequences of what could happen he may be a scholar but hes first a man who believes with certain justification that he was betrayed by his government he asked for help and a trap was set to kill him no appeals of mine would have broken through that barrier you could have tried and risk delay when every hour counted in a way im sorry youve never been put in my position then perhaps you might really understand me question said catherine holding up her hand defiantly what makes you think that david webb will go into china after sheng if he does find and take the impostor as i understand it the agreement is for him to deliver the man who calls himself jason bourne and marie is returned to him at that point if it occurs it doesnt really matter thats when well tell him why we did what we did thats when well appeal to his far east expertise and the global consequences of shengs and the taipans machinations if he walks away we have several experienced field agents who can take his place theyre not men who youd care to bring home to meet your mother but theyre available and they can do it how codes mrs staples the original jason bournes methods always included codes between himself and his clients that was the structured myth and the impostor has studied every aspect of the original once this new bourne is in our hands well get the information we need one way or another confirmed by chemicals of course well know how to reach sheng and thats all we have to know one meeting in the countryside outside jade tower mountain one kill and the world goes on im not capable of coming up with any other solution are you no said catherine softly slowly shaking her head its hardball give us mrs webb yes of course but not tonight she cant go anywhere and youve got enough to worry about with kai tak i took her to a flat in tuen mun in the new territories it belongs to a friend of mine i also took her to a doctor who bandaged her feet she bruised them badly running from lin and he gave her a sedative my god shes a wreck she hasnt slept in days and the pills didnt do much for her last night she was too tense still too frightened i stayed with her and she talked until dawn let her rest ill pick her up in the morning how will you manage it what will you say im not sure ill call her later and try to keep her calm ill tell her im making progress more perhaps than i thought i would i just want to give her hope to ease the tension ill tell her to stay near the phone get as much rest as she can and ill drive up in the morning i think with good news id like to send a backup with you said havilland including mcallister he knows her and i honestly believe his moral suasion will be communicated it will bolster your case it might agreed catherine nodding as you said i sensed it all right but theyre to stay away until ive talked to her and that could take a couple of hours she has a finely honed distrust of washington and ive got a lot of convincing to do thats her husband out there and she loves him very much i cant and i wont tell her that i approve of what you did but i can say that in light of the extraordinary circumstances not excluding the conceivable economic collapse of hong kong i understand why you did it what she has to understand if nothing else is that shes closer to her husband being with you than away from you of course she may try to kill you but thats your problem shes a very feminine goodlooking woman more than attractive quite striking actually but remember shes a ranch girl from calgary i wouldnt advise being alone with her in a room im sure shes wrestled calves to the ground far stronger than you ill bring in a squad of marines dont shed turn them against you shes one of the most persuasive people ive ever met she has to be replied the ambassador leaning back in his chair she forced a man with no identity with overwhelming feelings of guilt to look into himself and walk out of the tunnels of his own confusion no easy task tell me about her not the dry facts of a dossier but the person catherine did telling what she knew from observation and instinct and as one aspect arose it gave rise to other angles of questioning time passed the minutes and the half hours punctuated with repeated phone calls apprising havilland of the conditions at kai tak airport the sun descended beyond the walls of the garden outside a light supper was provided by the staff would you ask mr mcallister to join us said havilland to a steward i asked mr mcallister if i could fetch him something sir and he was pretty firm about it he told me to get out and leave him alone then never mind thank you the phone calls kept coming the subject of marie st jacques was exhausted and the conversation now turned exclusively on the developments at kai tak staples watched the diplomat in amazement for the more intense the crisis became the slower and more controlled was his speech tell me about yourself mrs staples only what you care to professionally of course catherine studied raymond havilland and began quietly i sprang from an ear of ontario corn yes of course said the ambassador in utter sincerity glancing at the phone staples now understood this celebrated statesman was carrying on an innocuous conversation while his mind was riveted on an entirely different subject kai tak his eyes kept straying to the telephone his wrist turned constantly so that he could look at his watch and yet he never missed the breaks in their dialogue where he was expected to voice a response my former husband sells shoes havillands head snapped up from his watch he would not have been thought capable of an embarrassed smile but he showed one at that moment youve caught me he said a long time ago said catherine theres a reason i know owen staples quite well it figures i imagine you move in the same circles i saw him last year at the queens plate race in toronto i think one of his horses ran respectably well he looked quite grand in his cutaway but then he was one of the queen mothers escorts when we were married he couldnt afford a suit off the rack you know said havilland when i read up on you and learned about owen i had a fleeting temptation to call him not to say anything obviously but to ask him about you then i thought my god in this age of postmarital civility suppose they still talk to each other id be tipping my hand were still talking and you tipped your hand when you flew into hong kong for you perhaps but only after webbs wife reached you tell me what did you think when you first heard i was here that the uk had called you in for consultation on the accords you flatter me the telephone rang and havillands hand flew out for it the caller was wenzu reporting the progress being made at kai tak or more substantively as was apparent the lack of progress why dont they simply call the whole damn thing off asked the ambassador angrily pile them into their cars and get the hell out of there whatever reply the major offered only served to further exasperate havilland thats ridiculous this isnt a show of gamesmanship its a potential assassination no ones image or honour is involved under the circumstances and believe me the world isnt hanging by its collective teeth waiting for that damned press conference most of its asleep for gods sake again the diplomat listened lins remarks not only astonished him they infuriated him the chinese said that its preposterous peking has no right to make such a demand its havilland glanced at staples its barbaric someone should tell them its not their asian faces that are being saved its the british governors and his face is attached to his head which could be blown off silence the ambassadors eyes blinked in angry resignation i know i know the heavenly red star must continue to shine in a heavenly blackout theres nothing you can do so do your best major keep calling as one of my grandchildren puts it im eating bananas whatever the hell that means havilland hung up and looked over at catherine orders from peking the delegations are not to run in the face of western terrorism protect all concerned but carry on london would probably approve the carry on has a familiar ring orders from peking said the diplomat softly not hearing staples orders from sheng are you quite sure of that its his ballgame he calls the shots my god he is ready the tension grew geometrically with each quarter hour until the air was filled with electricity the rains came pounding the bay window with a relentless tattoo a television set was rolled in and turned on the american ambassadoratlarge and the canadian foreign service officer watching in fear and in silence the huge jet taxied in the downpour to its appointed rendezvous with the crowds of reporters and camera crews the english and the chinese honour guards emerged first simultaneously from both sides of the open door their appearance was startling for instead of the stately procession expected of such military escorts these squads moved rapidly into flanking positions down the metal steps elbows bent skyward sidearms gripped guns at the ready the leaders then filed out waving to the onlookers they started down the staircase followed by two lines of awkwardly grinning subordinates the strange press conference began and undersecretary of state edward mcallister burst into the room the heavy door crashing into the wall as he flung it open i have it he cried a page of paper in his hand im sure i have it calm down edward speak sensibly the chinese delegation shouted mcallister out of breath racing to the diplomat and thrusting the paper at him its headed by a man named lao sing the second in command is a general named yunshen theyre powerful and theyve opposed sheng chou yang for years objecting to his policies openly in the central committee their inclusion in the negotiating teams was seen as due to shengs willingness to accept a balance making him look fair in the eyes of the old guard for gods sake what are you trying to say its not the governor not just him its all of them with one action he removes his two strongest opponents in peking and clears the path for himself then as you put it he implants his clearing house his taipans during a period of instability shared by both governments havilland yanked the telephone out of its cradle get me lin at kai tak he ordered the switchboard quickly major lin please at once what do you mean hes not there where is he whos this yes i know who you are listen to me and listen carefully the target is not the governor alone its worse it includes two members of the chinese delegation separate all parties you know that a man from the mossad what the hell theres no such arrangement there couldnt be yes of course ill get off the line breathing rapidly his lined face pale the diplomat looked at the wall and spoke in a barely audible voice they found out from god knows where and are taking immediate countermeasures who for christs sake who was it our jason bourne said mcallister quietly hes there on the television screen a distant limousine jolted to a stop while others peeled away into the darkness figures fled from the stationary car in panic and seconds later the screen was filled with a blinding explosion hes there repeated mcallister whispering hes there the motor launch pitched violently in the darkness and the torrential rains the crew of two bailed out the water that continuously swept back over the gunwales as the grizzled chineseportuguese captain squinting through the cabins large windows inched his way forward towards the black outlines of the island bourne and danjou flanked the boats owner the frenchman spoke raising his voice over the downpour how far do you judge it to the beach two hundred metres plus or minus ten or twenty said the captain its time for the light where is it in the locker beneath you on the right another seventyfive metres and i hold any farther the rocks can be dangerous in this weather we have to get in to the beach cried the frenchman its imperative i told you that yes but you forgot to tell me there would be this rain these swells ninety metres and you can use the little boat the engine is strong youll get there merde spat out danjou opening the locker and pulling out a signal light that could leave a hundred metres or more in any event it would not be less than fifty i told you that and between the two is deep water shall i turn around and head for macao and get us blown up by the patrols you make payment when it is due or you do not make your destination you know that one hundred metres no more danjou nodded testily while holding the signal light up to his chest he pressed a button immediately releasing it and for a brief moment an eerie dark blue flash illuminated the pilots window seconds later a corresponding blue signal was seen through the mottled glass from the islands shoreline you see mon capitaine had we not come in for the rendezvous this miserable scow would have been blown out of the water you were fond enough of her this afternoon said the helmsman working furiously at the wheel that was yesterday afternoon it is now onethirty the next morning and i have come to know your thieving ways danjou replaced the light in the locker and glanced at bourne who was looking at him each was doing what he had done many times in the days of medusa checking out a partners apparel and equipment both men wore trousers sweaters and thin rubber skull caps all black their normal clothing was rolled up in canvas bags their only other equipment apart from jasons automatic and the frenchmans small calibre pistol were scabbarded knives all unseen get in as close as you can said danjou to the captain and remember you wont receive the final payment if youre not here when we return suppose they take your money and kill you cried the pilot spinning the wheel then im our im touched said bourne have no fear of that answered the frenchman glaring at the chineseportuguese ive dealt with this man many times over many months like you he is the pilot of a fast boat and every bit the thief you are i line his marxist pockets so that his mistresses live like concubines of the central committee also he suspects i keep records we are in gods hands perhaps better then take the light muttered the captain grudgingly you may need it and youre no good to me stranded or ripped up on the rocks your concern overwhelms me said danjou retrieving the light and nodding at jason well familiarize ourselves with the skiff and its motor the motors under thick canvas dont start it until youre in the water how do we know it will start asked bourne because i want my money silent one the ride into the beach drenched them both both bracing themselves against the panels of the small boat jason gripping the sides and danjou the rudder and the stern so as to keep from pitching overboard they grazed a shoal metal ground against the rocks as the frenchman swerved the rudder to starboard pushing the throttle to maximum the strange dark blue flash came once again from the beach they had strayed in the wet darkness danjou angled the boat towards the signal and within minutes the bow struck sand the frenchman swung the stick down elevating the motor as bourne leaped overboard grabbing the rope and pulling the small craft up on the beach he gasped startled by the figure of a man suddenly next to him gripping the line in front of him four hands are better than two shouted the stranger an oriental in perfectly fluent english english with an american accent youre the contact yelled jason bewildered wondering if the rain and the waves had distorted his hearing thats such a foolish term replied the man shouting back im simply a friend five minutes later having beached the small boat the three men walked through the thick shorefront foliage suddenly replaced by scrubby trees the friend had constructed a primitive leanto out of a ships tarpaulin a small fire faced the dense woods in front unseen from the sides and the rear concealed by the tarp the warmth was welcome the winds and the drenching rain had chilled bourne and danjou they sat crosslegged around the fire and the frenchman spoke to the uniformed chinese this was hardly necessary gamma gamma erupted jason ive implemented certain traditions of our past delta actually i could have used tango or fox trot it wasnt all greek you know the greek was reserved for the leaders this is a bullshit conversation i want to know why were here why you havent paid him so we can get the hell out man said the chinese drawing out the word using the particular american idiom this cats uptight whats his beef my beef man is that i want to get back to that boat i really dont have time for tea how about scotch said the officer of the peoples republic reaching behind him pulling his arm forward and displaying a bottle of perfectly acceptable whisky well have to share the cork as it were but i dont think were infectious people we bathe we brush our teeth we sleep with clean whores at least my heavenly government makes sure theyre clean who the hell are you asked jason bourne gamma will do echos convinced me of that as to what i am i leave that to your imagination you might try usc thats the university of southern california with graduate studies in berkeley all those protests in the sixties surely you remember them you were a part of that crowd certainly not i was a staunch conservative a member of the john birch society who wanted them all shot screeching freaks with no regard for their nations moral commitments this is a bullshit conversation my friend gamma interrupted danjou is the perfect intermediary he is an educated double or triple or conceivably quadruple agent working all sides for the benefit of his own interests he is the totally amoral man and i respect him for that you came back to china to the peoples republic its where the money was admitted the officer any repressive society offers vast opportunities for those willing to take minor risks on behalf of the repressed ask the commissars in moscow and the eastern bloc of course one must have contacts in the west and possess certain talents that can also serve the regimental leaders fortunately im an exceptional sailor courtesy of friends in the bay area who owned yachts and small motor craft ill return one day i really do like san francisco dont try to fathom his swiss accounts said danjou instead lets concentrate on why gamma has made us such a pleasant retreat in the rainstorm the frenchman took the bottle and drank it will cost you echo said the chinese with you what doesnt what is it danjou passed the bottle to jason i may speak in front of your companion anything youll want the information i guarantee it the price is one thousand american thats it it should be enough said the chinese officer taking the bottle of scotch from bourne there are two of you and my patrol boat is half a mile away in the south cove my crew thinks im holding a secret meeting with our undercover people in the colony ill want the information and youll guarantee it for those words im to produce a thousand dollars without a struggle when its entirely possible you have a dozen zhongguo ren outside in the bush some things must be taken on faith not my money countered the frenchman you dont get a sou until i have an idea what youre selling you are gallic to the core said gamma shaking his head very well it concerns your disciple the one who no longer follows his master but instead picks up his thirty pieces of silver and a great deal more the assassin pay him ordered bourne rigid staring at the chinese officer danjou looked at jason and the man called gamma then pulled up his sweater and unbuckled his soaking wet trousers he reached below his waist and forced up an oilcloth money belt he unzipped the centre pocket slipped out the bills one after another with his fingers and held them out for the chinese officer three thousand for tonight and one for this new information the rest is counterfeit i always carry an extra thousand for contingencies but only a thousand the information broke in jason bourne he paid for it replied gamma i shall address him address whomever the hell you like just talk our mutual friend in guangzhou canton began the officer speaking to danjou the radioman at headquarters one weve done business said the frenchman guardedly knowing id be meeting you here at this hour i refuelled at the pumps in zhuhai shi shortly after tenthirty there was a message for me to reach him we have a safe relay he told me a call was rerouted through beijing with an unidentified jade tower priority code it was for soo jiang danjou bolted forward both hands on the ground the pig who is he asked bourne quickly supposedly chief of intelligence for macao operations replied the frenchman but he would sell his mother to a brothel if the price were right at the moment he is the conduit to my once and former disciple my judas whos suddenly been summoned to beijing interrupted the man called gamma youre sure of that said jason our mutual friend is sure answered the chinese still looking at danjou an aide to soo came to headquarters one and checked all tomorrows flights from kai tak to beijing under his departments authorization he reserved space a single space on every one in several cases it meant that an original passenger was reduced to standby status when an officer at headquarters one asked for soos personal confirmation the aide said he had left for macao on urgent business who has business in macao at midnight everythings closed except the casinos volunteered bourne table five the kam pek totally controlled circumstances which in view of the reserved spaces said the frenchman means that soo isnt sure when he will reach the assassin but he is sure hell reach him whatever message hes carrying is nothing short of an order that has to be complied with jason looked at the chinese officer get us into beijing he said the airport the earliest flight youll be rich i guarantee it delta youre mad cried danjou peking is out of the question why no ones looking for us and there are french english italians americans god knows who else all over the city weve both got passports thatll get us through be reasonable pleaded echo well be in their nets knowing what we know if were spotted in the vaguest questionable circumstances well be killed on the spot hell show up again down here most likely in a matter of days i dont have days said bourne coldly ive lost your creation twice im not going to lose him a third time you think you can possibly take him in china where else would he least expect a trap madness you are mad make the arrangements jason ordered the chinese officer the first flight out of kai tak when ive got the tickets ill hand over fifty thousand dollars american to whomever gives them to me send someone you can trust fifty thousand the man called gamma stared at bourne the skies over peking were hazy the dust travelling on the winds from the north china plains creating pockets of vapid yellows and dull browns in the sunlight the airport like all internationals was immense the runways a crisscrossing patchwork of black avenues several over two miles in length if there was a difference between peking airport and its western counterparts it was in the huge domeshaped terminal with its adjacent hotel and various freeways leading into the complex although contemporary in design there was an underlying sense of function and an absence of eyepleasing touches it was an airport to be used and admired for its efficiency not for its beauty bourne and danjou went through customs with a minimum of effort the way eased for them by their fluent chinese the guards were actually pleasant barely glancing at their minimal luggage more curious about their linguistic ability than their possessions the chief official accepted without question the story of two oriental scholars on a holiday from which pleasant tales of travel would no doubt find their way into the lecture halls they converted a thousand dollars each into renminbi literally the peoples money and were given nearly two thousand yuan apiece in return and bourne took off the glasses he had purchased in washington from his friend cactus one thing bewilders me said the frenchman as they stood in front of an electronic sign showing the next three hours of arrivals and departures why would he be flown in on a commercial plane certainly whoever is paying him has government or military aircraft at his disposal like ours those aircraft have to be signed out and accounted for answered jason and whoever it is has to keep his distance from your assassin he comes in as a tourist or a businessman and then the convoluted process of making contact begins at least thats what im counting on madness tell me delta if you do take him and i add that its a significant if because hes extraordinarily capable have you any idea how to get him out ive got money american money large bills more than you can imagine its in the lining of my jacket thats why we stopped at the peninsula isnt it why you told me not to check you out yesterday your moneys there it was in the hotel safe ill get him out on the wings of pegasus no probably a pan am flight with the two of us helping a very sick friend actually somewhere along the line i think you gave me the idea then i am a mental case stay by the window said bourne theres another twelve minutes before the next plane is due from kai tak but then that could mean two minutes or twelve hours im going to buy us both a present madness mumbled the frenchman too tired to do more than shake his head when jason returned he directed danjou into a corner within sight of the immigration doors which were kept closed except when passengers were emerging from customs bourne reached into his inside jacket pocket and pulled out a long thin brightly covered box with the sort of gaudy wrapping found in souvenir shops the world over he removed the top inside on ersatz felt was a narrow brass letteropener with chinese characters along the handle the point was obviously honed and sharp take it said jason put it in your belt hows the balance asked medusas echo as he slid the blade under his trousers not bad its about halfway to the base of the handle and the brass gives it weight the thrust should be decent yes i recall said danjou one of the first rules was never to throw a knife but one evening at dusk you watched a gurkha take out a scout ten feet away without firing a shot or risking handtohand combat his carbine bayonet spun through the air like a whirling missile right into the scouts chest the next morning you ordered the gurkha to teach us some did better than others how did you do reasonably well i was older than all of you and felt drawn to whatever defences i could learn that did not take great physical exertion also i kept practising you saw me you commented on it frequently jason looked at the frenchman its funny but i dont remember any of that i just naturally thought im sorry delta forget it im learning to trust things i dont understand the vigil continued reminding bourne of his wait in lo wu as one trainload after another crossed the border no one revealed until a short elderly man with a limp became someone else in the distance the plane was over two hours late customs would take an additional fifty minutes that one cried danjou pointing to a figure walking out of the immigration doors with a cane asked jason with a limp his shabby clothes cannot conceal his shoulders exclaimed echo the grey hair is too new he hasnt brushed it sufficiently and the dark glasses too wide like us he is tired you were right the summons to beijing had to be complied with and he is careless because rest is a weapon and he disregarded it yes last night kai tak must have taken its toll on him but more important he had to obey merde his fees must be in the hundreds of thousands hes heading for the hotel said bourne stay back here ill follow him at a distance if he spotted you hed run and we could lose him he could spot you not likely i invented the game also ill be behind him stay here ill come back for you carrying his canvas bag his gait showing the weariness of jet lag jason fell in line with the disembarked passengers heading into the hotel his eyes on the greyhaired man ahead twice the former british commando stopped and turned around and twice with each brief movement of the shoulders bourne also turned and bent down as if brushing an insect from his leg or adjusting the strap of his bag his body and face out of sight the crowd at the registration counter grew and jason was eight people behind the killer in the second line making himself as inconspicuous as possible continually stooping to kick his bag ahead the commando reached the female clerk he showed his papers signed the register and limped with his cane towards a bank of brown elevators on the right six minutes later bourne faced the same clerk he spoke in mandarin ni neng bangzhu wo ma he began asking for help it was a sudden trip and ive no place to stay just for the night you speak our language very well said the clerk her almond eyes wide in appreciation you do us honour she added politely i hope to do much better during my stay here im on a scholarly trip it is the best kind there are many treasures in beijing and elsewhere of course but this is the heavenly city you have no reservation im afraid not everything was last minute if you know what i mean as i speak both languages i can tell you that you said it correctly in ours everything is rushrush ill see what i can do it will not be terribly grand of course i cant afford terribly grand said jason shyly but i have a roommate we can share the same bed if necessary im certain it will be a case of sharing at such short notice the clerks fingers leafed through the file cards here she said a single back room on the second floor i think it may fit your economics well take it agreed bourne by the way a few minutes ago i saw a man in this line who im sure i know hes getting on now but i think he was an old professor of mine when i studied in england greyhaired with a cane im certain its he id like to call him oh yes i remember the clerk now separated the most recent registration cards in front of her the name is wadsworth joseph wadsworth hes in three twentyfive but you may be wrong his occupation is listed as an offshore oil consultant from great britain youre right wrong man said jason shaking his head in embarrassment he took the key to the room we can take him now bourne gripped danjous arm pulling the frenchman away from the deserted corner of the terminal now so easily so quickly it is incredible the opposite said jason leading danjou towards the crowded row of glass doors that was the entrance to the hotel its completely credible your mans mind is on a dozen different things right now hes got to stay out of sight he cant place a call through a switchboard so hell remain in his room waiting for a call to him giving him his instructions they walked through a glass door looked around and headed to the left of the long counter bourne continued speaking rapidly kai tak didnt work last night so he has to consider another possibility his own elimination on the basis that whoever discovered the explosives under the car saw him and identified him which is the truth he has to insist that his client is alone at the arranged rendezvous so that he can reach him one on one its his ultimate protection they found a staircase and started climbing and his clothes went on medusas delta hell change them he cant appear as he was and he cant appear as he is he has to be someone else they reached the third floor and jason his hand on the knob turned to danjou take my word for it echo your boys involved hes got exercises going on in his head that would challenge a russian chess player is this the academic speaking or the man they once called jason bourne bourne said david webb his eyes cold his voice ice if it ever was its now the canvas bag slung over his shoulder jason slowly opened the door at the head of the stairs inching his body past the frame two men in dark pinstriped suits walked up the hallway towards him complaining at the apparent lack of room service their speech was british they opened the door to their room and went inside bourne pushed the staircase door back and shoved danjou through they walked down the corridor the room numbers were in chinese and english three fortyone they were in the right hallway the room was along the left wall three indian couples suddenly emerged from a brown elevator the women in their saris the men in tightfitting cloth trousers they passed jason and danjou chattering looking for their rooms the husbands obviously annoyed to be carrying their own luggage three thirtyfive this is the end screamed a female voice as an obese woman in curlers strode martially out of a door on the right wearing a bathrobe the nightgown underneath trailed below twice snarling her feet she yanked it up revealing a pair of legs worthy of a rhinoceros the toilet doesnt work and you can forget the phone isabel i told you shouted a man in red pyjamas peering through the open door its the jet lag get some sleep and remember this isnt short hills dont nitpick expand yourself since i cant use the bathroom i have no choice ill find some slanteyed bastard and yell like hell where are the stairs i wouldnt walk into one of those goddamned elevators if they move at all its probably sideways and right through the walls into a sevenfourseven the distraught woman swept by on her way to the staircase exit two of the three indian couples had difficulty with their keys finally managing to negotiate the locks with loud wellplaced kicks and the man in the red pyjamas slammed the door of his room after shouting to his wife in high dudgeon its like that class reunion at the club youre so embarrassing isabel three twentynine the room the hallway was deserted they could hear the strains of oriental music from behind the door the radio was turned up the volume loud to be made louder with the first ring of a telephone bell jason pulled danjou back and spoke quietly against the wall i dont remember any gurkhas or any scouts a part of you did delta interrupted echo maybe but thats beside the point this is the beginning of the end of the road well leave our bags out here ill go for the door and you follow hard keep your blade ready but i want you to understand something and there cant be a mistake dont throw it unless you absolutely have to if you do go for his legs nothing above the waist you put more faith in an older mans accuracy than i do im hoping i wont have to call on it these doors are made of hollow plywood and your assassins got a lot on his mind hes thinking about strategy not about us how could we know hes here and even if we did how could we get across the border on such short notice and i want him im taking him ready as i ever will be said the frenchman lowering his canvas bag and pulling the brass letteropener from his belt he held the blade in his hand his fingers spread seeking the balance bourne slipped the flight bag off his shoulder to the floor and quietly positioned himself in front of room he looked at danjou echo nodded and jason sprang towards the door his left foot a battering ram crashing into the space below the lock the door plunged inward as though blown apart wood shattered hinges were torn from their bolts bourne lunged inside rolling over and over on the floor his eyes spinning in all directions arretez roared danjou a figure came through an inner doorway the greyhaired man the assassin jason sprang to his feet hurling himself at his quarry grabbing the mans hair yanking him to the left then to the right crashing him back into the doorframe suddenly the frenchman screamed as the brass blade of the letteropener flashed through the air embedding itself in the wall the handle quivering it was off the mark a warning delta no bourne stopped all movement his quarry pinned helpless under his weight and grip look cried danjou jason slowly moved back his arms rigid caging the figure in front of him he stared into the gaunt wrinkled face of a very old man with thinning grey hair marie lay on the narrow bed staring up at the ceiling the rays of the noonday sun streamed through the shadeless windows filling the small room with blinding light and too much heat sweat clogged her face and her torn blouse clung to her moist skin her feet ached from the midmorning madness that had begun as a walk down an unfinished coastal road to a rocky beach below a stupid thing to do but at the time the only thing she could do she had been going out of her mind the sounds of the street floated up a strange cacophony of highpitched voices sudden shrieks and bicycle bells and the blaring horns of trucks and public buses it was as if a crowded bustling hustling section of hong kong had been ripped out of the island and set down in some far away place where a wide river and endless fields and distant mountains replaced victoria harbour and the countless rows of ascending tall buildings made of glass and stone in a sense the transplant had happened she reflected the miniature city of tuen mun was one of those spaceoriented phenomena that had sprung up north of kowloon in the new territories one year it had been an arid river plain the next a rapidly developing metropolis of paved roads and factories shopping districts and spreading apartment buildings all beckoning those from the south with the promise of housing and jobs in the thousands and those who heeded the call brought with them the unmistakable hysteria of hong kongs commerce without it they would be filled with innocuous anxieties too placid to contend with these were the descendants of guangzhou the province of canton not worldweary shanghai marie had awakened with the first light what sleep she had managed wracked with nightmares and knew that she faced another suspension of time until catherine called her she had telephoned late last night dragging her out of a sleep induced by total exhaustion only to tell her cryptically that several unusual things had happened that could lead to favorable news she was meeting a man who had taken an interest a remarkable man who could help marie was to stay in the flat by the telephone in case there were new developments since catherine had instructed her not to use names or specifics on the phone marie had not questioned the brevity of the call ill phone you first thing in the morning my dear staples had abruptly hung up she had not called by or by and by marie could stand it no longer she reasoned that names were unnecessary each knew the others voice and catherine had to understand that david webbs wife was entitled to something first thing in the morning marie had dialled stapless flat in hong kong there was no answer so she dialled again to make sure she had spun the correct numbers nothing in frustration and without caring she had called the consulate foreign service officer staples please im a friend from the treasury board in ottawa id like to surprise her the connections very good honey im not in ottawa im here said marie picturing the face of the talkative receptionist only too well sorry hon mrs staples is offpremises with no instructions to tell you the truth the high commish is looking for her too why dont you give me a number marie lowered the phone into its cradle a sublime panic passing through her it was nearly and catherine was an early riser first thing in the morning might be any time between and most likely splitting the difference but not oclock not under the circumstances and then minutes later the phone had rung it was the beginning of a far less subtle panic marie catherine are you all right yes of course you said first thing in the morning why didnt you call before ive been going out of my mind can you talk yes im in a public booth whats happened whats happening whos the man you met there had been a brief pause on the line from hong kong for an instant it seemed awkward and marie had not known why i want you to stay calm my dear said staples i didnt call before because you need all the rest you can get i may have the answers that you want that you need things are not as terrible as you think and you must stay calm damn it i am calm at least im reasonably sensible what the hell are you talking about i can tell you that your husbands alive and i can tell you that hes very good at what he does what he did youre not telling me anything im driving out to see you in a few minutes the traffics rotten as usual made worse by all the security surrounding the sinobritish delegations tying up the streets and the tunnel but it shouldnt take me more than an hour and a half perhaps two catherine i want answers im bringing them to you a few at least rest marie try to relax everythings going to be all right ill be there soon this man asked david webbs wife pleading will he be with you no ill be alone no one with me i want to talk youll see him later all right had it been stapless tone of voice marie had wondered after hanging up or that catherine had literally told her nothing after admitting she could talk freely over a public phone the staples she knew would try to allay the fears of a terrified friend if she had concrete facts to offer in comfort even a single piece of vital information if the fabric of the whole were too complex something david webbs wife deserved something instead there had been a diplomats talk the allusion to but not the substance of reality something was wrong but it was beyond her understanding catherine had protected her taken enormous risks for her both professionally in terms of not seeking guidance from her consulate and personally in confronting acute physical danger marie knew that she should feel gratitude overwhelming gratitude but instead she felt a growing sense of doubt say it again catherine she had screamed inside herself say everything will be all right i cant think any more i cant think in here ive got to get out ive got to have air she had lurched about unsteadily for the clothes they had bought for her when they had reached tuen mun the previous night clothes purchased after staples had taken her to a doctor who ministered to her feet applying cushioned gauze giving her hospital slippers and prescribing thicksoled trainers if she had to do any extended walking during the next few days actually catherine had picked out the clothes while marie waited in the car and considering the tension staples was under her selections were both functional and attractive a light green sheer cotton skirt was complemented by a white cotton blouse and a small whiteshelled bag also a pair of dark green slacks shorts were inappropriate and a second casual blouse all were successful counterfeits of wellknown designers the labels correctly spelled theyre very nice catherine thank you they go with your hair staples had said not that anyone in tuen mun will notice i want you to stay in the flat but well have to leave here some time also in case i get stuck at the office and you need anything ive put some money in the bag i thought i wasnt supposed to leave the flat that we were going to pick up a few things at a market i dont know whats back in hong kong any more than you do lin could be so furious he might dig up an old colonial law and put me under house arrest theres a shoe store in blossom soon street youll have to go inside and try on the trainers yourself ill come with you of course several moments had passed and marie spoke catherine how do you know so much about this place ive yet to see another occidental in the streets whose flat is it a friends said staples without further elaboration theres no one using it a great deal of the time so i come up here to get away from it all catherine had said no more the subject was not to be explored even when they had talked for most of the night no amount of prodding had brought forth any more information it was a topic catherine simply would not discuss marie had put on the slacks and the white blouse and struggled with the outsized shoes cautiously she had walked down the stairs and into the busy street instantly aware of the stares she attracted wondering whether she should turn around and go back inside she could not she was finding a few minutes of freedom from the stifling confines of the small apartment and they were like a tonic she strolled slowly painfully down the pavement mesmerized by the colour and the hectic movement and the unending staccato chatter all around her as in hong kong garish signs rose everywhere above the buildings and everywhere people haggled with one another alongside stands and in storefront doorways it was as if a slice of the colony had been uprooted and set down on a vast frontier she had found an unfinished road at the end of a back street the work apparently abandoned but only temporarily as levelling machinery unused and rusting stood on the borders two signs in chinese were on either side of the descending dirt taking each step carefully she made her way down the steep decline to the deserted shoreline and sat on a cluster of rocks the minutes of freedom were opening up precious moments of peace she looked out and watched the boats sailing from the docks of tuen mun as well as those heading in from the peoples republic from what she could see the first were fishing craft nets draped over bows and gunwales while those from the chinese mainland were mostly small cargo ships their decks bulging with crates of produce but not all there were also the sleek grey navy patrol boats flying the colours of the peoples republic ominous black guns were mounted on all sides of the various craft uniformed men standing motionless next to them peering through binoculars every now and then a naval vessel would pull alongside a fishing boat provoking wildly excited gestures from the fishermen stoic responses were the replies as the powerful patrols slowly turned and slipped away it was all a game thought marie the north was quietly asserting its total control while the south was left to protest about its disturbed fishing grounds the former had the strength of hard steel and a disciplined chain of command the latter soft nets and perseverance no one was the victor except those opposing sisters boredom and anxiety jingchar shouted a male voice from behind in the distance sheir shrieked a second ni zai zher gan shemma marie spun around two men up on the road had broken into a run they were racing down the unfinished access towards her their screams directed at her commanding her awkwardly she got to her feet steadying herself on the rocks as they ran up to her both men were dressed in some sort of paramilitary clothing and as she looked at them she realized they were young late teenagers twenty at most bu xing barked the taller boy looking back up the hill and gesturing for his companion to grab her whatever it was it was to be done quickly the second boy pinned her arms from behind stop this cried marie struggling who are you lady speaks english observed the first young man i speak english he added proudly if unctuously i worked for a jeweller in kowloon again he glanced up at the unfinished road then tell your friend to take his hands off me the lady does not tell me what to do i tell the lady the young lad came closer his eyes fixed on the swell of maries breasts under the blouse this is forbidden road a forbidden part of the shore the lady did not see the signs i dont read chinese im sorry ill leave just tell him to let go of me suddenly marie felt the body of the young man behind her pressing against her own stop it she yelled hearing quiet laughter in her ear feeling a warm breath on her neck is the lady to meet a boat with criminals from the peoples republic does she signal to men on the water the taller chinese raised both his hands to maries blouse his fingers on the top buttons is she concealing a radio perhaps a signalling device it is our duty to learn these things the police expect it of us goddamn you take your hands off me marie twisted violently kicking out in front of her the man behind pulled her back off her feet as the taller boy grabbed her legs straddling them with his own and scissoring them she could not move her body was stretched taut diagonally up from the rocky beach held firmly in place the first chinese ripped off her blouse and then her brassiere cupping her breasts with both hands she screamed and thrashed and screamed again until she was slapped and two fingers were pincered into her throat cutting off all sound but muffled coughs the nightmare of ztirich came back to her rape and death on the guisan quai they carried her to a stretch of tall grass the boy behind clamping his hand over her mouth then replacing it quickly with his right arm cutting off the air and any screams she might have managed as he yanked her forward she was thrown to the ground one of her attackers now covering her face with his bare stomach as the other began pulling off her slacks and thrusting his hands between her legs it was zurich and instead of writhing in the cold swiss darkness there was the wet heat of the orient instead of the limmat another river far wider far more deserted instead of one animal there were two she could feel the body of the tall chinese on top of her thrusting in his panic furious that he was not able to enter her her thrashing repelling his assault for an instant the boy across her face reached under his trousers to his groin there was a brief moment of space and for marie the world went mad she sunk her teeth into the flesh above her drawing blood feeling the sickening flesh in her mouth screams followed her arms were released she kicked as the young oriental rolled away clutching his stomach she crashed her knee up into the exposed organ above her waist then clawed at the wildeyed sweating face of the taller man now screaming herself yelling pleading shouting as she had never shouted in her life before holding his testicles beneath his shorts the infuriated boy threw himself down on her but rape was no longer a consideration only to keep her quiet suffocating the darkness had begun to close in on marie and then she had heard other voices in the distance excited voices closing that distance and she knew she had to send up a final cry for help in a desperate surge she dug her nails into the contorted face above her for an instant freeing her mouth from the grip here down here over here bodies were suddenly swarming around her she could hear slaps and kicks and furious screams but none of the madness was directed at her then the darkness had come her last thoughts only partly about herself david david for gods sake where are you stay alive my dearest dont let them take your mind again above all dont allow that they want mine and i wont give it to them why are they doing this to us oh my god why she had awakened on a cot in a small room with no windows a young chinese woman a girl really wiping her forehead with a cool perfumed cloth where whispered marie where is this where am i the girl smiled sweetly and shrugged nodding at a man on the other side of the cot a chinese marie judged to be in his thirties dressed in tropical clothes a white guayabera instead of a shirt permit me to introduce myself said the man in accented but clear english my name is jitai and i am with the tuen mun branch of the hang chow bank you are in the back room of a fabric shop belonging to a friend and client mr chang they brought you here and called for me you were attacked by two hoodlums of the didi jing cha which can be translated as the young peoples auxiliary police it is one of those wellmeant social programmes that has many benefits but on occasion also has its very rotten apples as you americans say why do you think im american your speech while you were unconscious you spoke about a man named david a dear friend no doubt you wish to find him what else did i say nothing really you were not very coherent i dont know anyone named david said marie firmly not in that way it must have been one of those deliriums that go back to childhood it is immaterial it is your wellbeing that matters we are filled with shame and sorrow at what happened where are those two punks those bastards they are caught and will be punished i hope they spend ten years in jail the chinese had frowned to bring that about will mean involving the police a formal complaint a hearing before a magistrate so many legalities marie stared at the banker now if you wish i will accompany you to the police and act as your interpreter but it was our opinion that we should first hear your desires in this regard you have been through so much and you are alone here in tuen mun for reasons only you know no mr jitai said marie quietly td rather not press charges im all right and vengeance isnt a high priority with me it is with us madame what do you mean your attackers will carry our shame to their wedding beds where their performances will be less than expected i see they are young this morning as we have learned is not their first offence they are filth and lessons must be taught this morning oh my god what time is it how long have i been here the banker looked at his watch nearly an hour ive got to get back to the apartment the flat right away its important the ladies wish to mend your clothing theyre excellent seamstresses and it will not take long however they believed you should not wake up without your clothes i havent time i have to get back now oh christ i dont know where it is and i dont have an address we know the building madame a tall attractive white woman alone in tuen mun is noticed word spreads well take you there at once the banker turned and spoke in rapid chinese addressing a halfopened door behind him as marie sat up she was suddenly aware of the crowd of people peering inside she got to her feet her painful feet and stood for a moment weaving but slowly finding her balance holding the ripped folds of her blouse together the door was pulled back and two old women entered each carrying an article of brightly coloured silk the first was a kimonolike garment which was gently lowered over her head becoming a halfdress covering her torn blouse and much of her soiled green slacks the second was a long wide sash which was wrapped around her waist and tied also gently tense as she was marie saw that each article was exquisite come madame said the banker touching her elbow i will escort you they walked out into the fabric shop marie nodding and trying to smile as the crowd of chinese men and women bowed to her their dark eyes filled with sadness she had returned to the small apartment removed the beautiful sash and garment and lay down on the bed trying to make sense where no reason was to be found she buried her face in the pillow now trying to push the horrible images of the morning out of her head but the ugliness was beyond purging instead it made the sweat pour out of her and the tighter she closed her eyes the more violent the images became interweaving the terrible memories of zurich on the guisan quai when a man named jason bourne had saved her life she stifled a scream and leaped off the bed standing there trembling she walked into the tiny kitchen and turned on the tap reaching for a glass the stream of water was weak and thin and she watched vacantly as the glass filled her mind elsewhere there are times when people should put their heads on hold god knows i do it more than a reasonably respected psychiatrist should things overwhelm us we have to get our acts together morris panov friend to jason bourne she shut off the tap drank the lukewarm water and went back towards the confining room that served the triple functions of sleeping sitting and pacing she stood in the doorway and looked around knowing what she found so grotesque about her sanctuary it was a cell as surely as if it were in some remote prison worse it was a very real form of solitary confinement she was again isolated with her thoughts with her terrors she walked to a window as a prisoner might and peered at the world outside what she saw was an extension of her cell she was not free down in that teeming street below either it was not a world she knew and it did not welcome her quite apart from the obscene madness of the morning on the beach she was an intruder who could neither understand nor be understood she was alone and that loneliness was driving her crazy numbly marie gazed at the street the street there she was catherine she was standing with a man by a grey car their heads turned watching three other men ten yards behind them by a second car all five were glaringly apparent for they were like no other people in the street they were occidentals in a sea of chinese strangers in an unfamiliar place they were obviously excited concerned about something as they kept nodding their heads and looking in all directions especially across the street at the apartment house heads hair three of the men had closecropped hair military cuts marines american marines catherines companion a civilian to judge by his hair was talking rapidly his index finger jabbing the air marie knew him it was the man from the state department the one who had come to see them in maine the undersecretary with the dead eyes who kept rubbing his temples and barely protested when david told him he did not trust him it was mcallister he was the man catherine said she was to meet suddenly abstract and terrible pieces of the horrible puzzle fell into place as marie watched the scene below the two marines by the second car crossed the street and separated the one standing with catherine talked briefly with mcallister then ran to his right pulling a small handheld radio from his pocket staples spoke to the undersecretary of state and glanced up at the apartment house marie spun away from the window hell be alone no one with me all right it was a trap catherine staples had been reached she was not a friend she was the enemy marie knew she had to run for gods sake get away she grabbed the whiteshelled purse with the money and for a split second stared at the silks from the fabric shop she picked them up and ran out of the flat there were two hallways one running the width of the building along the front with a staircase on the right leading down to the street the other hallways bisected the first to form an inverted t leading to a door in the rear it was a second staircase used for carrying garbage to the bins in the back alley catherine had casually pointed it out when they arrived explaining that there was an ordinance forbidding refuse in the street which was the main thoroughfare of tuen mun marie raced down the bisecting hall to the rear door and opened it she gasped suddenly confronted by the stooped figure of an old man with a straw broom in his hand he squinted at her for a moment then shook his head his expression one of intense curiosity she stepped out into the dark landing as the chinese went inside she held the door slightly open waiting for the sight of staples emerging from the front stairs if catherine finding the flat empty quickly returned to the staircase to rush down into the street to mcallister and the marine contingent marie could slip back into the apartment arid pick up the skirt and second blouse staples had bought for her in her panic she had only fleetingly thought about them grabbing the silks instead not daring to lose precious moments rummaging through the closet where catherine had hung them among various other clothing she thought about them now she could not walk much less run through the streets in a torn blouse and filthy slacks something was wrong it was the old man he just stood there staring at the crack in the doorframe go away whispered marie footsteps the clacking of highheeled shoes walking rapidly up the metal staircase in the front of the building if it was staples she would pass the bisecting hallway on her way to the flat deng yi dengf yelped the old chinese still standing motionless with his broom still staring at her marie closed the door farther watching through barely a half inch of space staples came into view glancing briefly curiously at the old man apparently having heard his sharp highpitched angry voice without breaking stride she continued down the hall intent only on reaching the flat marie waited the pounding in her chest seemed to echo throughout the dark stairwell then the words came pleas shouted in hysteria marie marie where are you the footsteps hammered now racing on the cement catherine rounded the corner and began running towards the old chinese and the door towards her marie its not what you think for gods sake stop marie webb spun and ran down the dark steps suddenly a shaft of bright yellow sunlight spread up the staircase and just as suddenly was no more the ground floor door three storeys below had been opened a figure in a dark suit had entered swiftly a marine taking up his post the man raced up the steps marie crouched in the corner of the second landing the marine reached the top step about to round the turn steadying himself on the railing marie lunged out her hand the hand with the bunched silks crashing into the astonished soldiers face catching him off balance she slammed her shoulder into the marines chest sending him reeling backwards down the staircase marie passed his tumbling body on the steps as she heard the screams from above marie marie i know its you for christs sake listen to me she lurched out into the alley and another nightmare began its dreadful course played out in the blinding sunlight of tuen mun running through the connecting thoroughfare behind the row of apartment buildings her feet now bleeding inside the training shoes marie threw the kimonolike garment over her head and stopped by a row of garbage cans where she removed her green slacks and threw them inside the nearest one she then draped the wide sash over her head covering her hair and ran into the next alleyway that led to the main street she reached it and seconds later walked into the mass of humanity that was a slice of hong kong in the new frontier of the colony she crossed the street there shouted a male voice the tall one the chase began but abruptly without any indication it was different a man raced down the pavement after her suddenly stopped by a wheeled stand blocking his way he tried to shove it aside only to put his hands into recessed pots of boiling fat he screamed overturning the cart and was now met with shrieks from the proprietor obviously demanding payment as he and others surrounded the marine forcing him back into the kerb theres the bitch as marie heard the words she was confronted by a phalanx of women shoppers she spun to her right and ran into another alley off the street an alley she suddenly discovered was a deadend closed by the wall of a chinese temple it happened again five young men teenagers in paramilitary outfits suddenly appeared from a doorway and gestured for her to pass yankee criminal yankee thief the shouts were in the cadence of a rehearsed foreign language the young men locked arms and without violence intercepted the man with closecropped hair crowding him against a wall get out of my way you pricks shouted the marine get out of my way or ill take every one of you brats you raise your arms or a weapon cried a voice in the background i never said anything about a weapon broke in the soldier from victoria peak but if you do either continued the voice they will release their arms and five didi jing cha so many trained by our american friends will certainly contain one man goddamn it sir im only trying to do my job its none of your business tm afraid it is sir for reasons you do not know shit the marine leaned against the wall out of breath and looked at the smiling young faces in front of him lai said a woman to marie pointing to a wide oddly shaped door with no visible handle on what appeared to be a thick impenetrable exterior xiao xin kaafill carefull i understand an aproned figure opened the door and marie rushed inside instantly feeling the harsh blasts of cold air she was standing in a large walkin refrigerator where carcasses of meat hung eerily on hooks under the glow of meshencased light bulbs the man in the apron waited a full minute his ear at the door marie wrapped the wide silk sash around her neck and clutched her arms to ward off the sudden bitter cold made worse by the contrasting oppressive heat outside finally the clerk gestured for her to follow him she did so threading her way around the carcasses until they reached the huge refrigerators entrance the chinese yanked a metal lever and pushed the heavy door open nodding for marie who was shivering to walk through she now found herself in a long narrow deserted butchers shop the bamboo blinds on the front windows filtering the intense noonday sunlight a whitehaired man stood behind the counter by the far right window peering through the slats at the street outside he beckoned for marie to join him quickly again she did as she was instructed noticing an oddly shaped floral wreath behind the glass of the front door which appeared to be locked the older man indicated that marie should look through the window she parted two curved bamboo slats and gasped astonished at the scene outside the search was at its frenzied peak the marine with scalded hands kept waving them in the air as he went from store to store across the street she saw catherine staples and mcallister in a heated conversation with a crowd of chinese who obviously were objecting to foreigners disturbing the peaceful if hectic way of life in tuen mun in his panic mcallister apparently had shouted something offensive and was challenged by a man twice his age an ancient in an oriental gown who had to be restrained by younger cooler heads the undersecretary of state backed away his arms raised pleading innocence as staples shouted to no avail in her efforts to extricate them both from the angry mob suddenly the marine with the hurt hands came crashing out of a doorway across the street shattered glass flew in all directions as he rolled on the pavement yelling in pain as his hands touched the cement he was pursued by a young chinese dressed in the white tunic sash and kneelength trousers of a martialarts instructor the marine sprang to his feet and as his oriental adversary ran up to him he pounded a low left hook into the young mans kidney and followed it with a wellaimed right fist into the oriental face pummelling his assailant back into the storefront while screaming in agony at the pain both blows caused his scalded hands a last marine from victoria peak came running down the street one leg limping his shoulders sagging as if damaged from a fall a fall down a flight of stairs thought marie as she watched in amazement he came to the aid of his anguished comrade and was very effective the amateurish attempts at combat by the berobed students of the unconscious martialarts instructor were met by a flurry of slashing legs crashing chops and the whirling manoeuvres of a judo expert suddenly again with no warning whatsoever a cacophony of oriental music swelled the cymbals and primitive wood instruments reaching abrupt crescendos with each stride of the ragtag band that marched down the street its followers carrying placards mounted with flowers the fighting stopped as arms were restrained everywhere silence spread along the main avenue of commerce of tuen mun the americans were confused catherine staples choked back her frustration and edward mcallister threw up his hands in exasperation marie watched literally hypnotized by the change outside everything came to a stop as if a halt had been ordered by an announcement from some sepulchral presence not to be denied she shifted her angle of sight between the bamboo blinds and looked at the ragged group approaching it was led by the banker jitai it was heading for the butchers shop her eyes darting marie saw catherine staples and mcallister race past the odd gathering in front of the shop then across the street the two marines once again took up the chase they all disappeared in the blinding sunlight there was a knock on the front door of the butchers shop the old man with white hair removed the wreath and opened it the banker jitai walked in and bowed to marie did you enjoy the parade madame he asked i wasnt sure what it was a funeral march for the dead in this instance no doubt for the slain animals in mr woos cold storage you this was all planned in a state of readiness you might say explained jitai frequently our cousins from the north manage to get across the border not the thieves but family members wishing to join their own and the soldiers want only to capture them and send them back we must be prepared to protect our own but me you knew we watched we waited you were in hiding running from someone that much we did know you told us that when you said you did not care to go before the magistrate to press charges as you put it you were directed into the alley outside the line of women with the shopping bags yes they crossed the street when you did we must help you marie glanced at the anxious faces of the crowd beyond the bamboo slats then looked at the banker how do you know im not a criminal it doesnt matter the outrage against you resulting from two of our people is what matters also madame you do not look or speak like a fugitive from justice im not and i do need help i have to get back to hong kong to a hotel where they wont find me where theres a telephone i can use i dont really know who but i have to reach people who can help me help us marie paused her eyes locked with jitais the man named david is my husband i can understand said the banker but first you have to see a doctor what your feet are bleeding marie looked down blood had seeped through the bandages penetrating the canvas of her shoes they were a sickening mess i guess youre right she agreed then there will be clothes transportation i myself will find you a hotel under any name you wish and there is the matter of money do you have funds i dont know said marie putting the silks on the counter and opening the whiteshelled purse that is i havent looked a friend someone who i thought was a friend left me money she pulled out the bills staples had placed in the purse we are not wealthy here in tuen mun but perhaps we can help there was talk of taking up a collection im not a poor woman mr jitai interrupted marie if that is necessary and frankly if im alive every cent will be returned with interest far in excess of the prime rate as you wish i am a banker but what would such a lovely lady like yourself know of interests and prime rates jitai smiled youre a banker and im an economist what do bankers know about the impacts on floating currencies caused by inflated interests especially in the prime rates marie smiled for the first time in a very long time she had over an hour to think in the countryside quiet as she sat in the taxi that drove her down to kowloon it would be another fortyfive minutes once they reached the less quiet outskirts particularly a congested district called mongkok the contrite people of tuen mun had been not only generous and protective but inventive as well the banker jitai apparently had confirmed that the hoodlums victim was indeed a white woman in hiding and running for her life and that therefore as she was in the process of reaching people who might help her perhaps her appearance might be altered western clothes were brought from several shops clothes that struck marie as odd they seemed drab and utilitarian neat but dreary not cheap but the kind of clothes that would be selected by a woman who had either no sense of design or felt herself above it then after an hour in the back room of a beauty shop she understood why such a costume had been chosen the women fussed over her her hair was washed and blown dry and when the process was over she had looked in the mirror barely breathing as she did so her face drawn pale and tired was framed by a shell of hair no longer a striking auburn but mousegrey with subtle tinges of white she had aged more than a decade it was an extension of what she had attempted after escaping from the hospital but far bolder far more complete she was the chinese image of the uppermiddleclass serious nononsense tourist probably a widow who peremptorily issued instructions counted her money and never went anywhere without a guidebook which she continuously checked off against each site on her wellorganized itinerary the people of tuen mun knew such tourists well and their imposed portrait was accurate jason bourne would approve there were other thoughts however that occupied her on the ride to kowloon desperate thoughts that she tried to control and keep in perspective pushing away the panic that could so easily engulf her causing her to do the wrong thing make a wrong move that could harm david kill david oh god where are you how can i find you howl she searched her memory for anyone who could help her constantly rejecting every name and every face that came to her because in one way or another each had been a part of that horrible strategy so ominously termed beyondsalvage the death of an individual the only acceptable solution except of course morris panov but mo was a pariah in the eyes of the government he had called the official killers by their rightful names incompetents and murderers he would get nowhere and conceivably bring about a second order for beyondsalvage beyondsalvage a face came to her a face with tears running down his cheeks muted cries of mercy in his tremulous voice a onceclose friend of a young foreign service officer and his wife and children in a remote outpost called phnom penh conklin his name was alexander conklin throughout davids long convalescence he had tried repeatedly to see her husband but david would not permit it saying that he would kill the cia man if he walked through the door the crippled conklin had wrongfully stupidly made accusations against david not listening to the pleas of an amnesiac instead assuming treachery and turning to the point where he had tried to kill david himself outside of paris and finally he had mounted a last attempt on new yorks st street at a sterile house called treadstone that nearly succeeded when the truth about david was known conklin had been consumed with guilt shattered by what he had done she had actually felt sorry for him his anguish was so genuine his guilt so devastating she had talked with alex over coffee on the porch but david would never see him he was the only one she could think of that made sense any sense at all the hotel was called the empress on chatham road in kowloon it was a small hotel in the crowded tsim sha tsui frequented by a mix of cultures neither rich nor hardly poor by and large salesmen from the east and west who had business to do without the largess of executive expense accounts the banker jitai had done his job a single room had been reserved for a mrs austin penelope austin the penelope had been jitais idea for he had read many english novels and penelope seemed so right so be it as jason bourne would have said thought marie she sat on the edge of the bed and reached for the telephone unsure of what to say but knowing she had to say it i need the number of a person in washington dc in the united states she said to the operator its an emergency there is a charge for overseas information charge it broke in marie its urgent ill stay on the line yes said the voice filled with sleep hello alex its marie webb goddamn you where are you where are both of you he found you i dont know what youre talking about i havent found him and he hasnt found me you know about all this who the hell do you think almost broke my neck last week when he flew into washington david ive got relays on every phone that can reach me mo panovs got the same where are you hong kong kowloon i guess the empress hotel under the name of austin david reached you and mo he and i have turned every trick in the deck to find out what the hell is going on and weve been stonewalled no i take it back not stonewalled no one else knows whats going on either id know if they did good christ marie i havent had a drink since last thursday i didnt know you missed it i miss it whats happening marie told him including the unmistakable stamp of government bureaucracy on the part of her captors and her escape and the help given by catherine staples that turned into a trap engineered by a man named mcallister whom she had seen on the street with staples mcallister you saw him hes here alex he wants to take me back with me he controls david and hell kill him they tried before there was a pause on the line a pause filled with anguish we tried before said conklin softly but that was then not now what can i do stay where you are ordered alex ill be on the earliest plane to hong kong dont go out of your room dont make any more calls theyre searching for you they have to be davids out there alex whatever theyve forced him to do because of me im frightened to death delta was the best man ever developed in medusa no one better ever walked into that field i know i saw thats one aspect and ive taught myself to live with it but not the other alex his mind what will happen to his mind conklin paused again and when he spoke his voice was pensive ill bring a friend with me a friend to all of us mo wont refuse stay put marie its time for a showdown and by christ theres going to be one who are you screamed bourne in a frenzy gripping the old man by the throat and pressing him into the wall delta stop it commanded danjou your voice people will hear you theyll think youre killing him theyll call the desk i may kill him and the phones dont work jason released the impostors impostor released his throat but gripped the front of his shirt ripping it as he swung the man down into a chair the door continued danjou steadily angrily put it in place as best you can for gods sake i want to get out of beijing alive and every second with you diminishes my prospects the door half crazed bourne whipped around picked up the shattered door and shoved it into the frame adjusting the sides and kicking them into place the old man massaged his throat and suddenly tried to spring out of the chair won mon ami said the frenchman blocking him stay where you are do not concern yourself with me only with him you see he really might kill you in his rage he has no respect for the golden years but since im nearly there i do rage this is an outrage sputtered the old man coughing his words i fought at el alamein and by christ ill fight now again the old man struggled out of the chair and again danjou pushed him back as jason returned oh the stoically heroic british observed the frenchman at least you had the grace not to say agincourt cut the crap shouted bourne pushing danjou aside and leaning over the chair his hands on both arms crowding the old man back into the seat you tell me where he is and you tell me quickly or you may wish you never got out of el alamein where who is you maniac youre not the man downstairs youre not joseph wadsworth going up to room three twentyfive this is room three twentyfive and i am joseph wadsworth brigadier retired royal engineers when did you check in actually i was spared that drudgery replied wadsworth haughtily as a professional guest of the government certain courtesies are extended i was escorted through customs and brought directly here i must say the room service is hardly up to snuff god knows its not the connaught and the damned telephones mostly on the fritz i asked you when last night but since the plane was six hours late i suppose i should say this morning what were your instructions im not sure its any of your business bourne whipped out the brass letteropener from his belt and held the sharp point against the old mans throat it is if you want to get out of that chair alive good god you are a maniac youre right i havent much time for sanity in fact none at all the instructions theyre harmless enough i was to be picked up some time around twelve noon and as its now after three one can assume that the peoples government is not run by the clock any more than its airline danjou touched bournes arm the eleventhirty plane said the frenchman quietly hes the decoy and knows nothing then your judas is here in another room replied jason over his shoulder he has to be dont say any more hell be questioned with sudden and unexpected authority danjou edged bourne away from the chair and spoke in the impatient tones of a superior officer see here brigadier we apologize for the inconvenience its a damned nuisance i know this is the third room weve broken into we learned the name of each occupant for the purposes of shock interrogation shock what i dont understand one of four people on this floor has smuggled in over five million dollars worth of narcotics since it wasnt the three of you we have our man i suggest you do as the others are doing say your room was broken into by a raging drunk furious over the accommodation thats what theyre saying theres a lot of that going on and its best not to be put under suspicion even by mistaken association the government here often overreacts wouldnt want that sputtered wadsworth formerly of the royal engineers damned pensions little enough to get by on this was meant to be a little extra feathering for the old surrey nest the door major ordered danjou addressing jason easy now try to keep it upright the frenchman turned to the englishman stand by and hold it brigadier just lean it back and give us twenty minutes to get our man then do whatever you like remember a raging drunk for your own sake yes yes of course a drunk raging come major out in the hallway they picked up their bags and started rapidly towards the staircase hurry up said bourne theres still time he has to make his change id have to make it well check the street entrances the taxi stands try to pick two logical ones or goddamn it illogical ones well each take one and work out signals first there are two doors broke in danjou breathlessly in this hallway pick any two you wish but do it quickly kick them in and yell abusive language slurring your words of course you were serious never more so delta as we saw for ourselves the explanation is entirely plausible and embarrassment will restrict any formal investigation the management will no doubt persuade our brigadier to keep his mouth shut they could lose their comfortable jobs quickly now take your choice and do the job jason stopped at the next door on the right he braced himself then rushed towards it crashing his shoulder into the middle of the flimsy upper panel the door flew open gods teeth screamed a woman in hindi half out of her sari which was draped around her feet what the devil is happening has that damned lock broken again a naked man shrieked as he came racing out of the bathroom his genitals shielded with an inadequate towel both stood gaping at the mad intruder who lurched about with unfocused eyes as he swept articles off the nearest bureau yelling in a coarse drunken voice rotten hotel toilets dont work phones dont work nothing jesus this isnt my room shhorry bourne weaved out slamming the door shut behind him that was fine said danjou theyd already had trouble with the lock hurry one more that one the frenchman pointed to a door on the left i heard laughter inside two voices again jason crashed into a door smashing it open roaring his drunken complaints however instead of being met by two startled guests he faced a young couple both bare to the waist each drawing on a pinched cigarette inhaling deeply their eyes glazed welcome neighbour said the young american male his voice floating his diction precise if at quarter speed dont let things trouble you so the phones dont work but our can does use it share it dont get so uptight what the hell are you doing in my room yelled jason even more drunkenly his slur now obscuring his words if this is your room macho boy interrupted the girl swaying in her chair you were privy to private things and were not like that she giggled christ youre stoned and without taking the lords name in vain countered the young man youre very drunk we dont believe in alcohol added the spacedout girl it produces hostility it rises to the surface like lucifers demons get yourself detoxified neighbour continued the young american liltingly then get healthy with grass i will lead you into the fields where you will find your soul again bourne raced out of the room slamming the door and grabbed danjous arm lets go he said adding as they approached the staircase if that story you gave the brigadier gets around those two will spend twenty years deballing sheep in outer mongolia the chinese proclivity for close observation and intense security dictated that the airport hotel should have a single large entrance in the front for guests and a second for employees at the side of the building the latter was replete with uniformed guards who scrutinized everyones working papers and searched all bags and bulging pockets when the employees left for the day the lack of familiarity between guards and workers suggested that the former were changed frequently putting space between potential bribes and bribers he wont chance the guards said jason as they passed the employees exit after hastily checking in their two canvas bags pleading lateness for a meeting due to the delayed plane they look as if they get brownie points for picking up anyone who steals a chicken wing or a bar of soap they also intensely dislike those who work here agreed danjou but why are you so certain hes still in the hotel he knows beijing he could have taken a taxi to another hotel another room not looking the way he did on the plane i told you that he wouldnt allow it i wouldnt he wants the freedom to move around without being spotted or followed hes got to have it for his own protection if thats the case they could be watching his room right now same results theyll know what he looks like if it were me and thats all ive got to go on hes not there hes made arrangements for another room you contradict yourself objected the frenchman as they approached the crowded entrance hall of the airport hotel you said hed be receiving his instructions by phone whoever calls will ask for the room they assigned him certainly not the decoys not wadsworths if the phones are working a condition thats a plus for your judas incidentally its a simple matter to have calls transferred from one room to another a plug is inserted in the switchboard if its primitive or programmed if its computerized its not a big deal a business conference old friends on the plane read that any way you like or no explanation at all which is probably best fallacy proclaimed danjou his client here in beijing will alert the hotel operators hell be wired into the switchboard thats the one thing he wont do said bourne pushing the frenchman through a revolving door out on to the pavement which was crawling with confused tourists and businessmen trying to arrange transportation its a gamble he cant afford to take continued jason as they walked past a line of small shabby buses and wellaged taxis at the kerb your commandos client has to keep maximum distance between the two of them there cant be the slightest possibility that a connection could be traced so that means everythings restricted to a very tight very elite circle with no runs on a switchboard no calling attention to anyone especially your commando they wont risk wandering around the hotel either theyll stay away from him let him make the moves there are too many secret police here someone in that elite circle could be recognized the phones delta from all weve heard theyre not working what does he do then jason frowned while walking as if trying to recall the unremembered times on his side thats the plus hell have backup instructions to follow in case hes not reached within a given period after his arrival for whatever reasons and there could be any number considering the precautions they have to take in that event theyd still be watching for him wouldnt they theyd wait somewhere outside and try to pick him up no of course and he knows that he has to get by them and reach his position without being seen its the only way he retains control its his first job danjou gripped bournes elbow then i think ive just spotted one of the spotters what jason turned looking down at the frenchman and slowing his pace keep walking ordered danjou head over to that truck the one half out on the street with the man on the extension ladder it follows said bourne its the telephone repair service remaining anonymous in the crowds they reached the truck look up look interested then look to your left the van quite far ahead of the first bus do you see it jason did and instantly he knew the frenchman was right the van was white and fairly new and had tinted glass windows except for the colour it could be the van that had picked up the assassin in shenzhen at the lo wu border bourne started to read the chinese characters on the door panel niao jing shan my god its the same the name doesnt matter it belongs to a bird sanctuary the jing shan bird sanctuary in shenzhen it was chutang here something else how did you notice it the man in the open window the last window on this side you cant see him too clearly from here but hes looking back at the entrance hes also somewhat of a contradiction for an employee of a bird sanctuary that is why hes an army officer and by the cut of his tunic and the obviously superior fabric one of high rank is the glorious peoples army now conscripting egrets for its assault troops or is he an anxious man waiting for someone hes been ordered to pick up and follow using a rather acceptable cover flawed by an angle of sight that demands an open window cant go anywhere without echo said jason bourne once delta the scourge of medusa bird sanctuaries christ its beautiful what a smoke screen so removed so peaceful its one hell of a cover its so chinese delta the righteous mask conceals the unrighteous face the confucian parables warn of it thats not what im talking about back in shenzhen at lo wu where i missed your boy the first time he was picked up by a van then a van with tinted windows and it also belonged to a government bird sanctuary as you say an excellent cover its more than that echo its some kind of mark or identification birds have been revered in china for centuries said danjou looking at jason his expression puzzled theyve always been depicted in their great art the great silks theyre considered delicacies for both the eye and the palate in this case they could be a means to something much simpler much more practical such as bird sanctuaries are large preserves theyre open to the public but subject to government regulations as they are everywhere your point delta in a country where any ten people opposed to the official line are afraid to be seen together what better place than a nature reserve that usually stretches for miles no offices or houses or apartments being watched no telephone taps or electronic surveillance just innocent bird watchers in a nation of bird lovers each holding an official pass that permits him entry when the sanctuary is officially closed day or night from shenzhen to peking youre implying a situation larger than we had considered whatever it is said jason glancing around it doesnt concern us only he does weve got to separate but stay in sight ill head over no need broke in the frenchman there he is where move back closer to the truck in its shadow which one is her the priest patting the child the little girl answered danjou his back to the truck staring into the crowd in front of the hotels entrance a man of the cloth continued the frenchman bitterly one of the guises i taught him to use he had a priestly black suit made for him in hong kong complete with an anglican benediction sewn into the collar under the name of a savile row tailor it was the suit i recognized first i paid for it you come from a wealthy diocese said bourne studying the man he wanted more than his life to race over and take to subdue and force up into a hotel room and start on the road back to marie the assassins cover was good more than good and jason tried to analyse that judgement grey sideburns protruded below the killers dark hat thin steelrimmed glasses were perched low on the nose of his pale colourless face his eyes wide and his brows arched he showed joy and wonder at what he saw in this unfamiliar place all were gods works and gods children signified by the act of being drawn to a little chinese girl and patting her head lovingly smiling and nodding graciously to the mother that was it thought jason in grudging respect the son of a bitch exuded love it was in his every gesture every hesitant movement every glance of his gentle eyes he was a compassionate man of the cloth a shepherd of his flock which extended far beyond a parish or a vicarage and as such in a crowd he might be glanced at but instantly dismissed by eyes seeking out a killer bourne remembered carlos the jackal had been dressed in the clothes of a priest his dark latin features above the starched white collar walking out of the church in neuillysurseine in paris jason had seen him they had seen each other their eyes locking each knowing who the other was without words being spoken get carlos trap carlos cain is for charlie and carlos is for cain the codes had exploded in his head as he raced after the jackal in the streets of paris only to lose him in the traffic as an old beggar squatting on the pavement smiled obscenely this was not paris thought bourne there was no army of dying old men protecting this assassin he would take this jackal in peking be ready to move said danjou breaking into jasons memories hes nearing the bus its full thats the point hell be the last one on who refuses a pleading priest in a hurry one of my lessons of course again the frenchman was right the door of the small packed shabby bus began to close stopped by the inserted arm of the priest who wedged his shoulder inside and obviously begged to be released as he had been caught the door snapped open the killer pressed himself inside and the door closed its the express to tian an men square said danjou i have the number we have to find a taxi come on it will not be easy delta ive perfected a technique replied bourne walking out of the shadow of the telephone truck as the bus passed by the frenchman at his heels they weaved through the crowd in front of the airport hotel and proceeded down the line of taxis until they reached the end a last cab rounded the circle about to join the line when jason rushed into the street holding up the palms of his hands unobtrusively the taxi came to a stop as the driver pushed his head out the window shemma weir cried bourne running to the driver and holding up fifty american dollars worth of unmetered yuan biyao bang zhu he said telling the man he needed help badly and would pay for it lao exclaimed the driver as he grabbed the money bingli bar he added justifying his action on behalf of a tourist who was suddenly ill jason and danjou climbed in the driver vocally annoyed that there was a second passenger entering the kerbside door bourne dropped another twenty yuan over the seat and the man was mollified he swung his cab around away from the line of taxis and retraced his path out of the airport complex up ahead there is a bus said danjou leaning forward in the seat addressing the driver in an awkward attempt at mandarin can you understand me your tongue is guangzhou but i understand it is on the way to tian an men square which gate asked the driver which bridge i dont know i know only the number on the front of the bus it is sevenfourtwoone number one ending said the driver tian gate second bridge imperial city entrance is there a parking section for the buses there will be a line of many busvehicles all are filled they are very crowded tian an men is very crowded this angle of the sun we should pass the bus i speak of on the road which is favourable to us for we wish to be at tian a men before it arrives can you do this without difficulty answered the driver grinning busvehicles are old and often break down we may get there several days before it reaches the heavenly north gate i hope youre not serious interrupted bourne oh no generous tourist all the drivers are superior mechanics when they have the good fortune to locate their engines the driver laughed contemptuously and pressed his foot on the accelerator three minutes later they passed the busvehicle carrying the killer fortysix minutes after that they entered the sculptured white marble bridge over the flowing waters of a manmade moat that fronted the massive gate of heavenly peace from which the leaders of china displayed themselves on the wide platform above approving the paraded instruments of war and death inside the misnomered gate is one of the most extraordinary human achievements on earth tian an men square the electrifying vortex of beijing the majesty of its sheer vastness first catches the visitors eye then the architectural immensity of the great hall of the people on the right where reception areas accommodate as many as three thousand people the single banquet hall seats over five thousand the major conference room ten thousand with space to spare opposite the gate reaching towards the clouds is a foursided shaft of stone an obelisk mounted on a twostorey terrace of balustraded marble all glistening in the sunlight while in the shadows below on the huge base of the structure are carved the struggles and triumphs of maos revolution it is the monument to the peoples heroes mao first in the pantheon there are other buildings other structures memorials museums gates and libraries as far as the eye can see but above all the eye is struck by the compelling vastness of open space space and people and for the ear something else totally unexpected a dozen of the worlds great stadiums all dwarfing romes colosseum could be placed within tian an men square and not exhaust the acreage people in hundreds of thousands can wander about the open areas and still leave room for hundreds of thousands more but there is an absence of an element whose lack would never have been found in romes bloody arena much less tolerated in the contemporary great stadiums of the world sound it is barely there only decibels above silence interrupted by the soft rippling notes of bicycle bells the quiet is at first peaceful and then frightening it is as though an enormous transparent geodesic dome had been lowered over a hundred acres as an unspoken but understood command from a nether kingdom repeatedly informs those below that they are in a cathedral it is unnatural unreal and yet there is no hostility towards the unheard voice only acceptance and that is more frightening especially when the children are quiet jason observed these things quickly and dispassionately he paid the driver the sum based on the odometer reading and shifted his concentration to the purpose and problems facing him and danjou for whatever reason whether a phone call had reached him or whether he had opted for backup instructions the commando was on his way to tian a men square the pavane would begin with his arrival the slow steps of the cautious dance bringing the killer closer and closer to his clients representative the assumption being that the client would remain out of sight but no contact would be made until the impostor was convinced the rendezvous was clean therefore the priest would mount his own surveillance circling the appointed coordinates of the meeting ground searching out whatever armed minions were in place he would take one perhaps two pressing them at the point of a knife or jamming a silenced gun into their ribs to elicit the information he needed a false look in the eyes would tell him that the conference was a prelude to execution finally if the landscape seemed clear he would propel a minion under a gun to approach the clients representative and give his ultimatum the client himself must show up and walk into the net of the assassins making anything else was unacceptable the central figure the client had to be the deadly balance a second meeting ground would be established the client would arrive first and at the first sign of deception he would be blown away that was the way of jason bourne it would be the commandos if he had half a brain in his head bus number rolled lethargically into place at the end of the line of vehicles disgorging tourists the assassin in priestly garb emerged helping an elderly woman down to the pavement patting her hand as he nodded his gentle goodbyes he turned away walked rapidly to the rear of the bus and disappeared around it stay a good thirty feet behind and watch me said jason do as i do when i stop you stop when i turn you turn be in a crowd go from one group to another but make sure there are always people around you be careful delta he is not an amateur neither am i bourne ran to the end of the bus stopped and edged his way around the hot foulsmelling louvres of the rear engine his priest was about fifty yards ahead his black suit a dark beacon in the hazy sunlight crowds or no crowds he was easy to follow the commandos cover was acceptable his playing of it even more so but like most covers there was always the glaring but unrecognized liability it was in limiting those liabilities that the best distinguished themselves from the merely better professionally jason approved the clerical status not the clerical colour a roman priest might be wedded to black but not an anglican vicar a solid grey was perfectly acceptable under the collar grey faded in the sunlight black did not suddenly the assassin broke away from the crowd and walked up behind a chinese soldier taking pictures the camera at eye level the soldiers head moving constantly bourne understood this was no insignificant enlisted man on leave in beijing he was too mature his uniform too well tailored as danjou had remarked about the army officer in the truck the camera was a transparent device to scan the crowds the initial meeting ground was not far away the commando now playing his role to the fullest clasped a fatherly right hand on the military mans left shoulder his left was unseen but his black coat filled the space between them a gun had been jammed into the officers ribs the soldier froze his expression stoic even in his panic he moved with the assassin the commando now gripping his arm and issuing orders the soldier abruptly out of character bent over holding his left side recovering quickly and shaking his head the weapon had been rammed again into his ribcage he would follow orders or he would die in tian an men square there was no compromise bourne spun around lowering his body and tying a perfectly firm shoelace apologizing to those behind him the assassin had checked his rear flank the evasive action was demanded jason stood up where was he where was the impostor there bourne was bewildered the commando had let the soldier go why the army officer was suddenly running through the crowds screaming his gestures wildly spastic then in a frenzy he collapsed and chattering excited people gathered around his unconscious body diversion watch him jason raced ahead feeling the time was right it had not been a gun but a needle not jammed but puncturing the soldiers ribcage the assassin had taken out one protector he would look for another and perhaps another after that the scenario bourne had predicted was being played out and as the killers concentration was solely on his search for his next victim the time was right now jason knew he could take out anyone on earth with a paralysing blow to the kidneys especially a man whose least concern was an attack on himself for the quarry was attacking and his concentration was absolute bourne closed the gap between himself and the impostor fifty feet forty thirtyfive thirty he broke away from one crowd into another the blacksuited priest was within reach he could take him marie a soldier another soldier but now instead of an assault there was communication the army man nodded and gestured to his left jason looked over bewildered a short chinese in civilian clothing and carrying a government briefcase was standing at the foot of a wide stone staircase that led up to the entrance of an immense building with granite pillars everywhere supporting twin sloping pagoda roofs it was directly behind the heroes monument the carved calligraphy over the huge doors proclaiming it to be the chairman mao memorial hall two lines were moving up the steps guards separating the individual groups the civilian was between the two lines the briefcase a symbol of authority he was left alone suddenly without any indication that he would make such a move the tall assassin gripped the soldiers arm propelling the smaller army man in front of him the officers back arched his shoulders snapping upright a weapon had been shoved into his spine the commands specific as the excitement mounted and the crowds and the police continued to run towards the collapsed first soldier the assassin and his captive walked steadily towards the civilian at the steps of the mao memorial the man was afraid to move and again bourne understood these men were known to the killer they were at the core of the tight elite circle that led to the assassins client and that client was nearby they were no mere minions once they appeared the lesser figures became even less important for these men rarely exposed themselves the diversion which was now reduced to a mild disturbance as the police swiftly controlled the crowds and carried the body away had given the impostor the seconds he needed to control the chain that led to the client the soldier in his grip was dead if he disobeyed and with a single shot any reasonably competent marksman could kill the man by the steps the meeting was in two stages and as long as the assassin controlled the second stage he was perfectly willing to proceed the client was obviously somewhere inside the vast mausoleum and could not know what was happening outside nor would a mere minion dare follow his superiors up into the conference area there was no more time for analysing jason knew it he had to act quickly he had to get inside mao zedongs monument and watch wait for the meeting to conclude one way or another and the repugnant possibility that he might have to protect the assassin crossed his mind yet it was within the realm of reality and the only plus for him was the fact that the impostor had followed a scenario he himself might have created and if the conference was peaceful it was simply a matter of following the assassin by then inevitably buoyed by the success of his tactics as well as by whatever the client delivered and taking an unsuspecting supreme egotist in tian an men square bourne turned looking for danjou the frenchman was on the edge of a controlled tourist group he nodded as if he had read deltas thoughts he pointed to the ground beneath him then made a circle with his index finger it was a silent signal from their days in medusa it meant he would remain where he was but if he had to move he would stay in sight of that specific location it was enough jason crossed behind the assassin and his prisoner and walked diagonally through the crowd rapidly negotiating the open space to the line on the right half of the staircase and up to the guard he spoke in a polite if pleading mandarin high officer im most embarrassed i was so taken by the calligraphy on the peoples monument that i lost my group which passed through here only minutes ago you speak our language very well said the astonished guard apparently used to the strange accents of tongues he neither knew nor cared to know you are most courteous im simply an underpaid teacher from the west who has an enduring love of your great nation high officer the guard laughed im not so high but our nation is great my daughter wears blue jeans in the street i beg your pardon its nothing where is your tourgroup identification my what the name tag to be worn on all outer clothing it kept falling off said bourne shaking his head helplessly it wouldnt stay pinned i must have lost it when you catch up see your guide and get another go ahead get to the back of the line on the steps something is going on the next group may have to wait youll miss your tour oh is there a problem i dont know the official with the government briefcase gives us our orders i believe he counts the yuan that could be made here thinking this holy place should be like beijings underground train youve been most kind hurry sir bourne rushed up the steps bending down behind the crowd once again tightening a secure shoelace his head angled to watch the assassins progress the impostor talked quietly to the civilian with the soldier still in his grip but something was odd the short chinese in the dark suit nodded but his eyes were not on the impostor they were focused beyond the commando or were they jasons angle of vision was not the best no matter the scenario was being followed the client reached on the assassins terms he walked through the doors into the semidarkness as awed as everyone in front of him by the sudden appearance of the enormous white marble sculpture of a seated mao rising so high and so majestically that one nearly gasped in its presence theatricality helped the shafts of light that played down on the exquisite apparently translucent marble evoked an ethereal effect that isolated the gigantic sitting figure from the velvet tapestry behind it and the outer darkness around the massive statue with its searching eyes seemed in itself alive and aware jason pulled his own eyes away and looked for doorways and corridors there were none it was a mausoleum a hall dedicated to a nations saint but there were pillars wide high shafts of marble that provided areas of seclusion in the shadows behind any one of them could be the meeting ground he would wait he would stay in other shadows and watch his group entered the second great hall and it was if anything more electrifying than the first facing them was a crystal glass coffin encasing the body of chairman mao zedong draped in the red flag the waxen corpse in peaceful repose the closed eyes however any second likely to open wide and glare in fiery disapproval there were flowers surrounding the raised sarcophagus and two rows of dark green pine trees in huge ceramic pots lined the opposing walls again shafts of light played a dramatic symphony of colour pockets of darkness pierced by intersecting beams that washed over the brilliant yellows and reds and blues of the banks of flowers a commotion somewhere in the first hall briefly intruded on the awed silence of the crowd but was arrested as rapidly as it had begun as the last tourist in line bourne broke away without being noticed by the others he slipped behind a pillar concealed in the shadows and peered around the glistening white marble what he saw paralysed him as a dozen thoughts clashed in his head above all the single word trap there was no group following his own it was the last admitted he was the last person admitted before the heavy doors were closed that was the sound he had heard the shutting of the doors and the disappointed groans from those outside waiting to be admitted something is going on the next group may have to wait a kindly guard on the steps my god from the beginning it was a trap every move every appearance had been calculated from the beginning the information paid for on a rainsoaked island the nearly unobtainable airline tickets the first sight of the assassin at the airport a professional killer capable of a far better disguise his hair too obvious his clothes inadequate to cover his frame then the complication with an old man a retired brigadier from the royal engineers so illogically logical so right the scent of deception so accurate so irresistible a soldier in a trucks window not looking for him but for them i the priestly black suit a dark beacon in the sunlight paid for by the impostors creator so easily spotted so easily followed christ from the beginning finally the scenario played out in the immense square a scenario that could have been written by bourne himself again irresistible to the pursuer a reverse trap catch the hunter as he stalks his quarry frantically jason looked around ahead in the distance was a steady shaft of sunlight the exit doors were at the other end of the mausoleum they would be watched each tourist studied as he left footsteps over his right shoulder bourne spun to his left pulling the brass letteropener from his belt a figure in a grey mao suit the cut military cautiously passed by the wide pillar in the dim outer light of the pine trees he was no more than five feet away in his hand was a gun the bulging cylinder on the barrel a guarantee that a detonation would be reduced to the sound of a spit jason made his lethal calculations in a way david webb would never understand the blade had to be inserted in such a way as to cause instant death no noise could come from his enemys mouth as the body was pulled back into darkness he lunged the rigid fingers of his left hand clamped vicelike over the mans face as he plunged the letteropener into the soldiers neck the blade rushing through sinew and fragile cartilage severing the windpipe in one motion bourne dropped his left hand clutching the large weapon still in his enemys grip and swung the corpse around dropping with it under the branches of the row of pine trees lined up along the right wall he slid the body out of sight into the dark shadows between two large ceramic pots holding the roots of two trees he crawled over the corpse the weapon in front of his face and made his way back against the wall towards the first hall to where he could see without being seen a second uniformed man crossed through the shaft of light that lit up the darkness of the entrance to the second hall he stood in front of maos crystal coffin awash in the eerie beams and looked around he raised a handheld radio to his face and spoke listening five seconds later his expression changed to one of concern he began walking rapidly to his right tracing the assigned path of the first man jason scrambled back towards the corpse hands and knees silently pounding the marble floor and moved out towards the edge of the lowslung branches the soldier approached walking more slowly studying the last people in the line up ahead now bourne sprang up as the man passed hammerlocking his neck choking off all sound as he pulled him back down under the branches the gun pressed far up in the flesh of the soldiers stomach he pulled the trigger the muffled report was like a burst of air no more the man expunged a last violent breath and went limp he had to get out if he was trapped and killed in the awed silence of the mausoleum the assassin would roam free and maries death would be assured his enemies were closing the reverse trap he had to reverse the reversal and somehow survive the cleanest escape is made in stages using whatever confusion there is or can be created stages one and two were accomplished a certain confusion already existed if other men were whispering into radios what had to be brought about was a focal point of disruption so violent and unexpected that those hunting him in the shadows would themselves become the subjects of a sudden hysterical search there was only one way and jason felt no obscure heroic feelings of imaydietrying he had to do it he had to make it work survival was everything for reasons beyond himself the professional was at his apex calm and deliberate bourne stood up and walked through branches crossing the open space to the pillar in front of him he then ran to the one behind and then the one behind that the first pillar in the second hall thirty feet from the dramaticallylit coffin he edged his body around the marble and waited his eyes on the entrance door it happened they happened the officer who was the assassins captive emerged with the short civilian carrying his government briefcase the soldier held a radio at his side he brought it up to speak and listen then shook his head placing the radio in his righthand pocket and removing the gun from his holster the civilian nodded once reached under his jacket and pulled out a shortbarrelled revolver each walked forward towards the glass coffin containing the remains of mao zedong then looked at each other and began to separate one to the left one to the right now jason raised his weapon took rapid aim and fired once a hair to the right twice the spits were like coughs in shadows as both men fell into the sarcophagus grabbing the edges of his coat bourne gripped the hot cylinder on the barrel of his pistol and spun it off there were five shells left he squeezed the trigger in rapid succession the explosions filled the mausoleum echoing off the marble walls shattering the crystal glass of the coffin the bullets embedding themselves in the spastically jerked corpse of mao zedong one penetrating a bloodless forehead another blowing out an eye sirens erupted clamouring bells split the air and deafened the ear as soldiers appearing at once from everywhere raced in panic towards the scene of the horrible outrage the two lines of tourists feeling trapped in the eerie light of the house of death exploded into hysteria en masse the crowds rushed towards the doors and the sunlight trampling those in their paths jason bourne joined them crashing his way into the centre of an inside column reaching the blinding light of tian an men square he raced down the steps danjou jason ran to his right rounding the stone corner and ran down the side of the pillared structure until he reached the front guards were doing their best to calm the agitated crowds while trying to find out what had happened a riot was in the making bourne studied the place where he had last seen danjou then moved his eyes over a gridlock area within which the frenchman might logically be seen nothing no one even vaguely resembling him suddenly there was the screeching of tyres far off on a thoroughfare to jasons left he whipped around and looked a van with tinted windows had circled the stanchioned pavement and was speeding towards the south gate of tian an men square they had taken danjou echo was gone questil arrive des coups defer les gardes sont paniques bourne heard the shouts and running joined the group of french tourists led by a guide whose concentration was riveted on the chaos taking place on the steps of the mausoleum he buttoned his jacket covering the gun in his belt and slipped the perforated silencer into his pocket glancing around he moved quickly back through the crowd next to a man taller than himself a welldressed man with a disdainful expression jason was grateful that there were several others of nearly equal height in front of them with luck and in the excitement he might remain inconspicuous above at the top of the mausoleums stairs the doors had been partially opened uniformed men were racing back and forth along the stairs obviously the leadership was a shambles and bourne knew why it had fled had simply disappeared wanting no part of the terrible events all that concerned jason now was the assassin would he come out or had he found danjou capturing his creator himself and leaving with echo in the van convinced that the original jason bourne was trapped a second unlikely corpse in the desecrated mausoleum questce que cest asked jason addressing the tall welldressed frenchman beside him another ungodly delay no doubt replied the man in a somewhat effeminate parisian accent this place is a madhouse and my tolerance is at an end im going back to the hotel can you do that bourne upgraded his french from middleclass to a decent university it meant so much to a parisian i mean are we permitted to leave our tour we hear constantly that we must stay together im a businessman not a tourist this tour as you call it was not on my agenda frankly i had the afternoon off these people linger endlessly over decisions and thought id see a few sights but there wasnt a frenchspeaking driver available the concierge assigned me mind you assigned me to this group the guide you know is a student of french literature and speaks as though she was born in the seventeenth century i havent a clue what this socalled tour is all about its the fivehour excursion explained jason accurately reading the chinese characters printed on the identification tag affixed to the mans lapel after tian an men square we visit the ming tombs then drive out to watch the sunset from the great wall now really ive seen the great wall my god it was the first place all twelve of those bureaucrats from the trade commission took me prattling incessantly through the interpreter that it was a sign of their permanence shirt if the labour werent so unbelievably cheap and the profits so extraordinary i too am in business but for a few days also a tourist my line is wicker imports whats yours if i may ask fabrics what else unless you consider electronics or oil or coal or perfume even canework the businessman allowed himself a superior but knowing smile i tell you these people are sitting on the wealth of the world and they havent the vaguest idea what to do with it bourne looked closely at the tall frenchman he thought of medusas echo and a gallic aphorism that proclaimed that the more things changed the more they remained the same opportunities will present themselves recognize them act on them as i said continued jason while staring up at the chaos on the staircase i too am a businessman who is taking a short sabbatical courtesy of our governments tax incentives for those of us who plough the foreign fields but ive travelled a great deal here in china and have learned a good deal of the language cane has come up in the world said the parisian sardonically our best quality work is a staple line on the cete dazur as well as points north and south the grimaldi family has been a client for years bourne kept his eyes on the staircase i stand corrected my business friend in the foreign fields for the first time the frenchman actually looked at jason and i can tell you now said bourne that no more visitors will be permitted into maos tomb and that everyone on every tour in the vicinity will be cordoned off and possibly detained my god why apparently something terrible happened inside and the guards are shouting about foreign gangsters did you say you were assigned to this tour but not really a part of it essentially yes grounds for at least speculation no detention almost certainly inconceivable this is china it cannot be millions upon millions of francs are in the balance im only here on this horrid tour because i suggest you leave my business friend say you were out for a stroll give me your identification tag and ill get rid of it for you is that what it is your country of origin and passport number are on it its how they control your movements while youre on a guided tour im for ever in your debt cried the businessman ripping the plastic tag off his lapel if youre ever in paris i spend most of the time with the prince and his family in but of course again my thanks the frenchman so different and yet so much like echo left in a hurry his welldressed figure conspicuous in the hazy greyish yellow sunlight as he headed towards the heavenly gate as obvious as the false quarry who had led a hunter into a trap bourne pinned the plastic tag to his own lapel and now became part of an official tour it was his way out through the gates of tian an men square after the group had been hastily diverted from the mausoleum to the great hall the bus passed through the northern gate and jason saw through the window the apoplectic french businessman pleading with the beijing police to let him pass fragments of reports of the outrage had been fitted together the word was spreading a white occidental had horribly defiled the coffin and the hallowed body of chairman mao a white terrorist from a tour without the proper identification on his outer clothing a guard on the steps had reported such a man i do recall the tour guide said in obsolete french she was standing by the statue of an angry lion on that extraordinary avenue of animals where huge stone replicas of large cats horses elephants and ferocious mythical beasts lined the road guarding the final way to the tombs of the ming dynasty but my memory faileth concerning your knowledge of our language and i do believe that i heard you employ our tongue but a moment ago a student of french literature and speaks as though she were in the seventeenth century an indignant businessman now undoubtedly far more indignant i didnt before replied bourne in mandarin because you were with others and i didnt wish to stand out but lets speak your language now you do so very well i thank you then you do recall that i was added to your tour at the last minute the manager of the beijing hotel actually spoke to my superior but yes i do recall the woman smiled and shrugged in truth as it is such a large group i recall only giving a tall man his tourgroup emblem and it is in front of my face now you will have to pay additional yuan on your hotel bill i am sorry but then you are not part of the tourist programme no im not because im a businessman negotiating with your government may you do well said the guide with her piquant smile some do some do not my point is that i may not be able to do anything said jason smiling back my chinese speech is far better than my chinese reading a few minutes ago several words fell into place for me and i realized im t be at the beijing hotel in about half an hour from now for a meeting how can i do that it is a question of finding transportation i will write out what you need and you can present it to the guards at the da hong men the great red gate interrupted bourne the one with the arches yes there are busvehicles that will take you back to beijing you may be late but then it is customary i understand for government people to be late also she took out a notebook from the pocket of her mao jacket and then a reedlike ballpoint pen i wont be stopped if you are ask those who stop you to call the government people said the guide writing out instructions in chinese and tearing off the page this is not your tour group barked the operator of the bus in lowerclass mandarin shaking his head and stabbing his finger at jasons lapel the man obviously expected his words to have no effect whatsoever on the tourist so he compensated with exaggerated gestures and a strident voice it was also apparent that he hoped that one of his superiors under the arches of the great red gate would take notice of his alertness one did whats the problem asked a wellspoken soldier walking rapidly up to the door of the bus parting his way through the tourists behind bourne opportunities will present themselves theres no problem said jason curtly even arrogantly in chinese as he withdrew the guides note thrusting it into the hand of the young officer unless you wish to be responsible for my missing an urgent meeting with a delegation from the trade commission whose military procurements chief is a general liangsomebodyorother you speak the chinese language startled the soldier pulled his eyes away from the note id say thats obvious so does general liang i do not understand your anger perhaps youll understand general liangs interrupted bourne i do not know a general liang sir but then there are so many generals you are upset with the tour im upset with the fools who told me it was a threehour excursion when it turns out to be five hours if i miss this meeting because of incompetence therell be several very upset commissioners including a powerful general of the peoples army whos anxious to conclude certain purchases from france jason paused holding up his hand then continued quickly in a softer voice if however i get there on time ill certainly commend by name anyone who might help me i will help you sir said the young officer his eyes bright with dedication this sick whale of a bus could take you well over an hour and that is only if this miserable driver stays on the road i have at my disposal a much faster vehicle and a fine driver who will escort you i would do so myself but it would not be proper to leave my post ill also mention your commitment to duty to the general its my natural instinct sir my name is yes do let me have your name write it on that slip of paper bourne sat in the bustling lobby of the beijing hotels east wing a halffolded newspaper covering his face the left edge offcentre so he could see the line of doors that was the entrance he was waiting watching for the sight of jean louis ardisson of paris it had not been difficult for jason to learn his name twenty minutes ago he had walked up to the guided tour travel desk and said to the female clerk in his best mandarin im sorry to bother you but im first interpreter for all french delegations having business with government industry and im afraid ive lost one of my confused sheep you must be a fine interpreter you speak excellent chinese what happened to your bewildered sheep the woman permitted herself a slight giggle at the phrase im not sure we were having coffee in the cafeteria about to go over his schedule when he looked at his watch and said he would call me later he was going on one of the fivehour tours and apparently was late it was an inconvenience for me but i know what happens when visitors first arrive in peking theyre overwhelmed i believe they are agreed the clerk but what can we do for you i need to know the correct spelling of his name and whether he has a middle name or whats called a baptismal name the details that must be included on the government papers that ill fill out for him but how can we help he left this behind in the cafeteria jason held up the french businessmans identification tag i dont know how he even got on the tour the woman laughed casually as she reached under the counter for the days tour ledger he was told the departure area and the guide understood each carries a list those things fall off all the time and she no doubt gave him a temporary ticket the clerk took the tag and began turning pages as she continued i tell you the idiots who make these are not worth the small yuan they are paid we have all these precise regulations these strict rules and we are made to look foolish at the beginning who is who the woman stopped her finger on an entry in the ledger oh bad luck spirits she said softly looking up at bourne i do not know if your sheep is bewildered but i can tell you he bleats a great deal he believes himself very grand and was himself very disagreeable when he was told there was no chauffeur who spoke french he took it as an insult to his nations honour as well as his own which was more important to him here you read the name i cannot pronounce it thank you so much said jason reading he had then gone to a house phone marked english and asked the operator for mr ardissons room you may dial it sir said the male operator a note of technological triumph in his voice it is room onesevenfourthree very fine accommodations very fine view of the forbidden city thank you bourne had dialled there was no answer monsieur ardisson had not yet returned and under the circumstances he might not return for quite a while still a sheep that was known for bleating a great deal would not stay silent if his dignity was affronted or his business was in jeopardy jason decided to wait the outlines of a plan were coming into focus it was a desperate strategy based on probabilities but it was all he had left he bought a monthold french magazine at the newsstand and sat down feeling suddenly drained and helpless the face of marie intruded on david webbs inner screen and then the sound of her voice filled the close air around him echoing in his ears suspending thought and creating a terrible pain at the centre of his forehead jason bourne removed the intrusion with the force of a sledgehammer the screen went dark its last flickering light rejected by harsh commands spoken by an ice cold authority stop it there is no time concentrate on what we must think about nothing else jasons eyes strayed intermittently briefly constantly returning to the entrance the clientele of the east wing lobby was international a mix of languages of clothing from fifth and madison avenues savile row st honorfe and the via condotti as well as the more sombre apparel of both germanys and the scandinavian countries the guests wandered in and out of the brightly lighted shops amused and intrigued by the pharmacy selling only chinese medicines and flocking into the crafts shop next to a large relief map of the world on the wall every now and then someone with an entourage came through the doors obsequious interpreters bowing and translating between uniformed government officials trying to appear casual and weary executives from across the globe whose eyes were dazed from jet lag and the need for sleep to be preceded perhaps by whisky this might be red china but negotiations were older than capitalism and the capitalists aware of their fatigue would not discuss business until they could think straight bravo adam smith and david hume there he was jean louis ardisson was being escorted through the doors by no fewer than four chinese bureaucrats all of whom were doing their best to mollify him one rushed ahead to the lobby liquor store as the others detained him by the elevator chattering continuously through the interpreter the buyer returned carrying a plastic bag the bottom stretched and sagging under the weight of several bottles there were smiles and bows as the elevator doors opened jean louis ardisson accepted his booty and walked inside nodding once as the doors closed bourne remained seated watching the lights as the elevator ascended fifteen sixteen seventeen it had reached the top floor ardissons floor jason got up and walked back to the bank of telephones he looked at the sweep hand of his watch he could only guess at the timing but a man in an agitated state would not stroll slowly to his room once he left the elevator the room signified a measure of peace even the relief of solitude after several hours of tension and panic to be held for questioning by the police in a foreign country was frightening for anyone but it became terrifying when an incomprehensible language and radically different faces were added to the knowledge that the prisoner was in a country where people frequently disappeared without explanation after such an ordeal a man would enter his room and in no particular order would collapse trembling in fear and exhaustion light one cigarette after another forgetting where he left the last one take several strong drinks swallowing rapidly for a faster effect and grab the telephone to share his dreadful experience unconsciously hoping to minimize the aftereffects of his terror by sharing them bourne could allow ardissons collapsing and as much wine or liquor as the man could handle but he could not permit the telephone there could be no sharing no lessening of the terror rather ardissons terror had to be extended amplified to the point where he would be paralysed fearing for his life if he left his room fortyseven seconds had elapsed it was time to call hello the voice was strained breathless ill speak quickly said jason quietly in french stay where you are and do not use the telephone in precisely eight minutes ill knock on your door twice rapidly then once admit me but no one else before me especially a maid or a housekeeper who are you a countryman who must speak to you for your own safety eight minutes bourne hung up and returned to the chair counting off the minutes and calculating the time it took an elevator with the usual number of passengers to go from one floor to the next once on a specific floor thirty seconds were enough to reach any room six minutes went by and jason rose nodding to a bewildered stranger next to him and walked to an elevator where the lighted numbers indicated it would be the next to reach the lobby eight minutes were ideal for priming a subject five were too few not long enough for the right degree of tension six were better but passed too quickly eight however while still within an urgent timespan provided those additional moments of anxiety that wore down a subjects resistance the plan was not yet clear in bournes mind the objective however was crystallized absolute it was all he had left and every instinct in his medusan body told him to go after it delta one knew the oriental mind in one respect it had not varied for centuries secrecy was worth ten thousand tigers if not a kingdom he stood outside the door of looking at his watch eight minutes precisely he knocked twice paused then knocked once again the door opened and a shocked ardisson stared at him cest vous cried the businessman bringing his hand to his lips keep calm said jason in french stepping inside and closing the door we have to talk he continued i must know what happened you you were next to me in that horrid place we spoke you took my identification you were the cause of everything did you mention me i didnt dare it would have looked as if i had done something illegal giving my pass to someone else who are you why are you here youve caused me enough trouble for one day i think you should leave monsieur not until you tell me exactly what happened bourne walked across the room and sat down in a chair next to a red lacquered table its urgent that i know well its not urgent that i tell you you have no right to walk in here make yourself comfortable and give me orders im afraid i do have that right ours was a private tour and you intruded i was assigned to that damn tour on whose orders the concierge or whatever you call that idiot downstairs not him above him who was it how would i know i havent the vaguest idea what youre talking about you left my god it was you who told me to leave i was testing you testing this is unbelievable believe said jason if youre telling the truth no harm will come to you harm we do not kill the innocent only the enemy kill the enemy bourne reached under his jacket took the gun from his belt and placed it on the table now convince me youre not the enemy what happened after you left us stunned ardisson staggered back into the wall his wide frightened eyes riveted on the weapon i swear by all the saints you are talking to the wrong man he whispered convince me of what your innocence what happened i down in the square began the terrified businessman i thought about the things you said that something terrible had happened inside maos tomb and that the chinese guards were shouting about foreign gangsters and how people were going to be cordoned off and detained especially someone like me who was not really part of the tour group so i started to run my god i couldnt possibly be placed in such a situation millions of francs are involved profits on a scale unheard of in the high fashion industry im no mere bargainer i represent a consortium so you began running and they stopped you interrupted jason anxious to get the nonessentials out of the way yes they spoke so rapidly i didnt understand a word anyone was saying and it was an hour before they found an official who spoke french why didnt you simply tell them the truth that you were with our tour because i was running away from that damned tour and i had given you my damned identification card how would that look to these barbarians who see a fascist criminal in every white face the chinese people are not barbarians monsieur said bourne gently then suddenly he shouted it is only their governments political philosophy thats barbaric without the grace of almighty god with only satans benediction i beg your pardon later perhaps replied jason his voice abruptly calm again so an official who spoke french arrived what happened then i told him i was out for a stroll your suggestion monsieur and that i suddenly remembered i was expecting a call from paris and was hurrying back to the hotel which accounted for my running quite plausible not for the official monsieur he began abusing me making the most insulting remarks and insinuating the most dreadful things i wonder what in the name of god happened in that tomb it was a beautiful piece of work monsieur answered bourne his eyes wide i beg your pardon later perhaps so the official was abusive entirely but he went too far when he attacked paris fashion as a decadent bourgeois industry i mean after all we are paying money for their damned fabrics they certainly dont have to know the margins of course so what did you do i carry a list of the names with whom im negotiating some are rather important i understand as they should be considering the money i insisted the official contact them and i refused and i did refuse to answer any more questions until at least several of them arrived well after another two hours they did and let me tell you that changed things i was brought back here in a chinese version of a limousine damned cramped for a man of my size and four escorts and far worse they told me that our final conference is postponed yet again it will not take place tomorrow morning but instead in the evening what kind of hour is that to do business ardisson pushed himself away from the wall breathing hard his eyes now pleading thats all there is to tell you monsieur you really do have the wrong man i am not involved in anything over here but my consortium you should be cried jason accusingly raising his voice again to do business with the godless is to debase the work of the lord i beg your pardon you have satisfied me said the chameleon you are simply a mistake a what i will tell you what happened inside the tomb of mao zedong we did it we shot up the crystal coffin as well as the body of the infamous unbeliever you what and we will continue to destroy the enemies of christ wherever we find them we will bring his message of love back into the world if we have to kill every diseased animal who thinks otherwise it will be a christian globe or no globe at all surely there is room for negotiation think of the money the contributions not from satan bourne rose from the chair picked up the gun and shoved it under his belt then buttoned his jacket and tugged at the cloth as though it were a military tunic he approached the distraught businessman you are not the enemy but youre close monsieur your wallet please and your trade papers including the names of those with whom you negotiate money we do not accept contributions we have no need of them then why for your protection as well as ours our cells here must check out individuals to see whether or not youre being used as a dupe there is evidence we may have been infiltrated everything will be returned to you tomorrow i really must protest dont broke in the chameleon reaching under his jacket his hand remaining there you asked who i was no suffice it to say that as our enemies employ the services of such as the plo and the red armies the ayatollahs fanatics and baader meinhof we have mounted our own brigades we neither seek nor offer any quarter it is a struggle unto death my god we fight in his name do not leave this room order your meals from room service do not call your colleagues or your counterparts here in beijing in other words stay out of sight and pray in truth i must tell you that if i myself was followed and it is known that i came to your room you will simply disappear unbelievable his eyes suddenly unfocused ardissons whole body began to tremble your wallet and your papers please showing the full array of ardissons papers including the frenchmans list of government negotiators jason hired a car under the name of ardissons consortium he made it plain to a relieved dispatcher at the china international travel service on chaoyangmen street that he both read and spoke mandarin and as the rented car would be driven by one of the chinese officials no driver was required the dispatcher told him the car would be at the hotel by pm if everything fell into place he would have twentyfour hours to move as freely as a westerner could in beijing and then some the first ten of those hours would tell him whether or not a strategy conceived in desperation would lead him out of the darkness or plunge both marie and david webb into an abyss but delta one knew the oriental mind for a score of centuries it had not varied in one respect secrecy was worth ten thousand tigers if not a kingdom bourne walked back to the hotel stopping in the crowded shopping district of wang fu jing around the corner from the hotels east wing at number was the main department store where he made the necessary purchases of clothing and hardware at number he found a shop named tuzhang menshibu translated as the seal engraving store where he selected the most officiallooking stationery he could find to his amazement and delight ardissons list included not one but two generals and why not the french produced the exocet and although hardly high fashion it was high on any list of hightech military equipment finally at the arts store numbered on the wang fu jing he bought a calligraphy pen and a map of beijing and its environs as well as a second map showing the roads leading from beijing to the southern cities carrying his purchases back to the hotel he went to a desk in the lobby and began his preparations first he wrote a note in chinese relieving the driver of the rented car of all responsibility in turning the automobile over to the foreigner it was signed by a general and amounted to an order second he spread out the map and circled a small green area on the outskirts of northwest beijing the jing shan bird sanctuary secrecy was worth ten thousand tigers if not a kingdom marie leaped out of the chair at the shrill jangling bell of the telephone she ran limping and wincing across the room and picked it up yes mrs austin i presume mo mo panov thank god marie closed her eyes in gratitude and relief it had been nearly thirty hours since she had spoken to alexander conklin and the waiting and the tension above all the helplessness had driven her to the edge of panic alex said he was going to ask you to come with him he thought you would thought was there a doubt how are you feeling marie and i dont expect an answer from pollyanna going mad mo im trying not to but im going mad as long as you havent completed the journey id say you were remarkable and the fact that youre fighting every step of the way even more so but then you dont need any chicken soup psychology from me i just wanted an excuse to hear your voice again to find out whether i was a babbling wreck said marie gently making a statement weve been through too much together for such a thirdrate subterfuge id never get away with it with you which i just didnt wheres alex talking into the pay phone next to me he asked me to call you apparently he wants to speak with you while whoever it is hes talking to is still on the line wait a second hes nodding the next voice you hear et cetera et cetera marie alex thank you thank you for coming as your husband would say no time for that what were you wearing when they last saw you wearing when you got away from them i got away twice the second time was in tuen mun not then interrupted conklin the contingent was small and there was too much confusion if i remember what you told me a couple of marines actually saw you but nobody else did here here in hong kong thatd be the description theyd start with the one that would stick in their minds what were you wearing then let me think at the hospital later broke in alex you said something to me about swapping clothes and buying a few things the canadian consulate stapless apartment can you remember good lord how can you remember no mystery i make notes its one of the byproducts of alcohol hurry marie just generally what were you wearing a pleated skirt yes a grey pleated skirt that was it and a kind of bluishgrey blouse with a high collar youd probably change that what never mind what else oh a hat a fairly widebrimmed hat to cover my face good and a fake gucci purse i bought in the street oh and sandals to make me shorter i want the height well stick to heels thats fine thats all i need for what alex what are you doing playing simon says i know perfectly well the state department passport computers picked me up and with my smooth athletic walk even states warthogs could spot me in customs they wont know a damn thing but someones giving them orders and i want to know who else shows up im not sure i understand ill explain later stay where you are well get there as soon as we can make a clean break but it has to be very clean sterile in fact so it may take an hour or so what about mo he has to stay with me if we separate now at the least theyll follow him at worst theyll take him in what about you they wont touch me beyond a tight surveillance youre confident im angry they cant know what ive left behind or with whom or what my instructions are if theres a break in any prearranged phone calls for them right now im a walking limping megabomb that could blow apart their entire operation whatever the hell it is i know you say theres no time alex but ive got to tell you something im not sure why but i have to i think one of the things about you that so hurt and enraged david was the fact that he thought you were the best at what you did every once in a while when hed had a few drinks or his mind wandered opening a door or two for him hed shake his head sadly or pound his fist furiously and ask himself why why hed say he was better than that he was the best i was no match for delta no one was ever you sound awfully good to me because im not coming in from the cold im going out with a better reason than ive ever had in my life before be careful alex tell them to be careful conklin hung up the phone and marie felt the tears rolling slowly down her cheeks morris panov and alex left the gift shop in the kowloon railway station and headed for the escalator that led to the lower level tracks and mo the friend was perfectly willing to follow his former patients instructions but panov the psychiatrist could not resist offering his professional opinion no wonder you people are all fucked up he said carrying a stuffed panda under his arm and a brightlycoloured magazine in his hand let me get this straight when we go downstairs i walk to the right which is track six and then proceed to my left towards the rear of the train which we assume will arrive within minutes correct so far correct answered conklin beads of sweat on his forehead as he limped beside the doctor i then wait by the last pillar holding this foulsmelling stuffed animal under my arm while glancing through the pages of this extremely pornographic magazine until a woman approaches me correct again said alex as they stepped down into the escalator the pandas a perfectly normal gift its a favourite with westerners think of it as a present to her kid the porno magazine simply completes the recognition signal pandas and dirty pictures with naked women dont usually go together on the contrary the combination could be positively freudian score one for the funny farm just do as i say say you never told me what i was to say to the woman try nice to meet you or hows the kid it doesnt matter give her the panda and get back to this escalator as fast as you can without running they reached the lower platform and conklin touched panovs elbow angling the doctor to the right youll do fine coach just do as i say and come back here everythings going to be all right thats easier said from where i usually sit panov walked down to the end of the platform as the train from lo wu thundered into the station he stood by the last pillar and as passengers by the hundreds poured out of the doors the doctor awkwardly held the black and white panda under his arm and raised the magazine in front of his face and when it happened he nearly collapsed you must be harold exclaimed the loud falsetto voice as a tall figure heavily made up under a soft widebrimmed hat and dressed in a grey pleated skirt slapped his shoulder id know you anywhere darling nice to meet you hows the kid morris could barely speak hows alex countered the suddenly bass male voice quietly i owe him and i pay my debts but this is crazy has he still got both his oars in the water im not sure any of you have said the astonished psychiatrist quickly said the strange figure theyre closing in give me the panda and when i start running fade into the crowd and get out of here give it to me panov did as he was told aware that several men were breaking through the straggling groups of passengers and converging on them suddenly the heavily rouged man in womens clothes ran behind the thick pillar and emerged on the other side he kicked off his high heels circled the pillar again and like a footballer back raced into the crowd nearest the train passing a chinese who tried to grab him dodging through pummelled bodies and startled faces behind him other men took up the chase thwarted by the increasingly hostile passengers who began using suitcases and knapsacks to ward off the bewildering assaults somehow in the near riot the panda was put in the hands of a tall occidental female who was also holding an unfolded train timetable the woman was grabbed by two welldressed chinese she screamed they looked at her yelled at each other and plunged ahead morris panov again did as he had been instructed to do he quickly mingled with the departing crowd on the opposite side of the platform and walked rapidly along the edge of track back to the escalator where a line had formed there was a queue but no alex conklin suppressing his panic mo slowed his pace but kept walking looking around scanning the crowds as well as those riding up on the escalator what had happened where was the cia man allo panov spun to his left the brief shout both a relief and a warning conklin had edged his way partially around a pillar thirty feet beyond the escalator from his quick rapid gestures he made it clear that he had to stay where he was and for mo to reach him but slowly cautiously panov assumed the air of a man annoyed with the queue a man who would wait for the crowds to thin out before attempting to get on the escalator he wished he smoked or at least had not thrown the pornographic magazine down onto the tracks either would have given him something to do instead he clasped his hands behind his back and strolled casually along the deserted area of the platform glancing around twice frowning at the waiting people he reached the pillar slid behind it and gasped at conklins feet lay a stunned middleaged man in a raincoat with conklins club foot in the centre of his back id like you to meet matthew richards doctor matts an old far east hand going back to the early saigon days when we first knew each other of course he was younger then and a lot more agile but then again werent we all for christs sake alex let me up pleaded the man named richards shaking his head as best he could in his prone position my head hurts like hell what did you hit me with a crowbar no matt the shoe belonging to my nonexistent foot heavy isnt it but then it has to take a lot of abuse as to letting you up you know i cant do that until you answer my questions goddamn it i have answered them im a lousy case officer not the station chief we picked you up from a dc directive that said to put you under surveillance then state moved in with another direct which i didnt see i told you i find that hard to believe youve got a tight unit here everybody sees everything be reasonable matt we go back a long time what did the state directive say i dont know it was eyesonly for the sc thats station chief doctor said conklin looking over at panov its the oldest copout we have we use it all the time when we get in rhubarbs with other government agencies what do i know ask the sc that way our noses are clean because no one wants to hassle a station chief you see scs have a direct line to langley and depending on the oval yo yo langley has a direct line to the white house its very politicized let me tell you and has very little to do with gathering intelligence very enlightening said panov staring at the prone man not knowing what else to say grateful that the platform was now practically deserted and the pillar at the rear was in shadows wo copout yelled richards struggling under the pressing weight of conklins heavy boot jesus im telling you the truth i get out next february why would i want any trouble from you or anybody else at headquarters oh matt poor matt you never were the best or the brightest you just answered your own question you can taste that pension just like me and you dont want any waves im listed as a pickup a tight surveillance and you dont want to louse up a directive where youre concerned okay pal ill wire back an evaluation report thatll get you transferred to central american demolitions until your times up if you last that long cut it out imagine being skunktrapped behind a pillar in a crowded train station by a lousy cripple theyll probably let you mine a few harbours all by yourself i dont know anything who are the chinese i dont theyre not the police so who arethey government what branch they had to tell you that the sc had to tell you he couldnt expect you to work blind thats just it we are the only thing he told us was that they were cleared by dc on the top floors he swore that was all he knew what the hell were we supposed to do ask to see their drivers licences so no ones accountable because no one knows anything itd turn out nice if they were chincomms picking up a defector wouldnt it the scs accountable we lay it on him oh the higher morality of it all we just follow orders hen general conklin employed the hard german g for the rank and naturally hen general doesnt know anything either because hes following his orders alex paused squinting there was one man a big fellow who looked like a chinese paul bunyan conklin stopped richardss head suddenly twitched as did his body who is he matt i dont know for sure who ive seen him thats all hes hard to miss that isnt all because he is hard to miss and considering the places where youve seen him you asked questions what did you learn come on alex its just gossip nothing set in concrete i love gossip tattle matt or this ugly heavy thing on my leg may just have to pound your face you see i cant control it its got a mind of its own and it doesnt like you it can be very hostile even to me with an effort conklin suddenly raised his club foot and pounded it down between richardss shoulder blades christ youre breaking my back no i think it wants to break your face who is he matt again grimacing alex raised his false foot and lowered it now on the base of the cia mans skull all right as i said its not gospel but ive heard hes high up in crown ci crown ci explained conklin to morris panov means british counter intelligence here in hong kong which means a branch of mi which means they take their orders from london very enlightening said the psychiatrist as bewildered as he was appalled very agreed alex may i have your necktie doctor asked conklin as he began removing his own ill replace it out of contingency funds because we now have a new wrinkle im officially at work langley is apparently funding by way of matthews salary and time something involving an allys intelligence operation as a civil servant under a like classification i should put my shoulder to the wheel i need your necktie too matt two minutes later case officer richards lay behind the pillar his feet and hands tied and his mouth drawn taut all accomplished with three ties were sterile said alex studying what remained of the crowd beyond the pillar theyve all gone after our decoy whos probably halfway to malaysia by now who was she he i mean he certainly wasnt a woman no sexism intended but a woman probably couldnt have made it out of here he did taking the others with him after him he jumped over the escalator railing and worked his way up lets go were clear but who is he pressed panov as they walked around the pillar towards the escalator and the few stragglers forming a short line weve used him occasionally over here mainly as a pair of eyes for outoftheway border installations which he knows something about since he has to get past them with his merchandise narcotics he wouldnt touch them hes a top notch jock he runs stolen gold and jewels operating between hong kong macao and singapore i think it has something to do with what happened to him a number of years ago they took away his medals for conduct unbecoming just about everything he posed for some raunchy photographs when he was in college and needed the money later through the good offices of a sleazy publisher with the ethics of an alley cat they surfaced and he was crucified ruined that magazine i carried exclaimed mo as they both stepped on to the escalator something like it i guess what medals nineteen seventysix olympics track and field the high hurdles were his speciality speechless panov stared at alexander conklin as they rose on the escalator nearing the entrance to the terminal a platoon of sweepers carrying wide brooms over their shoulders appeared on the opposite escalator heading down to the platform alex jerked his head towards them snapped the fingers of his right hand and with the thumb extended jabbed the air in the direction of the terminals exit doors above the message was clear within moments a bound cia agent would be found behind a pillar thatd be the one they call the major said marie sitting in a chair opposite conklin while morris panov knelt beside her examining her left foot ouch she cried pulling back her crossed leg im sorry mo dont be said the doctor its a nasty bruise spread over the second and third metatarsals you must have taken quite a spill several you know about feet right now i feel more secure with chiropody than psychiatry you people live in a world that would drive my profession back to the middle ages not that most of us arent still there the words are just cuter panov looked up at marie his eyes straying to her severely styled greystreaked hair you had fine medical treatment darkredheadthatwas except the hair its atrocious its brilliant corrected conklin what do you know you were a patient of mine mo returned to the foot theyre both healing nicely the cuts and the blisters that is the bruise will take longer ill pick up some things later and change the dressings panov got up and pulled a straightbacked chair away from the small writing table youre staying here then asked marie down the hall said alex i couldnt get either of the rooms next door how did you even manage that money this is hong kong and reservations are always getting lost by somebody who isnt around back to the major his name is lin wenzu catherine staples told me he was with british intelligence speaks english with a uk accent she was sure very she said he was considered the best intelligence officer in hong kong and that included everyone from the kgb to the cia its not hard to understand his name is lin wenzu not ivanovitch or joe smith a talented native is sent to england educated and trained and brought back to assume a responsible position in government standard colonial policy especially in the area of law enforcement and territorial security certainly from a psychological viewpoint added panov sitting down there are fewer resentments that way and another bridge is built to the governed foreign community i understand that said alex nodding but somethings missing the pieces dont fit its one thing for london to give a green light for an undercover dc operation which everything weve learned tells us this is only more bizarre than most but its another for mi to lend us their local people in a colony the uk is still running why asked panov several reasons first they dont trust us oh its not that they mistrust our intentions just our brains in some ways theyre right in others theyre dead wrong but thats their judgement second why risk exposing their personnel for the sake of decisions made by an american bureaucrat with no expertise in onthescene deep cover administration thats the sticking point and london would reject it out of hand i assume youre referring to mcallister said marie till the cows come home from a field of new alfalfa conklin shook his head exhaling as he did so ive done my research and i can tell you hes either the strongest or the weakest factor in this whole damned scenario i suspect the latter hes pure cold brains like mcnamara before his conversion to doubt knock off the bullshit said mo panov what do you mean in straight talk not chicken soup leave that to me i mean doctor that edward newington mcallister is a rabbit his ears spring up at the first sign of conflict or offthewire lapses and he scampers off hes an analyst and one of the best but he is not qualified to be a case officer to say nothing of a station chief and dont even consider his being the strategist behind a major covert operation hed be laughed off the scene believe me he was terribly convincing with david and me broke in marie he was given that script prime the subject he was told stick to the convoluted narrative that would become clearer to the subject in stages once he made his first moves which he had to make because you were gone who wrote the script asked panov i wish i knew no one i reached in washington knows and that includes a number of people who should they werent lying after all these years i can spot a swallow in a voice its so damn deep and filled with so many contradictions it makes treadstone seventyone look like an amateur effort which it wasnt catherine said something to me interrupted marie i dont know whether it will help or not but it stuck in my mind she said a man flew into hong kong a statesman she called him someone who was far more than a diplomat or something like that she thought there might be a connection with everything thats happened what was his name she never told me later when i saw mcallister down in the street with her i assumed it was he but maybe not the analyst you just described and the nervous man who spoke to david and me is hardly a diplomat much less a statesman it must have been someone else when did she say this to you asked conklin three days ago when she was hiding me in her apartment in hong kong before she drove you up to tuen mun alex leaned forward in the chair yes she never mentioned him again no and when i asked her she said there was no point in either of us getting our hopes up she said she had more digging to do you settled for that yes i did because at the time i thought i understood i had no reason to question her then she was taking a personal and professional risk helping me accepting my word on her own without asking for consular advice which others might have done simply to protect themselves you mentioned the word bizarre alex well lets face it what i told her was so bizarre it was outrageous including a fabric of lies from the us state department vanishing guards from the central intelligence agency suspicions that led to the higher levels of your government a lesser person might have backed away and covered herself gratitude notwithstanding said conklin gently she was withholding information you had a right to know christ after everything you and david have been through youre wrong alex interrupted marie softly i told you i thought i understood her but i didnt finish the cruellest thing you can do to a person whos living every hour in panic is to offer him or her a hope that turns out false when the crash comes its intolerable believe me ive spent over a year with a man desperately looking for answers hes found quite a few but those he followed only to find them wrong nearly broke him dashed hopes are no fun for the one hoping shes right said panov nodding his head and looking at conklin and i think you know it dont you t happened replied alex shrugging and looking at his watch at any rate its time for catherine staples shell be watched guarded it was marie who now sat forward in her chair her expression concerned her eyes questioning theyll assume you both came over here because of me and that you reached me and i told you about her theyll expect you to go after her theyll be waiting for you if they could do what theyve done so far they could kill you no they couldnt said conklin getting up and limping towards the bedside telephone theyre not good enough he added simply youre a goddamned basket case whispered matthew richards from behind the wheel of the small car parked across the street from catherine stapless apartment youre not very grateful matt said alex sitting in the shadows next to the cia man not only did i not send in that evaluation report but i also let you get me back under surveillance thank me dont insult me shit what did you tell them back at the office what else i was mugged for christs sake by how many at least five teenaged punks zhongguo ren and if you fought back making a lot of ruckus i might have spotted you thats the story board agreed richards quietly and when i called you naturally it was one of the street people youve cultivated who saw a white man with a limp bingo you might even get a promotion i just want to get out youll make it not this way so it was old havilland himself who blew into town you didnt get that from me it was in the papers the sterile house in victoria peak wasnt in the papers matt hey come on that was a trade off youre nice to me im nice to you no lousy report about me getting clobbered by a shoe with no foot in it and you get an address anyway id deny it you got it from garden road its all over the consulate thanks to a pissedoff marine havilland mused alex out loud it fits hes tightass with the british even talks like them my god i should have recognized the voice the voice asked a perplexed richards over the phone another page in the scenario it was havilland he wouldnt let anyone else do it weve lost her oh jesus and i was sucked right in into what forget it gladly an automobile slowed down and stopped across the street in front of stapless apartment house a woman got out of the rear kerbside door and seeing her in the wash of the streetlights conklin knew who it was catherine staples she nodded to the driver turned around and walked across the pavement to the thick glass doors of the entrance suddenly an engine roaring at high pitch filled the quiet street by the park a long black sedan swerved out of a space somewhere behind them and screeched to a stop beside stapless car staccato explosions thundered from the second vehicle glass was shattered both in the street and across the pavement as the windows of the parked automobile were blown away along with the drivers head and the doors of the apartment house riddled collapsing in bloody fragments as the body of catherine staples was nailed into the frame under the fusillade of bullets tyres spinning the black sedan raced away in the dark street leaving the carnage behind blood and torn flesh everywhere jesus christ roared the cia man get out of here ordered conklin where for christs sake where victoria peak are you out of your mind no but somebody else is one blueblooded son of a bitch has been taken hes been had and hes going to hear it first from me move bourne stopped the black shanghai sedan on the dark treelined deserted stretch of road according to the map he had passed the eastern gate of the summer palace actually once a series of ancient royal villas set down on acres of sculptured countryside dominated by a lake known as kunming he had followed the shoreline north until the coloured lights of the vast pleasure ground of emperors past faded giving way to the darkness of the country road he extinguished the headlights got out and carried his purchases now in a waterproof knapsack to the wall of trees lining the road and dug his heel into the ground the earth was soft making his task easier for the possibility that his rented car might be searched was real he reached inside the knapsack pulled out a pair of workmans gloves and a longbladed hunting knife he knelt down and dug a hole deep enough to conceal the sack he left the top of it open picked up the knife and cut a notch in the trunk of the nearest tree to expose the white wood beneath the bark he replaced the knife and gloves in the knapsack pressed it down into the earth and covered it with dirt he returned to the car checked the odometer and started the engine if the map was as accurate about distances as it was in detailing those areas in and around beijing where it was prohibited to drive the entrance to the jing shan sanctuary was no more than threequarters of a mile away around a long curve up ahead the map was accurate two floodlights converged on the high green metal gate beneath huge panels depicting brightly coloured birds the gate was closed in a small glassenclosed structure on the right sat a single guard at the sight of jasons approaching headlights he sprang up and ran out it was difficult to tell whether the mans jacket and trousers were a uniform or not there was no evidence of a weapon bourne drove the sedan up to within feet of the gate climbed out and approached the chinese behind it surprised to see that the man was in his late fifties or early sixties bei long bei long began jason before the guard could speak apologizing for disturbing him ive had a terrible time he continued rapidly pulling out the list of the french assigned negotiators from his inside pocket i was to be here three and a half hours ago but the car didnt arrive and i couldnt reach minister he picked out the name of a textile minister from the list wang xu and im sure hes as upset as i am you speak our language said the bewildered guard you have a car with no driver the minister cleared it ive been to beijing many many times we were going to have dinner together we are closed and there is no restaurant here did he leave a note for me perhaps no one leaves anything here but lost articles i have very nice japanese binoculars i could sell you cheap it happened beyond the gate about thirty yards down the dirt road bourne saw a man in the shadows of a tall tree a man wearing a long tunic four buttons an officer around his waist was a thick holster belt a weapon im sorry i have no use for binoculars a present perhaps i have few friends and my children are thieves you are a sad man there is nothing but children and friends and the spirits of course now really i simply want to find the minister we are discussing renminbi in the millions the binoculars are but a few yuan all right how much fifty get them for me said the chameleon impatiently reaching into his pocket his gaze casually straying beyond the green fence as the guard rushed back to the gatehouse the chinese officer had retreated farther into the shadows but was still watching the gate the pounding in jasons chest once again felt like kettledrums as it so often had in the days of medusa he had turned a trick exposed a strategy delta knew the oriental mind secrecy the lone figure did not of course confirm it but he did not deny it either look how grand they are cried the guard running back to the fence and holding out the binoculars one hundred yuan you said fifty i didnt notice the lenses far superior give me the money and ill throw them over the gate very well said bourne about to push the money through the crisscrossing mesh of the fence but under one condition thief if by any chance you are questioned about me i choose not to be embarrassed questioned thats foolish theres no one here but me delta was right but in case you are i insist you tell the truth i am a french businessman urgently seeking this minister of textiles because my car was unpardonably delayed i will not be embarrassed as you wish the money please jason shoved the yuan bills through the fence the guard clutched them and threw the binoculars over the gate bourne caught them and looked pleadingly at the chinese have you any idea where the minister might have gone yes and i was about to tell you without additional money men so grand as you and he would no doubt go to the dining house named ting li guan it is a favourite of rich foreigners and powerful men of our heavenly government where is it in the summer palace you passed it on this road go back fifteen twenty kilometres and you will see the great dong an men gate enter it and the guides will direct you but show your papers sir you travel in a very unusual way thank you yelled jason running to the car vive la france how beautiful said the guard shrugging heading back to his post and counting his money the officer walked quietly up to the gatehouse and tapped on the glass astonished the night watchman leaped out of his chair and opened the door oh sir you startled me i see you were locked inside perhaps you fell asleep in one of our beautiful resting places how unfortunate i will open the gate at once who was that man asked the officer calmly a foreigner sir a french businessman who has had much misfortune as i understood him he was to meet the minister of textiles here hours ago and then proceed to dinner but his automobile was delayed hes very upset he does not wish to be embarrassed what minister of textiles minister wang xu i believe he said wait outside please certainly sir the gate in a few minutes the soldier picked up the telephone on the small counter and dialled seconds later he spoke again may i have the number of a minister of textiles named wang xu thank you the officer pressed down the centre bar released it and dialled again minister wang xu please i am he said a somewhat disagreeable voice at the other end of the line who is this a clerk at the trade council office sir were doing a routine check on a french businessman who has you listed as a reference great christian jesus not that idiot ardisson whats he done now you know him sir i wish i didnt special this special that he thinks that when he defecates the odour of lilacs fills the stalls were you to have dinner with him tonight sir dinner i might have said anything to keep him quiet this afternoon of course he hears only what he wants to hear on the other hand its perfectly possible that he would use my name to obtain a reservation when he didnt have one i told you special this special that give him whatever he wants hes a lunatic but harmless enough wed send him back to paris on the next plane if the fools he represents werent paying so much for such thirdrate material hes cleared for the best illegal whores in beijing just dont bother me im entertaining the minister abruptly hung up his mind at ease the army officer replaced the phone and walked outside to the night watchman you were accurate he said the foreigner was most agitated sir and very confused im told both conditions are normal for him the army man paused for a moment then added you may open the gate now certainly sir the guard reached into his pocket and pulled out a ring of keys he stopped looking over at the officer i see no automobile sir it is many kilometres to any transportation the summer palace would be the first ive telephoned for a car it should be here in ten or fifteen minutes im afraid i will not be here then sir i can see the light of my reliefs bicycle down the road now i am off duty in five minutes perhaps ill wait here said the officer dismissing the watchmans words there are clouds drifting down from the north if they bring rain i could use the gatehouse for shelter until my car arrives i see no clouds sir your eyes are not what they once were too true the repeated ringing of a bicycle bell broke the outer silence the relief guard approached the fence as the current watchman started to unlock the gate these young ones announce themselves as though they were descending spirits from heaven i should like to say something to you said the officer sharply stopping the watchman in his tracks like the foreigner i too do not wish to be embarrassed for catching an hour of much needed sleep in a beautiful resting place do you enjoy your job very much sir and the opportunity to sell such things as japanese binoculars turned over to you for safekeeping sir my hearings acute and your shrill voice is loud sir say nothing about me and i will say nothing about your unethical activities which would undoubtedly send you into a field with a pistol put to your head your behaviour is reprehensible i have never seen you sir i swear on the spirits in my soul we in the party reject such thoughts then on anything you like open the gate and get out of here first my bicycle sir the watchman ran to the far edge of the fence wheeled out his bicycle and unlocked the gate he swung it back nodding with relief as he literally threw the new man the ring of keys mounting the saddle of his bicycle he sped off down the road the second guard walked casually through the gate holding his bicycle by the handlebars can you imagine he said to the officer the son of a kuomintang warlord taking the place of a feebleminded peasant who would have served us in the kitchens bourne spotted the white notch in the tree trunk and drove the sedan off the road between two pine trees he turned off the lights and got out rapidly he broke numerous branches to camouflage the car in the darkness instinctively he had worked quickly he would have done so in any event but to his alarm within seconds after he finished concealing the sedan headlights appeared far down on the road to beijing he bent down kneeling in the underbrush and watched the car pass by fascinated by the sight of a bicycle strapped to its roof then concerned when moments later the noise of the engine was abruptly cut off the car had stopped around the r bend ahead wary that some part of his own car had been seen by an experienced field man who would park out of sight and return on foot jason raced across the road into the tangled brush beyond the trees he ran in spurts to his right from pine to pine to the midpoint of the curve where again he knelt in the shadowed greenery waiting studying every foot of the thoroughfares borders listening for any sound that did not belong to the hum of the deserted country road nothing then finally something and when he saw what it was it simply did not make sense or did it the man on the bicycle with a friction light on the front fender was pedalling up the road as if his life depended on a speed he could not possibly attain as he drew closer bourne saw that it was the watchman on a bicycle and a bicycle had been strapped to the roof of the car that had stopped around the bend had it been for the watchman of course not the car would have proceeded to the gate a second bicycle a second watchman arriving on a bicycle of course if what he believed was true the guard at the gate would be changed a conspirator put in his place jason had waited until the watchmans light was barely a speck in the distant darkness then ran in the road back to his car and the tree with the notch in the bark he now dug up the knapsack and began sorting out the articles of his trade he removed his jacket and white shirt and put on a black turtleneck sweater he secured the sheath of the hunting knife to the belt of his dark trousers and shoved the automatic with a single shell in it on the other side he picked up two spools connected by a threefoot strand of thin wire and thought that the lethal instrument was far better than the one he had fashioned in hong kong why not he was much closer to his objective if anything he had learned in that distant medusa had any value he rolled the wire on to both spools equally and carefully pushed them down inside his trousers right back pocket then picked up a small penlight and clipped it to the lower edge of his right front pocket he placed a long double strand of outsized chinese firecrackers which was folded and held in place by an elastic band in his left front pocket along with three books of matches and a small wax candle the most awkward item was a handheld mediumgauge wirecutter the size of a pair of pliers he inserted it head down into his left back pocket then sprang the release so that the two short handles were pressed against the cloth thus locking the instrument in its shell finally he reached for a wrapped pile of clothing that was coiled so tight its dimensions were no more than that of a rolling pin he centred it on his spine pulled the elastic band around his waist and snapped the clips into place he might never use the clothes but then he could leave nothing to chance he was too close ill take him marie i swear ill take him and well have our life again its david and i love you so i need you so stop it there are no people only objectives no emotions only targets and kills and men to be eliminated who stand in the way i have no use for you webb youre soft and i despise you listen to delta listen to jason bourne the killer who was a killer by necessity buried the knapsack with his white shirt and tweed jacket and stood up between the pine trees his lungs swelled at the thought of what was before him one part of him frightened and uncertain the other furious icecold jason started walking north into the curve going from tree to tree as he had done before he reached the car that had passed him with the bicycle strapped to its roof parked on the side of the road it had a large sign taped under the front window he edged closer and read the chinese characters smiling to himself as he did so this is a disabled official vehicle of the government tampering with any part of the mechanism is a serious crime theft of this vehicle will result in the swift execution of the offender in the lower lefthand corner there was a column in small print peoples printing plant number shanghai bourne wondered how many hundreds of thousands of such signs had been made by printing plant perhaps they took the place of a warranty two with each vehicle he backed into the shadows and continued around the bend until he reached the open space in front of the floodlit gate his eyes followed the line of the green fence on the left it disappeared into the forest darkness on the right it extended perhaps two hundred feet beyond the gatehouse running the length of a parking lot with numbered areas for tour buses and taxis where it angled sharply south as he expected a bird sanctuary in china would be enclosed a deterrent to poachers as danjou had phrased it birds have been revered in china for centuries theyre considered delicacies for the eyes and the palate echo echo was gone he wondered if danjou had suffered no time voices bourne snapped his head back towards the gate lurching into the nearest foliage the chinese army officer and a new much younger watchman no now definitely a guard walked out from behind the gatehouse the guard was wheeling a bicycle while the officer held a small radio to his ear theyll start arriving shortly after nine oclock said the army man lowering the radio and shoving down the antenna seven vehicles each three minutes apart the truck it will be the last the guard looked at his watch perhaps you should get the car then if theres a telephone check i know the routine a good thought agreed the officer clamping the radio to his belt and taking the bicycles right handlebar i have no patience with those bureaucratic females who bark like chows but you must have insisted the guard laughing and you must take out the lonely ones the ugly ones and perform at your best between their legs suppose you received a poor report you could lose this heavenly job you mean that feebleheaded peasant you relieved no no broke in the guard releasing the bicycle they seek out the younger ones the handsome ones like me from our photographs of course hes different he pays them yuan from his sales of lost items i sometimes wonder if he makes a profit i have trouble understanding you civilians correction if i may colonel in the true china i am a captain in the kuomintang jason was stunned by the younger mans remark what he had heard was incredible in the true china i am a captain in the kuomintang the true china taiwan good god had it started the war of the two chinas was that what these men were about madness wholesale slaughter the far east would be blown off the face of the earth christ in his hunt for an assassin had he stumbled on the unthinkable it was too much to absorb too frightening too cataclysmic he had to move quickly putting all thought on hold concentrating only on movement he read the radium dial of his watch it was and he had very little time to do what had to be done he waited until the army officer bicycled past then made his way cautiously silently through the foliage until he saw the fence he approached it taking out the penlight from his pocket flashing it twice to judge the dimensions they were extraordinary its height was no less than feet and the top angled outwards like the inner barricade of a prison fence with coils of barbed wire strung along the parallel strands of steel he reached into his back pocket squeezed the handles together and removed the wirecutter he then probed with his left hand in the darkness and when he found the crisscrossing wires closest to the ground he placed the head of the cutter to the lowest had david webb not been desperate and jason bourne not furious the job would not have been accomplished the fence was no ordinary fence the gauge of the metal was far far stronger than that of any barricade enclosing the most violent criminals on earth each strand took all the strength jason had as he manipulated the cutter back and forth until the metal snapped free and each snap came but only with the passing of precious minutes again bourne looked at the glowing dial of his watch using his shoulder his feet digging into the ground he bent the barely twofoot vertical rectangle inward through the fence he crawled inside sweat drenching his body and lay on the ground breathing heavily no time he rose unsteadily to his knees shook his head to clear it and started to his right holding the fence for support until he came to the corner that fronted the parking area the floodlit gate was feet to his left suddenly the first vehicle arrived it was a russian zia limousine vintage late sixties it circled into the parking lot and took the first position on the right beside the gatehouse six men got out and walked in martial unison towards what was apparently the main path of the bird sanctuary they disappeared in the dark the beams of flashlights illuminating their way jason watched closely he would be taking that path three minutes later precisely on schedule a second car drove through the gate and parked alongside the zia three men got out of the back while the driver and the front seat passenger talked seconds later the two men emerged and it was all bourne could do to control himself as his stare centred on the passenger the tall slender passenger who moved like a cat as he walked to the rear of the automobile to join the driver it was the assassin the chaos at kai tak airport had demanded the elaborate trap in beijing whoever was stalking this assassin had to be caught quickly and silenced information had to be leaked reaching the assassins creator for who else knew the hired killers tactics better than the one who had taught them to him who else wanted revenge more than the frenchman who else was capable of unearthing the other jason bourne danjou was the key and the impostors client knew it and jason bournes instincts born of the gradually painfully remembered medusa were accurate when the trap had so disastrously collapsed inside maos tomb a desecration that would shake the republic the elite circle of conspirators had to regroup swiftly secretly beyond the scrutiny of their peers an unparalleled crisis faced them there was no time to lose in determining their next moves paramount however was secrecy wherever they met secrecy was their most crucial weapon in the true china lam a captain in the kuomintang christ was it possible secrecy for a lost kingdom where better could it be found than in the wild acreages of idyllic government bird sanctuaries official parks controlled by powerful moles from the kuomintang in taiwan a strategy that came out of desperation had led bourne to the core of an incredible revelation no time its not your business only he is eighteen minutes later the six cars were in place the passengers dispersed joining their colleagues somewhere within the dark forest of the sanctuary finally twentyone minutes after the arrival of the russian limousine a canvascovered truck lumbered through the gate making a wide circle and parking next to the last entry no more than feet from jason shocked he watched as bound and gagged men and women with gaping mouths held in place by strands of cloth were pushed out of the van without exception they fell rolling on the ground moaning in protest and in pain then just within the covered opening a man was struggling twisting his short thin body and kicking at the two guards who held him off and finally threw him down on the gravelled parking lot it was a white man bourne froze it was danjou in the glow of the distant floodlights he could see that echos face was battered his eyes swollen when the frenchman pulled himself to his feet his left leg kept bending and collapsing yet he would not give in to his captors taunting he remained defiantly on his feet move do something what medusa we had signals what were they oh god what were they stones sticks rocks gravel throw something to make a sound a small distracting sound that could be anything away from an area ahead as far ahead as possible then follow it up quickly quickly jason dropped to his knees in the shadows of the rightangled fence he reached down and grabbed a small handful of gravel and threw it in the air over the heads of prisoners struggling to their feet the brief clatter on the roofs of several cars was by and large lost amid the stifled cries of the bound captives bourne repeated the action now with a few more stones the guard standing next to danjou glanced over in the direction of the splattering gravel then dismissed it when his attention was suddenly drawn to a woman who had got to her feet and had started to run towards the gate he raced over grabbed her by the hair and threw her back into the group again jason reached for more stones he stopped all movement danjou had fallen to the ground his weight on his right knee his bound hands supporting him on the gravel he watched the distracted guard then slowly he turned in bournes direction medusa was never far away from echo he had remembered swiftly jason shoved the palm of his hand out once twice the dim reflected light off his flesh was enough the frenchmans gaze was drawn to it bourne moved his head forward in the shadows echo saw him their eyes made contact danjou nodded then turned away and awkwardly painfully rose to his feet as the guard returned jason counted the prisoners there were two women and five men including echo they were herded by the guards both of whom had removed heavy night sticks from their belts and used them as prods driving the group towards the path outside the parking lot danjou fell he collapsed on his left leg twisting his body as he dropped to the ground bourne watched closely there was something strange about the fall then he understood the fingers of the frenchmans hands which were tied together in front were spread apart covering the movement with his body echo scooped up two fistfuls of gravel and as a guard approached pulling him to his feet danjou again stared briefly in jasons direction it was a signal echo would drop the tiny stones as long as they lasted so that his fellow medusan would have a path to follow the prisoners were directed to the right out of the gravelled area as the young guard the captain in the kuomintang locked the gate jason ran out of the shadows of the fence into the shadows of the truck pulling the hunting knife from its sheath as he crouched by the bonnet looking at the gatehouse the guard was just outside the door speaking into the handheld radio that connected him to the meeting ground the radio would have to be taken out so would the man tie him up use his clothes to gag him kill him there cant be any additional risks listen to me bourne dropped to the ground plunging the hunting knife into the trucks left front tyre and as it deflated he ran to the rear and did the same rounding the back of the truck he raced into the space between it and the adjacent car pivoting back and forth as he moved forward he slashed the remaining tyres of the truck and those on the left side of the car he repeated the tactic down the line of vehicles until he had slashed all the tyres except those of the russian zia only yards or so away from the gatehouse it was time for the guard tie him kill him each step has to be covered and each step leads back to your wife silently jason opened the door of the russian automobile reached inside and released the hand brake closing the door as quietly as he had opened it he judged the distance from the bonnet to the fence it was approximately eight feet gripping the windowframe he pressed his full weight forward grimacing as the huge car began to roll giving the vehicle a final surging shove he dashed in front of the car next to the zia as the limousine crashed into the fence he lowered himself out of sight and reached into his right back pocket hearing the crash the startled guard ran around the gatehouse and into the parking lot shifting his eyes in all directions then staring at the stationary zia he shook his head as if accepting a vehicles unexplained malfunction and walked over to the door bourne sprang out of the darkness the spools in both hands the wire arcing over the guards head it was over in less than three seconds no sound emitted other than a sickening expulsion of air the garrotte was lethal the captain from the kuomintang was dead removing the radio from the mans belt jason searched the clothes there was always the possibility that something might be found something of value there was were the first was a weapon not surprisingly an automatic the same calibre as the one he had taken from another conspirator in maos tomb special guns for special people another recognition factor the armaments consistent instead of one shell he now had the full complement of nine in addition to a silencer that precluded disturbing the revered dead in a revered mausoleum the second was a wallet that contained money and an official document proclaiming the bearer to be a member of the peoples security forces the conspirators had colleagues in high places bourne rolled the corpse under the limousine slashed the left tyres and raced around the car plunging his hunting knife into those on the right the huge automobile settled into the ground the captain from the kuomintang was provided with a secure concealed resting place jason ran to the gatehouse debating whether or not to shoot out the floodlights and decided against it if he survived he would need the illumination of the landmark if he had to survive marie he went inside kneeling below the window and removed the shells from the guards automatic inserting them into his own he then looked around for schedules or instructions there was a roster tacked to the wall next to the ring of keys hanging on a nail he grabbed the keys a telephone rang the earsplitting bell reverberated off the glass walls of the small gatehouse if theres a telephone check i know the routine a captain from the kuomintang bourne rose picked up the phone from the counter and crouched again spreading his fingers over the mouthpiece jing shan he said hoarsely yes hello my thrusting butterfly answered a female voice in what jason could hear was decidedly uncultured mandarin how are all your birds tonight theyre fine but im not you dont sound like yourself this is wo isnt it with a terrible cold and vomiting and running back to the toilets every two minutes nothing stays down or inside will you be all right in the morning i dont wish to be contaminated take out the lonely ones the ugly ones i wouldnt want to miss our date youll be too weak ill call you tomorrow night my heart withers like the dying flower cow dung the woman hung up as he talked jasons eyes strayed to a pile of heavy coiled chain in the corner of the gatehouse and he understood in china where so many mechanical things failed the chain was a backup should the lock in the centre of the gate refuse to close on top of the coiled chain was an ordinary steel padlock one of the keys on the ring should fit it he thought as he inserted several until the lock sprang open he gathered up the chain and started outside then stopped turned around and ripped the telephone out of the wall one more piece of malfunctioning equipment at the gate he uncoiled the chain and wound the entire length around the midpoint of the two centre posts until there was a bulging mass of coiled steel he pressed four links of the chain together so that the open spaces were clear inserted the curved bar and secured the lock everything was stretched taut and contrary to generally accepted belief firing a bullet into the mass of hard metal would not blow it apart only heighten the possibility that a deflected bullet might kill the one firing and endanger the lives of anyone else in the area he turned and started down the centre path once more staying in the shadows of the border the path was dark the glow from the floodlit gate was blocked by the dense woods of the bird sanctuary the light however still visible in the sky cupping his penlight in the palm of his left hand his arm stretched downwards towards the ground he could see every six or seven feet a small piece of gravel once he saw the first two or three he knew what to look for tiny discolorations on the dark earth the distance relatively consistent between each danjou had squeezed up each stone probably between his thumb and forefinger rubbing it as hard as he could to remove the grime of the parking lot and impart the oils of his flesh so that each might stand out the battered echo had not lost his presence of mind suddenly there were two stones not one and only inches apart jason looked up squinting in the tiny glow of the concealed penlight the two stones were no accident but another signal the main path continued straight ahead but the one taken by the herded prisoners veered sharply to the right two stones meant a turn then abruptly there was a change in the relative distances between the pebbles they were farther and farther apart and just when bourne thought there were no more he saw another suddenly there were two on the ground marking another intersecting path danjou knew he was running out of stones and so had begun a second strategy a tactic that quickly became clear to jason as long as the prisoners remained on a single path there would be no stones but when they turned into other paths two pieces of gravel indicated the direction he skirted the edges of marshes and went deep into fields and out of them everywhere hearing the sudden fluttering of wings and the screeches of disturbed birds as they winged off into the moonlit sky finally there was only one narrow path and it led down into a glen of sorts he stopped instantly extinguishing the cupped penlight below about a hundred feet down the narrow path he saw the glow of a cigarette it moved slowly casually up and down an unconcerned man smoking but still a man placed where he was for a reason then jason studied the darkness beyond because it was a different darkness specks of light flickered now and then through the dense woods of the descending glen torches perhaps for there was nothing constant about the barely discernible light of course torches he had reached it below in the distant glen beyond the guard with his cigarette was the meeting ground bourne lurched into the tangled brush on the right side of the path he started down only to find that the serpentine reeds were like fish nets stalks woven together by years of erratic winds to rip them apart or to break them would create noise inconsistent with the normal sounds of the sanctuary snaps and zipperlike scratchings were not the sudden fluttering of wings or the screeches of disturbed inhabitants they were manmade and signified a different intrusion he reached for his knife wishing the blade were longer and began a journey that had he remained on the path would have taken him no more than thirty seconds it took him now nearly twenty minutes to slice his way silently to within sight of the guard my god jason held his breath suppressing the cry in his throat he had slipped the slithering hissing creature beneath his left foot was at least a yard and a half in length it coiled around his leg and in panic he clutched a part of the body pulling it away from his flesh and severing it in midair with his knife the snake thrashed violently about for several seconds then the spasms stopped it was dead uncoiled at his foot he closed his eyes and shivered letting the moment pass again he crouched and crept closer to the guard who was now lighting another cigarette or trying to light it with one match after another that failed to ignite the guard seemed furious with his government subsidized book of matches ma de shizi shizi he said under his breath the cigarette in his mouth bourne crawled forward slicing the last few reeds of thick grass until he was six feet from the man he sheathed the hunting knife and again reached into his right back pocket for the garrotte there could be no misplaced blade that permitted a scream there could only be utter silence broken by an unheard expulsion of air hes a human being a son a brother a father he is the enemy hes our target thats all we have to know marie is yours not theirs jason bourne lunged out of the grass as the guard inhaled his first draft of tobacco the smoke exploded from his gaping mouth the garrotte was arced in place the trachea severed as the patrol fell back in the underbrush his body limp his life over whipping out the bloody wire jason shook it in the grass then rolled the spools together and shoved them back into his pocket he pulled the corpse deeper into the foliage away from the path and began searching the pockets he first found what felt like a thick wad of folded toilet tissue not at all uncommon in china where such paper was continuously in short supply he unsnapped his penlight cupped it and looked at his find astonished the paper was folded and soft but it was not tissue it was renminbi thousands of yuan more than several years income for most chinese the guard at the gate the captain of the kuomintang had money somewhat more than jason thought usual but nowhere near this amount a wallet was next there were photographs of children which bourne quickly replaced a driving permit a housing allocation certificate and an official document proclaiming the bearer to be a member of the peoples security forces jason pulled out the paper he had taken from the first guards wallet and placed both side by side on the ground they were identical he folded both and put them into his pocket a last item was as puzzling as it was interesting it was a pass allowing the bearer access to friendship stores those shops that served foreign travellers and which were prohibited to the chinese except for the highest government officials whoever the men were below thought bourne they were a strange and rarefied group subordinate guards carried enormous sums of money enjoyed official privileges light years beyond their positions and bore documents identifying them as members of the governments secret police if they were conspirators and everything he had seen and heard from shenzhen to tian an men square to this wildlife preserve would seem to confirm it the conspiracy reached into the hierarchy of beijing no time its not your concern the weapon strapped to the mans waist was as he expected similar to the one in his belt as well as the gun he had thrown into the woods at the jing shan gate it was a superior weapon and weapons were symbols a sophisticated weapon was no less a mark of status than an expensive watch which might have many imitators but those who had a schooled eye for the merchandise would know the genuine article one might merely show it to confirm ones status or deny it as government issue from an army that bought its weapons from every available source in the world it was a subtle point of recognition only one superior kind allocated to one elite circle no time its no concern of yours move jason extracted the shells put them in his pocket and threw the gun into the forest he crawled out to the path and started slowly silently down towards the flickering light beyond the wall of high trees below it was more than a glen it was a huge well dug out of prehistoric earth a rupture dating from the ice age that had not healed birds flapped above in fear and curiosity owls hooted in angry dissonance bourne stood at the edge of the precipice looking down through the trees at the gathering below a pulsating circle of torches illuminated the meeting ground david webb gasped wanting to vomit but the icecold command dictated otherwise stop it watch know what were dealing with suspended from the limb of a tree by a rope attached to his bound wrists his arms stretched out above him his feet barely inches off the ground a male prisoner writhed in panic muted cries coming from his throat his eyes wild and pleading above his gagged mouth a slender middleaged man dressed in a mao jacket and trousers stood in front of the violently twisting body his right hand was extended clasping the jewelled hilt of an upended sword its blade long and thin its point resting in the earth david webb recognized the weapon weapon and not a weapon it was a ceremonial sword of a fourteenthcentury warlord a ruthless class of militarists who destroyed villages and towns and whole countrysides even suspected of opposing the will of the yuan emperors mongols who left nothing but fire and death and the screams of children in their wake the sword was also used for ceremonies far less symbolic far more brutal than appearances at the dynastys courts david felt a wave of nausea and apprehension gripping him as he watched the scene below listen to me shouted the slender man in front of the prisoner as he turned to address his audience his voice was highpitched but deliberate instructive bourne did not know him but his was a face that would be hard to forget the closecropped grey hair the gaunt pale features above all the stare jason could not see the eyes clearly but it was enough that the fires of the torches danced off them they too were on fire behind him silent almost passive stood the impostor the man who looked like david no like jason bourne the nights of the great blade begin the slender man screamed suddenly and they will continue night after night until all those who would betray us are sent to helll each of these poisonous insects has committed crimes against our holy cause crimes we are aware of all of which could lead to the great crime demanding the great blade the speaker turned to the suspended prisoner you indicate the truth and only the truth do you know the occidental the prisoner shook his head throated moans accompanying the wild movement liar shrieked a voice from the crowd he was in the tian an men this afternoon again the prisoner shook his head spastically in panic he spoke against the true china shouted another i heard him in the hua gong park among the young people and in the coffee house on the xidan bei the prisoner moved convulsively his wide stunned eyes fixed in shock on the crowd bourne began to understand the man was hearing lies andhe did not know why but jason knew a star chamber inquisition was in session a troublemaker or a man with doubts was being eliminated in the name of a greater crime in the remote possibility that he might have committed it the nights of the great blade begin night after night it was a reign of terror inside a small bloody kingdom within a vast land where centuries of bloodstained warlords had prevailed he did these things shouted the gauntfaced orator he said these things a frenzied chorus of affirmatives filled the glen in the tian an men he talked to the occidental he betrayed us all he caused the trouble at the hated maos tomb he would see us dead our cause lost he speaks against our leaders and wants them killed to oppose our leaders said the orator his voice calm but rising is to vilify them and by so doing to remove the care one must accord the precious gift called life when these things occur the gift must be taken away the suspended man writhed more furiously his cries growing louder and matching the moans of the other prisoners who were forced to kneel in front of the speaker in full view of the imminent execution only one kept refusing continuously trying to rise in disobedience and disrespect and continuously beaten down by the guard nearest him it was philippe danjou echo was sending another message to delta but jason bourne could not understand it this diseased ungrateful hypocrite this teacher of the young who was welcomed like a brother into our dedicated ranks because we believed the words he spoke so courageously we thought in opposition to our motherlands tormentors is no more than a traitor his words are hollow he is a sworn companion of the treacherous winds and they would take him to our enemies the tormentors of mother china in his death may he find purification the now shrillvoiced orator pulled the sword out of the ground he raised it above his head and so that his seed may not be spread recited the scholar david webb to himself recalling the words of the ancient incantation and wanting to close his eyes but unable to ordeted by his other self not to we destroy the well from which the seed springs praying to the spirits to destroy all it has entered here on earth the sword arced vertically down hacking into the groin and genitalia of the screaming twisting body and so that his thoughts may not be spread diseasing the innocent and the weak we pray to the spirits to destroy them wherever they may be as we here destroy the well from which they spring the writhing body fell to the ground under a shower of blood from the severed head which the slender man with the eyes of fire continued to abuse with the blade until there was no remnant of a human face the rest of the terrified prisoners filled the glen with wails of horror as they grovelled on the ground soiling themselves begging for mercy except one danjou rose to his feet and stared in silence at the messianic man with the sword the guard approached hearing him the frenchman turned and spat in his face the guard mesmerized perhaps sickened by what he had seen backed away what was echo doing what was his message bourne looked back to the executioner the man with the gaunt face and closecropped grey hair he was wiping the long blade of the sword with a white silk scarf as aides removed the body and what was left of the prisoners skull he pointed to a striking attractive woman who was being dragged by the two guards over to the rope her posture was erect defiant delta studied his face beneath the maniacal eyes the mans thin mouth was stretched into a slit he was smiling he was dead some time somewhere perhaps tonight a butcher a bloodstained blind fanatic who would plunge the far east into an unthinkable war china against china the rest of the world to follow tonight this woman is a courier one of those to whom we gave our trust the orator went on gradually raising his voice like a fundamentalist minister preaching the gospel of love while his eye is on the work of the devil the trust was not earned but given in faith for she is the wife of one of our own a brave soldier a first son of an illustrious family of the true china a man who as i speak now risks his life by infiltrating our enemies in the south he too gave her his trust and she betrayed that trust she betrayed that gallant husband she betrayed us all she is no more than a whore who sleeps with the enemy and while her lust is satiated how many secrets has she revealed how much deeper is her betrayal is she the occidentals contact here in beijing is she the one who informs on us who tells our enemies what to look for what to expect how else could this terrible day have happened our most experienced dedicated men set a trap for our enemies that would have cut them down ridding ourselves of western criminals who see only riches to be won by grovelling in front of chinas tormentors it is related that she was at the airport this morning the airport where the trap was in progress did she give her wanton body to a dedicated man drugging him perhaps did her lover tell her what to do what to say to our enemies what has this harlot done the scene was set thought bourne a case so flagrantly leapfrogging over facts and related facts that even a court in moscow would send a puppet prosecutor back to the drawing board the reign of terror within the warlord tribe continued weed out the misfits among the misfits find the traitor kill anyone who might be he or she a subdued but angry chorus of whore and traitor came from the audience as the bound woman struggled with the two guards the orator held up his hands for silence it was immediate her lover was a despicable journalist for the xinhua news agency that lying discredited organ of the despicable regime i say was for since an hour ago the loathsome creature is dead shot through the head his throat cut for all to know that he too was a traitor i have spoken myself to this whores husband for i accord him honour he instructed me to do as our ancestral spirits demand he wants nothing further to do with her aiyaaa with extraordinary strength and fury the woman ripped the tightly bound cloth from her mouth liar she screamed killer of killers you killed a decent man and i have betrayed no one it is i who have been betrayed i was not at the airport and you know it i have never seen this occidental and you know that too i knew nothing of this trap for western criminals and you can see the truth in my face how could it by whoring with a dedicated servant of the cause and corrupting him drugging him by offering him your breasts and misused tunnelofcorruption withholding withdrawing until the herbs make him mad youre mad you say these things these lies because you sent my husband south and came to me for many days first with promises and then with threats i was to service you it was my duty you said you lay with me and i learned things woman you are contemptible i came to you pleading with you to keep honour to your husband with the cause to abandon your lover and seek forgiveness a lie men came to you taipans from the south sent by my husband men who could not be seen near your high offices they came secretly to the shops below my flat the flat of a so called honourable widow another lie you left for me and my child whore shrieked the wildeyed man with the sword liar to the depths of the northern lakes shouted the woman in reply like you my husband has many women and cares nothing for me he beats me and you tell me it is his right for he is a great son of the true china i carry messages from one city to another which if found on me would bring me torture and death and i receive only scorn never paid for my rail fares or the yuan withheld from my place of work for you tell me it is my duty how is any girl child to eat the child your great son of china barely recognizes for he wanted only sons the spirits would not grant you sons for they would be women disgracing a great house of china you are the traitor you went to the airport and contacted our enemies permitting a great criminal to escape you would enslave us for a thousand years you would make us your cattle for ten thousand you dont know what freedom is woman freedom from your mouth you tell me you tell us you will give us back the freedoms our elders had in the true china but what freedoms liar the freedom that demands blind obedience that takes the rice from my child a child dismissed by a father who believes only in lords warlords landlords lords of the earth aiya the woman turned to the crowd rushing forward away from the orator you she cried all of you i have not betrayed you nor our cause but i have learned many things all was not as this great liar says there is much pain and restriction which we all know but there was pain before restriction before my lover was no evil man no blind follower of the regime but a literate man a gentle man and a believer in eternal china he wanted the things we want he asked only for time to correct the evils that had infected the old men in the committees that lead us there will be changes he told me some are showing the way now do not permit the liar to do this to me do not permit him to do it to you whore traitor the blade came slashing through the air decapitating the woman her headless body lurched to the left her head to the right both spouting geysers of blood the orator then swung the sword down slicing into her remains but the silence that had fallen on the crowd was heavy awesome he stopped he had lost the moment he regained it swiftly may the sacred ancestral spirits grant her peace and purification he shouted his eyes roving stopping staring at each member of his congregation for it is not in hatred that i end her life but in compassion for her weakness she will find peace and forgiveness the spirits will understand but we must understand here in the motherland we cannot deviate from our cause we must be strong we must bourne had had enough of this maniac he was hatred incarnate and he was dead some time somewhere perhaps tonight if possible tonight delta unsheathed his knife and started to his right crawling through the dense medusan woods his pulse strangely quiet a furious core of certainty growing within him david webb had vanished there were so many things he could not remember from those clouded faraway days but there was much too that came back to him the specifics were unclear but not his instincts impulses directed him and he was at one with the darkness of the forest the jungle was not an adversary instead it was his ally for it had protected him before saved him before in those distant disordered memories the trees and the vines and the underbrush were his friends he moved through and around them like a wildcat surefooted and silent he turned to his left above the ancient glen and began his descent focusing on the tree where the assassin stood so casually the orator had once again altered his strategy in dealing with his congregation he was cutting his losses in place of cutting up another woman a sight the sons of mothers could barely accept regardless of any earthly cause the impassioned pleas of a dead mutilated female prisoner had to be put out of mind a master of his craft his art perhaps the orator knew when to revert to the gospel of love momentarily omitting lucifer aides had swiftly removed the evidence of violent death and the remaining woman was summoned with a gesture of the ceremonial sword she was no more than eighteen if that and a pretty girl weeping and vomiting as she was dragged forward your tears and your illness are not called for child said the orator in his most paternal voice it was always our intent to spare you for you were asked to perform duties beyond your competence at your age privileged to learn secrets beyond your understanding youth frequently speaks when it should be silent you were seen in the company of two hong kong brothers but not our brothers men who work for the disgraced english crown that enfeebled decadent government that sold out the motherland to our tormentors they gave you trinkets pretty jewellery and lip rouge and french perfume from kowloon now child what did you give them the young girl hysterically coughing vomit through her gag shook her head furiously the tears streaming down her face her hand was beneath a table between a mans legs in a caf on the guangquem shouted an accuser it was one of the pigs who work for the british added another youth is subject to arousal said the orator looking up at those who had spoken his eyes glaring as if commanding silence there is forgiveness in our hearts for such young exuberance as long as betrayal is no part of that arousal that exuberance she was at the qian men gate she was not in the tian an men i myself have determined it shouted the man with the sword your information is wrong the only question that remains is a simple one child did you speak of us could your words have been conveyed to our enemies here or in the south the girl writhed on the ground her whole body swaying frantically back and forth denying the implied accusation i accept your innocence as a father would but not your foolishness child you are too free with your associations your love of trinkets when these do not serve us they can be dangerous the young woman was put in the custody of a smug obese middleaged member of the chorus for instruction and reflective meditation from the expression on the older mans face it was clear that his mandate would be far more inclusive than that prescribed and when he was finished with her a childsiren who had elicited secrets from the beijing hierarchy who demanded young girls in the belief that such liaisons extended their lifespans would disappear two of the three remaining chinese men were literally put on trial the initial charge was trafficking in drugs their network the shanghaibeijing axis their crime however was not in the distribution of narcotics but in constantly skimming off the profits depositing huge sums of money into personal accounts in numerous hong kong banks several in the audience stepped forward to corroborate the damning evidence stating that as subordinate distributors they had given the twobosses great sums of cash never recorded in the organizations secret books that was the initial charge but not the major one it came with the orators highpitched singsong voice you travel south to kowloon once twice often three times a month the kai tak airport you screamed the zealot with the sword pointing to the prisoner on his left you flew back this afternoon you were in kowloon last night last night the kai tak we were betrayed last night at the kai tak the orator walked ominously out of the light of the torches to the two petrified men kneeling in front your devotion to money transcends your devotion to our cause he intoned like a sorrowful but angry patriarch brothers in blood and brothers in thievery weve known for many weeks now known because there was so much anxiety in your greed your money had to multiply like rodents in putrid sewers so you went to the criminal triads in hong kong how enterprising industrious and how grossly stupid you think certain triads are unknown to us or we to them you think there are not areas where our interests might converge you think they have less loathing for traitors than we do the two bound brothers grovelled in the dirt rising to their knees in supplication shaking their heads in denial their muted cries were pleas to be heard to be allowed to speak the orator approached the prisoner on his left and yanked the gag downward the rope scraping the mans flesh we betrayed no one great sir he shrieked i betrayed no one i was at the kai tak yes but only in the crowds to observe sir to be filled with joy to whom did you speak no one great sir oh yes the clerk to confirm my flight for the next morning sir that was all i swear on the spirits of our ancestors my young brothers and mine sir the money what about the money you stole not stole great sir i swear it we believed in our proud hearts hearts made proud by our cause that we could use the money to advantage for the true china every yuan of profit was to be returned to the cause the crowd thundered its response derisive catcalls were hurled at the prisoners dual thematic fugues of treachery and theft filled the glen the orator raised his arms for silence the voices trailed off let the word be spread he said slowly with gathering force those of our growing band who might harbour thoughts of betrayal be warned there is no mercy in us for none was shown us our cause is righteous and pure and even thoughts of treachery are an abomination spread the word you dont know who we are or where we are whether a bureaucrat in a ministry or a member of the security police we are nowhere and we are everywhere those who waver and doubt are dead the trial of these poisonous dogs is over its up to you my children the verdict was swift and unanimous guilty on the first count probable on the second the sentence one brother would die the other would live to be escorted south to hong kong where the money would be retrieved the choice was to be decided by the ageold ritual of yi zang li literally one funeral each man was given an identical knife with blades that were serrated and razor sharp the area of combat was a circle the diameter ten paces the two brothers faced each other and the savage ritual began as one made a desperate lunge and the other sidestepped away from the attack his blade lacerating the attackers face the duel within the deadly circle as well as the audiences primitive reactions to it covered whatever noise bourne made in his decision to move quickly he raced down through the underbrush snapping branches and slashing away the webbed reeds of high grass until he was twenty feet behind the tree where the assassin was standing he would return and move closer but first there was danjou echo had to know he was there the frenchman and the last male chinese prisoner were off to the right of the circle the guards flanking them jason crept forward as the crowd roared insults and encouragement at the gladiators one of the combatants both now covered with blood had delivered a nearfatal blow with his knife but the life he wanted to end would not surrender bourne was no more than eight or nine feet from danjou he felt around the ground and picked up a fallen branch with another roar from the crazed audience he snapped it twice from the three sections he held in his hand he stripped the foliage and reduced the bits of wood into manageable sticks he took aim and hurled the first end over end keeping the trajectory low it fell short of the frenchmans legs he threw the second it struck the back of echos knees danjou nodded his head twice to acknowledge deltas presence then the frenchman did a strange thing he began moving his head slowly back and forth echo was trying to tell him something suddenly danjous left leg collapsed and he fell to the ground he was yanked up harshly by the guard on his right but the mans concentration was on the bloody battle taking place within the onefuneral circle again echo shook his head slowly deliberately finally holding it steady and staring to his left his gaze on the greyhaired bystander who had moved away from the tree to watch the deadly combat and then he turned his head once more now directing his stare at the maniac with the sword danjou collapsed again this time struggling to his feet before the guard could touch him as he rose he moved his thin shoulders back and forth and breathing deeply bourne closed his eyes in the only brief moment of grief he could permit himself the message was clear echo was taking himself out telling delta to go after the impostor and while doing so to kill the evangelical butcher danjou knew he was too battered too weak to be any part of an escape he would only be an impediment and the impostor came first marie came first echos life was over but he would have his bonus in the maniacal butchers death the zealot who would surely take his life a deafening scream filled the glen the crowd was abruptly silent bourne snapped his head to the left where he could see beyond the edge of the row of onlookers what he saw was as sickening as anything he had observed during the past violent minutes the messianic orator had sunk his ceremonial sword in the neck of a combatant he pulled it out as the bloodied corpse rattled in death and sprawled on the ground the minister of killing raised his head and spoke surgeon yes sir said a voice from the crowd tend to the survivor mend him as best you can for his imminent journey south if id let this continue both would be dead and our money gone these closeknit families bring years of hostility to the yi zang li take his brother away and throw him into the swamps with the others all will be sweet carrion for the more aggressive birds yes sir a man with a black medicine bag stepped forward into the dirtringed circle as the dead body was hauled away and a stretcher appeared out of the darkness from the far end of the crowd everything had been planned everything considered the doctor administered a hypodermic into the arm of the moaning bloodcovered brother who was carried out of the circle of brotherly death wiping his sword with a fresh silk cloth the orator nodded his head in the direction of the two remaining prisoners stunned bourne watched as the chinese beside danjou calmly undid his bound wrists and reached up to the back of his neck untying the supposedly strangling strip of cloth and rope that had apparently kept his gaping mouth incapable of any sound but throaty moans the man walked over to the orator and spoke in a raised voice addressing both his leader and the crowd of followers he says nothing and he reveals nothing yet his chinese is fluent and he had every opportunity to speak to me before we boarded the truck and the gags were in place even then i communicated with him by loosening my own offering to do the same for him he refused he is obstinate and corruptly brave but i am sure he knows what he will not tell us tong ku long ku came wild shouts from the crowd demanding torture to these were added fen hong guil narrowing the site of the pain to be inflicted to the testicles of the occidental he is old and frail and will collapse into unconsciousness as he has done before insisted the false prisoner therefore i suggest the following with our leaders permission if theres a chance of success whatever you wish the orator said we have offered him his freedom in exchange for the information but he does not trust us hes been dealing with the marxists too long i propose taking our reluctant ally to the beijing airport and using my position to secure him passage on the next plane to kai tak i will clear him through immigration and all he must do before boarding with his ticket is give me the information what could be a greater show of trust we will be in the midst of our enemies and if his conscience is so offended all he has to do is raise his voice he has seen and heard more than any person who ever walked away from us alive we might in time become true allies but first there must be trust the orator studied the provocateurs face then shifted his gaze to danjou who stood erect peering out of his swollen eyes listening without expression then the man with the sword turned and addressed the greyhaired man by the tree suddenly speaking in english we have offered to spare this insignificant manipulator if he tells us where his comrade can be found do you agree the frenchman will lie to you said the killer in a clipped british accent stepping forward to what purpose asked the orator he has his life his freedom he has little or no regard for others his entire dossier is proof of that im not sure said the englishman they worked together in an outfit called medusa he talked about it all the time there were rules codes you might call them hell lie the infamous medusa was made up of human refuse men who would kill their brothers in the field if it could save their own lives the assassin shrugged you asked for my opinion he said thats it let us ask the one to whom we are prepared to offer mercy the orator reverted to mandarin issuing orders as the impostor returned to the tree and lit a cigarette danjou was brought forward untie his hands hes not going anywhere and remove the rope from his mouth let him be heard show him we can extend trust as well as less attractive aspects of our nature danjou shook his hands at his sides then raised his right and massaged his mouth your trust is as compassionate and convincing as your treatment of prisoners he said in english i forgot the orator raised his eyebrows you understand us somewhat more than you think echo replied good i prefer speaking english in a sense this is between us isnt itt theres nothing between us i try never to deal with madmen theyre so unpredictable danjou glanced over at the impostor by the tree ive made mistakes of course but somehow i think that one will be rectified you can live said the orator for how long longer than tonight the remainder is up to you your health and your abilities no its not its all ended when i walk off that plane in kai tak you wont miss as you did yesterday evening therell be no security forces no bulletproof limousines just one man walking in or out of the terminal and another with a silenced pistol or a knife as your rather unconvincing fellow prisoner put it ive been here tonight ive seen ive heard and what ive seen and heard marks me for death incidentally if he wonders why i didnt confide in him tell him he was far too obvious too anxious and that suddenly loosened mouthpiece really he could never become a pupil of mine like you he has unctuous words but hes fundamentally stupid like me yes and theres no excuse for you youre a welleducated man a world traveller its in your speech where did you study was it oxford cambridge the london school of economics said sheng chou yang unable to stop himself well done youre still proud of the old place as the english say yet for all that youre hollow a clown youre not a scholar not even a student only a zealot with no sense of reality youre a fool you dare say this to me kai sai zuan said echo turning to the crowd shenjing bing he added laughing explaining that he was conversing with a crazy corkscrew stop that wei shemme continued the enfeebled frenchman asking why including the crowd as he spoke in chinese youre taking these people to their oblivion because of your lunatic theories of changing lead into gold piss into wine but as that unfortunate woman said whose gold whose wine yours or theirst danjou swept his hand towards the crowd i warn you cried sheng in english you see shouted echo hoarsely weakly in mandarin he will not talk with me in your language he hides from you this spindlylegged little man with the big sword is it to make up for what he lacks elsewhere does he hack women with his blade because he has no other equipment and can do nothing else with them and look at that balloon head with the foolish flat top enough and the eyes of a screeching disobedient ugly child as i say hes nothing more than a crazy corkscrew why give him your time hell give you only piss in return no wine at all id stop it if i were you said sheng stepping forward with his sword theyll kill you before i do somehow i doubt that answered danjou in english your anger clouds your hearing monsieur windbag did you not detect a snicker or two i did gou le roared sheng chou yang ordering echo to be silent you will give us the information we must have he continued his shrill chinese the bark of a man accustomed to being obeyed the games are finished and we will not tolerate you any longer where is the killer you brought from macao over there said danjou casually gesturing his head towards the impostor not him the one who came before this madman you called back from the grave to avenge you where is your rendezvous where do you meet your base here in beijing where is it there is no rendezvous answered echo reverting to english no base of operations no plans to meet there were plans you people always concern yourselves with contingencies emergencies its how you survive survived past tense i fear sheng raised his sword you tell us or you die unpleasantly monsieur ill tell you this much if he could hear my voice i would explain to him that you are the one he must kill for you are the man who will bring all asia to its knees with millions drowning in oceans of their brothers blood he must tend to his own business i understand that but i would tell him with my last breath that you must be part of that business i would tell him to move quickly mesmerized by danjous performance bourne winced as if struck echo was sending a final signal move now jason reached into his left front pocket and pulled out the contents as he crawled swiftly through the woods beyond the staging area of the savage rituals he found a large rock rising several feet out of the ground the air was still behind it and its size more than enough to conceal his work as he started he could hear danjous voice it was weak and tremulous but nevertheless defiant echo was finding resources within himself not only to face his final moments but also to buy delta the precious few he needed dont be hasty mon general genghis khan or whoever you are i am an old man and your minions have done their work as you observed im not going anywhere on the other hand im not sure i care for where you intend to send me we were not clever enough to perceive the trap you set for us if we had been we would never have walked into it so why do you think we were clever enough to agree on a rendezvous because you did walk into it said sheng chou yang calmly you followed he followed the man from macao into the mausoleum the madman expected to come out your contingencies would include both chaos and a rendezvous on the surface your logic might appear unassailable where shouted sheng my inducement your lifer oh yes you mentioned that your time runs short i shall know my time monsieur a last message delta understood bourne struck a match cupping the flame and lit the thin wax candle the fuse embedded an eighth of an inch below the top he quickly crawled deeper into the woods unravelling the string attached to the two double rolls of fireworks he reached the end and started back towards the tree what guarantee do i have for my life persisted echo perversely enjoying himself a master of chess plotting his own inevitable death the truth replied sheng its all you need but my former pupil tells you that ill lie as you have lied so consistently this evening danjou paused and repeated his statement in mandarin liao jie he said to the onlookers asking if they understood stop that you repeat yourself incessantly you really must learn to control it its such a tiresome habit and my patience is at an end where is your madman in your line of work mon general patience is not only a virtue but a necessity hold shouted the impostor springing away from the tree astonishing everyone hes stalling you hes playing with you i know him for what reason asked sheng his sword poised i dont know said the british commando i just dont like it and thats reason enough for me ten feet behind the tree delta looked at the radium dial of his watch concentrating on the second hand he had timed the burning candle in the car and the time was now closing his eyes pleading with something he could not understand he grabbed a handful of earth and hurled it high to the right of the tree arcing it farther to the right of danjou as he heard the first drops of the shower echo raised his voice to the highest roar he could command deal with you he screamed i would as soon deal with the archangel of darkness i may yet have to but then again i may not for a merciful god will know that you have committed sins beyond any i have approached and i leave this earth wanting only to take you with me apart from your obscene brutality mon general you are a fatuous hollow bore a cruel joke on your people come die with me general dung with his final words danjou flung himself at sheng chou yang clawing at his face spitting into the wide astonished eyes sheng leaped back swinging the ceremonial sword slashing the blade into the frenchmans head mercifully quick it was over for echo it began a staccato burst of fireworks filled the glen resounding through the woods swelling in intensity as the stunned crowd reacted in shock men threw themselves to the ground others scrambled behind trees and into the underbrush yelling in panic frightened for their lives the impostor lurched behind the treetrunk crouching a weapon in his hand bourne the silencer affixed to his gun strode up to the killer and stood over him he took aim and fired blowing the weapon out of the other mans hand the flesh between the commandos thumb and forefinger erupting in blood the killer spun around his eyes wide his mouth gaping in shock jason fired again creasing his opponents cheekbone turn around ordered bourne shoving the barrel of his gun into the commandos left eye now grab the tree grab it both arms tight tighter jason rammed the weapon into the back of the killers neck as he peered around the trunk several of the torches that were stuck in the ground had been ripped up their flames extinguished another series of explosions came from deeper within the woods panicked men began to fire their guns in the direction of sounds the impostors leg moved then his right hand bourne fired two shots directly into the tree the bullets seared the wood shattering the bark less than an inch from the commandos skull he gripped the trunk his body still rigid keep your head to the left said jason harshly you move once more and its blown away where was he where was the killer maniac with the sword delta owed that much to echo where there the man with the fanatical eyes was rising from the ground looking everywhere at once shouting orders to those near him and demanding a weapon jason stepped away from the tree and raised his gun the zealots head stopped moving their eyes met bourne fired just as sheng pulled a guard in front of him the soldier arched backward his neck snapping under the impact of the bullets sheng held on to the body using it as a shield as jason fired twice more jolting the guards corpse he could not do it whoever the maniac was he was covered by a dead soldiers body delta could not do what echo had told him to do general dung would survive im sorry echo no time move echo was gone marie the impostor shifted his head trying to see bourne squeezed the trigger bark exploded in the killers face as he whipped his hands up to his eyes then shook his head blinking to regain his vision get up ordered jason gripping the assassins throat and pivoting the commando towards the path he had broken through the underbrush as he came down into the glen youre coming with me a third series of fireworks deeper still in the woods exploded in rapid overlapping bursts sheng chou yang screamed hysterically commanding his followers to go in two directions towards the vicinity of the tree and after the detonating sounds the explosions stopped as bourne propelled his prisoner into the brush ordering the killer to lie prone jasons foot on the back of his neck bourne crouched feeling the ground he picked up three rocks and threw them in the air one after another past the men searching the area around the tree each rock thrown farther away the diversion had its effect bu caodi nerr they began moving forward weapons at the ready several rushed ahead plunging into the scrub others joined them as the fourth and last cannonade of fireworks burst forth in spite of the distance the reports were as loud or louder than the previous explosions it was the final stage the climax of the display longer and more booming than the explosions preceding it delta knew that time was now measured in minutes and if ever a forest was a friend this one had to be now in moments perhaps seconds men would find the hollow shells of exploded fireworks strewn on the ground and the tactical distraction would be exposed a massive hysterical race for the gate would follow move ordered bourne grabbing the assassins hair pulling him to his feet and shoving him forward remember you bastard there isnt a trick youve learned i havent perfected and that makes up for a certain difference in our ages you look the wrong way youve got two bullet holes for eye sockets move out as they raced up the broken path through the wooded glen bourne reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of shells while the assassin ran in front of him breathlessly rubbing his eyes and wiping away the blood from his cheek jason removed the clip from his automatic replaced his full complement of bullets and cracked the magazine back into place hearing the sound of a weapon being dismantled the commando whipped his head around but realized he was too late the gun was reassembled bourne fired grazing the killers ear i warned you he said breathing loud but steadily where do you want it in the centre of your forehead he levelled the automatic in front of him good christ that butcher was right cried the british commando holding his ear you are a madman and youre dead unless you move faster they reached the corpse of the guard who had been posted on the narrow path leading down to the deep glen go to the right ordered jason where for christs sake i cant see theres a path youll feel the space move once on the bird sanctuarys series of dirt thoroughfares bourne kept jamming his automatic into the assassins spine forcing the killer to run faster faster for a moment david webb returned and a grateful delta acknowledged him webb was a runner a ferocious runner for reasons that went back in time and tortured memories past jason bourne to the infamous medusa racing feet and sweat and the wind against his face made living each day easier for david and at the moment jason bourne was breathing hard but nowhere near as breathlessly as the younger stronger man delta saw the glow of light in the sky the gate was through a field and past three dark twisting paths no more than half a mile he fired a shot between the commandos churning legs i want you to run faster he said imposing control on his voice as though the strenuous movement had little effect on him jesus i cant ive got no wind left find it commanded jason suddenly in the distance behind them they heard the hysterical shouts of men ordered by their maniacal leader back to the gate told to find and kill an intruder so dangerous that their very lives and fortunes were in the balance the jagged paper remnants of fireworks had been found a radio had been activated with no response from a gatehouse find him stop him kill him if you have any ideas major forget them yelled bourne major said the commando barely able to speak as he kept running youre an open book to me and what ive read makes me sick you watched danjou die like a slaughtered pig you grinned you bastard he wanted to die he wanted to kill me ill kill you if you stop running but before i do ill slice you up from your balls to your throat so slowly youll wish youd gone with the man who created you wheres my choice youll kill me anyway maybe i wont ponder it maybe im saving your life think about it the assassin ran faster they raced through the final dark path running into the open space of the floodlit gate the parking lot shouted jason the far right end bourne stopped hold it the bewildered assassin stood still in his tracks jason took out his penlight then aimed his automatic as he walked up to the killers back he fired five shots missing with one the floodlights exploded the gate fell into darkness and bourne rammed the gun into the base of the commandos skull he turned on the penlight shining it into the side of the assassins face the situation is in hand major he said the operation proceeds move you son of a bitch racing across the darkened parking lot the killer stumbled sprawling prone on the gravel jason fired twice in the glow of the penlight the bullets ricocheted away from the commandos head he got to his feet and continued running past the cars and the truck to the end of the lot the fence cried bourne in a loud whisper head over to it at the edge of the gravel he gave another order get on your hands and knees look straight ahead you turn around im the last thing youll see now crawl the assassin reached the broken opening in the fence start through it said jason once more reaching into his pocket for shells and quietly removing the automatics magazine stop he whispered when the psychotic former commando was halfway through he replaced the expended bullets in the darkness and cracked the magazine into its chamber just in case you were counting he said now get through there and crawl two lengths away from the fence hurry up as the assassin scrambled under the bent wire bourne crouched and surged through the opening inches behind him expecting otherwise the commando whipped around rising to his knees he was met by the beam of the penlight the glow illuminating the weapon levelled at his head id have done the same said jason getting to his feet id have thought the same now go back to the fence reach under and yank that section back into place quickly the killer did as he was told straining as he pulled the thick wire mesh down at the threequarter mark bourne spoke thats enough get up and walk past me with your hands behind your back go straight ahead shouldering your way through the branches my lights on your hands if you unclasp them ill kill you am i clear you think id snap a limb back in your face i would youre clear they reached the road in front of the eerily dark gate the distant shouts were clearer now the advance party nearer down the road said jason run three minutes later he snapped on the penlight stop he shouted that pile of green over there can you see it where asked the breathless assassin my beams on it theyre branches parts of the pine trees pull them away hurry up the commando began throwing the branches aside in moments revealing the black shanghai sedan it was time for the knapsack bourne spoke follow my light to the left of the bonnet to what the tree with the white notch on the trunk see it yes under it about eighteen inches in front theres loose dirt beneath theres a knapsack dig it out for me fucking technician arent you arent you without replying the sullen killer dug through the dirt and pulled the knapsack out of the ground with the straps in his right hand he stepped forward as if to hand the bag to his captor then suddenly he swung the knapsack sweeping it diagonally up towards jasons weapon and the penlight as he lunged forward the fingers ofhis hands spread like the extended claws of a huge furious cat bourne was prepared it was the precise moment he would have used to gain the advantage however transient for it would have given him the seconds he needed to race away into the darkness he stepped back smashing the automatic into the assassins head as the lunging figure passed him he crashed his knee down into the back of the splayedout commando grabbing the mans right arm while clenching the penlight between his teeth i warned you said jason yanking the killer up by his right arm but i also need you so instead of your life well do a little bulletsurgery he put the barrel of his automatic laterally against the flesh of the assassins arm muscle and pulled the trigger jesus screamed the killer as the spit echoed and blood erupted no bone was broken said delta only muscle tissue and now you can forget about using your arm youre fortunate that im a merciful man in that knapsack is gauze and tape and disinfectant you can repair yourself major then youre going to drive youll be my chauffeur in the peoples republic you see ill be in the back seat with my gun at your head and i have a map if i were you i wouldnt make a wrong turn twelve of sheng chou yangs men raced to the gate only four flashlights among them wei shemme cuo wu mafan feng kuangr you mao bing weifan a dozen screaming voices were raised against the unlit floodlights blaming everything and everyone from inefficiency to treachery the gatehouse was checked the electric switches and the telephone were found to be inoperative the guard nowhere in evidence several studied the coiled chain around the gates lock and issued orders to the others since none could get out they reasoned the offenders had to be inside the sanctuary biao shouted the infiltrator who had been the false prisoner quart bu zai zheli he shrieked telling the others to share the lights and search the parking lot the surrounding woods and the swamps beyond the hunters spread out guns extended racing across the parking area in different directions seven additional men arrived only one carrying a flashlight the false prisoner demanded it and proceeded to explain the situation so to form another search party he was countered by objections that one light among them was insufficient for the darkness in frustration the organizer roared a series of profanities ascribing incredible stupidity to everyone but himself the dancing flames of torches grew brighter as the last of the conspirators arrived from the glen led by the striding figure of sheng chou yang the ceremonial sword swinging at his side in its belted scabbard the infiltrator showed him the coiled chain and repeated his argument youre not thinking correctly said sheng exasperated your approach is wrong that chain was not placed there by one of our people to keep the criminal or criminals inside instead it was put there by the offender or the offenders to delay us to keep us inside but there are too many obstacles studied and considered shouted sheng chou yang must i repeat myself these people are survivors they stayed alive in that criminal battalion called medusa because they considered everything they climbed out impossible protested the younger man the top rail and the extended panel of barbed wire are electrified sir any weight in excess of thirty pounds activates them that way the birds and animals are not electrocuted then they found the source of the current and shut it off the switches are inside and at least seventyfive metres from the gate concealed in the ground even i am not sure where they are send someone up ordered sheng the subordinate looked around twenty feet away two men were talking quietly rapidly to each other it was unlikely either had heard the heated conversation you said the young leader pointing to the man on the left sir scale the fence yes sir the lesser subordinate ran to the fence and leaped up his hands gripping the open crisscrossing squares of wire mesh as his feet worked furiously below he reached the top and started over the angled panel of coiled barbed wire aiyaaa a shattering cascade of static was accompanied by blinding bluewhite bolts of fired electricity his body rigid his hair and eyebrows singed to their roots the climber fell backward hitting the earth with the impact of a heavy flat rock flashlight beams converged the man was dead the truck screamed sheng this is idiocy bring out the truck and break through do as i say instantly two men raced into the parking lot and within seconds the roar of the trucks powerful engine filled the night the gears whined as reverse was found the heavy truck lurched backward its whole chassis shaking violently until it came to a sudden leaden stop the deflated tyres spun smoke curling up from the burning rubber sheng chou yang stared in growing apprehension and fury the others he shrieked start the others all of them one by one the vehicles were started and one after another each lurched in reverse only to rattle and groan sinking into the soft gravel unable to move in a frenzy sheng ran up to the gate pulled out a gun and fired twice into the coiled chain a man on his right screamed holding his bleeding forehead as he fell to the ground sheng raised his face to the dark sky and screamed a primeval roar of protest he yanked out his ceremonial sword and began crashing it repeatedly down on the chained lock of the gate it was an exercise in futility the blade broke theres the house the one with the high stone wall said cia case officer matthew richards as he drove the car up the hill in victoria peak according to our information there are marines all over the place and it wont do me any goddamned good being seen with you i gather you want to owe me a few more dollars said alex conklin leaning forward and peering through the windshield its negotiable i just dont want to be involved for christs sake and dollars i havent got poor matt sad matt you take things too literally i dont know what youre talking about im not sure i do either but drive by the house as if you were going to somebody elses place ill tell you when to stop and let me out you will under conditions those are the dollars oh shit theyre not hard to take and i may not even call them in the way i see it now ill want to stay on ice and out of sight in other words i want a man inside ill call you several times a day asking you if our lunch or dinner dates are still on or whether ill see you at the happy valley race not there interrupted richards all right the wax museum anything that comes to mind except the track if you say no im busy ill know im not being closed in on if you say yes ill get out i dont even know where the hell youre staying you told me to pick you up on the corner of granville and carnarvon my guess is that your unit will be called in to keep the lines straight and the responsibility where it belongs the british will insist on it theyre not going to take a solo fall if dc blows it these are touchy times for the brits over here so theyll cover their colonial asses they passed the gate conklin shifted his gaze and studied the large victorian entrance i swear alex i dont know what youre talking about thats better yet do you agree are you my guru inside hell yes i can do without the marines fine stop here ill get out and walk back as far as anyones concerned i took the tram to the peak got a cab to the wrong house and made my way to the right address only a couple of hundred feet down the road are you happy matt ecstatic said the case officer scowling as he braked the car get a good nights sleep its been a long time since saigon and we all need more rest as we get older i heard you were a lush its not true is it you heard what we wanted you to hear replied conklin flatly this time however he was able to cross the fingers of both hands before he climbed awkwardly out of the car a brief knock and the door was flung open startled havilland looked up as edward mcallister his face ashen walked rapidly into the room conklins at the gate said the undersecretary hes demanding to see you and says hell stay there all night if he has to he also says if it gets chilly hell build a fire in the road to keep warm crippled or not he hasnt lost his panache said the ambassador this is totally unexpected continued mcallister massaging his right temple were not prepared for a confrontation it seems we havent a choice thats a public road out there and its the province of the colonys fire department in the event our neighbours become alarmed surely he wouldnt surely he would broke in havilland let him in this isnt only unexpected its extraordinary he hasnt had time to assemble his facts or organize an attack that would give him leverage hes openly exposing his involvement and given his background in covert to black operations he wouldnt do that lightly its far too dangerous he himself once gave the order for beyondsalvage we can presume hes in touch with the woman protested the undersecretary heading for the telephone on the ambassadors desk that gives him all the facts he needs no it doesnt she hasnt got them and you said mcallister his hand on the phone how does he know to come to you havilland smiled grimly all hed have to hear is that im in hong kong besides we spoke and im sure hes put it all together but this house hell never tell us conklins an old far east hand mr undersecretary and he has contacts we cant presume to know about and we wont know what brings him here unless hes admitted will we no we wont mcallister picked up the phone he dialled three digits officer of the guard let mr conklin through the gate search him for a weapon and escort him yourself to the east wing office he what admit him quickly and put the damn thing out what happened asked havilland as the undersecretary hung up the phone he started a fire on the other side of the road alexander conklin limped into the ornate victorian room as the marine officer closed the door havilland rose from the chair and came around the desk his hand extended mr conklin keep your hand mr ambassador i dont want to get infected i see anger precludes civility no i really dont want to catch anything as they say over here youre rotten joss youre carrying something a disease i think and what might that be death so melodramatic come mr conklin you can do better than that no i mean it less than twenty minutes ago i saw someone killed cut down in the street with forty or fifty bullets in her she was blown into the glass doors of her apartment house her driver shot up in the car i tell you the place is a mess blood and glass all over the pavement havillands eyes were wide with shock but it was the hysterical voice of mcallister that stopped the cia man her she was it the woman a woman said conklin turning to the undersecretary whose presence he had not yet acknowledged you mcallister yes i dont want to shake your hand either she was involved with both of you webbs wife is dead yelled the undersecretary his whole body paralysed no but thanks for the confirmation good god cried the longstanding ambassador of the state departments clandestine activities it was staples catherine staples give the man an exploding cigar and thanks again for the second confirmation are you planning to have dinner with the canadian consulates high commissioner soon id love to be there just to watch the renowned ambassador havilland at work gosh and golly i betcha us lowlevel types could learn an awful lot shut up you goddamned fool shouted havilland crossing behind the desk and plummeting into his chair he leaned back his eyes closed thats the one thing im not going to do said conklin stepping forward his club foot pounding the floor you are accountable sir the cia man leaned over gripping the edge of the desk just as youre accountable for whats happened to david and marie webb who the fuck do you think you are and if my language offends you sir look up the derivation of the offending word it comes from a term in the middle ages meaning to plant a seed in the ground and in a way thats your specialty only in your case theyre rotten seeds you dig in clean dirt and turn it into filth your seeds are lies and deception they grow inside people turning them into angry and frightened puppets dancing on your strings to your goddamned scenarios i repeat you aristocratic son of a bitch who the fuck do you think you are havilland half opened his heavylidded eyes and leaned forward his expression was that of an old man willing to die if only to remove the pain but those same eyes were alive with a cold fury that saw things others could not see would it serve your argument if i said to you that catherine staples said essentially the same thing to me serves it and completes it yet she was killed because she joined forces with us she didnt like doing that but in her judgement there was no alternative another puppet no a human being with a firstrate mind and a wealth of experience who understood what faced us i mourn her loss and the manner of her death more than you can imagine is it her loss sir or is it the fact that your holy operation was penetrated how dare you havilland his voice low and cold rose from the chair and stared at the cia man its a little late for you to be moralizing mr conklin your lapses have been all too apparent in the areas of deception and ethics if youd had your way thered be no david webb no jason bourne you put him beyondsalvage no one else did you planned his execution and nearly succeeded ive paid for that lapse christ how ive paid for it and i suspect youre still paying for it or you wouldnt be in hong kong now said the ambassador nodding his head slowly the coldness leaving his voice lower your cannons mr conklin and ill do the same catherine staples really did understand and if theres any meaning in her death lets try and find it i havent the vaguest idea where to start looking youll be given chapter and verse just as staples was maybe i shouldnt hear it i have no choice but to insist that you do i guess you werent listening youve been penetrated the staples woman was killed because it was assumed she had information that called for her to be taken out in short the mole whos bored his way in here saw her in a meeting or meetings with both of you the canadian connection was made the order given and you let her walk around without protection are you afraid for your life asked the ambassador constantly replied the cia man and right now im also concerned with someone elses webbs conklin paused studying the old diplomats face if what i believe is true he said quietly theres nothing i can do for delta that he cant do better for himself but if he doesnt make it i know what hed ask me to do protect marie and i can do that best by fighting you not listening to you and how do you propose fighting me the only way i know how down and very dirty ill spread the word in all those dark corners in washington that this time youve gone too far youve lost your grip maybe at your age even looney ive got maries story mo panovs morris panov interrupted havilland cautiously webbs psychiatrist you get another cigar and last of all my own contribution incidentally to jog your memory im the only one who talked to david before he came over here all together including the slaughter of a canadian foreign service officer theyd make interesting reading as affidavits carefully circulated of course by so doing youd jeopardize everything your problem not mine then again id have no choice said the ambassador ice once more in his eyes and in his voice as you issued an order for beyondsalvage id be forced to do the same you wouldnt leave here alive oh my god whispered mcallister from across the room thatd be the dumbest thing you could do said conklin his eyes locked with havillands you dont know what ive left behind or with whom or whats released if i dont make contact by a certain time with certain people and so on dont underestimate me we thought you might resort to that kind of tactic said the diplomat walking away from the cia man as if dismissing him and returning to his chair you also left something else behind mr conklin to put it kindly perhaps accurately you were known to have a chronic illness called alcoholism in anticipation of your imminent retirement and in recognition of your longpast accomplishments no disciplinary measures were taken but neither were you given any responsibility you were merely tolerated a useless relic about to go to pasture a drunk whose paranoid outbursts were the talk and concern of your colleagues whatever might surface from whatever source would be categorized and substantiated as the incoherent ramblings of a crippled psychopathic alcoholic the ambassador leaned back in the chair his elbow resting on the arm the long fingers of his right hand touching his chin you are to be pitied mr conklin not censured the dovetailing of events might be dramatized by your suicide havilland cried mcallister stunned rest easy mr undersecretary said the diplomat mr conklin and i know where were coming from weve both been there before theres a difference objected conklin his gaze never wavering from havillands eyes i never took any pleasure from the game you think i do the telephone rang havilland shot forward grabbing it yes the ambassador listened frowning staring at the darkened bay window if i dont sound shocked major its because the news reached me a few minutes ago no not the police but a man i want you to meet tonight say in two hours is that convenient yes hes one of us now havilland raised his eyes to conklin there are those who say hes better than most of us and i dare say his past service record might bear that out yes its he yes ill tell him what what did you say the diplomat again looked at the bay window the frown returning they covered themselves quickly didnt they two hours major havilland hung up the phone both elbows on the table his hands clasped he took a deep breath an exhausted old man gathering his thoughts about to speak his name is lin wenzu said conklin startling both havilland and mcallister hes crown ci which means mi orientated probably special branch hes chinese and uk educated and considered about the best intelligence officer in the territory only his size works against him hes easily spotted wheret mcallister took a step towards the cia man a little bird cock robin said conklin a redheaded cardinal i presume said the diplomat actually not any more replied alex i see havilland unclasped his hands lowering his arms on the desk he knows who you are too he should he was part of the detail at the kowloon station he told me to congratulate you to tell you that your olympian outraced them he got away hes sharp he knows where to find him but wont waste the time sharper still waste is waste he told you something else too and since i overheard your flattering assessment of my past would you care to tell me what it was then youll listen to me or be carried out in a box or boxes wheres the option yes quite true said the diplomat id have to go through with it you know i know you know hen general thats offensive so are you what did the major tell you a terrorist tong from macao telephoned the south china news agency claiming responsibility for the killings only they said the woman was incidental the driver was the target as a native member of the hated british secret security arm he had shot to death one of their leaders on the wanchai waterfront two weeks ago the information was correct he was the protection we assigned to catherine staples its a lie shouted conklin she was the target lin says its a waste of time to pursue a false source then he knows that weve been penetrated what the hell else said the exasperated cia man hes a proud zhongguo ren and has a brilliant mind he doesnt like failure in any form especially now i suspect hes started his hunt sit down mr conklin we have things to talk about i dont believe this cried mcallister in a deeply personal whisper you talk of killings of targets of beyondsalvage of a mockedup suicide the victim here talking about his own death as if you were discussing the dowjones or a restaurant menu what kind of people are you ive told you mr undersecretary said havilland gently men who do what others wont or cant or shouldnt theres no mystique no diabolical universities where we were trained no driving compulsion to destroy we drifted into these areas because there were voids to fill and the candidates were few its all rather accidental i suppose and with repetition you either find that you do or you dont have the stomach for it because somebody has to would you agree mr conklin this is a waste of time no its not corrected the diplomat explain to mr mcallister believe me hes valuable and we need him he has to understand us conklin looked at the undersecretary of state his expression without charity he doesnt need any explanations from me hes an analyst he sees it all as clearly as we do if not clearer he knows what the hell is going on down in the tunnels he just doesnt want to admit it and the easiest way to remove himself is to pretend to be shocked beware the sanctimonious intellect in any phase of this business what he gives in brains he takes away with phoney recriminations hes the deacon in a whorehouse gathering material for a sermon hell write when he goes home and plays with himself you were right before said mcallister turning towards the doon this is a waste of time edward havilland clearly angry with the crippled cia man called out sympathetically to the undersecretary we cant always choose the people we deal with which is obviously the case now i understand said mcallister coldly study everyone on lins staff went on the ambassador there cant be more than ten or twelve who know anything about us help him hes your friend yes he is said the undersecretary going out the door was that necessary snapped havilland when he and conklin were alone yes it was if you can convince me that what youve done was the only route you could take which i doubt or if i cant come up with an option thatll get marie and david out with their lives if not their sanity then ill have to work with you the alternative of beyondsalvage is unacceptable on several grounds basically personal but also because i owe the webbs do we agree so far we work together one way or another checkmate given the reality i want that son of a bitch mcallister that rabbit to know where im coming from hes in as deep as any of us and that intellect of his had better go down into the filth and come up with every plausibility and every possibility i want to know whom we should kill even those marginally arrived at to cut our losses and get the webbs out i want him to know that the only way he can save his soul is to bury it with accomplishment if we fail he fails and he cant go back teaching sunday school any more youre too harsh on him hes an analyst not an executioner where do you think the executioners get their input where do we get our input from whom the paladins of congressional oversight checkmate again youre as good as they say you were hes come up with the breakthroughs its why hes here talk to me sir said conklin sitting in the chair his back straight his club foot awkwardly at an angle i want to hear your story first the woman webbs wife shes all right shes safe the answer to your first question is so obvious i wonder how you can ask it no shes not all right her husbands missing and she doesnt know whether hes alive or dead as to the second yes shes safe with me not with you i can move us around and i know my way around you have to stay here were desperate pleaded the diplomat we need her youve also been penetrated that doesnt seem to sink in i wont expose her to that this house is a fortress all it takes is one rotten cook in the kitchen one lunatic on a staircase conklin listen to me we picked up a passport check everything fits its him we know it webbs in peking now he wouldnt have gone in if he wasnt after the target the only target if somehow god knows how your delta comes out with the merchandise and his wife isnt in place hell kill the one connection we must have without it were lost were all lost so that was the scenario from the beginning reductio ad absurdum jason bourne hunts jason bourne yes painfully simple but without the escalating complications he never would have agreed hed still be in that old house in maine poring over his scholarly papers we wouldnt have our hunter you really are a bastard said conklin slowly softly a certain admiration in his voice and you were convinced he could still do it still handle this kind of asia the way he did years ago as delta he has physical checkups every three months its part of the government protection programme hes in superb condition something to do with his obsessive running i understand start at the beginning the cia man settled into the chair i want to hear it step by step because i think the rumours are true im in the presence of a master bastard hardly mr conklin said havilland were all groping ill want your comments of course youll get them go ahead all right ill begin with a name im sure youll recognize sheng chou yang any comment hes a tough negotiator and i suspect that underneath his benevolent exterior theres a ramrod still hes one of the most reasonable men in peking there should be a thousand like him if there were the chances of a far east holocaust would be a thousand times greater lin wenzu slammed his fist down on the desk jarring the nine photographs in front of him and making the attached summaries of their dossiers leap off the surface which which one each had been certified by london each background checked and rechecked and triple checked again there was no room for error these were not simply wellschooled zhongguo ren selected by bureaucratic elimination but the products of an intensive search for the brightest minds in government and in several cases outside government who might be recruited into this most sensitive of services it had been lins contention that the writing was on the wall the great wall perhaps and that a superior special intelligence force manned by the colonys own could well be its first line of defence in the years leading up to and in the event of a takeover its first line of cohesive resistance afterwards the british had to relinquish leadership in the area of secret intelligence operations for reasons that were as clear as they were unpalatable to london the occidental could never fully understand the peculiar subtleties of the oriental mind and these were not the times to render misleading or poorly evaluated information london had to know the west had to know exactly where things stood for hong kongs sake for the sake of the entire far east not that lin believed that his growing task force of intelligence gatherers was pivotal to policy decisions he did not but he believed thoroughly intensely that if the colony was to have a special branch it should be staffed and run by those who could do the job best and that did not include veterans however brilliant of the europeanoriented british secret services for a start they all looked alike and were not compatible with either the environs or the language and after years of work and provenworth lin wenzu had been summoned to london and for three days grilled by unsmiling far east intelligence specialists on the morning of the fourth day however the smiles had appeared along with the recommendation that the major be given command of the hong kong branch with wide powers of authority and for a number of years thereafter he had lived up to the commissions confidence he knew that he also knew that now in the single most vital operation of his professional and personal life he had failed there were thirtyeight special branch officers in his command and he had selected nine hand picked nine to be part of this extraordinary insane operation insane until he had heard the ambassadors extraordinary explanation the nine were the most exceptional of the man task force each capable of assuming command if their leader was taken out he had written as much in their evaluation reports and he had failed one of the handpicked nine was a traitor it was pointless to restudy the dossiers whatever inconsistencies he might find would take too long to unearth for they or it had eluded his own experienced eyes as well as londons there was no time for intricate analyses the painfully slow exploration of nine individual lives he had only one choice a frontal assault on each man and the word front was intrinsic to his plan if he could play the role of a taipan he could play the part of a traitor he realized that his plan was not without risk a risk neither london nor the american havilland would tolerate but it had to be taken if he failed sheng chou yang would be alerted to the secret war against him and his counter moves could be disastrous but lin wenzu did not intend to fail if failure was written on the northern winds nothing else would matter least of all his life the major reached for his telephone he pushed the button on his console for the radio operator in the computerized communication centre of mi special branch yes sir said the voice from the white sterilized room who in dragonfly is still on duty asked lin naming the elite unit of nine who reported in but never gave explanations two sir in vehicles three and seven but i can reach the rest in a few minutes five have checked in theyre at home and the remaining two have left numbers one is at the pagoda cinema until eleventhirty when hell return to his flat but he can be reached by beeper until then the other is at the yacht club in aberdeen with his wife and her family shes english you know lin laughed softly no doubt charging the british familys bill to our woefully inadequate budget from london is that possible major if so would you consider me for dragonfly whatever it is dont be impertinent im sorry sir im joking young man next week ill take you to a fine dinner myself you do excellent work and i rely on you thank you sir the thanks are mine shall i contact dragonfly and put out an alert you may contact each and every one but quite the opposite of an alert theyve all been overworked without a clean day off in several weeks tell each of them that of course i want any changes of location to be reported but unless informed otherwise were secure for the next twentyfour hours and the men in vehicles three and seven may drive them home but not up into the territories for drinks tell them i said they should all get a good nights sleep or however they wish to pass the time yes sir theyll appreciate that sir i myself will be wandering around in vehicle four you may hear from me stay awake of course major youve got a dinner coming young man if i may sir said the enthusiastic radio operator and i know i speak for all of us we wouldnt care to work for anyone but you perhaps two dinners parked in front of an apartment house on yun ping road lin lifted the microphone out of its cradle below the dashboard radio its dragonfly zero yes sir switch me to a direct telephone line with a scrambler ill know were on scrambler when i hear the echo on my part of the call wont i naturally sir the faint echo pulsated over the line with the dial tone the major punched in the numbers the ringing began and a female voice answered yes mr zhou kuair said lin his words rushed telling the woman to hurry certainly she replied in cantonese zhou here said the man xun su xiaoxir lin spoke in a husky whisper it was the sound of a desperate man pleading to be heard sheng contact instantly sapphire is gone what who is this the major pressed down the bar and pushed a button to the right of the microphone the radio operator spoke instantly yes dragonfly patch into my private line also on scrambler and reroute all calls here right away this will be standard procedure until i instruct otherwise understood yes sir said a subdued radioman the mobile phone buzzed and lin picked it up speaking casually yes he answered feigning a yawn major this is zhou i just had a very strange call a man phoned me he sounded badly hurt and told me to contact someone named sheng i was to say that sapphire was gone sapphire said the major suddenly alert say nothing to anyone zhou damned computers i dont know how it happened but that call was meant for me this is beyond dragonfly i repeat say nothing to anyone understood sir lin started the car and drove several blocks west to tanlung street he repeated the exercise and again the call came over his private line major yes i just got off the phone with someone who sounded like he was dying he wanted me to the explanation was the same a dangerous error had been made beyond the purview of dragonfly nothing was to be repeated the order was understood lin called three more numbers each time from in front of each recipients apartment or boarding house all were negative each man reached him within moments after a call with his startling news and none had raced outside to a random sterile pay phone the major knew only one thing for certain whoever the infiltrator was he would not use his home phone to make contact telephone bills recorded all numbers dialled and all bills were submitted for departmental audit it was a routine containment procedure that was welcomed by the agents excess charges were picked up by special branch as if they were related to business the two men in vehicles three and seven having been relieved of duty had checked in with headquarters by the fifth telephone call one was at a girlfriends house and made it plain that he had no intention of leaving for the next twentyfour hours he pleaded with the radioman to take all emergency calls from clients telling everyone who tried to reach him that his superiors had sent him to the antarctic negative it was not the way of a double agent including the humour he neither cut himself off nor revealed the whereabouts or the identity of a drop the second man was if possible more negative he informed headquarterscommunications that he was available for any and all problems major or minor related or unrelated to dragonfly even to answering the phones his wife had recently given birth to triplets and he confided in a voice that bordered on panic according to the radioman he got more rest on the job than at home negative seven down and seven negative that left one man at the pagoda cinema for another forty minutes and the other at the yacht club in aberdeen his mobile phone hummed emphatically it seemed or was it his own anxiety yes i just received a message for you sir said the radio operator eagle to dragonfly zero urgent respond thank you lin looked at the clock in the centre of the dashboard he was thirtyfive minutes late for his appointment with havilland and the legendary crippled agent from years past alexander conklin young man said the major bringing the microphone back to his lips the line unbroken yes sir i have no time for the anxious if somewhat irrelevant eagle but i dont wish to offend him hell call again when i dont respond and i want you to explain that youve been unable to reach me of course when you do youll give me the message immediately it will be a delight major i beg your pardon the eagle who called was very disagreeable he shouted about appointments that should be kept when they were confirmed and that lin listened to the secondhand diatribe and made a mental note that if he survived the night he would talk to edward mcallister about telephone etiquette especially during emergencies sugar brought gentle expressions salt only grimaces yes yes i understand young man as our ancestors might say may the eagles beak be caught in its elimination canal just do as i say and in the meantime in fifteen minutes from now raise our man at the pagoda cinema when he calls in give him my unlisted fourth level number and patch it into this frequency scrambler continuing of course of course sir lin sped east on hennessy road past southern park to fleming where he turned south into johnston and east again on burrows street to the pagoda cinema he swerved into the parking lot taking the spot reserved for the assistant manager he stuck a police card in the front window got out and ran up to the entrance there were only a few people at the window for the midnight showing of lust in the orient an odd choice for the agent inside nevertheless to avoid calling attention to himself since he had six minutes to go he stood behind three men who were waiting in front of the booth ninety seconds later he had paid for and received his ticket he went inside gave it to the girl at the door and adjusted his eyes to the darkness and to the pornographic motion picture on the distant screen it was an odd choice of entertainment for the man he was testing but he had vowed to himself he would permit no prejudgements no balancing of one suspect against another it was admittedly difficult in this case however not that he particularly liked the man who was somewhere in that darkened theatre watching along with the feverishly attentive audience the sexual gymnastics of the wooden actors in truth he did not like the man he simply recognized the fact that he was among the best in his command the agent was arrogant and unpleasant but he was also a brave soul whose defection from beijing was eighteen months in the making his every hour in the communist capital a threat to his life he had been a highranking officer in the security forces with access to invaluable intelligence information and in a heartrending gesture of sacrifice he had left behind a beloved wife and girl child when he escaped south protecting them with a charred bulletridden corpse that he made sure was identified as himself a hero of china shot and then burned by a roving band of hoodlums in the recent crime wave that had swept through the mainland mother and daughter were secure pensioned by the government and like all highlevel defectors he was subjected to the most rigorous examinations designed to trap potential infiltrators here his arrogance had actually helped him he had made no attempt to ingratiate himself he was what he was and he had done what he had done for the good of mother china the authorities could either accept him with all he had to offer or he would look elsewhere everything checked except the wellbeing of his wife and child they were not being taken care of in the manner the defector had expected therefore money was filtered through to her place of work without explanation she could be told nothing if there was the slightest suspicion that her husband was alive she could be tortured for information she did not possess the indepth profile of such a man was not the profile of a double agent regardless of his taste in films that left the man in aberdeen and he was something of a puzzle to lin the agent was older than the others a small man who always dressed impeccably a logician and former accountant who professed such loyalty that lin almost made him a confidant but had pulled himself up short when he was close to revealing things he should not reveal perhaps because the man was nearer his own age he felt a stronger kinship on the other hand what an extraordinary cover for a mole from beijing married to an english woman a member of the rich and social yacht club by way of marriage everything was in place for him he was respectability itself it seemed incredible to lin his closest colleague that the irascible older man who imposed such order but still wanted to arrest an australian brawler for causing dragonfly to lose face could have been reached by sheng chou yang and corrupted no impossible perhaps thought the major he should go back and examine further a comical offduty agent who wanted all clients to be told he was in the antarctic or the overworked father of triplets who was willing to answer phones to escape his domestic chores these speculations were not in order lin wenzu shook his head as if ridding his mind of such thoughts now here concentrate his sudden decision to move came from the sight of a stairway he walked over to it and climbed the steps to the balcony the projection room was directly in front of him he knocked once on the door and went inside the weight of his body breaking the cheap thin bolt on the door ting zhil yelled the projectionist a woman was on his lap his hand under her skirt the young woman leaped away from her perch turning to the wall crown police said the major showing his identification and i mean no harm to either of you please believe that you shouldnt replied the projectionist this isnt exactly a place of worship that might be disputed but it certainly isnt a church we operate with a fully paid licence you have no argument from me sir interrupted lin the crown simply needs a favour and it could hardly be against your interests to provide it what is it asked the man getting up angrily watching the woman slip through the door stop the film for say thirty seconds and turn up the lights announce to the audience that there was a break and that it will be repaired quickly the projectionist winced its almost over therell be screaming as long as there are lights do it i the projector ground down with a whir the lights came up and the announcement was made over the loudspeaker trie projectionist was right catcalls echoed throughout the motion picture house accompanied by waving arms and numerous extended third fingers lins eyes scanned the audience back and forth row by row there was his man two men the agent was leaning forward talking to someone lin wenzu had never seen before the major looked at his watch then turned to the projectionist is there a public phone downstairs when it works there is when it isnt broken is it working now i dont know where is it below the staircase thank you start the film again in sixty seconds you said thirty ive changed my mind and you do enjoy the privileges of a good job because of a licence dont you theyre animals down there put a chair against the door said lin going outside the locks broken in the lobby beneath the staircase the major passed the exposed pay phone barely pausing he yanked the spiral cord out of the box and proceeded outside to his car stopping at the sight of a phone booth across the road he raced over and read the number instantly memorizing it and ran back to the car he climbed into the seat and looked at his watch he backed up the car drove out into the street and double parked several hundred feet beyond the cinemas marquee he turned his headlights off and watched the entrance a minute and fifteen seconds later the defector from beijing emerged looking first to his right then to his left obviously agitated he then looked straight ahead seeing what he wanted to see what lin expected him to see since the telephone in the theatre was not working it was the phone booth on the other side of the road lin dialled as his subordinate ran over to it spinning into the plastic shell that faced the street it rang before the man could insert his coins xun su xiao xi lin coughed as he whispered i knew you would find the phone sheng contact instantly sapphire is gone he replaced the microphone but left his hand on the instrument expecting to remove it with the agents incoming call on his private line it did not come he turned in his seat and looked back at the open plastic shell of the pay phone across the road the agent had dialled another number but the defector was not speaking to him there was no need to drive to aberdeen the major silently got out of the car walked across the street into the shadows of the far pavement and started towards the pay phone he stayed in the relative darkness moving slowly calling as little attention to his bulk as he could cursing as he often did the genes that had produced his outsized figure remaining well back in the shadows he approached the phone the defector was eight feet away his back to lin talking excitedly exasperation in every sentence who is sapphire why this telephone why would he reach me no i told you he used the leaders name yes thats right his name no code no symbol it was insane lin wenzu heard all he had to hear he pulled out his service automatic and walked rapidly out of the darkness the film broke and they turned up the lights my contact and i were hang up the phone ordered the major the defector spun around you he screamed lin rushed the man his immense body crushing the double agent into the plastic shell as he grabbed the phone smashing it into the metal box enough he roared suddenly he felt the blade slicing with icecold heat into his abdomen the defector crouched the knife in his left hand and lin squeezed the trigger the explosion filled the quiet street as the traitor dropped to the pavement his throat ripped open by the bullet blood streaming down his clothes staining the concrete below m made screamed a voice on the majors left cursing him it was the second man the contact who had been inside the theatre talking with the defector he raised a gun and fired as the major lunged his huge bleeding torso falling into the man like a wall flesh blew apart in lins upper right chest but the killers balance was shaken the major fired his automatic the man fell clutching his right eye he was dead across the street the pornographic film had ended and the crowd began to emerge on the street sullen angry ungratified and with what remained of his enormous strength the badly wounded lin picked up the bodies of the two dead conspirators and half dragged half carried them back to his car a number of people from the pagodas audience watched him with glazed or distinterested stares what they saw was a reality they could not contend with or comprehend it was beyond the narrow confines of their fantasies alex conklin rose from the chair and limped awkwardly noisily to the darkened bay window what the hell do you want me to say he asked turning and looking at the ambassador that given the circumstances i took the only road open to me the only one that would have recruited jason bourne havilland held up his hand before you answer i should tell you in all fairness that catherine staples did not agree with me she felt i should have appealed to david webb directly he was after all a far east scholar an expert who would understand the stakes the tragedy that could follow she was nuts said alex he would have told you to shove it thank you for that the diplomat nodded his head just hold it conklin broke in he would have said that to you not because he thought you were wrong but because he didnt think he could do it what you did by taking marie away from him was to make him go back and be someone he wanted to forget oh you really are one son of a bitch you son of a bitch sirens suddenly erupted ringing throughout the enormous house and the grounds as searchlights began spinning through the windows gunfire accompanied the sound of smashing metal as tyres screeched outside the ambassador and the cia man lurched to the floor in seconds it was all over both men got to their feet as the door was crashed open his chest and stomach drenched in blood lin wenzu staggered in carrying two dead bodies under his arms here is your traitor sir said the major dropping both corpses and a colleague with these two i believe weve cut off dragonfly from sheng wenzus eyes rolled upward until the sockets were white he gasped and fell to the floor call an ambulance shouted havilland to the people who had gathered at the door get gauze tape towels antiseptic for christs sake anything you can find yelled conklin limping racing over to the fallen chinese stop the goddamned bleeding bourne sat in the racing shadows of the back seat the intermittent moonlight bright creating brief explosions of light and dark inside the car at sudden irregular unexpected moments he leaned forward and pressed the barrel of his gun into the back of his prisoners neck try crashing off the road and theres a bullet in your head do you understand me and always there was the same reply or a variation of it spoken in a clipped british accent im not a fool youre behind me and youve got a weapon and i cant see you jason had ripped the rearview mirror from its bracket the bolt having cracked easily in his hand then im your eyes back here remember that im also the end of your life understood the former commando officer repeated without expression the government road map spread out on his lap the penlight cupped in his left hand the automatic in his right bourne studied the roads heading south as each half hour passed and landmarks were spotted jason understood that time was his enemy although the assassins right arm was effectively immobilized in sheer stamina bourne knew he was no match for the younger stronger man the concentrated violence of the last three days had taken its toll physically mentally and whether he cared to acknowledge it or not emotionally and while jason bourne did not have to acknowledge it david webb proclaimed it with every fibre of his emotional being the scholar had to be kept at bay deep down inside his voice stilled leave me alone youre worthless to me every now and then jason felt the dead weight of his lids closing over his eyes he would snap them open and abuse some part of his body pinching hard the soft sensitive flesh of his inner thigh or digging his nails into his lips creating instant pain to dispel the exhaustion he recognized his condition only a suicidal fool would not and there was no time or place to remedy it with an axiom he had stolen from medusas echo rest is a weapon never forget it forget it echo brave echo theres no time for rest no place to find it and while he accepted his own assessment of himself he also had to accept his evaluation of his prisoner the killer was totally alert his sharpness was in his skill at the wheel for jason demanded speed over the strange unfamiliar roads it was in his constantly moving head and it was in his eyes whenever bourne saw them and he saw them frequently whenever he directed the assassin to slow down and watch for an offshooting road on the right or the left the impostor would turn in the seat the sight of his so familiar features always a shock to jason and ask whether the road ahead was the one his eyes watched the questions were superfluous the former commando was continuously making his own assessment of his captors physical and mental condition he was a trained killer a lethal machine who knew that survival depended on gaining the advantage over his enemy he was waiting watching anticipating the moment when his adversarys eyelids might close for that brief instant or when the weapon might suddenly drop to the floor or his enemys head might recline for a second into the comfort of the back seat these were the signs he was waiting for the lapses he could capitalize on to violently alter the circumstances bournes defence therefore depended upon his mind in doing the unexpected so that the psychological balance remained in his favour how long could it last could he last time was his enemy the assassin in front of him a secondary problem in his past that vaguely remembered past he had handled killers before manipulated them before because they were human beings subject to the wiles of his imagination christ it came down to that so simple so logical and he was so tired his mind there was nothing else left he had to keep thinking had to keep prodding his imagination and make it do its work balance balance he had to keep it on his side think act do the unexpected he removed the silencer from his weapon levelled the gun at the closed right front window and pulled the trigger the explosion was earshattering reverberating throughout the enclosed car as the glass splintered blowing out into the rushing night air what the hell was that for screamed the impostorkiller clutching the wheel holding an involuntary swerve in control to teach you about balance answered jason you should understand that im unbalanced the next shot could blow your head away youre a fucking lunatic thats what you are im glad you understand the map one of the more civilized things about a prc road map and consistent with the quality of its vehicles was the system of stars to indicate garages which were open hours a day along the major routesone had only to think of the confusion that might result from military and official vehicles breaking down to understand the necessity it was heavensent for bourne theres a gas station about four miles down this road he said to the assassin to jason bourne he reflected stop and refill and dont say a word which would be foolish if you tried because you cant speak the language you do its why im the original and youre the fake you can bloody well have it mr original jason fired the gun again blowing the rest of the window away the face he yelled raising his voice over the sound of the wind remember that time was the enemy he took a mental inventory of what he had and it was not all that much money was his primary ammunition he had more than a hundred chinese could make in a hundred lifetimes but money in itself was not the answer only time was the answer if he had a prayer of a chance to get out of the vast land of china it had to be by air not on the ground he would not last that long again he studied the map it would take thirteen to fifteen hours to reach shanghai the car held up and if he held up and if they could get by the provincial checkpoints where he knew there would be alarms out for a westerner or two westerners attempting to pass through he would be taken they would be taken and even if they reached shanghai with its relatively lax airport how many complications might arise there was an option there were always options it was crazy and outrageous but it was the only thing left time was the enemy do it there is no other choice he circled a small symbol on the outskirts of the city of jinan an airport dawn wetness everywhere the ground the tall grass and the metal fence glistened with morning dew the single runway beyond was a shining black shaft cutting across the closecropped field half green with todays moisture half dullish brown from the pounding of yesterdays broiling sun the shanghai sedan was far off the airport road as far off as the assassin could drive it again concealed by foliage the impostor was once more immobilized now by the thumbs pressing the gun into his right temple jason had ordered the assassin to wind the spools of wire into double slipknots around each thumb and then he had snapped the spools away with his cutter ran the wire back and coiled the two remaining strands tightly around the killers wrists as the commando discovered with any slight pressure such as twisting or separating his hands the wire dug deeper into his flesh if i were you said bourne id be careful can you imagine what it would be like having no thumbs or if your wrists were cut fucking technician believe it across the airfield a light was turned on in a onestorey building with a row of small windows along the side it was a barracks of sorts simple in design and functional then there were other lights naked bulbs the glows more like glares a barracks jason reached for the coiled roll of clothing he had removed from the small of his back he undid the straps unfurled the garments over the grass and separated them there was a large mao jacket a pair of rumpled outsized trousers and a visored cloth hat that was standard peasant wear he put on the hat and the jacket buttoning the latter over his dark sweater then stood up and pulled the large trousers over his own a webbed cloth belt held them in place he smoothed the drab bulky jacket over the trousers and turned to the impostor who was watching him with astonishment and curiosity get over to the fence said jason bending down and digging into his knapsack get on your knees and lean into it he continued pulling out a fivefoot length of thin nylon rope press your face into the links eyes front hurry up the killer did as he was told his bound hands awkwardly painfully in front of him between his body and the fence his head pressed into the wire mesh bourne walked rapidly over and quickly threaded the rope through the fence on the right side of the killers neck and with his fingers reaching through the open squares he swung the line across the commandos face and pulled the rope back through he yanked it taut and knotted it at the base of the impostors skull he had worked so swiftly and so unexpectedly that the former officer could barely get out the words before he realized what had happened what the hell are you oh christ as that maniac remarked about danjou before he hacked into his head youre not going anywhere major youre going to leave me here asked the killer stunned dont be foolish were on the buddy system where i go you go actually youre going first where through the fence said jason taking the wirecutter from the knapsack he began cutting a pattern around the assassins torso relieved that the wire links were nowhere near as thick as those at the bird sanctuary the outline complete bourne stepped back and raised his right foot placing it between the impostors shoulder blades he shoved his leg forward killer and fence fell collapsing into the grass on the other side jesus cried the commando in pain pretty fucking funny arent you i dont feel remotely amusing replied jason every move i make is very unfunny very serious get up and keep your voice down for christs sake im tied to the damn fence its free get up and turn around awkwardly the assassin staggered to his feet bourne surveyed his work the sight of the outline of wire mesh attached to the killers upper body as though held in place by a protruding nose was funny but the reason for its being there was not funny at all only with the assassin secure in front of his eyes was all risk eliminated jason could not control what he could not see and what he could not see could cost him his life far more important the life of david webbs wife even david webb stay away from me dont interfere were too close bourne reached over and yanked the bowknot free holding on to one end of the line the fence fell away and before the assassin could adjust jason whipped the rope around the commandos head raising it so that the line was caught in the killers mouth he pulled it tight tighter stretching the assassins jaw open until it was a gaping dark hole surrounded by a border of white teeth the flesh creased in place unintelligible sounds emerging from the commandos throat i cant take credit for this major said bourne knotting the thin nylon rope the remaining thirtyodd inches hanging loose i watched danjou and the others they couldnt talk they could only gag on their own vomit you saw them too and you grinned how does it feel major oh i forgot you cant answer can you he shoved the assassin forward then gripped his shoulder sending him to the left well skirt the end of the runway he said move as they rounded the airfield grass staying in the darkness of the borders jason studied the relatively primitive airport beyond the barracks was a small circular building with a profusion of glass but no lights shining except a single glare in a small square structure set in the centre of the roof the building was jinans terminal he thought the barelylit square on top the control tower to the left of the barracks at least two hundred feet to the west was a dark open highceilinged maintenance hangar with huge wheeled ladders near the wide doors reflecting the early light it was apparently deserted the crews still in their quarters down in the southern perimeter of the field on both sides of the runway and barely discernible were five aircraft all props and none imposing jinan airport was a secondary even tertiary landing field undoubtedly being upgraded as were so many airports in china in the cause of foreign investment but still a long way from international status then again the air corridors were channels in the sky and not subject to the cosmetic or technological whims of airports one simply had to enter those channels and stay on course the sky acknowledged no borders only earthbound men and machines did combined they were another problem were going into the hangar whispered jason jabbing the commandos back remember if you make any noise i wont have to kill you they will and ill have my chance to get away because youll be giving it to me dont doubt it get down thirty yards away a guard walked out of the cavernous structure a rifle slung over his shoulder his arms stretching as his chest swelled with a yawn bourne knew it was the moment to act a better one might not present itself the assassin was prone his wirebound hands beneath him his gaping mouth pressed into the earth grabbing the loose nylon rope jason gripped the killers hair yanking up his head and looped the line twice around the commandos neck you move you choke whispered bourne getting to his feet he ran silently to the hangars wall then quickly walked to the corner and peered around the edge the guard had barely moved then jason understood the man was urinating perfectly natural and perfectly perfect bourne stepped away from the building dug his right foot into the grass and rushed forward his weapon a rigid right hand preceded by an arcing left foot striking the base of the guards spine the man collapsed unconscious jason dragged him back to the corner of the hangar then across the grass to where the assassin lay immobile afraid to move youre learning major said bourne again grabbing the commandos hair and pulling the nylon rope from around his neck the fact that the looped rope would not have choked the impostor any more than a loose clothesline wound around a persons neck would told delta something his prisoner could not think geometrically stresses were not a strong point in the killers imagination only the spoken threat of death it was something to bear in mind get up ordered jason the assassin did so his gaping mouth swallowing air his eyes furious hatred in his stare think about echo said bourne his own eyes returning the killers loathing excuse me i mean danjou the man who gave you your life back a life at any rate and one you apparently took to your pygmalion old chap now hear me and hear me well would you like the rope removed auggh grunted the assassin nodding his head his eyes reduced from hatred to pleading and your thumbs released auggh auggh youre not a guerrilla youre a gorilla said jason pulling the automatic from his belt but as we used to say in the old days before your time chap there are conditions you see we both either get out of here alive or we disappear our mortal remains consigned to a chinese fire no past no present certainly no retrospective regarding our subzero contributions to society i see im boring you sorry ill forget the whole thing auggh okay if you insist naturally i wont give you a weapon and if i see you trying to grab one which i will if you try youre dead but if you behave we might just might get away what im really saying to you mr bourne is that whoever your client is over here cant allow you to live anymore than he can me understand dig capisce auggh one thing more added jason tugging at the rope that fell over the commandos shoulder this is nylon or polyurethane or whatever the hell they call it when its burned it just swells up like a marshmallow theres no way you can untie it itll be attached to both your ankles both knots curled up into cement youll have a stepspan of approximately five feet only because im a technician do i make myself clear the assassin nodded and as he did so bourne sprang to his right kicking the back of the commandos knees sending the impostor to the ground his bound thumbs bleeding jason knelt down the gun in his left hand pressed into the killers mouth the fingers of his right undoing the bowknot behind the commandos head christ almighty cried the assassin as the rope fell away im glad youre of a religious persuasion said bourne dropping the weapon and rapidly lashing the rope around the commandos ankles forming a square knot on each he ignited his lighter and fired the ends you may need it he picked up the gun held it against the killers forehead and uncoiled the wire around his prisoners wrists take off the rest he ordered be careful with the thumbs theyre damaged my right arms no piece of cake either said the englishman struggling to remove the slipknots his hands freed the assassin shook them then sucked the blood from his wounds you got your magic box mr bourne he asked always an arms length away mr bourne replied jason what do you need tape fingers bleed its called gravity youre so well schooled bourne reached behind him for the knapsack and pulled it forward dropping it in front of the commando his gun levelled at the killers head feel around its a spool near the top got it said the assassin removing the tape and rapidly winding it around his thumbs this is one rotten fucking thing to do to anybody he added when he had finished think of danjou said jason flatly he wanted to die for christs sake what the hell was i supposed to do nothing because you are nothing well then that kind of puts me on your level doesnt it sport he made me into you you dont have the talent said jason bourne youre lacking you cant think geometrically what does that mean ponder it delta rose to his feet get up he commanded tell me said the assassin pushing himself off the ground and staring at the weapon aimed at his head why me why did you ever get out of the business because i was never in it suddenly floodlights one after another began to wash over the field and with a single brilliant illumination yellow marker lights appeared along the entire length of the runway men ran out of the barracks a number towards the hangar others behind their quarters where the engines of unseen vehicles abruptly roared the lights of the terminal were turned on activity was at once everywhere take his jacket off and the hat ordered bourne pointing the gun at the unconscious guard put them on they wont fit you can have them altered in savile row move the impostor did as he was told his right arm so much a problem that jason had to hold the sleeve for him with bourne prodding the commando with the gun both men ran to the wall of the hangar then moved cautiously towards the end of the building do we agree asked bourne whispering looking at the face that was so like his own years ago we get out or we die understood answered the commando that screaming bastard with his bloody fancy sword is a fucking lunatic i want out that reaction wasnt on your face if it had been the maniac might have turned on me who is her never got a name only a series of connections to reach him the first was a man at the guangdong garrison named soo jiang ive heard the name they call him the pig its probably accurate i dont know then what a number is left at table five at a casino in the kam pek macao interrupted jason what then i call the number and speak french this soo jiang is one of the few slants who speak the language he sets the time of the meet its always the same place i go across the border to a field up in the hills where a chopper comes in and someone gives me the name of the target and half the money for the kill look here it conies hes circling into his approach my guns at your head understood did your training include flying one of those things no only jumping out of them that wont do us any good the incoming plane its lights blinking swept down out of the brightening sky towards the runway the jet landed smoothly it taxied to the end of the asphalt swung to the right and headed back to the terminal kai guan qi you shouted a voice from in front of the hangar the man pointing at three fuel trucks off to the side explaining which one was to be used theyre gassing up said jason the planes taking off again lets get on it the assassin turned his face that face pleading for christs sake give me a knife something nothing i can help this is my show major not yours with a knife youd slice my stomach apart no way chap da long xia cried the same voice from in front of the hangar describing government officials in terms of large crayfish fang song he continued telling everyone to relax that the plane would taxi away from the terminal and the first of the three fuel trucks should be driven out to meet it the officials disembarked the jet circled in place and began charging back over the runway while the tower instructed the pilot where he would refuel the truck raced out men leaped from the carriage and began pulling the hoses from their recesses itll take about ten minutes said the assassin its a chinese version of an upgraded dcthree the aircraft came to a stop the engines cut as rolling ladders were pushed to the wings and men scaled them the fuel tanks were opened the nozzles inserted amid constant chatter between the maintenance crews suddenly the hatch door in the centre of the fuselage was reopened the metal steps slapping down to the ground two men in uniform walked out the pilot and his flight officer said bourne and theyre not stretching their legs theyre checking every damn thing those people are doing well time this very carefully major and when i say move you move straight to the hatch agreed the assassin when the second bloke hits the first step thats about it diversion in what way you had a pretty fancy one last night you had your own yank fourth of july you did wrong way besides i used them all up wait a minute the fuel truck you blow it there goes the plane also you couldnt time it to the blokes getting back on board not that truck said jason shaking his head and staring beyond the commando the one over there bourne gestured at the nearer of the two red trucks directly in front of them about a hundred feet away if it went up the first order of business would be to get the plane out of there and wed be a lot closer than we are now lets do it no corrected jason youll do it exactly the way i tell you with my gun inches from your head move the assassin in front they raced out to the truck covered by the dim light and the commotion around the plane the pilot and his flight officer were shining flashlights over the engines and barking impatient orders to the maintenance crews bourne ordered the commando to crouch down in front of him as he knelt over the open knapsack and withdrew the roll of gauze he removed the hunting knife from his belt pulled a coiled hose off its rack dropping it to the ground and slid his left hand to the base where it entered the tank check them he told the commando how much longer and move slowly major im watching you i said i wanted out im not going to screw up sure you want out but ive got a hunch youd rather go it alone the thought never occurred to me then youre not my man thanks a lot no i meant it the thought would have occurred to me how much longer between two and three minutes as i judge how good is your judgement twentyodd missions in oman yemen and points south aircraft similar in structure and mechanism i know it all sport its old hat two to three minutes no more than that good get back here jason pricked the hose with his knife and made a small incision enough to permit a steady stream of fuel to flow out but little enough so that the pump barely operated he rose to his feet covering the assassin with his gun as he handed him the roll of gauze pull out about six feet and drench it with the fuel thats leaking down there the killer knelt down and followed bournes instructions now continued jason stuff the end into the slit where ive cut the hose farther farther use your thumb my arms not what it used to be your left hand is press harder bourne looked quickly over at the refuelling refuelled aircraft the commandos judgement had been accurate men were climbing off the wings and winding the hoses back into the fuel truck suddenly the pilot and the flight officer were making their final check they would head for the hatch door in less than a minute jason reached into his pocket for matches and threw them down in front of the assassin his weapon levelled at the killers head light it now itll go up like a goddamned stick of nitro itll blow us both into the sky especially me not if you do it right lay the gauze on the grass its wet retarding the fire hurry up do it done the flame leaped up from the end of the cloth strip then instantly fell back and began its gradual march up the gauge bloody technician said the commando under his breath as he rose to his feet get in front of me ordered bourne as he strung the knapsack to his belt start walking straight forward lower your height and shrink your shoulders like you did in lo wu jesus christ you were move the fuel truck began backing away from the plane then circled forward swinging around the rolling ladders heading to its left beyond where the first red truck was parked and circling again now to the right behind both stationary trucks to take up its position next to the one with the lighted gauze heading into its fuel tank jason whipped his head around his eyes riveted on the fired tape it had burst into its final flame one spark entering the leaking valve and the exploding tank would send hot metal into its sister trucks vulnerable shells any second the pilot gestured to his flight officer they marched together towards the hatch door faster yelled bourne be ready to run when youll know keep your shoulders low bend your spine goddamn it they turned right towards the plane passing through an oncoming crowd of maintenance personnel heading back to the hangar gongju ne cried jason admonishing a colleague for having left behind a valuable set of tools by the aircraft gongju shouted a man at the end of the crowd grabbing bournes arm and holding up a toolbox their eyes met and the crewman was stunned his face contorted in shock tian a he screamed it happened it was too late for even consequential revelations the fuel truck exploded sending erratic pillows of fire pulsating into the sky as deadly shards of twisted metal pierced the space above and to the sides of the flaming vehicle the crews screamed en masse men raced in all directions most to the protection of the hangar run shouted jason the assassin did not have to be told both men raced to the plane and the hatch door where the pilot who had climbed inside was peering out in astonishment while the flight officer remained frozen on the ladder kuair yelled bourne keeping his face in the shadows and forcing the commandos head down on the metal steps wei fengi he added screaming telling the pilot to get out of the fire zone for the safety of the plane that he was maintenance and would secure the hatchway a second truck blew up the opposing walls of explosives forming a volcanic eruption of fire and spewing metal youre right shouted the pilot in chinese grabbing his officer copilot by the shirt and pulling him inside both raced up the short aisle to the flight deck it was the moment thought jason he wondered get in he ordered the commando as the third fuel truck blasted over the field and into the early light right yelled the assassin raising his head and straightening his body for the leap up the steps then suddenly as another deafening explosion took place and the planes engines roared the killer spun round on the ladder his right foot plunging towards bournes groin his hand lashing out to deflect the weapon jason was ready he crashed the barrel of his gun into the commandos ankle then swung it up smashing it across his temple blood flowed as the killer fell back into the fuselage bourne leaped up the steps kicking the unconscious body of the impostor back across the metal floor he yanked the hatchway into place slamming the latches down and securing the door the plane began to taxi instantly swerving to the left away from the flaming centre of danger jason ripped the knapsack from his belt pulled out a second length of nylon rope and tied the assassins wrists to two widely separated seat clamps there was no way the commando could free himself none that bourne could think of but just in case he was mistaken jason cut the rope attached to the assassins ankles separated his legs and tied each foot to the opposite clamps across the aisle he got up and started towards the flight deck the aircraft was now on the runway racing down the blacktop suddenly the engines were cut the plane was stopping in front of the terminal where the group of government officials was gathered watching the evergrowing conflagrations taking place less than a quarter of a mile away to the north kai bar said bourne placing the barrel of his automatic against the back of the pilots head the copilot whirled around in his seat jason spoke in clear mandarin as he shifted his arm watch your dials and prepare for takeoff then give me your maps they will not clear us yelled the pilot we are to pick up five outgoing commissioners to where baoding thats north said bourne northwest insisted the copilot good head south it will not be permitted shouted the pilot your first duty is to save the aircraft you dont know whats going on out there it could be sabotage a revolt an uprising do as i tell you or youre both dead i really dont care the pilot snapped his head around and looked up at jason you are a westerner you speak chinese but you are a westerner what are you doing commandeering this aircraft youve got plenty of runway left take off south and give me the maps the memories came back distant sounds distant sights distant thunder snake lady snake lady respond what are your sector coordinates they were heading towards tarn quan and delta would not break silence he knew where they were and that was all that mattered command saigon could go to hell he wasnt about to give the north viet monitoring posts an inkling as to where they were going if you wont or cant respond snake lady stay below six hundred feet this is a friend talking you assholes you dont have many down here their radar will pick you up over sixfifty i know that saigon and my pilot knows it even if he doesnt like it and i still wont break silence snake lady weve completely lost you can any retard on that mission read an air map yes i can read one very well saigon do you think hed go up with my team trusting any of you goddamnit thats my brother down there fm not important to you but he is youre crazy western man yelled the pilot in the name of the spirits this is a heavy aircraft and were barely over the treetops keep your nose up said bourne studying a map dip and grab altitude thats all that is also foolishness shouted the copilot one downdraught at this level and we are into the forests we are gone the weather reports on your radio say theres no turbulence anticipated that is above screamed the pilot you dont understand the risks not down here what was the last report out of jinan asked jason knowing full well what it was they have been trying to track this flight to baoding said the officer they have been unable to do so for the past three hours they are now searching the hengshui mountains great spirits why am i telling you you heard the reports yourself you speak better than my parents and they were educated two points for the republics air force okay take a hundred and sixty degree turn in two and a half minutes and climb to an altitude of a thousand feet well be over water well be in range of the japanese theyll shoot us down put out a white flag or better still ill get on the radio ill think of something they may even escort us to kowloon kowloon shrieked the flight officer well be shot entirely possible agreed bourne but not by me he added you see in the final analysis i have to get there without you as a matter of fact you cant even be a part of my scene i cant allow that youre making positively no sense said the exasperated pilot you just make a hundred and sixty degree turn when i tell you jason studied the airspeed calibrating the knots on the map and calculating the estimated distance he wanted below through the window he saw the coast of china fall behind them he looked at his watch ninety seconds had passed make your turn captain he said i would have made it anyway cried the pilot i am not the divine wind of the kamikaze i do not fly into my own death not even for your heavenly government least of all times change said bourne his concentration once more on the air map things change snake lady snake lady abort if you can hear me get out of there and return to base camp its a nowin do you readme abort what do you want to do delta keep flying mister in three more minutes you can get out of here thats me what about you and your people well make it youre suicidal delta tell me about it all right everyone check your chutes and prepare for cast off someone help echo put his hand on the cord deraisonnable the airspeed held steady at close to miles per hour the route jason chose flying at low altitude through the formosa strait past longhai and shantou on the chinese coast and hsinchu and fengshan on taiwan was something over miles therefore the estimate of four hours plus or minus minutes was reasonable the out islands north of hong kong would be visible in less than half an hour twice during the flight they had been challenged by radio once from the nationalist garrison on quemoy the other from a patrol plane out of raoping each time bourne took over communications explaining in the first instance that they were on a search mission for a disabled ship bringing taiwanese goods into the mainland for the second a somewhat more ominous declaration that as part of the peoples security forces they were scouting the coast for contraband vessels that had undoubtedly eluded the raoping patrols for this last communication he was not only unpleasantly arrogant but also used the name and the official highly classified identification number of a dead conspirator who lay underneath a russian limousine in the jing shan bird sanctuary whether either interrogator believed him or not was as he expected irrelevant neither cared to disturb the status quo ante life was complicated enough let things be let them go where was the threat wheres your equipment asked jason addressing the pilot im flying it replied the man studying his instruments visibly snaking at each eruption of static from the radio each reporting communication from commercial aircraft as you may or may not know i have no flight plan we could be on a collision course with a dozen different planes were too low said bourne and the visibilitys fine ill trust your eyes not to bump into anybody youre insane shouted the copilot on the contrary im about to walk back into sanity wheres your emergency equipment the way you people build things i cant imagine that you dont have any such as asked the pilot life rafts signalling devices parachutes great spirits where the compartment in the rear of the plane the door to the right of the galley its all for the officials added the copilot dourly if there are problems they are supplied thats reasonable said bourne how else would you attend to business madness tin going aft gentlemen but my gun will be pointed right back here keep on course captain im very experienced and very sensitive i can feel the slightest variation in the air and if i do were all dead understood maniac tell me about it jason got up from the deck and walked back through the fuselage stepping over his ropedup splayedout prisoner who had given up the struggle to free himself the layers of dried blood covering the wound at his left temple how are things major i made a mistake what else do you want your warm body in kowloon thats what i want so some son of a bitch can put me in front of a firing squad thats up to you since im beginning to put things together some son of a bitch might even give you a medal if you play your cards the way you should play them youre very big with the cryptics bourne what does that mean with luck youll find out thanks a lot shouted the englishman no thanks to me you gave me the idea sport i asked you if in your training youd learned how to fly one of these things do you remember what you told me what you said you only knew how to jump out of them holy shit the commando the parachute securely strapped to his back was bound upright between two seats legs and hands tied together his right hand lashed to the release cord you look crucified major except that the arms should be extended for gods sake will you make sense forgive me my other self keeps trying to express himself dont do anything stupid you bastard because youre going out that hatch hear me understood understood jason walked to the flight deck sat on the deck picked up the map and spoke to the flight officer whats the check he asked hong kong in six minutes if we dont bump into anybody i have every confidence in you but defection notwithstanding we cant land at kai tak head north into the new territories aiya screamed the pilot we cross radar the mad gurkhas will fire on anything remotely mainland not if they dont pick you up captain stay below six hundred feet up to the border then climb over the mountains at lo wu you can make radio contact with shenzhen and what in the name of the spirits do i say you were hijacked thats all you see i cant allow you to be part of me we cant land in the colony youd draw attention to a very shy man and his companion the parachutes snapped open above them the sixtyfoot rope connecting them by their waists stretched in the winds as the aircraft sped north towards shenzhen they landed in the waters of a fish hatchery south of lok ma chau bourne hauled in the rope pulling the bound assassin towards him as the owners of the hatchery screamed on the banks of their squaredoff pond jason held up money more money than the husband and wife could earn in a year we are defectors he cried rich defectors who cares no one cared least of all the owners of the hatchery mgoi mgoissaair they kept repeating thanking the strange pink creatures who fell from the sky as bourne dragged the assassin out of the water the chinese garments discarded and the commandos wrists lashed behind his back bourne and his captive reached the road that headed south into kowloon their drenched clothes were drying rapidly under the heat of the sun but their appearance would not attract what few vehicles there were on the road fewer still willing to pick up hitchhikers it was a problem that had to be solved solved quickly accurately jason was exhausted he could barely walk and his concentration was fading one misstep and he could lose but he could not lose not now peasants mainly old women trudged along the borders of the pavement their outsized widebrimmed black hats shielding withered faces from the sun yokes spread across ancient shoulders supporting baskets of produce a few looked curiously at the dishevelled westerners but only briefly their world did not invite surprises it was enough to survive their memories were strong memories study everything youll find something you can use get down said bourne to the assassin on the side of the road what why because if you dont you wont see three more seconds of daylight i thought you wanted my warm body in kowloon ill take a cold body if i have to down on your backl incidentally you can shout as loud as you want no one will understand you you might even be helping me christ now youre in trauma what down now the killer lowered himself to the pavement rolled over on his back and stared into the bright sunlight his chest heaving with awkward gulps of breath i heard the pilot he said you are a fucking maniac to each his own interpretation major suddenly jason turned in the road and began shouting to the peasant women jiuming he screamed ring bang mang he pleaded with the ancient survivors to help his hurt companion who had either a broken back or crushed ribs he reached into his knapsack and pulled out money explaining that every minute counted that medical help was required as soon as possible if they could give assistance he would pay a great deal for their kindness as one the peasants rushed forward their eyes not on the patient but on the money their hats flying in the wind their yokes forgotten wo gunzi lai yelled bourne asking for splints or sticks of wood that would hold the damaged man rigid the women ran into the fields returning with long bamboo shoots slicing away the fibres that would give the poor man in pain a measure of relief when he was strapped in place and having done so amid much shrieking expressions of sympathy and in spite of the patients protestations in english they accepted bournes money and went on their way except one she spotted a truck coming down from the north duo shao qian she said leaning into jasons ear asking him how much he would pay ni shuo ne answered bourne telling her to name a price she did and delta accepted with her arms outstretched the woman walked out onto the road and the truck stopped a second negotiation was made with the driver and the assassin was loaded onto the van supine strapped to the bamboo jason climbed on behind him how are you doing major this thing is filled with lousy fucking ducks screamed the commando staring around at the banks of wooden cages on all sides the odour overpowering sickening a particular bird in its infinite wisdom chose the moment to squirt a stream of excrement into the assassins face next stop kowloon said jason bourne closing his eyes the telephone rang marie spun around in the chair stopped by mo panovs raised hand the doctor walked across the hotel room picked up the bedside phone and spoke yes he said quietly he frowned as he listened then as if he realized that his expression might alarm the patient he looked over at marie and shook his head his hand now dismissing whatever urgency she might have attached to the call all right he continued after nearly a minute well stay put until we hear from you but i have to ask you alex and forgive my directness did anyone feed you drinks panov winced as he pulled the phone briefly away from his ear my only response is that im entirely too kind and experienced to speculate on your antecedents talk to you later he hung up whats happened asked marie half out of the chair far more than he could go into but it was enough the psychiatrist paused looking down at marie catherine staples is dead she was shot down in front of her apartment house several hours ago oh my god whispered marie that huge intelligence officer continued panov the one we saw in the kowloon station whom you called the major and staples identified as a man named lin wenzu what about him hes severely wounded and in critical condition at the hospital thats where conklin called from a pay phone in the hospital marie studied panovs face theres a connection between catherines death and lin wenzu isnt there yes when staples was killed it was apparent that the operation had been penetrated what operation by whom alex said thatll all come later in any event things are coming to a boil and this lin may have given his life to rip out the penetration neutralizing it was the way conklin put it oh god cried marie her eyes wide her voice on the edge of hysteria operations penetrations neutralizing lin even catherine a friend who turned on me i dont care about those things what about david they say he went into china good christ theyve killed him screamed marie leaping out of the chair panov rushed forward and grabbed her by the shoulders he gripped her harder forcing her spastically shaking head to stop its movement insisting in silence that she look at him let me tell you what alex said to me listen to me slowly breathlessly as if trying to find a moment of clarity in her confusion and exhaustion marie stood still staring at her friend what she whispered he said that in a way he was glad david was up there or out there because in his judgement he had a better chance to survive you believe that screamed david webbs wife tears filling her eyes perhaps said panov nodding and speaking softly conklin pointed out that here in hong kong david could be shot or stabbed in a crowded street crowds he said were both an enemy and a friend dont ask me where these people find their metaphors i dont know what the hell are you trying to tell me what alex told me he said they made him go back made him be someone he wanted to forget then he said there never was anyone like delta delta was the best there ever was david webb was delta marie no matter what he wanted to put out of his mind he was delta jason bourne was an afterthought an extension of the pain he had to inflict on himself but his skills were honed as delta in some respects i know your husband as well as you do in those respects far better im sure said marie resting her head against the comforting chest of morris panov there were so many things he wouldnt talk about he was too frightened or too ashamed oh god mo will he come back to me alex thinks delta will come back marie leaned away from the psychiatrist and looked into his eyes through the tears her stare was rigid what about david she asked in a plaintive whisper will he come back i cant answer that i wish i could but i cant i see she released panov and walked to a window looking down at the crowds below in the congested garishly lighted streets you asked alex if hed been drinking why did you do that mo the moment the words came out i regretted them because you offended him asked marie turning back to the psychiatrist no because i knew youd heard them and youd want an explanation i couldnt refuse you that well it was the last thing he said to me two things actually he said you were wrong about staples wrong i was there i saw i heard her lies she was trying to protect you without sending you into panic more lies what was the other panov held his place and spoke simply his eyes locked with maries alex said that crazy as things seemed they werent really so crazy after all my god theyve turned him not all the way he wont tell them where you are where we are he told me we should be ready to move within minutes after his next call he cant take the chance of coming back here hes afraid hell be followed so were running again with nowhere to go but back into hiding and all of a sudden theres a rotten growth in our armour our crippled st george who slays dragons now wants to lie with them thats not fair marie thats not what he said not what i said bullshit doctor thats my husband out there or up there theyre using him killing him without telling us why oh he may just may survive because hes so terribly good at what he does did which was everything he despised but whats going to be left of the man and his mind youre the expert doctor whats going to be left when all the memories come back and they damn well better come back or he wont survive i told you i cant answer that oh youre terrific mo all youve got is carefully qualified positions and no answers not even well couched projections youre hiding you should have been an economist you missed your calling i miss a lot of things almost including the plane to hong kong marie stood motionless as if struck she burst into a new wave of tears as she ran to panov embracing him oh god im sorry mo forgive me forgive me im the one who should apologize said the psychiatrist it was a cheap shot he tilted her head back gently stroking the grey hair streaked with white lord i cant stand that wig its not a wig doctor my degrees by way of sears roebuck never included cosmetology only taking care of feet theyre easier than heads take my word for it the telephone rang marie gasped and panov stopped breathing he slowly turned his head towards the hateful ringing you try that again or anything like it and youre dead roared bourne gripping the back of his hand where the flesh was darkening from the force of the blow the assassin his wrists tied in front of him beneath the sleeves of his jacket had lunged against the door of the cheap hotel jamming jasons left hand into the doorframe what the hell do you expect me to do the former british commando yelled walk gently into that good night smiling at my own firing squad so youre a closet reader too said bourne watching the killer clutch his ribcage where jasons right foot had landed an agonizing blow maybe its time i asked you why youre in the business i was never actually a part of why major are you really interested mr original grunted the impostor falling into a wornout armchair against the wall then its my turn to ask why perhaps because i never understood myself said david webb im quite rational about that oh i know all about you it was part of the frenchmans training the great delta was bonkers his wife and kiddies were blown up in the water in a place called phnom penh by a stray jet this ohsocivilized scholar went crazy and its a fact nobody could control him and nobody gave a damn because he and the teams he led did more damage than most of the searchanddestroys put together saigon said you were suicidal and from its point of view the more so the better they wanted you and the garbage you commanded to buy it they never wanted you back you were an embarrassment snake lady snake lady this is a friend talking you assholes you dont have many down here abort its a nowin i know or i think i know that part of it said webb i asked about you the assassins eyes grew wide as he stared at his bound wrists when he spoke it was barely above a whisper the voice that emerged an echo of itself and unreal because im psycho you son of a bitch ive known it since i was a kid the nasty dark thoughts the knives into animals just to watch their eyes and their mouths raping a neighbours daughter a vicars kid because i knew she couldnt say anything and then catching up with her on the street afterwards and walking her to school i was eleven years old and later at oxford during club hazing holding a lad under water just below the surface until he drowned to watch his eyes his mouth then going back to classes and excelling in that nonsense any damn fool could do who had the wits to get out of a thunder shower there i was the right sort of fellow as befitted the son of the father you never sought help help with a name like allcottprice allcott stunned bourne stared at his prisoner general allcottprice montgomerys boy genius in world war two slaughter allcott the man who led the flank attack on tobruk and later barrelled through italy and germany englands patton i wasnt alive then for christs sake i was a product of his third wife perhaps his fourth for all i know he was very large in that department women i mean danjou said you never told him your real name he was bloody well right the general swilling his brandy in his ohsosuperior club in st jamess has passed the word kill him kill the rotten seed and never let the name out hes no part of me the woman was a whore but i am part of him and he knows it he knows where i get my kicks from the sadistic bastard and we both have a slew of citations for doing what we like doing best he knew then about your sickness he knew he knows he kept me out of sandhurst our west point in case you dont know because he didnt want me anywhere near his precious army he figured theyd find me out and itd dim his precious image he damn near had apoplexy when i joined up he wont have a decent nights sleep until hes told quietly that im out dead out with all the traces buried why are you telling me who you are simple replied the former commando his eyes boring into jasons the way i read it whichever way it goes only one of us is going to make it through ill do my damndest to see that its me i told you that but it may not be youre no slouch and if it isnt youll have a name you can shock the goddamn world with probably make a bloody fortune in the bargain what with literary and cinema rights that sort of thing then the general will spend the rest of his life sleeping peacefully sleep hell probably blow his brains out you werent listening i said hed be told quietly all the traces buried no name surfacing but this way nothings buried its all hanging out like maggies drawers the whole sick sordid mess with no apologies on my part chap i know what i am i accept it some of us are just plain different lets say were antisocial to put it one way hardcore violent is another rotten still another the only difference within my being different is that im bright enough to know it and accept it said bourne quietly wallow in it positively intoxicated by the highs and lets look at it this way if i lose and the story blows how many practising antisocials might be fired up by it how many other different men are out there whod be only too happy to take my place as i took yours this bloody world is crawling with jason bournes give them direction give them an idea and theyll flock to the source and be off and running that was the frenchmans essential genius cant you see i see garbage thats all i see your eyesights not too shabby thats what the general will see a reflection of himself and hell have to live with the exposure choke with it if he wouldnt help you you should have helped yourself commit yourself youre bright enough to know that and cut off all the fun all the highs unthinkable sport you go your way and find the most expendable outfit in the service hoping the accident will happen that will put an end to it before they peg you for what you are i found the outfit but the accident never happened unfortunately competition brings out the best in all of us doesnt it we survive because somebody else doesnt want us to and then of course theres drink it gives us confidence even the courage to do the things were not sure we can do not when youre working of course not but the memories are there the whisky bravado that tells you you can do it false said jason bourne not entirely countered the assassin you draw strength from what you can there are two people said jason one you know the other you dont or you dont want to false repeated the commando he wouldnt be there unless i wanted my kicks dont kid yourself and dont delude yourself either mr original youd be better off putting a bullet in my head because ill take you if i can ill kill you if i can youre asking me to destroy what you cant live with cut the crap bourne i dont know about you but i get my kicks i want them i dont want to live without them you just asked me again stow it you fucker and again stop it the assassin lurched out of the chair jason took two steps forward his right foot again lashing out again pounding the killers ribs sending him back into the chair allcottprice screamed in pain i wont kill you major said bourne quietly but ill make you wish you were dead grant me a last wish coughed the killer through an open mouth holding his chest with his bound hands even ive done that for targets i can take the unexpected bullet but i cant take the hong kong garrison theyd hang me late at night when no ones around just to make it official according to the regs theyd put a thick rope around my neck and make me stand on a platform i cant take that delta knew when to switch gears i told you before he said calmly that may not be in store for you im not dealing with the british in hong kong youre not what you assumed it but i never said it youre lying then youre less talented than i thought which wasnt much to begin with i know i cant think geometrically you certainly cant then youre a premium man what you americans call a bounty hunter but youre working privately in a sense yes and i have an idea that the man who sent me after you may want to hire you not kill you jesus christ and my price was heavy very heavy then you are in the business only this once i couldnt refuse the reward lie down on the bed what you heard me i have to go to the loo be my guest replied jason walking to the bathroom door and opening it its not one of my favourite sports but ill be watching you the assassin relieved himself with bournes gun trained on him finished he walked out into the small shabby room in the cheap hotel south of the mongkok the bed said bourne again gesturing with his weapon get prone and spread your legs that fairy behind the desk downstairs would love to hear this conversation you can phone him later in your own time down quickly youre always in a hurry more than youll ever understand jason lifted his knapsack from the floor and put it on the bed pulling out the nylon cords as the deranged killer crawled oh top of the soiled spread ninety seconds later the commandos ankles were lashed to the beds rear metal springs his neck circled with the thin white line the rope stretched and knotted to the springs in front finally bourne slipped off the pillowcase and tied it around the majors head covering his eyes and ears leaving his mouth free to breathe his wrists bound beneath him the assassin was again immobilized but now his head began to twitch in sudden jerks and his mouth stretched with each spasm extreme anxiety had overcome former major allcottprice jason recognized the signs dispassionately the squalid hotel he had managed to find had no such conveniences as a telephone the only communication with the outside world would be a knock on the door which meant either the police or a wary desk clerk informing the guest that if the room was to be occupied another hour an additional days rent was required bourne crossed to the door slipped silently out into the dingy corridor and headed for the pay phone he had been told was at the far end of the hallway he had committed the telephone number to memory waiting praying if it were possible for the moment when he would dial it he inserted a coin and did so now his breath short the blood racing to his head snake lady he said into the phone drawing out the two words in harsh flat emphasis snake lady snake qing qing broke in an impersonal voice over the line speaking rapidly in chinese we are experiencing a temporary disruption of service for many telephones on this exchange service should be resumed shortly this is a recording qing qing jason replaced the phone a thousand fragmented thoughts like broken mirrors collided in his mind he walked rapidly back down the dimlylit corridor passing a whore in a doorway counting money she smiled at him raising her hands to her blouse he shook his head and ran to the room he waited fifteen minutes standing quietly by the window hearing the guttural sounds that emerged from his prisoners throat he returned to the door and once more stepped outside noiselessly he walked to the phone again inserted money and dialled qing he slammed the telephone down his hands trembling the muscles of his jaw working furiously as he thought about the prostrate merchandise he had brought back to exchange for his wife he picked up the phone for a third time and dialled o operator he began in chinese this is an emergency its most urgent i reach the following number he gave it to her his voice rising in barely controlled panic a recording explained that there was difficulty on the line but this is an emergency one minute please i will attempt to be of assistance silence followed every second filled with a growing echo in his chest reverberating like an accelerating kettledrum his temples throbbed his mouth was dry his throat parched burning the line is temporarily in disuse sir said a second female voice the line that line yes sir not many telephones on the exchange you asked the operator about a specific number sir i would not know about other numbers if you have them i will gladly check for you the recording specifically said many telephones yet youre saying one line are you telling me you cant confirm a a multiple malfunction a what whether a whole lot of phones arent working youve got computers they spell out trouble spots i told the other operator this is an emergency if it is medical i will gladly summon an ambulance if you will give me your address i want to know whether a lot of phones are out or whether its just one i have to know that it will take me some time to gather such information sir its past nine oclock in the evening and the repair stations are on reduced crews but they can tell you if theres an area problem goddamn it please sir i am not paid to be abused sorry im sorry i address yes the address whats the address of the number i gave you it is unpublished sir but you have it actually i do not sir the laws of confidentiality are most strict in hong kong my screen shows only the word unpublished i repeat this really is a matter of life and death then let me reach a hospital oh sir please wait you were correct sir my screen now shows that the last three digits of the number you gave me are electronically crossing over into one another so the repair station is attempting to correct the problem whats the geographical location the prefix is five therefore it is on the island of hong kong narrower whereabouts on the island digits on telephone numbers have nothing to do with specific streets or locations im afraid i cannot help you any further sir unless you care to give me your address so that i might send an ambulance my address said jason bewildered exhausted on the edge of panic no he continued i dont think ill do that edward newington mcallister bent over the desk as the woman replaced the phone she was visibly shaken her oriental face pale from the strain of the call the undersecretary of state hung up a separate phone on the other side of the desk a pencil in his right hand an address on a notepad beneath him you were absolutely wonderful he said patting the womans arm we have it weve got him you kept him on long enough longer than he would have permitted in the old days the trace is confirmed at least the building and thats enough a hotel he speaks very fine chinese the dialect is rather northern but he adjusts to guangzhou he also did not trust me it doesnt matter well put people around the hotel every entrance and exit its on a street called shek lung below the mongkok in the yau ma ti actually said the woman interpreter theres probably only one entrance through which the garbage is taken every morning no doubt i have to reach havilland at the hospital he shouldnt have gone there he appeared to be most anxious offered the interpreter last statements said mcallister dialling vital information from a dying man its permitted i dont understand any of you the woman got up from the desk as the undersecretary moved around and sat in the chair i can follow instructions but i dont understand you good lord i forgot you have to leave now what im discussing is highly classified were extremely appreciative and i can assure you you have our gratitude and im quite certain a bonus but im afraid i must ask you to leave gladly sir said the interpreter and you may forget the gratitude but please include the bonus i learned that much in economics eight at the university of arizona the woman left emergency police facilities mcallister fairly shouted into the phone the ambassador please its urgent no no names are required thank you and bring him to a telephone where we can talk privately the undersecretary massaged his left temple digging deeper and deeper into his scalp until havilland got on the line yes edward he called it worked we know where he is a hotel in the yau ma ti surround it but dont make any moves conklin has got to understand if he smells what he thinks is rotten bait hell pull back and if we dont have the wife we dont have our assassin for gods sake dont blow this edward everything must be tight and very very delicate beyondsalvage could well be the next order of business those arent words im used to mr ambassador there was a pause on the line when havilland spoke his voice was cold oh yes they are edward you protest too much conklin was right about that you could have said no at the beginning at sangre de cristo in colorado you could have walked away but you didnt you couldnt in some ways youre like me without my accidental advantages of course we think and outthink we take sustenance from our manipulations we swell with pride with every progressive move in the human chess game where every move can have terrible consequences for someone because we believe in something it all becomes a narcotic and the sirens songs are really appeals to our egos we have our minor powers because of our major intellects admit it edward i have and if it makes you feel any better ill say what i said before someone has to do it nor do i care for outofcontext lectures said mcallister youll receive no more from me just do as i tell you cover all the exits at that hotel but inform every man that no overt moves are to be made if bourne goes anywhere hes to be discreetly followed not touched under any circumstances we must have the woman before contact is made morris panov picked up the phone yes somethings happened conklin spoke rapidly quietly havilland left the waiting room to take an emergency call is anything going on over there no nothing weve just been talking im worried havillands men could have found you good lord how checking every hotel in the colony for a white man with a limp thats how you paid the clerk not to say anything to anyone you said it was a confidential business conference perfectly normal they can pay too and say its a confidential government matter that brings generous rewards or equally generous harassment guess who takes precedence i think youre overreacting protested the psychiatrist i dont care what you think doctor just get out of there now forget maries luggage if she has any leave as quickly as you can where should we go where its crowded but where i can find you a restaurant its been too many years and they change names every twenty minutes over here hotels are out theyre too easily covered if youre right alex youre taking too much time im thinking all right take a cab to the foot of nathan road at salisbury have you got that nathan and salisbury youll see the peninsula hotel but dont go inside the strip heading north is called the golden mile walk up and down on the right side the east side but stay within the first four blocks ill find you as soon as i can all right said panov nathan and salisbury the first four blocks north on the right alex youre quite certain youre right arent you on two counts answered conklin for starters havilland didnt ask me to go with him to find out what the emergency was thats not our arrangement and if the emergency isnt you and marie it means webbs made contact if thats the case im not trading away my only bargaining chip which is marie not without onsight guarantees not with ambassador raymond havilland now get out of there something was wrong what was it bourne had returned to the filthy hotel room and stood at the foot of the bed watching his prisoner whose twitch was more pronounced now his stretched body spastically reacting to each nervous movement what was it why did the conversation with the hong kong operator bother him so she was courteous and helpful she even tolerated his abuse then what was it suddenly words from a long forgotten past came to him words spoken years ago to an unknown operator without a face with only an irritable voice i asked you for the number of the iranian consulate it is in the telephone book our switchboards are full and we have no time for such inquiries click line dead that was it the operators in hong kong with justification were among the most peremptory in the world they wasted no time no matter how persistent the customer the workload in this congested frenetic financial megalopolis would not permit it yet the second operator was the soul of tolerance i would not know about other numbers if you have them i will gladly check for you if you will give me your address unless you care to give me your address the address and without really considering the question he had instinctively answered no i dont think hi do that from deep within him an alarm had gone off a trace they had bounced him around keeping him on the line long enough to put an electronic trace on his call pay phones were the most difficult to track down the vicinity was determined first next the location or premises and finally the specific instrument but it was only a matter of minutes and fractions of minutes between the first step and the last had he stayed on long enough and if so to what degree of progress the vicinity the hotel the pay phone itself jason tried to reconstruct his conversation with the operator the second operator when the trace would have begun maddeningly frantically but with all the precision he could summon he tried to recapture the rhythm of their words their voices realizing that when he had accelerated she had slowed down it will take me some time actually i do not sir the laws of confidentiality are most strict in hong kong a lecture oh sir please wait you were correct my screen now shows a mollifying explanation taking up time time how could he have allowed it how long ninety seconds two minutes at the outside timing was an instinct for him rhythms remembered say two minutes enough to determine a vicinity conceivably to pinpoint a location but given the hundreds of thousands of miles of trunk lines probably inadequate to pick up a specific phone for some elusive reason images of paris came to him then the blurred outlines of telephone booths as he and marie raced from one to another through the blinding paris streets making blind untraceable calls hoping to unravel the enigma that was jason bourne four minutes it takes that long but we have to get out of the area theyve got that by now the taipans men if there was a huge obese taipan to begin with might have traced the hotel but it was unlikely they would have tracked the pay phone or the floor and there was another time span to be considered one that could work for him if he in turn worked quickly if the trace had been made and the hotel unearthed it would take the hunters some time to reach the southern mongkok presuming they were in hong kong which the telephone prefix indicated the key at the moment was speed quickly the blindfold stays major but youre moving he said to the assassin as he swiftly undid the gag and the knots on the mattress springs coiling the three nylon ropes and stuffing them into the commandos jacket what what did you say thats better yet said bourne raising his voice get up were going for a walk jason grabbed his knapsack opened the door and checked the hallway a drunk staggered into a room on the left and slammed the door the right corridor was clear all the way up to the pay phone and the fire exit beyond it move ordered bourne shoving his prisoner the fire escape would have been rejected by underwriters at a glance the metal was corroded and the railings bent under pressure if one was escaping a fire a smokefilled staircase might have been preferable still if it descended in the darkness without collapsing that was all that mattered jason grabbed the commandos lapel leading him down the creaking metal steps until they reached the first landing beneath there was a broken ladder extended in its track half way to the alley below the drop to the pavement was no more than six or seven feet easily negotiated going down and more important coming back up sleep well said bourne taking aim in the dim light and crashing his knuckles into the base of the commandos skull the assassin collapsed on the staircase as bourne whipped out the cords and secured the killer to the steps and the railing at the last yanking down the pillowcase covering the impostors mouth and tying the cloth tighter the nocturnal sounds of hong kongs yau ma ti and the nearby mongkok would easily cover whatever cries allcottprice might manage if he awoke before jason awakened him which was doubtful bourne climbed down the ladder dropping into the narrow alleyway only seconds before three young men appeared running around the corner from the busy street out of breath they huddled in the shadows of a doorway as jason remained on his knees he hoped out of sight beyond the alleys entrance another group of youths raced by in pursuit shouting angrily the three young men lurched from the darkened doorway and ran out heading in the opposite direction away from their pursuers bourne got up and walked quickly to the mouth of the alley looking back up at the fire escape the impostor could not be seen he collided simultaneously with two running bodies bouncing off them and into the wall he could only assume that the young men were part of the crowd chasing the previous three who had hidden in the doorway one of these however held a knife menacingly in his hand jason did not need this confrontation he could not permit it before the youth realized what had happened bourne lashed out and gripped the young mans wrist twisting it clockwise until the blade fell from the youngsters hand while he screamed in pain get out of here shouted jason in harsh cantonese your gang is no match for your elders and betters if we see any of you around here your mothers will get corpses for their labours get out aiya we look for thieves for eyeeyes from the north they steal they out the young men fled from the alleyway disappearing into the busy street in the yau ma ti bourne shook his hand the hand the assassin had tried to crush in the hotel doorframe in his anxiety he had forgotten about the pain it was the best way to tolerate it he looked up at the sound sounds two dark sedans came racing down shek lung street and stopped in front of the hotel both vehicles had official written all over them jason watched in anguish as men climbed out of each car two from the first three from the one behind it oh god marie were going to lose ive killed us oh christ re killed us he fully expected the five men to rush into the hotel question the desk clerk take up positions and make their moves they would learn that the occupants of room had not been seen leaving the premises therefore presumably they were still upstairs the room would be broken into in less than a minute the fire escape discovered seconds later could he do it could he climb back up cut loose the killer get him down into the alley and escape he had to he took a last look before racing back to the ladder then he stopped something was wrong something unexpected totally unexpected the first man from the lead car had removed his suit coat his official dress code and unloosened his tie he ran his hand through his hair dishevelling it and walked unsteadily towards the entrance of the rundown hotel his four companions were spreading out away from the cars looking up at the windows two over to the right two to the left towards the alleyway towards him what was happening these men were not acting officially they were behaving like criminals like mafiosi closing in on a kill they could not be associated with a trap laid for others not themselves good god had alex conklin been wrong back at dulles airport in washington play the scenario its deep down and its there play it out you can do it delta no time there was no time to think any longer there were no precious instants to lose thinking about the existence or the nonexistence of a huge obese taipan too operatic to be real the two men heading towards him had spotted the alleyway they began running towards the alley towards the merchandise towards the destruction and death of everything jason held dear in this rotten world he would gladly leave but for marie the seconds were ticked off in milliseconds of premeditated violence at once accepted and reviled david webb was silenced as jason bourne again assumed complete command get away from me this is all weve got left the first man fell his ribcage shattered his voice stilled by the force of a blow to his throat the second man was accorded preferential treatment it was vital that he remain cognizant even alert for what followed he dragged both men into the deepest shadows of the alley ripping their clothes with his knife binding their feet their arms and their mouths with strips of their own clothing his arms pinned beneath jasons knees the blade of the knife breaking the flesh around the socket of his left eye the second man received bournes ultimatum my wife where is she now or lose your eye then the other one ill carve you up junggwo believe me he ripped the gag from the mans mouth we are not your enemy zhangfu cried the oriental in english using the cantonese word for husband we have been trying to find her we hunt everywhere jason stared down at the man the knife trembling in his hand his temples throbbing his personal galaxy about to explode the heavens to rain down fire and pain beyond his imagination marie he screamed in agony what have you done with her i was given a guarantee i bring out the merchandise and my wife is returned to me i was to hear her voice on the phone but the phone doesnt work instead a trace is put on me and suddenly youre here but my wife isnt where is she if we knew she would be here with us liar cried bourne drawing out the word im not lying to you sir nor should i be killed for not lying to you she escaped from the hospital the hospital she was ill the doctor insisted i was there outside her room watching over her she was weak but she got away oh christ sick weak alone in hong kong my god youve killed her no sir our orders were to see to her comfort your orders said jason bourne his voice flat and cold but not your taipans he followed other orders orders given before in zurich and paris and on seventyfirst street in new york ive been there weve been there and now youve killed her you used me as you used me before and when you thought it was over you took her away from me whats the death of one more daughter silence is everything jason suddenly gripped the mans face with his left hand the knife poised in his right whos the fat man tell me or the blade goes in whos the taipan hes not a taipan he is british schooled and trained an officer much respected in the territory he works with your countrymen the americans hes with the intelligence service im sure he is from the beginning it was the same only this time it wasnt the jackal but me i was moved around the chessboard until i had no choice but to hunt myself an extension of myself a man called bourne when he brings him in kill him kill her they know too much no cried the oriental perspiring his eyes wide staring at the blade pressing into his flesh we are told very little but i have heard nothing like that what are you doing here then asked jason harshly surveillance i swear it thats all until the guns move in said bourne icily so your threepiece suits can stay clean no blood on your shirts no traces back to those nameless faceless people you work for youre wrong we are not like that our superiors are not like that i told you ive been there youre like that believe me now youre going to tell me something whatever this is its down and dirty and totally secure nobody runs an operation like that without a camouflaged base where is it t dont understand you headquarters or base camp one a sterile house or a coded command centre whatever the hell you want to call it where is it please i cannot you can you will if you dont youre blind your eyes cut out of your head now i have a wife children so did i both counts im losing patience jason stopped only slightly reducing the pressure of the blade besides if youre so sure youre right that your superiors arent what i say they are wheres the harm accommodations can be reached fes yelled the frightened man accommodations they are good men they wont harm you they wont have a chance whispered bourne what sir nothing where is it wheres this ohsoquiet headquarters now victoria peak said the petrified intelligence subordinate the twelfth house down on the right with high walls bourne listened to the description of a sterile house a quiet patrolled estate among other estates in a wealthy district he heard what he had to hear there was nothing else he needed he smashed the heavy bone handle of the knife into the mans skull replaced the gag and rose to his feet he looked up at the fire escape at the barely discernible outline of the impostors body they wanted jason bourne and were willing to kill for him they would get two jason bournes and die for their lies ambassador havilland confronted conklin in the hospital corridor outside the police emergency room the diplomats decision to speak to the cia man in the busy whitewalled hallway was predicated on the fact that it was busy nurses and ancillaries doctors and specialists roamed the halls conferring and answering phones that seemed to ring continuously under the circumstances conklin would be unlikely to indulge in a loud heated argument their discussion might be charged but it would be quiet the ambassador could make his case better under those conditions bournes made contact said havilland lets go outside said conklin we cant replied the diplomat lin is in grave danger but we may be able to see him any minute we cant miss that opportunity and the doctor knows were here then lets go back inside there are five other people in the emergency room you dont want them overhearing us any more than i do christ you cover your ass dont you i have to think of all of us not one or two or three of us but all of us what do you want from me the woman of course you know that i know that of course what are you prepared to offer my god jason bourne i want david webb i want maries husband i want to know that hes alive and well in hong kong i want to see him with my own eyes thats impossible then youd better tell me why before he shows himself he expects to speak with his wife within thirty seconds of contact thats the agreement but you just said he made contact he did we didnt we couldnt afford to without having marie webb near the phone youve lost me said conklin angrily he had his own conditions not unlike yours which is certainly understandable you were both what were they broke in the cia man if he made the call it meant that he had the impostor it was the bilateral agreement jesus bilateral both sides agreed to it i know what it means you just send me into space thats all keep your voice down his condition was that if we did not produce his wife within thirty seconds whoever was on the phone would hear a gunshot meaning that the assassin was dead that bourne had killed him good old delta conklins lips formed a thin halfsmile he never missed a trick and i suspect he had a followup right yes said havilland grimly a point of exchange is to be mutually agreed upon not bilaterally shut up hell be able to see his wife walking alone under her own power when hes satisfied hell come out with his prisoner under a gun we presume and the exchange will be made from the initial contact to the switch everything is to take place in a matter of minutes certainly no more than half an hour double time with no one orchestrating any extraneous moves conklin nodded but if you didnt respond how do you know he made contact lin put a flag on the telephone number with a second relay to victoria peak bourne was told that the line was temporarily out of service and when he tried to get a verification which under the circumstances he had to do he was relayed to the peak we kept him on the line long enough to trace the location of the pay phone he was using we know where he is our people are on the way there now with orders to stay out of sight if he smells or sees anything hell kill our man a trace alex studied the diplomats face not kindly he let you keep him talking long enough for that hes in a state of extreme anxiety we counted on it webb maybe said conklin not delta not when he thinks about it hell keep calling insisted havilland he has no choice maybe maybe not how long has it been since his last call twelve minutes answered the ambassador looking at his watch and the first one about a half hour and every time he calls you know about it yes the informations relayed to mcallister phone him and see if bournes tried again why because as you put it hes in a state of extreme anxiety and will keep calling he cant help himself what are you trying to say that you may have made a mistake where how i dont know but i do know delta what could he do without reaching us kill said alex simply havilland turned looked down the busy hallway and started walking towards the floors reception desk he spoke briefly to a nurse she nodded and he picked up a telephone he talked for a moment and hung up he returned to conklin frowning its odd he remarked mcallister feels the way you do edward expected bourne to call every five minutes if he waited that long oh he was led to believe that telephone service might be restored at any moment the ambassador shook his head as if dismissing the improbable were all too tense there could be a number of explanations from coins for a pay phone to unsettled bowels the emergency room door opened and the british doctor appeared mr ambassador lin a remarkable man what hes been through would kill a horse but then theyre about the same size and a horse cant manifest a will to live can we see him thered be no point hes still unconscious stirring now and then but nowhere near coherent every minute he rests without a reversal is encouraging you understand how urgent it is that we talk to him dont you yes mr havilland i do perhaps more than you realize you know that i was the one responsible for the womans escape i do know said the diplomat i was also told that if she could fool you she could probably fool the best specialist at the mayo clinic thats dubious but i like to think im competent instead i feel like an idiot ill do everything in my power to help you and my good friend major lin the judgement was medical and mine the error mine not his if he makes it through the next hour or so i believe he has a chance to live if that happens ill bring him to and you can question him as long as you keep your questions brief and simple if i think a reversal is too severe and that hes slipping away ill also call you thats fair doctor thank you i could do no less its what wenzu would want ill go back to him now the waiting began havilland and alex conklin reached their own bilateral agreement when bourne next tried to reach the number for snake lady he was to be told that the line would be clear in twenty minutes during that time conklin would be driven to the sterile house on victoria peak prepared to take the call he would set up the exchange telling david that marie was safe and with morris panov the two men returned to the police emergency room and sat in opposite chairs each silent minute compounding the strain the minutes however stretched into quarter hours and these into over an hour three times the ambassador called the peak to learn if there was any word from jason bourne there was none twice the english doctor came out to report on wenzus condition it was unchanged a fact that allowed for hope rather than diminishing it once the emergency room telephone rang as both havilland and conklin snapped their heads towards it their eyes riveted on the nurse who calmly answered the call was not for the ambassador the tension mounted between the two men as every now and then they looked at each other the same message in their eyes something was wrong something had gone off the wire a chinese doctor came out and approached two people in the back of the room a young woman and a priest he spoke quietly the woman screamed then sobbed and fell into the enveloping arms of the priest a new police widow had been created she was led away to say a last goodbye to her husband silence the telephone rang again and again the diplomat and the cia man stared at the counter mr ambassador said the nurse its for you the gentleman says its most urgent havilland got up and strode to the desk nodding his thanks and he took the phone whatever it was it had happened conklin watched never thinking he would see what he saw now the consummate diplomats face became suddenly ashen his thin usually tight lips were now parted his dark brows arched his eyes wide and hollow he turned and spoke to alex his voice barely audible it was the whisper of fear bournes gone the impostors gone two of the men were found bound and severely injured he returned to the phone his eyes narrowing as he listened oh my god he cried turning back to conklin the cia man was not there david webb had disappeared only jason bourne remained yet he was both more and less than the hunter of carlos the jackal he was delta the predator the animal wanting only vengeance for a priceless part of his life that had been taken from him once again and as an avenging predator he went through the motions the instinctive logistics in a trancelike state each decision precise each movement deadly his eye was on the kill and his human brain had become an animal he wandered the squalid streets of the yau ma ti his prisoner in tow wrists still in traction finding what he wanted to find paying thousands of dollars for items worth a fraction of the amounts paid word spread up into the mongkok about the strange man and his even stranger silent companion who was bound and feared for his life other doors were opened to him doors reserved for the runners of contraband drugs exported whores jewels gold and materials of destruction deception death and exaggerated warnings accompanied the word about this obsessed man carrying thousands on his person he is a maniac and he is white and he will kill quickly it is said two throats were slit by those dishonest to him it is heard that a zhongguo ren was shot to death because he cheated on a delivery he is mad give him what he wants he pays hard cash who cares it is not our problem let him come let him go just take his money by midnight delta had the tools of his lethal trade and success was uppermost in the medusans mind he had to succeed the kill was everything where was echo he needed echo old echo was his good luck charm echo was dead slain by a madman with a ceremonial sword in a peaceful forest of birds memories echo marie ill kill them for what they did to you he stopped a dilapidated taxi in the mongkok and showing money asked the driver to step outside yes what is sir asked the man in broken english whats your car worth said delta i not understand how much money for your car youfeng kuangl bul shouted delta telling the driver he was not unbalanced how much will you take for your car he continued in chinese tomorrow morning you can say it was stolen the police will find it its my only source of livelihood and i have a large family you are crazy hows four thousand american aiya take it kuair said jason telling the man to hurry help me with this diseased one he has the shaking sickness and must be tied down so he cant hurt himself the owner of the taxi his eyes on the large bills in bournes hand helped jason throw the assassin into the back seat holding the killer down as the man from medusa whipped the nylon ropes around the commandos ankles knees and elbows once again gagging and blindfolding him with the strips of cloth ripped from the cheap hotels pillowcase unable to understand what was being said shouted in chinese the prisoner could only passively resist it was not merely the punishment inflicted on his wrists with each protesting movement it was something he saw as he stared at his captor there was a change in the original jason bourne he had gone into another world a far darker world the kill was in the medusas extended periods of silence it was in his eyes as he drove through the congested tunnel from kowloon to the island of hong kong delta primed himself for the assault imagining the obstacles that would face him conjuring up the counter measures he would employ all were overstated and excessive thus preparing himself for the worst he had done the same in the jungles of tarn quan there was nothing he had not considered and he had brought them out all of them but one apiece of garbage a man who had no soul but the want of gold a traitor who would sell the lives of his comrades for small advantage it was where it had all begun in the jungles of tarn quan delta had executed the piece of garbage blown his temple out with a bullet as this garbage was on a radio relaying their position to the cong the garbage was a man from medusa named jason bourne left to rot in the jungles of tarn quan he was the beginning of the madness yet delta had brought them all out including a brother he could not remember he had brought them out through two hundred miles of enemy territory because he had studied the probabilities and imagined the improbabilities the latter far more important to their escape for they had happened and his mind was prepared for the unexpected it was the same now there was nothing a sterile house in victoria peak could mount that he could not surmount death would be answered with death he saw the high walls of the estate and drove casually past them slowly as a guest or a tourist might unsure of his way down the stately road he spotted the glass of the concealed searchlights noted the barbed wire coiled above the wall he zeroed in on the two guards in back of the enormous gate they were in shadows but the cloth of their marine field jackets reflected what light there was bad form the cloth should have been dulled or replaced by less military apparel the high wall ended at the front it was the corner the stone stretched to the right as far as the eye could see the sterile house was obvious to the trained eye to the innocent it was clearly the residence of an important diplomat an ambassador perhaps who required protection because of the dangerous times terrorism was everywhere hostages were prized deterrents the order of the day cocktails were served at sundown amid the quiet laughter of the elite who moved governments but outside the guns were ready cocked with the darkness ready to fire delta understood it was why he carried his bulging knapsack he drove the battered car off the side of the road there was no need to conceal it he would not be coming back he did not care to come back marie was gone and it was over whatever lives he had led were finished david webb delta jason bourne they were the past he wanted only peace the pain had exceeded the limits of his endurance peace but first he must kill his enemies maries enemies all the enemies of the men and women everywhere who were driven by the nameless faceless manipulators would be taught a lesson a minor lesson of course for sanitized explanations would come from the experts made plausible by complicated words and distorted halftruths lies stave off doubts eliminate the questions be as outraged as the people themselves and march to the drums of consensus the objective is everything the insignificant players nothing but necessary digits in the deadly equations use them drain them kill them if you must just get the jobs done because we say so we see things others cannot see do not question us you have no access to our knowledge jason climbed out of the car opened the rear door and with his knife sliced the ropes away from the assassins ankles and knees he then removed the blindfold keeping the gag in place he grabbed his prisoner by the shoulder and the blow was paralysing the killer spun in place crashing his right knee up into bournes left kidney swinging his clasped bound hands up into jasons throat as delta buckled over a second knee caught bournes rib cage he fell to the ground as the commando raced into the road no it cant happen i need his gun his fire power its part of the strategy delta rose to his feet his chest and side bursting with pain and plunged after the running figure in the road in seconds the killer would be enveloped in darkness the man from medusa ran faster the pain forgotten concentrating only on the assassin in the part of his mind that still functioned faster faster suddenly headlights shot up from the bottom of the hill catching the assassin in their beams the commando lurched to the side of the road to avoid the light bourne stayed on the right side of the pavement until the last instant knowing he was gaining precious yards as the car raced past his arms useless the impostor stumbled on the soft shoulder of the road he crawled quickly awkwardly back to the asphalt getting to his feet and began to run again it was too late delta hurled his shoulder into the base of his prisoners spine both men went down the commandos guttural roars were the sounds of an animal in fury jason turned the assassin over and jammed his knee brutally into his prisoners stomach you listen to me scum he said breathlessly the sweat rolling down his face whether you die or not makes no difference to me a few minutes from now you wont concern me any longer but until then youre part of the plan my plan and whether or not you die then will be up to you not me im giving you a chance which is more than you ever did for a target now get up do everything i tell you or your one chance will be blown away with your head which is exactly what i promised them they stopped back at the car delta picked up his knapsack and removed a gun he had taken in beijing showing it to the commando you begged me for a weapon at the airport in jinan remember the assassin nodded his eyes wide his mouth stretched under the tension of the cloth gag its yours continued jason bourne his voice flat without emotion once were over that wall up there you in front of me ill hand it to you the killer frowned his eyes narrowing i forgot said delta you couldnt see it theres a sterile house about five hundred feet up the road were going in im staying taking out everyone i can you youve got nine shells and ill give you a bonus one bubble the medusan lifted a packet of plastique from the mongkok out of the knapsack and showed it to his prisoner as i read it youd never get back over the wall theyd cut you down so your only way out is through the gate itll be somewhere diagonally to the right to get there youll have to kill your way through the timer on the plastic can be set as low as ten seconds handle it any way you like i dont care capisce the assassin raised his bound hands then gestured at the gag the sounds from this throat indicated that jason should free his arms and remove the cloth at the wall said delta when im ready ill cut the ropes but when i do if you try to take the gag off before i tell you there goes your chance the killer stared at him and nodded once jason bourne and the lethal pretender walked up the road on victoria peak towards the sterile house conklin limped down the hospital steps as rapidly as he could holding on to the centre rail looking frantically for a taxi in the drive below there was none instead a uniformed nurse stood alone reading the south china times in the glow of the outdoor lights every now and then she glanced up towards the parking lot entrance excuse me miss said alex out of breath do you speak english a little replied the woman obviously noticing his limp and his agitated voice you are with difficulty much difficulty i have to find a taxi i have to reach someone right away and i cant do it by phone they will call one for you at the desk they call for me every night when i leave youre waiting here it comes said the woman as approaching headlights shone through the parking lot entrance miss cried conklin this is urgent a man is dying and another may die if i dont reach him please may i bie zhaoji exclaimed the nurse telling him to calm down you have urgency i have none take my taxi i will ask for another thank you said alex as the cab pulled up to the kerb thank you he added opening the door and climbing inside the woman nodded pleasantly and shrugged as she turned and started back up the steps the glass doors above crashed open and conklin watched through the rear window as the nurse nearly collided into two of lins men one stopped her and spoke the other reached the kerb and squinted peering out of the light into the receding darkness beyond hurry said alex to the driver as they passed through the gate kuai diar if thats right it will do answered the driver wearily in fluent english hurry is better however the base of nathan road was the galactic entrance to the luminescent world of the golden mile the blazing coloured lights the dancing flickering shimmering lights were the walls of this congested urban valley of humanity where seekers sought and sellers shrieked for attention it was the bazaar of bazaars a dozen tongues and dialects vying for the ears and the eyes of the evershifting crowds it was here in this gauntlet of freewheeling commercial chaos that alex conklin got out of the cab walking painfully his limp pronounced the veins of his footless leg swelling he hurried up the east side of the street his eyes roving like those of an angry wildcat seeking its young in the territory of hyenas he reached the end of the fourth block the last block where were they where was the slender compact panov and the tall striking auburnhaired marie his instructions had been clear absolute the first four blocks north on the right side the east side mo panov had recited them back to him oh christ i he had been looking for two people one whose physical appearance could belong to hundreds of men in those four crowded blocks but his eyes had been searching for the tall darkredheaded woman which she was no longer her hair had been dyed grey with streaks of white alex started back down towards salisbury road his eyes now attuned to what he should look for not what his painful memories told him he would find there they were on the outskirts of a crowd surrounding a street vendor whose cart was piled high with silks of all descriptions and labels the silks relatively genuine the labels as ersatz as the distorted signatures come on with me said conklin his hands on both their elbows alex cried marie are you all right asked panov no said the cia man none of us is its david isnt it marie grabbed conklins arm gripping it not now hurry up we have to get out of here theyre here marie gasped her greyhaired head turning right and left fear in her eyes who i dont know she shouted over the din of the crowds no theyre not here said conklin come on ive got a taxi holding down by the pen what pen asked panov i told you the peninsula hotel oh yes i forgot all three started walking down nathan road alex as was obvious to marie and morris panov with difficulty we can slow down cant we asked the psychiatrist no we cant youre in pain said marie knock it off both of you i dont need your horseshit then tell us whats happened yelled marie as they crossed a street filled with carts they had to dodge and buyers and sellers and touristvoyeurs who made for the exotic congestion of the golden mile theres the taxi said conklin as they approached salisbury road hurry up the driver knows where to go inside the cab panov between marie and alex she once again reached out clutching conklins arm it is david isnt it yes hes back hes here in hong kong thank god you hope we hope what does that mean asked the psychiatrist sharply somethings gone wrong the scenarios off the wire for christs sake exploded panov will you speak english he means said marie staring at the cia man that david either did something he wasnt supposed to do or didnt do something he was expected to do thats about it conklins eyes drifted to the right towards the lights of victoria harbour and the island of hong kong beyond i used to be able to read deltas moves usually before he made them then later when he was bourne i was able to track him when others couldnt because i understood his options and knew which ones he would take that is until things happened to him and no one could predict anything because hed lost touch with the delta inside him but deltas back now and as happened so often so long ago his enemies have underestimated him i hope im wrong jesus i hope im wrong his gun against the back of the assassins neck delta moved silently through the underbrush in front of the high wall of the sterile house the killer balked they were within feet of the darkened entrance delta jammed the weapon into the commandos flesh and whispered there arent any trip lights in the wall or on the ground theyd be set off by tree rats every thirty seconds keep going ill tell you when to stop the order came four feet from the gate delta grabbed his prisoner by the collar and swung him around the barrel of the gun still touching the assassins neck the man from medusa then reached into his pocket pulled out a globule of plastique and stretched his arm out as far as he could towards the gate he pressed the adhesive side of the packet against the wall he had preset the small digital timer in the soft centre of the explosive for seven minutes the number chosen both for luck and to give him time to get the killer and himself in place several hundred feet away move he whispered they rounded the corner of the wall and proceeded along the side to the midpoint from where the end of the stone was visible in the moonlight wait here said delta reaching into his knapsack which was strapped across his chest like a bandolier the bag on his right side he pulled out a square black box inches wide high and deep at its side was a coiled foot line of thin black plastic tubing it was a batteryamplified speaker he placed it on top of the wall and snapped a switch in the back a red light glowed he uncoiled the thin tubing as he shoved the killer forward another twenty or thirty feet he said above them the branches of a cascading willow tree were spread out above the wall arcing downward concealment here bourne whispered harshly and stopped the commando by gripping his shoulder he removed the wirecutters from the knapsack and pushed the assassin against the wall they faced each other im cutting you loose now but not free do you understand that the commando nodded and delta snipped the ropes between his prisoners wrists and elbows while levelling his gun at the assassins head he stepped back and bent his right leg forward in front of the killer as he handed him the cutters stand on my leg and cut the coils you can reach them if you jump a bit and slide your hand under for a grip dont try anything you havent got a gun yet but i have and as im sure youve gathered i dont care any more the prisoner did as he was told the leap from deltas leg was minimal the assassins left arm expertly slithered between the coils his hand gripping the opposite side of the top of the wall he severed the coiled wire noiselessly holding the cutters against the metal on one side to reduce the sound of snapping tension the open space above was now five feet wide climb up there said delta the killer did so and as his left leg swung over the wall delta leaped up to grab the assassins trousers and pulled himself up against the stone swinging his own left leg over the top he straddled the wall simultaneously with the commando nicely done major allcottprice he said a small circular microphone in his hand his weapon again aimed at the assassins head not much longer now if i were you id study the grounds under conklins urgent pleas to the driver the taxi sped up the road in victoria peak they passed a broken down car off the side of the road it seemed out of place in the elegant surroundings and alex swallowed as he saw it wondering in dread if it was really disabled theres the house cried the cia man for gods sake hurry go up to the he did not could not finish up ahead a shattering explosion filled the road and the night fire and stone flew in all directions as first a large part of the wall collapsed and then the huge iron gates fell forward in eerie slow motion beyond the flames oh my god i was right said alexander conklin softly to himself deltas come back he wants to die he will die not yet roared jason bourne as the wall blew apart beyond the stately gardens filled with rows of lilacs and roses ill tell you when he added quietly holding the small circular microphone in his free hand the assassin grunted his instincts roused to their primeval limits his desire to kill equal to his desire to survive the one dependent upon the other he was on the edge of madness only the barrel of deltas gun stopped him from an insane assault he was still human and it was better to try to live than to accept death through default but when when the nervous tic returned to allcottprices face his lower lip twitched as screams and shouts and the sound of men running in panic filled the gardens the killers hands trembled as he stared at delta in the dim pulsating light of the distant flames dont even think about it said the man from medusa youre dead if you make a move youve studied me so you know theres no reprieve you make it you make it on your own swing your leg over the wall and be ready to jump when i tell you not before without warning bourne suddenly brought the microphone to his lips and snapped a switch when he spoke his amplified words echoed eerily throughout the grounds a haunting reverberating sound that matched the thunder of the explosion made more ominous by its calm simplicity its frigidity you marines take cover and stay out of this its not your fight dont die for the men who brought you here to them expendable as i was expendable theres no legitimacy here no territory to be defended no honour of your country in question youre here for the sole purpose of protecting killers the only difference between you and me is the fact that they used me too but now they want to kill me because i know what theyve done dont die for these men theyre not worth it i give you my word i wont fire on you unless you shoot at me and then ill have no choice but theres another man here who isnt going to make any deals a fusillade of gunfire erupted shattering the source of the sound blasting the unseen speaker randomly off the wall delta was ready it was bound to happen one of the faceless nameless manipulators had given an order and it was carried out he reached into the knapsack removing a inch preset tear gas launcher the canister in place it could smash heavy glass at fifty yards he aimed and pulled the trigger a hundred feet away a bay window was shattered the fog of gas billowing throughout the room inside he could see figures running beyond the fragmented glass lamps and chandeliers were extinguished supplanted by a startling array of floodlights positioned in the eaves of the great house and the trunks of the surrounding trees suddenly the grounds were awash with blinding white light the branches of the overhanging tree would be a magnet for pivoting eyes and levelled weapons and he understood that no appeal of his would countermand the orders he had delivered that appeal both as an honest warning and a salve for what conscience remained to a barelythinking barelyfeeling robot avenger in the shadows of the mind he had left he did not want to take the lives of youngsters called to serve the paranoid egos of manipulators he had seen too much of that in saigon years ago he wanted only the lives of those inside the sterile house and he intended to have them jason bourne would not be denied they had taken everything from him and his personal account was now going to be settled for the man from medusa the decision was made he was a puppet on the strings of his own rage and apart from that rage his life was over jump whispered delta swinging his right leg over the wall pummelling the assassin down to the ground he followed while the commando was in midair and grabbed the impostors shoulder as the startled killer arms extended on his knees righted himself on the grass bourne dragged him out of sight into a latticed arbour with a profusion of bougainvillaea that reached nearly feet high heres your gun major said the original jason bourne mines on you and dont you forget it the assassin simultaneously grabbed the weapon and tore the cloth from his mouth coughing and spitting out saliva as a savage burst of gunfire tore leaves and branches all along the wall your little lecture didnt do much fucking good did it i didnt expect it to the truth of the matter is that they want you not me you see im really expendable now that was their plan from the beginning i bring you out and im dead my wifes dead we know too much she because she learned who they were she had to she was the bait me because they knew id put some figures together in peking youre messed up with a bloodbath major a megabomb that can blow the whole far east apart and will if saner heads in taiwan dont isolate and rip out those lunatic clients of yours only i dont give a shit any more play your goddamned games and blow yourselves up i just want to get inside that house a squad of marines assaulted the wall running alongside the stone rifles poised ready to fire delta pulled a second plastique from his knapsack set the miniaturized digital timer for ten seconds and threw the packet as far as he could towards the rear garden wall away from the guards come on he ordered the commando ramming his weapon into the killers spine you in front down this path nearer the house give me one of those give me a plastic i dont think so christ you gave me your word then either i lied or i changed my mind why what do you care i care i didnt know there were so many kids too many kids you could take out ten of them with one of these maim a lot more its a little late for you to become such a fucking christian the clubs not that exclusive it never was i know who i want and who i dont want and i dont want kids in pressed gi pajamas i want the men inside that the explosion came some forty yards away at the rear of the grounds trees and dirt bushes and whole beds of flowers flamed into the air a panorama of greens and browns and speckled dots of colour within the billowing grey smoke illuminated by the hot white floodlights move whispered delta to the end of the row its about sixty feet from the house and theres a pair of doors bourne closed his eyes in angry futility as a series of seemingly unending spurts of rifle fire filled the rear gardens they were children they fired blindly out of fear killing imaginary demons but no targets and they would not listen another group of marines these obviously led by an experienced officer took up equidistant positions in front of the great house circling it legs bent feet dug in for recoils weapons angled forward the manipulators had called for their praetorian guard so be it delta again reached into his knapsack felt around his arsenal and removed one of the two manual firebombs he had purchased in the mongkok it was similar to a grenade at the top circular but covered with a shield of heavy plastic the base however was a handle five inches long so that the thrower could hurl the explosive farther and with greater accuracy the trick was in the throwing the accuracy and the timing for once the plastic was removed the shell of the bomb itself would adhere to any surface by an instant steellike adhesive activated by air and with the explosion a chemical shot out in all directions prolonging the flames embedding itself into all porous surfaces seeping and burning from the removal of the plastic covering to the explosion took fifteen seconds the sides of the great house the sterile house were weatherboard above an imposing lower border of stone delta shoved the assassin into a cluster of roses stripped off the plastic and heaved the firebomb into the boarding far above and to the left of the french doors thirtyodd feet away it stuck to the wood the rest was waiting for the seconds to pass while the rifle fire hesitant now diminishing ceased altogether the wall of the house blew apart a gaping hole revealed a formal victorian bedroom complete with a brass bedstead and ornate english furniture the flames spread instantly shooting spokes of fire from a central hub spewing along the weatherboard and spitting inside the house an order was given and again there was an eruption of rifle fire bullets spraying the flowerbeds away from the rear garden wall and the contingent of marines who had raced in the direction of the previous explosion commands and counter commands were shouted in anger and frustration as two officers appeared sidearms in their hands one rounded the circle of protecting guards checking their positions and their weapons peering in front of each the other headed for the sidewall and began retracing the route of the first squad his eyes constantly shifting to his inner flanks to the succeeding rows of flowers he stopped beneath the willow tree and studied the wall then the grass he raised his head and looked over at the arbour of bougainvillaea his weapon now steadied by both hands he started towards the arbour delta watched the soldier through the bushes his own gun still pressed into the commandos back he removed another plastique set the timer and threw it over the bushes far forward towards the sidewall go through there ordered bourne pivoting the assassin by the shoulder and sending him into the row of bushes on the left jason plunged through after the commando cracking the barrel of his automatic into the killers head stopping him as he lurched for the knapsack just a few more minutes major then youre on your own the fourth explosion tore away six feet of the sidewall and as though they expected enemy troops to pour through the marine guards opened fire on the collapsing stone in the distance on the roads of victoria peak twonote sirens wailed in counterpoint to the sounds of carnage taking place within the grounds of the sterile house delta pulled out his next to last plastic packet set the timer for ninety seconds and heaved it towards the corner of the rear wall where the grounds were deserted it was the beginning of his final diversion the rest would be cold mathematics he removed the tear gas launcher inserted a canister and spoke to the commando turn around the assassin did so the barrel of bournes gun in front of his eyes take this said delta you can hold it with one hand when i tell you fire it into the stone to the right of the french doors the gas will spread blinding most of those kids they wont be able to shoot so dont waste bullets you havent got that many the killer did not at first reply instead he raised his weapon level with bournes and aimed it at jasons head now were oneonone mr original said the commando i told you i could take a bullet in the head ive been waiting for it for years but somehow i dont think you can take the idea of not getting inside that house there was a sudden roar of voices and yet another fusillade of gunfire as a squad of marines rushed the collapsed side wall delta watched waiting for the instant when the assassins concentration would break for that split second the instant did not come instead the commando continued quietly his voice tense but controlled as he stared at jason bourne they must be expecting an invasion the silly geese when in doubt attack as long as your flanks are covered isnt that right mr original empty your bag of tricks delta it was delta wasnt it theres nothing left bourne cocked the hammer of his automatic the assassin did the same then lets have a feel around said the commando his left hand slowly reaching out softly touching the knapsack strapped on deltas right hip their eyes locked the killer felt the canvas squeezing the harsh cloth in several places again slowly he withdrew his hand with all the shaltnots in the bloody big book none ever mentions a lie does it except false witness of course which isnt the same i guess you took the lapse to heart sport theres a shellframed automatic repeater in there and two or three clips i judge by the curves holding at least fifty rounds a piece forty to be exact thats a lot of firepower that little beast could get me out of here give or one of us goes right here right now the fifth plastique explosion shook the ground the startled assassin blinked it was enough bournes hand shot up deflecting the killers gun crashing his heavy automatic into the commandos left temple with the force of a hammer son of a bitch cried the impostor hoarsely as he fell to his left jasons knee on his wrist the killers gun wrenched free you keep begging for a quick demise major said bourne as pandemonium reached its height within the grounds of the victorian sterile house the squad of marines that had charged the collapsed sidewall were ordered to assault the rear of the gardens you really dont like yourself do you but youve got a good idea i will empty my bag of tricks its almost time now bourne removed the straps and upturned his open knapsack the contents fell on the grass the flames from the everexpanding fire on the first floor of the sterile house illuminating them there was one firebomb and one plastique left and as accurately described by the assassin a handheld repeating mac machine pistol that needed only its stock frame and a clip to be inserted in order to fire he inserted the frame of the lethal weapon cracked in one of the four clips and shoved the remaining three into his belt he then released the spring of the launcher put the canister in place and reset the mechanism it was ready to go to save the lives of children children called to die by the ageing egos of manipulators the firebomb remained he knew where to direct it he lifted it up tore off the shield and threw it with all his strength towards the aframed apex above the french doors it clung to the wood it was the moment he pulled the trigger of the launcher sending the canister of gas into the stone to the right of the french doors it exploded bouncing off the wall to the ground the vapours spreading instantly clouds of gas swirling choking men within its billowing periphery weapons were clung to but free hands rubbed swollen watery eyes and covered inflamed nostrils the second firebomb exploded tearing away the elegant victorian facade above the french doors shattering the panes of glass whole sections of the upper wall plummeting down into the tiled foyer beyond flames spread upward towards the eaves and inside firing curtains and upholstery the marine guards scrambled away from the thunderous explosion and the flames into the clouds of tear gas a number now dropped their rifles as all lurched in every direction colliding with another trying to get away from the fumes gagging coughing seeking relief delta rose to a crouch the machine pistol in his hand yanking the assassin up beside him it was time the chaos was complete the swirling gas in front of the shattered french doors was being sucked in by the heat of the flames it would dissipate sufficiently for him to make headway once inside his search would be quick over in moments the directors of a covert operation that required a sterile house in foreign territory would stay within the protective confines of the house itself for two reasons the first was that the size and disposition of the attacking force could not be accurately estimated and the risk of capture or death outside was too great the second was more practical papers had to be destroyed burnt not shredded as they had learned in teheran directives dossiers operational progress reports background materials all had to go the sirens in victoria peak were growing louder nearer the frantic race up the steep roads was nearly over its the countdown said bourne setting the timer on the last plastique explosive im not giving this to you but ill use it to advantage both yours and mind thirty seconds major allcottprice jason arced the packet as far as he could towards the right front wall my weapon for christs sake give me the gun its on the ground under my foot the assassin lurched down let go of it when i want to and i will want to but if you try to take it the next thing youll see is a cell in the hong kong garrison and according to you a scaffold a thick rope and a hangman in your immediate future the killer looked up in panic you goddamned liar you lied frequently dont you you said i know what i said i also know why youre here and why instead of nine shells you have three what youre my diversion major when i let you free with the gun youll head for the gate or a blownout section of the wall whichever its your choice theyll try to stop you youll fire back naturally and while they concentrate on you ill get inside you bastard my feelings are hurt but then i dont have feelings any longer so it doesnt matter i simply have to get inside the last explosion blew up a sculptured tree its roots smashing into a weakened section of the wall stones falling out of place the wall itself half crumbling splitting rocks forming a v at the centre of secondary impact marines from the gate contingent rushed forward wow roared delta rising to his full height give me the gun let go of it jason bourne suddenly froze he could not move except that by some instinct or other he crashed his knee up into the killers throat sending the assassin over on his side a man had appeared beyond the shattered glass doors of the burning foyer a handkerchief covered his face but it could not cover his limp his limp with his club foot the silhouetted figure kicked down the left frame of the french doors and awkwardly walked down the three steps to the short flagstone patio fronting the once stately gardens he dragged himself forward and yelled as loud as he could ordering the guards who could hear him to hold their fire the figure did not have to lower his handkerchief delta knew the face it was the face of his enemy it was paris a cemetery outside paris alexander conklin had come to kill him beyondsalvage was the order from on high david its alex dont do what youre doing stop it its we david im here to help you youre here to kill me you came to kill me in paris you tried again in new york treadstone seventyone youve got a short memory you bastard you dont have any memory goddamn you you became delta thats what they wanted i know the whole story david i flew over here because we put it together marie mo panov and i were all here maries safe lies tricks all of you you killed her you would have killed her in paris but i wouldnt let you near her i kept her away from you shes not dead david shes alive i can bring her to you now more lies delta crouched and pulled the trigger spraying the patio the bullets ricocheting up into the burning foyer but for reasons unknown to him they did not cut down the man himself you want to pull me out so you can give the order and im dead beyondsalvage carried out no way executioner im going inside i want the silent secret men behind you theyre there i know theyre there bourne grabbed the fallen assassin and pulled him to his feet handing him the gun you wanted a jason bourne hes yours im setting him loose among the roses kill him while i kill half crazed half survivor the commando lunged through the flowering bushes away from bourne he raced first down the path then instantly returned seeing that the marine guards were at the north and south areas of the wall if he showed himself on the east border of the garden he was caught between both contingents he was dead if he moved i havent any more time conklin yelled bourne why couldnt he kill the man who had betrayed him squeeze the trigger kill the last of treadstone seventyone kill kill what stopped him the assassin threw himself over the bed of flowers clutching the warm barrel of bournes machine gun wrenching it downward levelling and firing his own gun at jason the bullet grazed bournes forehead and in fury he yanked back the trigger of the repeating weapon bullets thundered into the ground the vibrations within their small deadly arena earthshattering he grabbed the englishmans gun twisting it counterclockwise the assassins halfmutilated right arm was no match for the man from medusa the gun exploded as bourne wrenched it free the impostor fell back on the grass his eyes glazed within them the knowledge that he had lost david for gods sake listen to me you have to there is no david here screamed jason his knee rammed into the assassins chest my rightful name is bourne sprung from delta spawned by medusa the snake lady remember we have to talk we have to die you have to die the secret men inside are my contract with myself with marie they have to die bourne gripped the lapel of the assassins jacket pulling him up on his feet i repeat heres your jason bourne hes all yours dont shoot hold your fire roared conklin as bewildered segments of the three marine contingents began to close in and the deafening sirens of the hong kong police roared to a stop at the demolished gate the man from medusa slammed his shoulder into the commandos back propelling the killer out into the light of the roaring flames and the floodlights there hew thats the prize you wanted there was a burst of rifle fire as the assassin reeled out then dove to the ground rolling over and over to avoid the bullets stop it not him for christs sake hold your fire dont kill him not him roared jason bourne not him only me isnt that right you son of a bitch now you do die for marie for echo for all of us he squeezed the trigger of the machine gun but still the bullets would not hit their mark he swung around and swinging back and forth aimed his deadly weapon at both converging squads of marines again he fired several prolonged bursts crouching ducking moving from place to place behind the roses yet he angled the barrel above their heads why the children could not stop him but then the children in their pressed gi issue should not die for the manipulators he had to get inside the sterile house now no moments were left it was now david a womans voice oh christ a womans voice david david david a figure in a flowing skirt ran out of the sterile house she grabbed alexander conklin and pushed him away she stood alone on the patio its me david im here im safe everythings all right my darling another trick another lie it was an old woman with grey hair white hair get out of my way lady or ill kill you youre just another lie another trick david its me cant you hear me i can see you a trick no david my names not david i told your scum friend theres no david here dont screamed marie desperately shaking her head and running in front of several marines who had crawled out on the grass away from the swirling vanishing clouds of gas they were on their knees with a clear view of bourne getting their bearings levelling their rifles unsteadily at him marie positioned herself between the recovering guards and their target havent you done enough to him for gods sake somebody stop them and get blown away by some son of a bitch terrorist yelled a youthful voice from the ranks by the front wall hes not what you think whatever he is the people inside made him that way you heard him he wont fire on you if you dont shoot hes already fired roared an officer youre still standing yelled back alex conklin from the edge of the patio and hes a better marksman with more weapons than any man here account for it i can i dont need you thundered jason bourne once again triggering a burst of machine gun fire into the burning wall of the sterile house suddenly the assassin was on his feet crouching then lunging for the marine nearest him a hatless youngster still coughing from the gas the killer grabbed the guards rifle kicking him in the head and firing the weapon into the next nearest marine who lurched backwards grabbing his stomach the killer spun around he spotted an officer with a machine pistol not unlike bournes he shot him in the neck and grabbed the weapon from the falling body he paused for only a split halfsecond evaluating his chances then whipped the machine pistol up under his left arm delta watched instinctively knowing what the commando would do knowing too that his diversion was about to take place the assassin did it he fired again one round after another into the closed ranks of the young inexperienced marines by the front wall racing dodging his way across the short stretch of grass into the shoulderhigh flowers on bournes left it was his only escape route the least illuminated collapsed right rear wall stop him shouted conklin limping frantically across the patio but dont shoot dont kill him for christs sake dont kill him bullshit came the reply from someone in the squad of marines by the left rear wall the assassin twisting turning crouching his rifle on repeat fire quickly worked his way towards the broken wall pinning the guards down by his rapid bursts the rifle chamber ran out of shells he threw it down swinging the murderous machine pistol into place and started his last race towards the broken wall spraying the prone contingent of marines he was there the darkness beyond was his escape you motherfucker it was a teenagers cry the voice immature in torment but nevertheless lethal you killed my buddy you blew his fucking face off youre going to buy it you shithead a young black marine leaped away from his dead white companion and raced towards the wall as the assassin swung around vaulting over the stone another burst from the killer caught the marine in the shoulder he lunged to the ground rolled over twice to his left and fired four rounds of ammunition they were followed by an agonizing hysterical scream of defiance it was the scream of death the impostor his eyes wide in hatred fell into the jagged rocks major allcott price formerly of the royal commandos was gone bourne started forward his weapon raised marie ran to the border of the patio the distance between them no more than a few feet dont do it david im not david lady ask your scumball friend we go back a long time get out of my way why couldnt he kill her one burst and he was free to do what he had to do why all right screamed marie holding her place there is no david all right youre jason bourne youre delta youre anything you want to be but youre also mine youre my husband the revelation had the impact of a sudden bolt of lightning on the guards who heard it the officers their elbows bent held up their hands the universal command to hold fire as they and the men stared in astonishment i dont know you my voice is my own you know it jason a trick an actress a mimic a lie its been done before and if i look different its because of you jason bourne get out of my way or get killed you taught me in paris on the rue de rivoli the hotel meurice the newsstand on the corner can you remember the newspapers with the story out of zurich my photograph on all the front pages and the small hotel in the montparnasse when we were checking out the concierge reading the paper my picture in front of his face you were so frightened you told me to run outside the taxi do you remember the taxi on the way to issylesmoulineaux ill never forget that impossible name change your hair you said pull it up or push it back you said you didnt care what i did so long as i changed it you asked me if i had an eyebrow pencil you told me to thicken my brows make them longer your words jason we were running for our lives and you wanted me to look different to remove any likeness to the photograph that was all over europe i had to become a chameleon because jason bourne was a chameleon he had to teach his lover his wife thats all ive done jason wo cried delta drawing the word out into a scream the mists of confusion enveloping him sending his mind into the outer regions of panic the images were there rue de rivoli the montparnasse the taxi listen to me i am a chameleon called cain and i can teach you many things i do not care to teach you but i must i can change my colour to accommodate the forest lean shift with the wind by smelling it i can find my way through natural and manmade jungles alpha bravo charlie delta delta is for charlie and charlie is for cain i am cain i am death and i must tell you who i am and lose you you do remember shouted david webbs wife a trick the chemicals i said the words they gave you the words they have to stop me they gave me nothing i want nothing from them i only want my husband im marie youre a lie they killed her delta squeezed the trigger the fusillade of bullets exploding the earth at maries feet rifles quickly were brought up to firing positions dont do it screamed marie whipping her head over at the marine guards her eyes glaring her voice a command all right jason if you dont know me i dont want to live i cant be plainer than that my darling its why i understand what youre doing youre throwing your life away because a part of you thats taken over thinks im gone and you dont want to live without me i understand that very well because i dont want to live without you marie took several steps across the grass and stood motionless delta raised the machine gun the snubnosed sight on the barrel centering on the grey hair streaked with white his index finger closed around the trigger suddenly involuntarily his right hand began to tremble then his left the murderous weapon began to waver at first slowly back and forth then faster in circles as bournes head swayed in fitful jerks the trembling spread his neck began to lose control there was a commotion within the gathering crowd at the smouldering ruins of the gate and the guardhouse several hundred feet away a man struggled he was held by two marines let me go you goddamned fools im a doctor his doctor with a surge of strength morris panov broke away and raced across the lawn into the glare of the floodlights he stopped twenty feet from bourne delta began to moan the sound and the rhythm were barbaric jason bourne dropped the weapon and david webb fell to his knees weeping marie started towards him woa commanded panov his voice quietly emphatic stopping webbs wife he has to come to you he must he needs me not that way he has to recognize you david has to recognize you and tell his other self to let him free you cant do that for him he has to do it for himself silence floodlights fire and like a cringing beaten child david webb raised his head the tears streaming down his cheeks slowly painfully he rose to his feet and ran into the arms of his wife they were in the sterile house in the whitewalled communications centre in an antiseptic cell belonging to some futuristic laboratory complex whitefaced computers rose above the white counters on the left dozens of thin dark rectangular mouths sporadically indented their teeth digital readouts forming luminescent green numbers that constantly changed with inviolate frequency alterations and less sophisticated less secure means of sending and receiving information on the right was a large white conference table above the whitetiled floor the only deviation to colour conformity and asepsis being several black ashtrays the players were in place around the table the technicians had been dismissed all systems put on hold only the ominous redalert a inch by inch panel in the central computer remained active an operator was outside the closed door should the alarming red lights appear beyond this sacrosanct isolated room the hong kong firefighters were hosing down the last of the smouldering embers as the hong kong police were calming the panicked residents from the nearby estates on victoria peak many of whom were convinced that armageddon had arrived in the form of a mainland onslaught telling everyone that the terrible events were the work of a deranged criminal killed by government emergency units the skeptical peak residents were not satisfied the times were not on their side their world was not as it should be and they wanted proof so the corpse of the dead assassin was paraded on a stretcher past the curious onlookers the punctured blooddrenched body partially uncovered for all to see the stately residents returned to their stately homes having by this time contemplated all manner of insurance claims the players sat in white plastic chairs living breathing robots waiting for a signal to commence none really possessing the courage or the energy to open the proceedings exhaustion mingled with the fear of violent death marked their faces marked all but one face his possessed the deep lines and dark shadows of extreme fatigue but there was no hollow fear in his eyes only passive bewildered acceptance of things still beyond his understanding minutes ago death had held no fear for him it was preferable to living now in his confusion his wife gripping his hand he could feel the swelling of distant anger distant in the sense that it was far back in the recesses of his mind relentlessly pushing forward like the faraway thunder over a lake in an approaching summer storm who did this to us said david webb his voice barely above a whisper i did answered havilland at the end of the rectangular white table the ambassador leaned slowly forward returning webbs deathlike stare if i were in a court of law seeking mercy for an ignominious act i would have to plead extenuating circumstances which were asked david in a monotone first there is the crisis said the diplomat second there was yourself explain that interrupted alex conklin at the other end of the table facing havilland webb and marie were on his left in front of the white wall morris panov and edward mcallister opposite them and dont leave anything out added the rogue intelligence officer i dont intend to said the ambassador his eyes remaining on david the crisis is real the catastrophe imminent a cabal has been formed deep in peking by a group of zealots led by a man so deeply entrenched in the hierarchy of his government so revered as a philosopherprince that he cannot be exposed no one would believe it anyone who attempted to expose him would become a pariah worse any attempt at exposure would risk a backlash so severe that peking would cry insult and outrage and revert to suspicion and intransigence but if the conspiracy is not aborted it will destroy the hong kong accords and blow the colony apart the result will be the immediate occupation by the peoples republic i dont have to tell you what that would mean economic chaos violence bloodshed and undoubtedly war in the far east how long could such hostilities be contained before other nations are forced to choose sides the risk is unthinkable silence eyes locked with eyes fanatics from the kuomintang said david his voice flat and cold china against china its been the war cry of maniacs for the past forty years but only a cry mr webb words talk but no movement no strikes no ultimate strategy havilland cupped his hands on the table breathing deeply there is now the strategys in place a strategy so oblique and devious so long in the making they believe it cant fail but of course it will and when it does the world will be faced with a crisis of intolerable proportions it could well lead to the final crisis the one we cant survive certainly the far east wont youre not telling me anything i havent seen for myself theyve gone down deep in high places and theyre probably spreading but theyre still fanatics a lunatic fringe and if the maniac i saw who was running the show is anything like the others theyd all be hanged in tian an men square itd be televised and approved by every group opposed to capital punishment he was is a messianic sadist a butcher butchers arent statesmen theyre not taken seriously herr hitler was in nineteenthirtythree observed havilland the ayatollah khomeini only a few years ago but then you obviously dont know who their true leader is hed never show himself under any circumstances where you might even remotely see him however i can assure you hes a statesman and taken very seriously however again his objective is not peking its hong kong i saw what i saw and heard what i heard and itll all be with me for a long time you dont need me you never did isolate them spread the word in the central committee call in taiwan to disown them they will times change they dont want that war any more than peking does the ambassador studied the medusan obviously evaluating davids information realizing that webb had seen enough in peking to draw conclusions of his own but not enough to understand the essence of the hong kong conspiracy its too late the forces have been set in motion treachery at the highest levels of chinas government treachery at the hands of the despised nationalists assumed to be in collusion with western financial interests even the devoted followers of deng xiao ping could not accept that blow to pekings pride that loss of international face the role of the duped cuckold neither would we if it was learned that general motors ibm and the new york stock exchange were being run by american traitors trained in the soviet diverting billions to projects not in our nations interests the analogy is accurate broke in mcallister his fingers at his right temple cumulatively thats what hong kong will be to the peoples republic that and a hundred thousand times more but theres another element and its as alarming as anything else weve learned i should like to bring it up now in my position as an analyst as someone whos supposed to calculate the reactions of adversaries and potential adversaries make it short interrupted webb you talk too much and you keep rubbing your head too much and i dont like your eyes they belong to a dead fish you talked too much in maine youre a liar yes yes i understand what youre saying and why youre saying it but im a decent man mr webb i believe in decency i dont not any longer go on this is all very enlightening and i dont understand a goddamned thing because nobodys said a goddamned thing that makes sense whats your contribution liar the organized crime factor mcallister swallowed at davids repeated insult but still delivered the statement as if he expected everyone to understand when faced with blank looks he added the triads mafiastructured groups oriental style said marie her eyes on the undersecretary of state criminal brotherhoods mcallister nodded narcotics illegal immigration gambling prostitution loan sharking all the usual pursuits and some not so usual added marie theyre deep into their own form of economics they own banks indirectly of course throughout california oregon the state of washington and up into my country in british columbia they launder money in the millions every day by way of international transfers which only serves to compound the crisis said mcallister emphatically why asked david whats your point crime mr webb the leaders of the peoples republic are obsessed with crime reports indicate that over a hundred thousand executions have taken place during the last three years with little distinction made between misdemeanors and felonies its consistent with the regime the origins of the regime all revolutions believe they are conceived in purity the purity of the cause is everything peking will make ideological adjustments to benefit from the wests marketplace but therell be no accommodation for even the hint of organized crime you make them sound like a collection of paranoids interjected panov they are they cant afford to be anything else ideologically asked the psychiatrist skeptically sheer numbers doctor the purity of the revolution is the cover but its the numbers that frighten them a huge immensely populated country with vast resources my god if organized crime moved in and with a billion people inside its borders dont think for a minute the overlords arent champing at the bit it could become a nation of triads villages towns whole cities could be divided into family terrains all profiting from the influx of western capital and technology thered be an explosion of illegal exports flooding the contraband markets across the world narcotics from uncountable hills and fields that could not possibly be patrolled weapons from subsidiary factories set up through graft textiles from hundreds of underground plants using stolen machinery and peasant labour crippling those industries in the west crime thats a great leap forward no one over heres been able to accomplish in the last forty years said conklin who would dare try asked mcallister if a person can be executed for stealing fifty yuan whos going to go for a hundred thousand it takes protection organization people in high places this is what peking fears why its paranoid the leaders are terrified of corruptors in high places the political infrastructure could be eroded the leaders would lose control and that they will not risk again their fears are paranoid but for them theyre terribly real any hint that powerful criminal factions are in league with internal conspirators infiltrating their economy would be enough for them to disown the accords and send their troops down into hong kong your conclusions obvious said marie but wheres the logic how could it happen its happening mrs webb answered ambassador havilland its why we needed jason bourne somebody had better start at the beginning said david the diplomat did it began over thirty years ago when a brilliant young man was sent from taiwan back to the land of his fathers birth and given a new name a new family it was a longrange plan its roots in zealotry and revenge webb listened as the incredible story of sheng chou yang unfolded each block in place each fact convincingly the truth for there was no reason any longer for lies twentyseven minutes later when he had finished havilland picked up a blackbordered file folder he lifted the cover revealing a clasped sheaf of some seventyodd pages closed it and reached over placing it in front of david this is everything we know everything weve learned the detailed specifics of everything ive told you it cant leave this house except as ashes but youre welcome to read it if you have any doubts or questions i swear to you ill move every source in the united states government from the oval office to the national security council to satisfy you i could do no less the diplomat paused his eyes fixed on webbs perhaps we have no right to ask it but we need your help we need all the information you can give us so you can send someone in to take out this sheng chou yang essentially yes but its far more complex than that our hand must be invisible it cant be seen or even remotely suspected shengs covered himself brilliantly peking looks upon him as a visionary a great patriot who works slavishly for mother china you might say a saint his security is absolute the people around him his aides his guards theyre his protective shock troops their allegiance is solely to him which is why you wanted the impostor interrupted marie he was your link to sheng we knew he had accepted contracts from him sheng had to has to eliminate his opposition both those who oppose him ideologically and those he intends to exclude from his operations in this latter group broke in mcallister are the leaders of rival triads sheng doesnt trust that the fanatics of the kuomintang dont trust he knows that if theyre around to see that theyre being squeezed out a destabilizing gangland war would erupt which sheng couldnt tolerate any more than the british can with peking up the street within the past two months seven triad overlords have been killed their organizations crippled the new jason bourne was shengs perfect solution continued the ambassador the hired assassin with no political or national ties for above all the killings could never be traced back to china but he went to peking objected webb its where i tracked him even if it started out as a trap for me which it was a trap for you exclaimed havilland they knew about you i came face to face with my successor two nights ago at the airport we each knew who the other was it was impossible not to know he wasnt going to keep it a secret and take the fall for a failed contract it was you interrupted mcallister i knew it so did sheng and his people i was the new gun in town and had to be stopped killed on a priorityone basis they couldnt risk what id pieced together the trap was conceived that night set that night jesus cried conklin i read about kai tak in washington the papers said it was assumed to be rightwing lunatics keep the commies out of capitalism instead it was you both governments had to come up with something for the world press added the undersecretary just as we have to say something about tonight my point is said david ignoring mcallister this sheng called for the commando used him to mount a trap for me and by doing so made him part of the inner circle thats no way for a concealed client to keep his distance from a hired killer it is as if he didnt expect him to walk out of that circle alive replied havilland glancing at the undersecretary of state its edwards theory and one to which i subscribe that when the final contract was carried out or when it was deemed that he knew too much and was therefore a liability the impostor was to be killed collecting a payment believing of course that he was being given another assignment everything untraceable the slate clean the events at kai tak no doubt sealed his death warrant he wasnt smart enough to see it said jason bourne he couldnt think geometrically i beg your pardon asked the ambassador nothing answered webb again staring at the diplomat so everything you told me was part truth part lie hong kong could blow apart but not for the reasons you gave me the truth was our credibility you had to accept that accept our deep frightening concerns the lies were to recruit you havilland leaned back in his chair and i cant be any more honest than that bastards said webb his voice low icelike ill grant you that agreed havilland but as i mentioned before there were extenuating circumstances specifically two the crisis and yourself and said marie let me ask you mr webb mrs webb if we had come to you and stated our case would you have joined forces with us would you willingly have become jason bourne again silence all eyes were on david as his own strayed blankly over the surface of the table then rested on the file folder no he said softly i dont trust you we knew that agreed havilland again nodding his head but from our point of view we had to recruit you you were able to do what no one else could do and insofar as you did it i submit that that judgement was correct the cost was terrible no one underestimates it but we felt i felt that there was no other choice time and the consequences were against us are against us as much as before said webb the commandos dead the commando mcallister leaned forward your assassin the impostor what you did to us was all for nothing not necessarily objected havilland it will depend on what you can tell us news of a death up here will be in tomorrows headlines we cant stop it but sheng cant know whose death no photographs were taken no press was here at the time and those whove arrived since have been cordoned off several hundred yards away by the police we can control the information by simply providing it what about the body asked panov there are medical procedures overruled by mi said the ambassador this is still british territory and communications between london washington and government house were swift the impostors face was too shattered for anyone who saw it to give a description and his remains are in custody beyond scrutiny it was edwards thinking and he was damn quick about it theres still david and marie persisted the psychiatrist too many people saw them heard them only several squads of marine guards were close enough to see and hear clearly said mcallister the entire contingent is being flown back to hawaii in an hour including two dead and seven wounded theyve left the premises and are sequestered at the airport there was a great deal of confusion and panic the police and the firemen were occupied elsewhere none were in the gardens we can say anything we like that seems to be a habit with you commented webb you heard the ambassador said the undersecretary avoiding davids gaze we didnt feel we had a choice be fair to yourself edward again havilland looked at webb while addressing the undersecretary didnt feel we had a choice you strenuously objected i was wrong said mcallister firmly as the diplomat snapped his eyes over at him but thats irrelevant continued the undersecretary quickly weve got to decide what were going to say the consulates been swamped by calls from the press the consulate broke in conklin some sterile house there wasnt time for a proper leasing cover said the ambassador it was kept as quiet as possible and we prepared a plausible story so far as we know there were no questions but the police report had to list the owner and the lessee hows garden road handling it edward simply that the situation hasnt been clarified theyre waiting for us but they cant stall much longer its better that we prepare something than leave the circumstances to speculation infinitely agreed havilland i suspect that means you have something in mind its stopgap but it could serve if i heard mr webb correctly about what youve used the word commando several times i assume not as a figure of speech the assassin was a commando former an officer and a mental case homicidal to be accurate did you get an identity learn his name david looked hard at the analyst recalling allcottprices words spoken in a warped sense of sick triumph if hose and the story blows how many practising antisocials will be fired up by it how many other different men are out there whod be only too happy to take my place as i took yours this bloody world is crawling with jason bournes give them direction an idea and theyll be off and running i never found out who he was said webb simply but nevertheless he was a commando thats right not a ranger or a green beret or special forces no t assume therefore that you mean he was british yes then well put out a story that implicitly denies those specifics not an englishman no military record go in the opposite direction a white male american said conklin quietly with even a measure of respect as he looked at the undersecretary of state give him a name and a history from a dead file preferably fourthrate garbage a psychopath with a hangup so heavy he goes after someone up here something like that but perhaps not entirely said mcallister awkwardly shifting his position in the chair as if he did not care to disagree with the experienced cia man or something else white male yes american yes certainly a man with an obsession so compelling that hes driven to wholesale slaughter his fury directed at a target as you say up here who asked david me replied mcallister his eyes locked with webbs which means me said david im that man that obsessed man your name would not be used continued the undersecretary calmly coldly we could invent an american expatriate who several years ago was hunted by the authorities throughout the far east for crimes ranging from multiple murders to running narcotics well say i cooperated with the police in hong kong macao singapore japan malaysia sumatra and the philippines through my efforts his operations were effectively shut down and he lost millions he learns ive returned and am posted here on victoria peak he conies after me the man who ruined him mcallister paused turning to david since i spent a number of years here in hong kong i cant imagine that peking overlooked me im sure theres an extensive dossier on an analyst who made a number of enemies during his tour of duty here i did make enemies mr webb it was my job we were trying to increase our influence in this part of the world and wherever americans were involved in criminal activities i did my level best to help the authorities apprehend them or at the least force them out of asia it was the best way to show our good intentions going after our own it was also the reason state recalled me to washington and by using my name we lend a certain authenticity for sheng chou yang you see we knew each other hell speculate on a dozen possibilities i hope the right one but none remotely connected to a british commando the right speculation interrupted conklin quietly being the fact that no one over here has heard from the first jason bourne in a couple of years exactly so im the corpse thats in custody said webb beyond scrutiny you could be yes said mcallister you see we dont know what sheng knows how deep his penetration went the only thing we want to establish is that the dead man is not his assassin leaving the way open for another impostor to go back up and draw sheng out for the kill added conklin respectfully youre something mr analyst a son of a bitch but something youd be exposing yourself edward said havilland his gaze levelled at the undersecretary i never asked that of you you do have enemies i want to do it this way mr ambassador you employ me to render the best judgements that i can and in my judgement this is the most productive course theres got to be a convincing smokescreen my name can provide it for sheng the rest can be couched in ambiguous language language that everyone we want to reach will understand so be it said webb suddenly closing his eyes hearing the words jason bourne had spoken so often david marie touched his face sorry webb fingered the file folder in front of him then opened it on the first page was a photograph with a name printed underneath it was identified as the face of sheng chou yang but it was far more than that it was the face it was the face of the butcher the madman who hacked women and men to death with his jewelled ceremonial sword who forced brothers to fight with razor sharp knives until one killed the other who took a brave tortured echos life with a slash to the head bourne stopped breathing enraged by the unimaginable cruelty as bloody images overcame him as he stared at the photograph the sight of echo throwing his life away to save delta brought him back to that clearing in the forest delta knew that it was echos death that had made the assassins capture possible echo had died defiantly accepting his unbearably painful execution so that a fellow medusan could make good not only his escape but with a final gesture telling him that the madman with the sword must be killed this whispered jason bourne is the son of your unknown taipan yes said havilland your revered philosopherprince the chinese saint no one can expose again yes you were wrong he showed himself christ did he show himself stunned the ambassador shot forward youre certain theres no way i couldnt be certain the circumstances must have been extraordinary said the astonished mcallister and it certainly confirms that the impostor never would have got out of there alive still the circumstances must have been earthshaking for him considering the fact that no one outside china ever learned about them they were maos tomb became a shooting gallery it was part of the trap and they lost echo lost who asked marie still gripping his hand a friend maos tomb repeated havilland extraordinary not at all said bourne how bright the last place in china a target would expect an attack he goes in thinking hes the pursuer following his quarry expecting to pick him up outside on the other side the lights are dim his guard down and all the while hes the quarry hunted isolated set up for the kill very bright very dangerous for the hunters said the ambassador for shengs people one misstep and they could have been taken insanity no missteps were possible they would have killed their own if i hadnt killed them i understand that now when everything went off the wire they simply disappeared with echo back to sheng please mr webb havilland was himself obsessed his eyes pleading tell us what you saw what you know hes a monster said jason quietly his eyes glazed staring at the photograph he comes from hell a savonarola who tortures and kills men women kids with a smile on his face he gives sermons like a prophet talking to children but underneath hes a maniac who rules his gang of misfits by sheer terror those shock troops you mentioned arent troops theyre goons sadistic thugs whove learned their craft from a master hes auschwitz dachau and bergen belsen all rolled into one god help us all if he runs anything over here he can mr webb said havilland quietly his terrified gaze fixed on jason bourne he will youve just described a sheng chou yang the world has never seen and at this moment he is the most powerful man in china as adolf hitler marched victoriously into the reichstag so sheng will march into the central committee making it his puppet what youve told us is far more catastrophic than anything weve conceived of china against china armageddon to follow oh my god hes a brute animal whispered jason hoarsely he has to kill like a predator but his only hunger is killing not for food but for the kill youre talking in generalities mcallisters interruption was cold but intense we have to know more i have to know more he called a conference bourne spoke dreamily his head swaying his eyes again riveted on the photograph it was the start of the nights of the great blade he said there was a traitor he said the conference was something only a madman could create torches everywhere held in the countryside an hour out of peking in a bird sanctuary can you believe it a bird sanctuary and he really did what i say he did he killed a man suspended by ropes hacking his sword into the screaming body then a woman who tried to argue her innocence cutting her head off her head in front of everyone and then two brothers a traitor whispered mcallister ever the analyst did he find one did anyone confess is there any kind of counter insurgency stop it cried marie wo mrs webb hes going back hes reliving it look at him cant you see hes there im afraid our irritating colleague is right marie said panov softly watching webb hes in and out trying to find his own reality its okay let him ride it it could save us all a lot of time bullshit for ever accurate my dear and for ever debatable shut up there was no traitor no one who spoke only the woman with doubts he killed her and there was silence an awful silence he was warning everyone telling everyone that they were everywhere and at the same time they were invisible in the ministries in the security police everywhere and then he killed echo but echo knew he had to die he wanted to die quickly because he couldnt live much longer anyway after they tortured him he was in awful shape still if he could give me time who is echo david asked morris panov tell us please alpha bravo charlie delta echo foxtrot medusa said the psychiatrist its medusa isnt it echo was in medusa he was in paris the louvre he tried to save my life but i saved his that was okay it was right he saved mine before years ago rest is a weapon he said he put the others around me and made me sleep and then we got out of the jungle rest is a weapon marie spoke quietly and closed her eyes pressing her husbands hand the tears falling down her cheeks oh christ echo saw me in the woods we used the old signals we used before years ago he hadnt forgotten none of us ever forget are we in the countryside in the bird sanctuary david asked panov gripping mcallisters shoulder to stop him from intruding yes replied jason bourne his eyes now floating unfocused we both know hes going to die so simple so clear die death no more just buy time precious minutes then maybe i can do it do what delta panov drew out the name in quiet emphasis take out the son of a bitch take out the butcher he doesnt deserve to live he has no right to live he kills too easily with a smile on his face echo saw it i saw it now its happening everythings happening at once the explosions in the forest everybody running shouting i can do it now hes a clean kill he sees me hes staring at me he knows im his enemy i am your enemy butcher im the last face youll see whats wrong somethings wrong hes shielding himself hes pulling someone in front of him i have to get out i cant do it cant or wont asked panov leaning forward are you jason bourne or are you david webb who are you delta screamed the victim stunning everyone at the table by his outburst i am delta i am bourn cain is for delta and carlos is for cain the victim whoever he was collapsed back in the chair his head snapped down into his chest he was silent it took several minutes none knew how long none counted until the man who was unable to establish an identity for himself raised his head his eyes were now half free half prisoner to the agony he was experiencing im sorry said david webb i dont know what happened to me im sorry no apologies david said panov you went back its understandable its okay yes i went back screwy isnt it not at all said the psychiatrist its perfectly natural i have to go back thats understandable too isnt it mo david screamed marie reaching for him i have to said jason bourne gently holding her wrists no one else can do it its as simple as that i know the codes i know the way echo traded in his life for mine believing id do it id kill the butcher i failed then i wont fail now what about us marie clutched him her voice reverberating off the white walls dont we matter ill come back i promise you said david removing her arms and looking into her eyes but i have to go back cant you understand for these people these liars no not for them for someone who wanted to live above everything you didnt know him he was a survivor but he knew when his life wasnt worth the price of my death i had to live and do what i had to do i had to live and come back to you he knew that too he faced the equation and made his decision somewhere along the line we all have to make that decision bourne turned to mcallister is there anyone here who can take a picture of a corpse whose asked the undersecretary of state mine said jason bourne the grisly photograph was taken on the white conference table by a sterile house technician under the reluctant supervision of morris panov a bloodstained white sheet covered webbs body it was angled across his throat revealing a bloodstreaked face the eyes wide the features clear develop the roll as fast as you can and bring me the contacts instructed conklin twenty minutes said the technician heading for the door as mcallister entered the room whats happening asked david sitting up on the table marie wincing wiped his face with a warm wet towel the consulate press people called the media replied the undersecretary they said theyd issue a statement in an hour or so as soon as all the facts were in place theyre mocking one up now i gave them the scenario with a goahead to use my name theyll work it out with embassy obfuscation and read it to us before issuing it any word on lin asked the cia man a message from the doctor hes still critical but holding on what about the press down the road asked havilland weve got to let them in here sooner or later the longer we wait the more theyll think its a coverup we cant afford that either weve still got some rope in that area said mcallister i sent word that the police at great risks to themselves were sweeping the grounds for undetonated explosives reporters can be very patient under those conditions incidentally in the scenario i gave the press people i told them to stress the fact that the man who attacked the house was obviously an expert in demolition jason bourne one of the most proficient demolitions men to come out of medusa looked at mcallister the undersecretary looked away ive got to get out of here jason said ive got to get to macao as quickly as possible david for gods sake marie stood in front of her husband staring at him her voice low and intense i wish it didnt have to be this way said webb getting off the table i wish it didnt he repeated softly but it does i have to be in place i have to start the sequence to reach sheng before the story breaks in the morning papers before that photograph appears confirming the message im sending through channels hes convinced no one knows about hes got to believe im his assassin the man he was going to kill not the jason bourne from medusa who tried to kill him in that forest glen he has to get word from me from who he thinks i am before hes given any other information because the information im sending him is the last thing he wants to hear everything else will seem insignificant the bait said alex conklin feed him the critical information first and the cover falls in place because hes stunned preoccupied and accepts the printed official version in particular the photograph in the newspapers what are you going to tell him asked the ambassador his voice conveying the fact that he disliked the prospect of losing control of this blackest of operations what you told me part truth part lie spell it out mr webb said havilland firmly we owe you a great deal but you owe me what you cant pay me snapped jason bourne interrupting unless you blow your brains out right here in front of me i understand your anger but still i must insist youll do nothing to jeopardize the lives of five million people or the vital interests of the united states government im glad you got the sequence right for once all right mr ambassador ill tell you its what i would have told you before if youd had the decency the decency to come to me and state your case im surprised it never occurred to you no not surprised shocked but i guess i shouldnt be you believe in your rarefied manipulations in the trappings of your quiet power you probably think you deserve it all because of your great intellect or something like that youre all the same you relish complexity and jour explanations of it so that you cant see when the simple route is a hell of a lot more effective im waiting to be instructed said havilland coldly so be it said bourne i listened very carefully during your ponderous explanation you took pains to explain why no one could officially approach sheng and tell him what you knew you were right too hed have laughed in your face or spat in your eye or told you to pound sand whatever you like sure he would hes got the leverage you pursue your outrageous accusations he pulls peking out of the hong kong accords you lose you try to go over his head good luck you lose again you have no proof but the words of several dead men whove had their throats cut members of the kuomintang whod say anything to discredit party officials in the peoples republic he smiles and without saying it lets you know that youd better go along with him you figure you cant go along because the risks are too great if the whistle blows on sheng the far east blows you were right about that too more for the reasons edward gave us than you did peking might possibly overlook a corrupt commission as one of those temporary concessions to greed but it wont permit a spreading chinese mafia to infiltrate its industry or its labour forces or its government as edward said they could lose their jobs im still waiting mr webb said the diplomat okay you recruited me but you forgot the lesson of treadstone seventyone send out an assassin to catch an assassin thats the one thing we did not forget broke in the diplomat now astonished we based everything on it for the wrong reasons said bourne sharply there was a better way to reach sheng and draw him out for the kill i wasnt necessary my wife wasnt necessary but you couldnt see it your superior brain had to complicate everything what was it i couldnt see mr webb send in a conspirator to catch a conspirator not officially its too late for that now but its what i would have told you im not sure youve told me anything part truth part lie your own strategy a courier is sent to sheng preferably a halfsenile old man whos been paid by a blind and fed the information over the phone no traceable source he carries a verbal message ears only shengs only nothing on paper the message contains enough of the truth to paralyse sheng lets say that the man sending it is someone in hong kong who stands to lose millions if shengs scheme falls apart a man smart enough and frightened enough not to use his name the message could allude to leaks or traitors in the boardrooms or excluded triads banding together because theyve been cut out all the things youre certain will happen the truth sheng has to follow up he cant afford not to contacts are made and a meeting is arranged the hong kong conspirator is every bit as anxious to protect himself as sheng and every bit as leery demanding a neutral meeting ground its set its the trap bourne paused glancing at mcallister even a thirdrate demolitions grunt could show you how to carry it off very quick and very professional said the ambassador and with a glaring flaw where do we find such a conspirator in hong kong jason bourne studied the elder statesman his expression bordering on contempt you make him up he said thats the lie havilland and alex conklin were alone in the whitewalled room each at either end of the conference table facing the other mcallister and morris panov had gone to the undersecretarys office to listen on separate telephones to a mockedup profile of an american killer created by the consulate for the benefit of the press panov had agreed to provide the appropriate psychiatric terminology with the correct washington overtones david webb had asked to be alone with his wife until it was time to leave they had been taken to a room upstairs the fact that it was a bedroom had not occurred to anyone it was merely a door to an empty room at the south side of the old victorian house away from the watersoaked men and ruins on the north side webbs departure had been estimated by mcallister to be in fifteen minutes or less a car would drive jason bourne and the undersecretary to kai tak airport in the interest of speed and because the hydrofoils stopped running at hours a medical helicopter would fly them to macao where all immigration permits would be cleared for the delivery of emergency supplies to the kiang wu hospital on the rua coelho do amaral it wouldnt have worked you know said havilland looking over at conklin what wouldnt have asked the man from langley his own thoughts broken off by the diplomats statement what david told you sheng would never have agreed to a meeting with someone he didnt know with someone who didnt identify himself itd depend on how it was presented that kind of thing always does if the critical information is mindblowing and the facts authentic the subject doesnt have much of a choice he cant question the messenger he doesnt know anything so hehas to go after the source as webb put it he cant afford not to webb asked the ambassador flatly his brows arched bourne delta who the hell knows the strategys sound there are too many possible miscalculations too many chances for a misstep when one side invents a mythical party tell that to jason bourne different circumstances treadstone had a willing agent provocateur to go after the jackal an obsessed man who chose extreme risk because he was trained for it and had lived with violence too long to let go he didnt want to let go there was no place else for him its academic said conklin but i dont think youre in a position to argue with him you sent him out with all the odds against him and he comes back with the assassin in tow and he finds you if he said it could be done another way hes probably right and you cant say he isnt i can say however said havilland resting his forearms on the table and fixing his eyes on the cia man that what we did really did work we lost the assassin but we gained a willing even obsessed provocateur from the beginning he was the optimum choice but we never for a minute thought that he could be recruited to do the final job willingly by himself now he wont let anybody else do it hes going back in demanding his right to do it so in the end we were right i was right one sets the forces in motion on a collision course always watching ready to abort to kill if one has to but knowing that as the complications mount and the closer they come to each others throat the nearer the solution is ultimately in their hatreds their suspicions their passions they create their own violence and the job is done you may lose your own people but you have to weigh that loss against what its worth to disrupt the enemy to expose him you also risk exposing your own hand the hand you insisted had to be kept out of sight how so because its not the end yet say webb doesnt make it say hes caught and you can bet your elegant ass the order will be to take him alive when a man like sheng sees that a trap is set to kill him hell want to know whos behind it if pulling out a fingernail or ten doesnt do it and it probably wouldnt theyll needle him full of juice and find out where he comes from hes heard everything youve told him even down to the point where the united states government cannot be involved interrupted the diplomat thats right and he wont be able to help himself the chemicals will bring it all out your hands revealed washington is involved by whom by webb for christs sake by jason bourne if you like by a man with a history of mental illness with a record of random aggression and selfdeception a paranoid schizophrenic whose logged telephone calls show a man disintegrating into dementia making insane accusations wild threats aimed at those trying to help him havilland paused then added quietly come now mr conklin such a man does not speak for the united states government how could he weve been searching for him everywhere hes an irrational fantasizing time bomb who finds conspiracies wherever his sick tortured mind takes him we want him back in therapy we also suspect that because of his past activities he left the country with an illegal passport therapy alex broke in stunned by the old mans words past activities of course mr conklin if its necessary especially over a hot line shengs hot line were willing to admit that he once worked for the government and was severely damaged by that work but in no way is it possible he would have any official standing again how could he this tragic violent man may have been responsible for the death of a wife he claims disappeared marie youd use marie wed have to shes in the logs in the affidavits volunteered by men who knew webb as a mental patient who tried to help him oh jesus whispered alex mesmerized by the cold precise elder statesman of covert operations you told him everything because you had your own backups even if he was taken you could cover your ass with official logs psychiatric evaluation you could disassociate yourself oh god you bastard i told him the truth because he would have known it if i tried to lie to him again mcallister of course went farther emphasizing the organized crime factor which is all too true but a sensitive issue id prefer not to bring up nobody does but then i didnt tell edward everything he hasnt yet put enough distance between his ethics and the demands of his job when he does he may join me on the heights but i dont think hes capable you told david everything in case he was taken went on conklin not listening to havilland if the kill doesnt happen you want him taken youre counting on the amphetamines and the scopolamine the drugs then sheng will get the message that his conspiracys known to us and hell get it unofficially not from us but from an unsanctioned mental case jesus its a variation of what webb told you unofficially agreed the diplomat so much is achieved that way no confrontations very smooth very cheap no cost at all really except a mans lifer shouted alex hell be killed he has to be killed from everyones point of view the price mr conklin if it must be paid alex waited as if he expected havilland to finish his statement nothing was forthcoming only the strong sad eyes peering into his thats all youve got to say its the price if it has to be paid the stakes are far higher than we imagined far higher you know that as well as i do so dont look so shocked the ambassador leaned back in his chair somewhat stiffly youve made such decisions before such calculations not like this never like this you send in your own and you know the risks but you dont set up a field man sealing off his escape route he was better off believing believing he was bringing in the assassin to get his wife back the objective is different infinitely more vital i know that then you dont send him you get the codes and send someone else someone who isnt half dead from exhaustion exhausted or not hes the best man for the job and he insists on doing it because he doesnt know what youve done how youve boxed him in made him the messenger who has to be killed i had no choice as you say he found me i had to tell him the truth then i repeat send in someone else a hit team recruited on the outside by a blind no connection to us just payment for a professional kill the target sheng webb knows how to reach sheng he told you that ill convince him to give you the codes or the sequence or whatever the hell it is and you buy a hit team youd put us on a level with the qaddafis of this world thats so puerile i cant find words to forget it broke in havilland if it was ever traced back to us and it could be wed have to launch against china before they dropped something on us unthinkable what youre doing here is unthinkable there are more important priorities than the survival of a single individual mr conklin and again you know that as well as i do its been your lifes work if youll forgive me but the present case is on a higher level than anything you ever experienced lets call it a geopolitical level son of a bitch your own guilt is showing now alex if i may call you alex since you call in question my immediate family line i never put jason bourne beyondsalvage my most fervent hope is that hell succeed that the kill will take place if that happens hes free the far east is rid of a monster and the world will be spared an oriental sarajevo thats my job alex at least tell him warn him i cant any more than you would in my position you dont tell a tueur a gages come again elegant ass a man sent in to kill must have the confidence of his convictions he cant for a second reflect on his motives or his reasons he must have no doubts at all none the obsession must be intact its his only chance to succeed suppose he doesnt succeed suppose hes killed then we start again as quickly as possible putting someone else in place mcallister will be with him in macao and learn the sequence codes to reach sheng bournes agreed to that if the worst happens we might even try his conspiratorforaconspirator theory he says its too late but he could be wrong you see im not above learning alex youre not above anything conklin said angrily getting out of the chair but you forgot something you forgot what you said to david theres a glaring flaw whats that i wont let you get away with it alex limped towards the door you can ask so much of a man but there comes a point when you dont ask any more youre out elegant ass webbs going to be told the truth the whole truth conklin opened the door he faced the back of a tall marine who upon hearing the sound of the door opening did a precise aboutface his rifle at portarms get out of my way soldier said alex sorry sir barked the marine his eyes distant staring straight ahead conklin turned back to the diplomat seated behind the desk havilland shrugged procedures he said i thought these people were out of here i thought they were sequestered at the airport the ones you saw are these are a squad from the consulate contingent thanks to downing streets bending a few rules this is officially us territory now we are entitled to a military presence i want to see webb you cant hes leaving who the hell do you think you are my name is raymond oliver havilland i am ambassadoratlarge for the government of the united states of america my decisions are to be carried out without debate during periods of crisis this is a period of crisis fuck off alex conklin closed the door and walked awkwardly back to his chair whats next mr ambassador do the three of us get bullets in our heads or are we given lobotomies im sure we can all come to a mutual understanding they held each other marie knowing that he was only partly there only partly himself it was paris all over again when she knew a desperate man named jason bourne who was trying to stay alive but not sure he would or even should his selfdoubts in some ways as lethal to him as those who wanted him killed but it was not paris there were no selfdoubts now no tactics feverishly improvised to elude pursuers no race to trap the hunters what reminded her of paris was the distance she felt between them david was trying to reach her generous david compassionate david but jason bourne would not let him go jason was now the hunter not the hunted and this strengthened his will it was summed up in a word he used with staccato regularity move why david why i told you because i can because i have to because it has to be done thats not an answer my darling all right webb gently released his wife and held her by the shoulders looking into her eyes for us then us yes id see those images for the rest of my life theyd keep coming back and theyd tear me apart because id know what i left behind and i wouldnt be able to handle it id go into tailspins and take you with me because for all your brains you havent the sense to bail out id rather go into senseless tailspins with you than without you read that as seeing you alive thats not an argument i think its considerable ill be calling the moves not making them what the hell does that mean i want sheng taken out i mean that he doesnt deserve to live but i wont be doing the taking the god image doesnt suit you interrupted marie sharply let others make that decision walk away from it stay safe youre not listening to me i was there and i saw him heard him he doesnt deserve to live in one of his screeching diatribes he called life a precious gift that may be debatable depending on the life but life doesnt mean a thing to him he wants to kill maybe he has to i dont know ask panov its in his eyes hes hitler and mengele and genghis khan the chainsaw killer whatever but he has to go and i have to make sure he goes but why pleaded marie you havent answered me i did but you didnt hear me one way or another id see him every day hear that voice id be watching him toy with terrified people before killing them butchering them try to understand ive tried and im no expert but ive learned a few things about myself only an idiot wouldnt its the images marie the goddamned pictures that keep coming back opening doors memories i dont want to know about but have to the clearest and simplest way i can put it is that i cant take any more i cant add to that collection of bad surprises you see i want to get better not entirely cured i can accept that live with it but i cant slide back either i wont slide back for both our sakes and you think by engineering a mans death youll get rid of those images i think itll help yes everythings relative and i wouldnt be here if echo hadnt thrown his life away so i could live its not always fashionable to say it but like most people i have a conscience or maybe its guilt because i survived i simply have to do it because i can youve convinced yourself yes i have im best equipped and you say youre calling the moves not making them i wouldnt have it any other way im coming back because i want a long life with you lady whats my guarantee whos going to make the moves the whore who got us into this havilland no hes the pimp mcallisters the whore he always was the man who believes in decency who wears it on his sleeve until the power boys ask him to put out hell probably call in the pimp and thats fine between them they can do it but how there are men and women who will kill if the price is high enough they may not have the egos of the mythical jason bourne or the very real carlos the jackal but theyre everywhere in that goddamned filthy shadow world edward the whore told us he made enemies throughout the far east from hong kong to the philippines from singapore to tokyo all in the name of washington who wanted influence over here if you make enemies you know who they are know the signals to send out to reach them thats what the whore and the pimp are going to do ill set up the kill but someone else will do the killing and i dont care how many millions it costs them ill watch from a distance to make sure that the butchers killed that echo gets whats coming to him that the far east is rid of a monster who can plunge it into a terrible war but thats all ill do watch mcallister doesnt know it but hes coming with me were extracting our pound of flesh whos talking now asked marie david or jason the husband paused his silent thoughts deep bourne he said finally it has to be bourne until im back you know that i accept it i dont have a choice there was a soft rapid knocking at the bedroom door mr webb its mcallister its time to leave the emergency medical service helicopter roared across victoria harbour past the out islands of the south china sea towards macao the patrol boats of the peoples republic had been appraised by way of the naval station in gongbei there would be no firing at the lowflying aircraft on an errand of mercy as mcallisters luck would have it a visiting party official from peking had been admitted to the kiang wu hospital with a bleeding duodenal ulcer he required rhnegative blood which was continuously in short supply let them come let them go if the official were a peasant from the hills of zhuhai hed be given the blood of a goat and let him hope for the best bourne and the undersecretary of state wore the white belted coveralls and caps of the royal medical corps with no rank of substance indicated on their sleeves they were merely grousing subordinates ordered to carry blood to a zhongguo ren belonging to a regime that was in the process of further dismantling the empire everything was being done properly and efficiently in the new spirit of cooperation between the colony and its soontobe new masters let them come let them go its all a lifetime away and for us without meaning we will not benefit we never benefit not from them not from those above the hospitals rear parking area had been cleared of vehicles four searchlights outlined the threshold the pilot shuttered the aircraft into verticalhold then began his descent clammering down towards the concrete landing zone the sight of the lights and the sound of the roaring helicopter had drawn crowds on the street beyond the hospitals gates on the rua coelho do amaral that was all to the good thought bourne looking down from the open hatchway he trusted that even more onlookers would be attracted for the choppers departure in roughly five minutes as the slapping blades continued to rotate at slow speed the searchlights remained on and the cordon of police stayed in place all signs of this most unusual activity crowds were the best that he and mcallister could hope for in the confusion they could become part of the curious onlookers as two other men in the white coveralls of paramedics took their places by rushing to the aircraft their bodies bent beneath the rotors for the return trip to hong kong grudgingly jason had to admire mcallisters ability to move his chess pieces the analyst had the convictions of his connivance he knew which buttons to press to shift his pawns in the current crisis the pawn was a doctor at the kiang wu hospital who several years ago had diverted imf medical funds to his own clinic on the almirante sergio since washington was a sponsor of the international monetary fund and since mcallister had caught the doctor with his hands in the till he was in a position to expose him and had threatened to do so yet the doctor had prevailed the physician had asked mcallister how he expected to replace him there was a dearth of competent doctors in macao would it not be better for the american to overlook his indiscretion if his clinic serviced the indigent with records of such service the choirboy in mcallister had capitulated but not without remembering the doctors indiscretion and his debt it was being paid tonight come on yelled bourne rising and gripping one of the two canisters of blood move mcallister clung to a wall bar on the opposite side of the aircraft as the helicopter thumpcrashed on to the cement he was pale his face frozen into a mask of itself these things are an abomination he mumbled please wait till were settled were settled its your schedule analyst move directed by the police they raced across the parking area to a pair of double doors held open by two nurses inside a whitejacketed oriental doctor the eternal stethoscope hanging from a pocket grabbed mcallisters arm good to see you again sir he said in fluent but heavily accented english although it is under curious circumstances so were yours three years ago broke in the analyst sharply breathlessly peremptorily cutting off the onceerrant doctor where do we go follow me to the blood laboratory it is at the end of the corridor the head nurse will check the seals and sign the receipts after which you will also follow me into another room where the two men who will take your places are waiting give them the receipts change clothes and they will leave who are they asked bourne where did you find them portuguese interns replied the doctor unmonied young doctors sent out from lisbon to complete their residencies here explanations pressed jason as they started down the hallway none actually answered the macaoan what you call in english a trade perfectly legitimate two british medics who wish to spend a night over here and two overworked young doctors who deserve a night in hong kong they will return on the hydrofoil in the morning neither of them speaks english theyll know nothing suspect nothing they will simply be pleased that an older doctor recognized their needs and deserts you found the right man analyst hes a thief youre a whore i beg your pardon nothing lets go once the canisters were delivered the seals inspected and the receipts signed bourne and mcallister followed the doctor into a locked adjacent office that held drug supplies and had its own door to the corridor also locked the two portuguese interns were waiting in front of the glass cabinets one was taller than the other and both were smiling there were no introductions just nods and a short statement by the doctor addressing the undersecretary of state v on the basis of your descriptions not that i needed yours id say their sizes are about right wouldnt you theyll do replied mcallister as he and jason began removing the white coveralls these are outsize if they run fast enough and keep their heads down theyll be okay tell them to leave the garments and the receipts with the pilot hes to sign us in once he gets to hong kong bourne and the analyst changed into dark rumpled trousers and loosefitting jackets each handed his counterpart his coveralls and cap mcallister said tell them to hurry departures scheduled for less than two minutes the doctor spoke in broken portuguese then turned back to the undersecretary the pilot cant go anywhere without them sir everythings timed and officially cleared down to the minute the analyst snapped fear now in his voice theres no room for someone to become any more curious than necessary everything has to be clockwork hurry the interns dressed the caps were pulled low and the receipts for the canisters of blood were in their pockets the doctor issued his last instructions to the americans as he handed them two orange hospital passes well go out together the door locks automatically i will immediately escort our young doctors thanking them loudly and profusely past the police ranks until they can dash to the aircraft you head to the right then left into the front lobby and the entrance i hope i really do hope that our association as pleasant as it has been is now finished what are these for asked mcallister holding up his hospital pass probably hopefully nothing but in case you are stopped they explain your presence and will not be questioned why what do they say there was no fact no fragment of data that the analyst could leave unexplained quite simply said the doctor looking calmly at mcallister they describe you as indigent expatriates totally without funds whom i generously treat at my clinic without charge for gonorrhea to be precise naturally there are the usual identifying features height approximate weight hair and eye colouring nationality yours are more complete im afraid as i had not met your friend naturally again there are duplicates in my files and no one could mistake it was you sir what once you are out on the streets i believe my longstanding debt is cancelled wouldnt you agree gonorrhea please sir as you say we must hurry everything clockwork the doctor opened the door ushered out the four men and instantly headed to the left with the two young portuguese towards the side entrance and the medical helicopter lets go whispered bourne touching mcallisters arm and starting to the right did you hear that man you said he was a thief he was there are times when a person shouldnt take that bromide about stealing from a thief too literally what does that mean simply this said jason bourne looking down at the analyst at his side hes got you on several counts collusion corrupt practices and gonorrhea oh my god they stood at the rear of the crowds by the high fence watching the helicopter roar up from the landing zone and then soar off into the night sky one by one the searchlights were turned off and the parking lot was once again lit by its dim lamps most of the police climbed into a van those remaining walked casually back to their previous posts while several of them lighted cigarettes as if to proclaim the excitement over the crowds began to disperse amid questions hurled at anyone and everyone who was it someone very important no what do you think happened do you think we ii ever be told who cares we had our show so lets have a drink yes will you look at that woman a firstclass whore i think dont you agree shes my first cousin you bastard the excitement was over lets go said jason we have to move you know mr webb you have two commands you use with irritating frequency move and lets go they work both men started across the do amaral im as aware as you are that we must move quickly only you havent explained where were going i know i havent said bourne i think its time you did they kept walking bourne picking up the pace you called me a whore continued the undersecretary you are because i agreed to do what i thought was right what had to be done because they used you the boys in power used you and theyll throw you away without thinking twice you saw limousines and highlevel conferences in your future and you couldnt resist you were willing to throw away my life without looking for an alternative which is what youre paid to do you were willing to risk the life of my wife because the pull was too great dinners with the forty committee perhaps even a member quiet confidential meetings in the oval office with the celebrated ambassador havilland to me thats being a whore only i repeat theyll throw you out without a second thought silence for nearly a long macao block you think i dont know that mr bourne what that theyll throw me out again jason looked down at the meticulous bureaucrat at his side you know that of course i do im not in their league and they dont want me in it oh ive got the credentials and the mind but i dont have that extraordinary sense of performance that they have im not prepossessing id freeze in front of a television camera although i watch idiots who do perform consistently make the most ridiculous errors so you see i recognize my limitations and since i cant do what these men can do i have to do whats best for them and for the country i have to think for them you thought for havilland you came to us in maine and took my wife from me there werent any other options in that swollen brain of yours none that i could come up with none that covered everything as thoroughly as havillands strategy the assassin was the untraceable link to sheng if you could hunt him down and bring him in it was the shortcut we needed to draw sheng out you had a hell of a lot more confidence in me than i did we had confidence in jason bourne in cain in the man from medusa called delta you had the strongest motive possible to get your wife back the wife you love very much and there would be no connection whatsoever to our government we smelled a covert scenario from the beginning exploded bourne smelled it and so did conklin smelling isnt tasting protested the analyst as they rushed down a dark cobble stoned alley you knew nothing concrete that you could have divulged no intermediary who pointed to washington you were obsessed with finding a killer who was posing as you so that an enraged taipan would return your wife to you a man whose own wife had supposedly been murdered by the assassin who called himself jason bourne at first i thought it was madness but then i saw the serpentine logic of it all havilland was right if there was one man alive who could bring in the assassin and in that way neutralize sheng it was you but you couldnt have any connection to washington therefore you had to be manoeuvred within the framework of an extraordinary lie anything less and you might have reacted more normally you might have gone to the police or government authorities people you knew in the past what you could remember of the past which was also to our advantage i did go to people i knew before and learned nothing except that the more you threatened to break silence the more likely it was that the government would put you back in therapy after all you came from medusa and had a history of amnesia even schizophrenia conklin went to others and was initially told only enough for us to find out what he knew what hed pieced together i gather he was once one of the best we had he was he still is he put you beyondsalvage history under the circumstances i might have done the same he learned a lot more than i did in washington he was led to believe exactly what he wanted to believe it was one of havillands really more brilliant strokes and done at a moments notice remember alexander conklin is a burnedout bitter man he has no love for the world he spent his adult life in or for the people with whom he shared that life he was told that a possible black operation might have gone off the wire that the scenario might have been taken over by hostile elements mcallister paused as they emerged from the alley and rounded a corner in the latenight macao crowds coloured lights were flashing everywhere it was back to the squareone lie dont you see continued the analyst conklin was convinced that someone else had moved in that your situation was hopeless and so was your wifes unless you followed the new scenario run by the hostile elements that had taken over thats what he told me said jason frowning remembering the lounge at dulles airport and the tears that had come to his eyes he told me to play out the scenario he had no choice mcallister suddenly gripped bournes arm nodding towards a darkened storefront up ahead on the right we have to talk we are talking said the man from medusa sharply i know where were going and theres no time to lose you have to take the time insisted the analyst the desperation in his voice forced bourne to stop and look at him and then to follow him into the recessed storefront before you do anything you have to understand what do i have to understand the lies no the truth you dont know what the truth is said jason i know perhaps better than you do as you said its my job havillands strategy would have proved sound had it not been for your wife she escaped she got away she caused the strategy to fall apart im aware of that then surely youre aware of the fact that whether or not hes identified her sheng knows about her and understands her importance i hadnt thought about it one way or the other think about it now lin wenzus unit was penetrated when it and all of hong kong were searching for her catherine staples was killed because she was linked to your wife and it was correctly perceived that through this mystery woman she either had learned too much or was closing in on some devastating truths shengs orders obviously are to eliminate all opposition even potential opposition as you saw in peking hes a fanatic and sees substance where there are only shadows enemies in every dark corner whats your point asked bourne impatiently hes also brilliant and his people are all over the colony so when the story breaks in the morning papers and on television hell make certain assumptions and have the house in victoria peak as well as mi scrutinized every minute of every hour even if he has to hold hostage the estate next door and once again infiltrate british intelligence goddamn it what are you driving at hell find havilland and then hell find your wife and suppose you fail suppose youre killed sheng wont rest until he learns everything there is to learn the key is undoubtedly the woman with havilland the tall woman everyone was looking for she has to be because shes the enigma at the centre of the mystery and is connected to the ambassador if anything happens to you havilland will be forced to let her go and sheng will have her picked up at kai tak or honolulu or los angeles or new york believe me mr webb he wont stop until hes caught her he has to know whats been mounted against him and she is the key theres no one else again your point everything could happen all over again with far more horrible results the scenario asked jason bloody images of the glen in the bird sanctuary assaulting him yes said the analyst firmly only this time your wife is taken for real not simply as part of the strategy to recruit you sheng would make certain of it not if hes dead probably not however theres the very real risk of failure that hell remain alive youre trying to say something but youre not saying it all right ill say it now as the assassin youre the link to sheng the one to reach him but im the one who can draw him out you it was the reason i told the embassy to use my name in the press release you see sheng knows me and i listened carefully when you outlined your conspiratorforaconspirator theory to havilland he didnt buy it and frankly i didnt either sheng wouldnt accept a conference with an unknown person but he will with someone he knows why with you part truth part lie said the analyst repeating bournes words thanks for listening so carefully now explain that the truth first mr webb or bourne or whatever you want to be called sheng is aware of both my contributions to my government and my obvious lack of progress im a bright but unseen unknown bureaucrat whos been passed over because i lack those qualities that could elevate me lead me to a degree of prominence and to lucrative jobs in the private sector in a way im like alexander conklin without his drinking problem but not without a degree of his bitterness i was as good as sheng and he knew it but he made it and i didnt a touching confession said jason impatiently again but why would he meet you how could you draw him out for a kill mr analyst and i trust you know what that means because i want a piece of that hong kong pie of his i was nearly killed last night it was the final indignity and now after all these years i want something for myself for my family thats the lie youre on tenth base i cant find you because youre not listening between the lines thats what im paid to do remember ive had it im at the end of my professional rope i was sent over here to trace down and analyse a rumour out of taiwan this rumour about an economic conspiracy in peking seemed to me to have substance and if it was true there could be only one source in peking my old counterpart from the sinoamerican trade conferences the power behind chinas new trade policies nothing like this could be done without him not even contemplated so i assumed there was at best enough substance for me to contact him not to blow the whistle but officially to dispose of the rumour for a price i could even go so far as to say i see nothing against my governments interests and certainly not against mine the main point is that hed have to meet me then what then youd tell me what to do you said a demolitions grunt could do it so why cant i except not with explosives i couldnt handle that a weapon instead youd get killed ill accept the risk why because it has to be done havillands right about that and the instant sheng sees youre not the impostor that youre the original assassin the one who tried to kill him in that bird sanctuary his guards would cut you down i never intended him to see me said bourne quietly you were going to take care of that but not this way in the shadows of the dark storefront mcallister stared at the medusan youre taking me with you arent you asked the analyst finally youll force me if you have to yes i thought so you wouldnt have agreed so readily to my coming with you to macao you could have told me how to reach sheng back at the airportand demanded that we give you a certain amount of time before we acted we wouldnt have violated it were too frightened regardless you can see now that you dont have to force me i even brought along my diplomatic passport mcallister paused for a single beat then added and a second one that i removed from the technicians file it belongs to that tall fellow who took the picture of you on the table you what all state department technical personnel dealing in classified matters must surrender their passports its a security measure and for their own protection i have three passports interrupted jason how the hell do you think i get around we knew you had at least two based on old bourne records you used one of the previous names flying into peking the one that said you had brown eyes not hazel how did you manage that i wore glasses clear glass by way of a friend who uses an odd name and is better than anyone youve got oh yes a black photographer and id specialist who calls himself cactus actually he worked secretly for treadstone but then you obviously remembered that or the fact that he used to come and visit you in virginia according to the records he had to be let go because he deals with criminal elements if you touch him ill blow you out of the bureaucratic water theres no intention of doing so right now however well simply transfer the photograph that best suits the features described in the technicians passport its a waste of time not at all diplomatic passports have considerable advantages especially over here they eliminate the timeconsuming process of a temporary visa and although im sure you have sources to buy one this is easier china wants our money mr bourne and our technology well be passed through quickly and sheng will be able to check immigration and ascertain that i am who i say i am well also be provided with priority transportation if we want it and that might be important depending upon our sequential telephone conversations with sheng and his aides our sequential what youll talk with his subordinates in whatever sequence is required ill tell you what to say but when the final clearance is given i ll speak with sheng chou yang youre flake yelled jason as much into the dark glass of the storefront as at mcallister youre an amateur in this kind of thing in what you do i am indeed but not in what i do why didnt you tell havilland about this grand plan of yours because he wouldnt have permitted it he would have placed me under house arrest because he thinks im inadequate hell always think so im not a performer i dont have those glib answers that ring with sincerity but are also woefully uninformed this however is different and the performers see it so clearly because its all part of their global macho theatrics economics aside this is a conspiracy to undermine the leadership of a suspicious authoritarian regime and whos at the core of this conspiracy that has to fail who are these infiltrators whom peking trusts as its own chinas most deeply committed enemies their own brothers from the kuomintang on taiwan again to use the vernacular when the shit hits the fan as it surely will the performers on all sides will step up to the podiums and scream their screams of treason and righteous internal revolt because theres nothing else the performers can do the embarrassments total complete and on the world stage massive embarrassment leads to massive violence it was bournes turn to stare at the analyst as he did maries words came to him from a different context but not irrelevant in the present case thats not an answer he said its a point of view but its not an answer why now i hope its not to prove your decency that would be very foolish very dangerous oddly enough said mcallister frowning briefly looking at the ground where you and your wife are concerned i suppose thats part of it a minor part the undersecretary of state raised his eyes and continued calmly but the basic reason mr bourne is that im rather tired of being edward newington mcallister maybe a brilliant but surely an inconsequential analyst im the mind in the back room thats brought out when things get too complicated and then sent back after hes rendered a judgement you might say id like that chance for a moment in the sun out of the back room as it were jason studied the undersecretary in the shadows a couple of moments ago you said there was the risk of my failing and im experienced youre not have you considered the consequences if you fail i dont think i will you dont think you will repeated bourne flatly may i ask why ive thought it out thats nice no i mean it protested mcallister the strategy is fundamentally simple to get sheng alone with me i can do that but you cant do it for me and you certainly cant get him alone with you all i need is a few seconds and a weapon if i allowed it i dont know which would frighten me more your succeeding or your failing may i remind you that youre an undersecretary of state for the united states government suppose youre caught its goodbye charlie for everyone ive considered that since the day i arrived back in hong kong you what for weeks ive thought that this might be the solution that i might be the solution the governments covered its all written down in my papers back on victoria peak with a copy for havilland and another set to be delivered to the chinese consulate in hong kong in seventytwo hours the ambassador may even have found his set by now so you see theres no turning back what the hell have you done described what amounts to a blood feud between sheng and myself given my record and the time i spent over here as well as shengs wellknown penchant for secrecy its actually quite plausible certainly his enemies in the central committee will leap at it if im killed or captured so much attention will be focused on sheng so many questions regardless of his denials he wont dare move if he survives good christ save me said bourne stunned its not necessary for you to know the particulars but youll recognize the main point of your conspiratorforaconspirator theory in essence i accuse him of going back on his word of cutting me out of his hong kong manipulations after i spent years secretly helping him develop the structure hes cutting me out because he doesnt need me any longer and he knows i cant possibly say anything because id be ruined i wrote that i was even frightened for my life forget it shouted jason forget the whole goddamned thing its crazy youre assuming ill fail or be captured im assuming neither with your help of course bourne took a deep breath and lowered his voice i admire your courage even your latent sense of decency but theres a better way and you can provide it youll have your moment in the sun mr analyst but not this way what way then asked the undersecretary of state now bewildered ive seen you operate and conklin was right you may be a son of a bitch but youre something you reach into the foreign office in london and know who can change the rules you spent six years over here digging around the dirtytricks business tracking killers and thieves and the pimps of the far east in the name of neighbourly government policy you know which button to press and where the bodies are buried you even remembered a squirrelly doctor here in macao who owed you a favour and you made him pay thats all second nature one doesnt easily forget such people find me others find me killers for a price between you and havilland the two of you can do it youre going to get on the phone to him and tell him these are my demands hes to transfer a million five million if he has to over here to macao in the morning and by midafternoon i want a killer unit here ready to go up into china ill make the arrangements i know a rendezvous thats been used before in the hills of guangdong there are fields that can easily be reached by helicopter where sheng or his lieutenants used to meet with the commando once he gets my message hell make the trip take my word for it you just do your part dig around that head of yours and come up with three or four experienced scumbags tell them the risk is minimal and the price high thats your moment in the sun mr analyst it should be irresistible youll have something on havilland for the rest of his life hell make you his chief aide probably secretary of state if you want it he cant afford not to impossible said mcallister quietly his eyes locked with jasons well maybe secretary of states a bit much what you have just suggested is impossible broke in the undersecretary are you telling me there arent such men because if you are youre lying again im sure there are i might even know of several and im sure others are on that list of names wenzu gave you when he was playing the role of the whitesuited taipan in the walled city but i wouldnt touch them even if havilland ordered me to id refuse then you dont want sheng everything you said was just another lie liar youre wrong i do want sheng but to use your words not this way why not because i wont put my government my country in that kind of compromised position actually i think havilland would agree with me hiring killers is too traceable the transferring of money too traceable someone gets angry or boastful or drunk he talks and an assassination is laid at washingtons feet i couldnt be a part of that i refer you to the kennedys attempts on castros life using the mafia insanity no mr bourne im afraid youre stuck with me im not stuck with anyone i can reach sheng you cant complicated issues can usually be reduced to simple equations if certain facts are remembered what does that mean it means i insist we do things my way why because havilland has your wife shes with conklin with mo panov he wouldnt dare you dont know him mcallister interrupted you insult him but you dont know him hes like sheng chou yang hell stop at nothing if im right and im sure i am mrs webb mr conklin and dr panov are guests at the house in victoria peak for the duration guests that house arrest i mentioned a few minutes ago son of a bitch whispered jason the muscles in his face pulsating now how do we reach peking with his eyes closed bourne answered a man at the guangdong garrison named soo jiang i speak to him in french and he leaves a message for us here in macao at a table in a casino move said mcallister the telephone rang startling the naked woman who quickly sat up in the bed the man lying next to her was suddenly wide awake he was wary of any intrusion especially one in the middle of the night or more accurately the early hours of the morning the expression on his soft round oriental face however showed that such intrusions were not infrequent only unnerving he reached for the phone on the bedside table wei he said softly macao lai dianhua replied the switchboard operator at headquarters guangdong garrison connect me on scrambler and remove all recording devices it is done colonel soo i will conduct my own study of that said soo jiang sitting up and reaching for a small flat rectangular object with a raised circle at one end its not necessary sir i would hope not for your sake soo placed the circle over the mouthpiece and pressed a button had there been an intercept on the line the piercing whistle that suddenly erupted for one second would have continued pulsating until the listening device was removed or a listeners eardrum was punctured there was only silence magnified by the moonlight streaming through the window go ahead macao said the colonel bonsoir man ami said the voice from macao the french instantly accepted as being spoken by the impostor comment fa va vous gasped jiang stunned swinging his short fat legs from under the sheet and planting them on the floor attendez the colonel turned to the woman you out get out of here he ordered in cantonese take your clothes and put them on in the front room keep the door open so i can see you leave you owe me money whispered the woman stridently for two times you owe me money and double for what i did for you below your payment is in the fact that i may not have your husband fired now get out you have thirty seconds or you have a penniless husband they call you the pig said the woman grabbing her clothes and rushing to the bedroom door where she turned glaring at soo pig out seconds later soo returned to the phone continuing in french what happened the reports from beijing are incredible no less so the news from the airfield in shenzhen he took you prisoner hes dead said the voice from macao dead shot by his own people at least fifty bullets in his body and you they accepted my story i was an innocent hostage picked up in the streets and used as a shield as well as a decoy they treated me well and in fact kept me from the press at my insistence of course theyre trying to minimize everything but they wont have much success the newspaper and television people were all over the place so youll read about it in the morning papers my god where did it happen an estate on victoria peak its part of the consulate and damned secret thats why i have to reach your leaderone i learned things that he should know about tell me the assassin laughed derisively i sell this kind of information i dont give it away especially not to pigs youll be well taken care of insisted soo too well in my book what do you mean by leaderone asked colonel soo jiang dismissing the remark your head man the chief the big rooster whatever you want to call him he was the man in that forest preserve who did all the talking wasnt he the one who used his sword with such efficiency the wildeyed corkscrew with the short hair the one i tried to warn about the frenchmans delaying tactics you dare you did that ask him i told him something was wrong that the frenchman was stalling him christ i paid for his not listening to me he should have hacked that french bastard when i told him to now you tell him i want to talk to him even i do not talk to him said the colonel i reach only subordinates by their code names i dont know their real ones you mean the men who fly down to the hills in guangdong to meet me and deliver the assignments interrupted bourne yes i wont talk to any of them exploded jason now posing as his own impostor i want to talk to the man and hed better want to talk to me you will speak with others first but still even for them there must be very strong reasons they do the summoning others do not you should know that by now all right you can be the courier i was with the americans for almost three hours mounting the best cover i ever mounted in my life they questioned me at length and i answered them openly i dont have to tell you that i have backups all over the territory men and women wholl swear im a business associate or that i was with them at a specific time no matter who calls you dont have to tell me that soo broke in please just give me the message im to convey you talked with the americans then what i listened too the colonials have a stupid habit of talking too freely among themselves in the presence of strangers i hear a british voice now the voice of superiority weve all heard it before youre damned right the wogs dont do that and god knows you slants dont either please sir continue the one who took me prisoner the man who was killed by the americans was an american himself so i leave a signature with my kills the name has a long history its jason bourne we know that and he was the original he was an american and theyve been hunting him for nearly two years and they think beijing found him and hired him someone in beijing who needed the most important kill of his life who needed to kill a man in that house bournes for sale to anybody an equalopportunity employee as the americans might say your language is elusive please be clearer there were several others in that room with the americans chinese from taiwan who said outright that they oppose most of the leaders of the secret societies in the kuomintang they were angry frightened too i think bourne stopped silence yes pressed the colonel apprehensively they said a number of other things they also kept mentioning the name of someone called sheng aiya thats the message youll convey and ill expect a response at the casino within three hours ill send someone to pick it up and dont try anything foolish i have people there who can start a riot as easily as they can roll a seven any interference and your men are dead we remember the tsim sha tsui a few weeks ago said soo jiang five of our enemies killed in a back room while a cabaret erupts in violence therell be no interference were not fools where you are concerned we often wondered if the original jason bourne was as proficient as his successor he wasnt bring up the possibility of a riot at the casino in case shengs people try to trap you say their men will be killed you dont have to elaborate theyll understand the analyst knew whereof he spoke a question said jason genuinely interested when did you and the others decide i wasnt the original at first sight replied the colonel the years leave their marks dont they the body may remain agile even improve with care but the face reflects time it is inescapable your face could not possibly be the face of the man from medusa that was over fifteen years ago and you are at best a man in your early thirties the medusa did not recruit children you were the frenchmans reincarnation the code word is crisis and you have three hours said bourne hanging up the phone this is crazy jason stepped out of the open glass booth in the allnight telephone complex and looked angrily at mcallister you did it very well said the analyst writing on a small notepad ill pay the bill the undersecretary started towards the raised platform where the operators accepted payments for international calls youre missing the point continued bourne at mcallisters side his voice low harsh it cant work its too unorthodox too obvious for anyone to buy it if you were demanding a meeting id agree with you but youre not youre only asking for a telephone conversation im asking him to acknowledge the core of his whole goddamned scam that he is the core to quote you again said the analyst picking up the bill on the counter and holding out money he cant afford not to respond he has to with preconditions thatll throw you out of the box ill want your input in such matters of course mcallister took his change nodding thanks to the weary female operator and started for the door jason beside him i may not have any input to give under the circumstances you mean said the analyst as they stepped out onto the crowded pavement what its not the strategy that upsets you mr bourne because its basically your strategy what makes you furious is that im the one implementing it not you like havilland you dont think im capable i dont think this is the time or the occasion for you to prove youre machine gun kelly if you fail your lifes the last thing that concerns me somehow the far east comes first the world comes first theres no way i can fail i told you even if i fail i dont sheng loses no matter whether he lives or not in seventytwo hours the consulate in hong kong will make sure of it premeditated selfsacrifice isnt something i approve of said jason as they started up the street selfdeluding heroics always get in the way and screw things up besides your socalled strategy reeks of a trap theyll smell it they would if you negotiated with sheng and not me you tell me its unorthodox too obvious the movements of an amateur thats fine when sheng hears me on the phone everything will fall into place for him i am the embittered amateur the man whos never been in the field the firstrate bureaucrat whos been passed over by the system hes served so well i know what im doing mr bourne you just get me a weapon the request was not difficult to fulfil over in macaos porto interior on the rua das lorchas was danjous flat which was a minor arsenal of weapons the tools of the frenchmans trade it was simply a matter of getting inside and selecting those arms most easily dismantled so as to cross the relatively lax border at guangdong with diplomatic passports but it took something over two hours the process of selection being the most timeconsuming as jason put gun after gun in mcallisters hand with each watching the analysts grip and the expression on his face the weapon finally chosen was the smallest lowest calibrated pistol in danjous arsenal a charter arms with a silencer aim for the head at least three bullets in the skull anything else would be a beesting mcallister swallowed staring at the gun as jason studied the weapons deciding which had the greatest firepower in the smallest package he chose for himself three interdynamic kg machine pistols that used outsized clips holding thirty rounds of ammunition with their weapons concealed beneath their jackets they entered the halffilled kam pek casino at in the morning and walked to the end of the long mahogany bar bourne went to the seat he had occupied previously the undersecretary sat four stools away the bartender recognized the generous customer who had given him close to a weeks salary less than a week ago he greeted him like a patron with a long history of dispensing largess nei hou a mchoh la mgoi said bourne saying that he was fine in good health the english whisky isnt it asked the bartender sure of his memory hoping it would produce a reward i told friends at the casino in the lisboa that they should talk to you i think youre the best man behind a bar in macao the lisboa thats where the true money is i thank you sir the bartender rushed to pour jason a drink that would have crippled caesars legions bourne nodded without comment and the man turned reluctantly to mcallister four chairs away jason noted that the analyst ordered white wine paid with precision and wrote the amount in his notebook the bartender shrugged performed the unpleasant service and walked to the centre of the sparsely occupied bar keeping his eyes on his favoured customer step one he was there the welldressed chinese in the tailored dark suit the martial arts veteran who did not know enough dirty moves the man he had fought in an alley and who had led him up into the hills of guangdong colonel soo jiang was taking no risks under the circumstances he wanted only the most proven conduits working tonight no impoverished old men no whores the man walked slowly past several tables as if studying the action appraising the dealers and the players trying to determine where he should test his luck he arrived at table five and after observing the play of the cards for nearly three minutes casually sat down and withdrew a roll of bills from his pocket among them thought jason was a message marked crisis twenty minutes later the impeccably dressed chinese shook his head put his money back in his pocket and got up from the table he was the short cut to sheng he knew his way around both macao and the border at guangdong and bourne knew he had to reach this man and reach him quickly he glanced first at the bartender who had gone to the end of the bar to prepare drinks for a waiter serving the tables then over at mcallister analyst he whispered sharply stay here what are you doing saying hello to my mother for christs sake jason got off the stool and started for the door after the conduit passing the bartender he said in cantonese ill be right back its no problem sir out on the pavement bourne followed the welldressed man for several blocks until he turned into a narrow dimly lit side street and approached an empty parked car he was meeting no one he had delivered the message and was getting out of the area jason rushed forward and as the conduit opened the car door he touched the mans shoulder the conduit spun around crouching his experienced left foot lashing out viciously bourne jumped back raising his hands in a gesture of peace lets not go through this again he said in english for he remembered the man spoke english taught him by portuguese nuns i still hurt from the beating you gave me last week aiya you the conduit raised his hands in a like gesture of noncombat you do me honour when i do not deserve it you bested me that night and for that reason i have practised six hours a day to improve myself you bested me then not now considering your age and then considering mine take my word for it you werent bested my bones ached far more than yours did and im not about to check out your new training schedule ill pay you a lot of money but i wont fight you the word for it is cowardice not you sir said the oriental lowering his hands and grinning you are very good yes me sir replied jason you scare the hell out of me and you did me a great favour you paid me well very well ill pay you better now the message was for you yes then you have taken the frenchmans place hes dead killed by the people who sent the message the conduit looked bewildered perhaps even sad why he asked he serviced them well and he was an old man older than you thanks a lot lid he betray those he serviced no he was betrayed the communists kuomintang said bourne shaking his head dong wu they are no better than the communists what do you want from me if everything goes right pretty much what you did before but this time i want you to stay around i want to hire a pair of eyes you go up into the hills in guangdong yes you need assistance crossing the border then not if you can find me someone who can shift a photograph from one passport to another it is done every day the children can do it good then were down to my hiring your eyes theres a degree of risk but not much theres also twenty thousand dollars american last time i paid you ten this time its twenty aiya fortune the conduit paused studying bournes face the risk must be great if theres trouble ill expect you to get out well leave the money here in macao accessible only to you do you want the job or do i look elsewhere these are the eyes of the hawk bird look no farther come back with me to the casino wait outside down the street and ill have the message picked up the bartender was only too pleased to do as jason requested although he was confused by the odd word crisis that was to be used until bourne explained that it was the name of a race horse he carried aspecial drink to a bewildered player at table five and returned with the sealed envelope under his tray jason had scanned the nearby tables looking for turning heads and shifting eyes amid the spiralling clouds of smoke he saw none the sight of the maroonjacketed bartender among the maroonjacketed waiters was too common to draw attention as instructed the tray was placed between bourne and mcallister jason shook a cigarette out of his pack and shoved a book of matches down the bar towards the nonsmoking analyst before the perplexed undersecretary could understand bourne got off his stool and walked over to him have you got a light mister mcallister looked at the matches quickly picked them up tore one out and struck it holding the flame up for the cigarette when jason returned to his seat the sealed envelope was in his hand he opened it removed the paper inside and read the typewritten english script telephone macao he looked around for a pay phone and then realized that he had never used one in macao and even if there were instructions he was not familiar with the portuguese colonys coins it was always the little things that loused up the bigger things he signalled the bartender who reached him before his hand was back on the bar yes sir another whisky sir not for a week said bourne placing hong kong money in front of him i have to make a phone call to someone here in macao tell me where a pay phone is and let me have the proper coins will you please i could not permit so fine a gentleman as yourself to use a common telephone sir between us i believe many of the customers here may be diseased the bartender smiled allow me sir i have a telephone on my counter for very special people before jason could protest or give thanks a telephone was put in front of him he dialled as mcallister stared at him wei said a female voice i was instructed to call this number replied bourne in english the dead impostor had not known chinese we will meet we wont meet we insist then resist you know me better than that or you should i want to talk to the man and only the man you are presumptuous youre less than an idiot sos the skinny preacher with the big sword unless he talks to me you dare ive heard that once before tonight interrupted jason sharply the answer is yes i do dare hes got a hell of a lot more to lose than i do hes only one client and my list is growing i dont need him but right now i think he needs me give me a reason that can be confirmed i dont give reasons to corporals i was once a major or didnt you know that theres no need for insults theres no need for this conversation ill call you back in thirty minutes offer me something better offer me the man and ill know if its himself because ill ask a question or two that only he can answer ciao lady bourne hung up what are you doing whispered an agitated mcallister four chairs away arranging your day in the sun and i hope youve got some lotion were getting out of here give me five minutes then follow me turn right out of the door and keep walking well pick you up we theres someone i want you to meet an old friend young friend whom i think youll approve of he dresses like you do someone else are you insane dont blow your cool analyst were not supposed to know each other no im not insane i just hired a backup in case im outthought remember you wanted my input in such matters the introductions were short and no names were used but it was evident that mcallister was impressed by the stocky broad shouldered welldressed chinese are you an executive with one of the firms over here asked the analyst as they walked towards the side street where the conduits car was parked in a manner of speaking yes sir my own firm however i run a courier service for very important people but how did he find you im sorry sir but im sure you can understand such information is confidential good lord muttered mcallister glancing at the man from medusa get me to a phone in twenty minutes said jason in the front seat the bewildered undersecretary sat in the back they are using a relay then asked the conduit they did so many times with the frenchman how did he handle them asked bourne with delays he would say let them sweat may i suggest an hour youre on is there a restaurant open around here over in the rua mercadores we need food and the frenchman was right he was always right let them sweat he was a decent man to me said the conduit at the end he was some kind of eloquent if perverted saint i do not understand sir its not necessary that you do but im alive and hes not because he made a decision what kind of decision sir that he should die so that i could live like the christian scriptures the nuns taught them to us hardly said jason amused at the thought if thered been another way out we would have taken it there wasnt he simply accepted the fact that his death was my way out i liked him said the conduit take us to the restaurant it was all edward mcallister could do to contain himself what he did not know and what bourne would not discuss at the table was choking him with frustration twice he tried to broach the subject of relays and the current situation and twice jason cut him off admonishing the undersecretary with a stare as the conduit in gratitude looked away there were certain facts the chinese knew about and there were other facts he did not care to know about for his own safety rest and food mused bourne finishing the last of his tiansuan ran the frenchman said they were weapons he was right of course i suggest he needed the first more than you did sir said the conduit perhaps but he was a student of military history he claimed more battles were lost from fatigue than from inferior fire power this is all very interesting mcallister interrupted sharply but weve been here for some time and im sure there are things we should be doing we will edward if youre uptight think what theyre going through the frenchman also used to say that the enemys exposed nerves were our best allies im becoming rather tired of your frenchman said mcallister testily jason looked at the analyst and spoke quietly dont ever say that to me again you werent there bourne checked his watch its over an hour lets find a phone he turned to the conduit ill need your help he added you just put in the money ill dial you said youd call back in thirty minutes spat out the woman at the other end of the line i had business to take care of i have other clients and im not too keen on your attitude if this is going to be a waste of time ive got other things to do and you can answer to the man when the typhoon comes how could that happen come on lady give me a trunk filled with more money than youve ever thought about and i might tell you on the other hand i probably wouldnt i like to be owed favours by men in high places youve got ten seconds until i hang up please you will meet a man who will take you to a house on the guia hill where there is highly sophisticated communications equipment and where half a dozen of your goons crack my skull and throw me into a room where a doctor fills me with juice and you get it all for nothing bournes anger was only partly feigned shengs troops were the ones behaving like amateurs ill tell you about another piece of sophisticated equipment its called a telephone and i didnt think thered be communications from macao to the guangdong garrison if you didnt have scramblers of course you bought them in tokyo because if you made them yourselves they probably wouldnt work use one im calling you just once more lady have a number for me the mans number jason hung up thats interesting said mcallister several feet away from the pay phone glancing briefly at the chinese conduit who had returned to the table you used the stick when i would have used the carrot used the what i would have emphasized what extraordinary information i had to reveal instead you threatened as if you were dismissing whoever it was spare me answered bourne lighting a cigarette grateful that his hand was not shaking for your edification i did both the threat emphasizes the revelation and the dismissal reinforces both your input is showing said the undersecretary of state a hint of a smile on his face thank you the man from medusa looked hard at the man from washington if this damn thing works can you do it analyst can you whip out the gun and pull the trigger because if you cant were both dead i can do it said mcallister calmly for the far east for the world and for your day in the sun jason started towards the table lets get out of here i dont want to use this phone again the serenity of jade tower mountain was belied by the frantic activity inside the villa of sheng chou yang the turmoil was not caused by the number of people for there were only five but by the intensity of the players the minister listened as his aides came and went from the garden bringing news of the latest developments and timidly offered advice which was withdrawn instantly at the first sign of displeasure our people have confirmed the story sir cried a uniformed middleaged man rushing from the house theyve talked to the journalists everything was as the assassin described and a photograph of the dead man was distributed to the newspapers get it ordered sheng have it wired here at once this is incredible its being done said the soldier the consulate sent an attache to the south china news it should be arriving within minutes incredible repeated sheng softly his eyes straying to the lily pads in the nearest of the four manmade ponds the symmetry is too perfect the timing too perfect and that means something is imperfect someone has imposed order the assassin asked another aide for what purpose he has no idea that he would have been a corpse before the night was over in the sanctuary he thought he was privileged but we were only using him to trap his predecessor unearthed by our man in special branch then who questioned another thats the dilemma who everything is at once tempting yet clumsy its all too apparent fraught with unprofessional ego the assassin if hes telling the truth must believe he has nothing to fear from me but still he threatens conceivably throwing over a most profitable client professionals dont do that and thats what bothers me you are suggesting a third party minister asked the third aide if so said sheng his eyes now riveted on a single lily pad someone with no experience or with the intelligence of an ox its a dilemma its here sir shouted a young man racing into the garden holding a teletyped photograph give it to me quickly sheng grabbed the paper and angled it into the glare of a floodlight it is he ill never forget that face as long as i breathe clear everything tell the woman in macao to give our assassin the number and electronically sweep all conceivable interceptions failure is death instantly minister the operator ran back to the house my wife and my children said sheng chou yang reflectively they may be upset by all this disturbance will one of you please go inside and explain that affairs of state keep me from their beloved presence it is my honour sir said an aide they suffer so from the demands of my work they are all angels one day they will be rewarded bourne touched the conduits shoulder then pointed to the lighted marquee of a hotel on the right side of the street well check in here then head for a phone booth on the other side of the city okay its wise said the chinese they are all over the telephone company and weve got to get some sleep the frenchman never stopped telling me that rest was also a weapon christ why do i keep repeating myself because youre obsessed said mcallister from the back seat tell me about it no dont jason dialled the number in macao that tripped a relay in china into a swept telephone in jade tower mountain as he did so he looked at the analyst does sheng speak french he asked quickly of course said the undersecretary he deals with the quai dorsay and speaks the language of everyone he negotiates with its one of his strengths but why not use mandarin you know it the commando didnt and if i speak english he might wonder where the british accent went frenchll cover it as it did with soo jiang and ill also know whether or not its sheng bourne stretched a handkerchief across the mouthpiece as he heard a second echoing ring fifteen hundred miles away the scramblers were in place wei comme le colonel je prefere parler francais shemma cried the voice bewildered fawen said jason the mandarin for french fawen wo buhui replied the man excitedly stating that he did not speak french the call was expected another voice intruded it was in the background and too low to be heard and then it was there on the line mats pourquoi parlezvous francaist it was sheng no matter the language bourne would never forget the orators singsong delivery it was the zealous minister of an unmerciful god seducing an audience before assaulting it with fire and brimstone lets say i feel more comfortable very well what is this incredible story you bring this madness during which a name was mentioned i was also told you speak french interrupted jason there was a pause in which only shengs steady breathing could be heard you know who i am i know a name that doesnt mean anything to me it does to someone else though someone you knew years ago he wants to talk to you what screamed sheng betrayal nothing of the sort and if i were you id listen to him he saw right through everything i told them the others didnt but he did bourne glanced at mcallister beside him the analyst nodded his head as if to say that jason was convincingly using the words the undersecretary had given him he took one look at me and put the figures together but then the frenchmans original boy was pretty well shot up his head was a bloody cauliflower what have you done probably the biggest favour you ever received and i expect to be paid for it heres your friend hell use english bourne handed the phone to the analyst who spoke instantly its edward mcallister sheng edward the stunned sheng chou yang could not complete the name this conversation is off the record with no official sanction my whereabouts are unlogged and unknown im speaking solely for my own benefit and yours you astonish me my old friend said the minister slowly fearfully collecting himself youll read about it in the morning papers and its undoubtedly on all the newscasts from hawaii already the consulate wanted me to disappear for a few days the fewer questions the better and i knew just whom i wanted to go with what happened and how did you the similarity in their appearance was too obvious to be coincidental broke in the undersecretary of state i suppose danjou wanted to trade on the legend as much as possible and that included the physical characteristics for those who had seen jason bourne in the past an unnecessary fillip in my opinion but it was effective in the panic on victoria peak and from the nearly unrecognizable face no one else noticed that striking resemblance but then none of the others knew bourne i did you i drove him out of asia im the one he came to kill and in keeping with his perverse sense of irony and revenge he decided to do it by leaving the corpse of your assassin on victoria peak fortunately for me his ego didnt permit him to evaluate your mans abilities correctly once the firing started our now mutual associate overpowered him and threw him into the guns edward the information is coming too fast i cannot assimilate it who brought jason bourne back obviously the frenchman his pupil and immensely successful meal ticket had defected he wanted revenge and knew where to find the one man who could give him that his colleague from medusa the original jason bourne medusa whispered sheng with loathing despite their reputations in certain units there were intense loyalties you save a mans life he doesnt forget what led you to the preposterous conclusion that i have had anything to do with the man you call an assassin please sheng interrupted the analyst its too late for protestations were talking but ill answer your question it was in the pattern of several killings it started with a vicepremier of china in the tsim sha tsui and four other men they all were your enemies and at kai tak the other night two of your most vocal critics in the peking delegation targets of a bomb there were also rumours there always are in the underworld the whispers spoke of messages between macao and guangdong of powerful men in beijing of one man with immense power and finally there was the file the figures added up you the file what is this edward asked sheng feigning strength why is this an unofficial unreported communication between us i think you know youre a brilliant man you know i would not ask if i did were above such pavanes a brilliant bureaucrat kept in the back room wouldnt you also say in truth i expected better things for you you provided most of the words and the moves for your socalled negotiators during the trade conferences and everyone knows you did exemplary work in hong kong by the time you left washington had every major influence in the territory in its orbit ive decided to retire sheng ive given twenty years of my life to my government but i wont give it my death i wont be ambushed and shot at or truckbombed i wont become a target for terrorists whether its here or in iran or beirut its time i got something for myself for my family times change people change and livings expensive my pension and my prospects are far less than i deserve i agree with you completely edward but what has it got to do with mel we were compromisers together adversaries to be sure as in a courtroom but certainly not enemies in the arena of violence and what in the name of heaven is this foolishness about my name being mentioned by jackals of the kuomintang spare me the analyst glanced over at bourne whatever was said by our mutual associate the words were provided by me they werent his your name was never mentioned in victoria peak and there were no taiwanese at our interrogation of your man i gave him those words because theres a certain validity in them for you as to your name its for a restricted few their eyes only its in the file i mentioned a file locked in my office in hong kong its marked ultramaximumsecurity there is only one copy of this file and its buried in a vault in washington to be released or destroyed only by me however should the unexpected happen say a plane crash or if i disappeared or was killed the file would be turned over to the national security council the information in this file in the wrong hands could prove catastrophic for the entire far east i am intrigued edward by your candid if incomplete information meet me sheng and bring money a great deal of money american money our mutual associate tells me there are hills in guangdong where your people flew down to see him meet me there tomorrow between ten oclock and midnight i must protest my adversarial friend you have not provided me with an incentive i can destroy both copies of that file i was sent over here to track down a story originating in taiwan a story so detrimental to all our interests that a hint of its contents could start a chain of events that terrifies everyone i believe theres considerable substance to the story and if im right it can be traced directly to my old counterpart during the sinoamerican conferences it couldnt be happening without him its my last assignment sheng and a few words from me can remove that file from the face of the earth i simply determine the information to be totally false and dangerously inflammatory compiled by your enemies in taiwan the few who know about it want to believe that take my word for it the file is then sent to the shredder so is the copy in washington you still have not told me why i should listen to you the son of a kuomintang taipan would know the leader of a cabal in beijing would know a man who could be disgraced and decapitated tomorrow morning certainly would know the pause was long the breathing erratic over the line finally sheng spoke the hills in guangdong he knows where only one helicopter said mcallister you and the pilot no one else darkness the figure dressed in the uniform of a united states marine dropped down from the top of the wall at the rear of the grounds of the house on victoria peak he crept to his left passing a sheet of interwoven strands of barbed wire that filled a space where a section of the wall had been blown away and proceeded around the edge of the property staying in the shadows he raced across the lawn to the corner of the house he peered around at the demolished bay windows of what had been a large victorian study in front of the shattered glass and the profusion of broken frames stood a marine guard an m rifle planted casually on the grass the end of the barrel in his hand a automatic strapped to his belt the addition of a rifle to the smaller weapon was a sign of maxalert the intruder understood this and smiled to see that the guard did not think it necessary to hold the m in his hands marines and poised weapons were not welcome the stock of a rifle could crash into a mans head before he knew it was into its whip the intruder waited for the opportune moment it came when the guards chest swelled with a long yawn and his eyes briefly closed as he inhaled deeply the intruder raced around the corner springing off his feet the wire of a garrotte looping over the guards head it was over in seconds there was barely a sound the killer left the body where it lay as it was far darker in this area of the grounds than elsewhere many of the rear floodlights had been shattered by the explosions he got to his feet and edged his way to the next corner where he took out a cigarette lighting it with the cupped flame from a butane lighter he then stepped out into the glare of the floodlights and walked casually around the corner towards the huge charred french doors where a second marine was at his post on the brick steps the intruder held the cigarette in his left hand which covered his face as he drew on it out for a smoke asked the guard yeah i couldnt sleep said the man with an american accent that was a product of the southwest those fuckin cots werent made for sleeping just sit on one and you know it hey wait a minute who the hell are you the marine had no chance to level his rifle the intruder lunged thrusting his knife straight into the guards throat with deadly accuracy cutting off all sound all life the killer quickly dragged the corpse around the corner of the building and left it in the shadows he wiped the blade off on the dead mans uniform reinserted it beneath his tunic and returned to the french doors he entered the house he walked down the long dimly lit corridor at the end of which stood a third marine in front of a wide sculptured door the guard angled his rifle downward and looked at his watch youre early he said im not due to be relieved for another hour and twenty minutes im not with this unit buddy you with the oahu group yeah i thought they got you jokers out of here pronto and back to hawaii thats the scuttlebutt a few of us were ordered to stay behind were down at the consulate now that guy whatshisname mcallister has been taking our testimonies all night i tell you pal this whole goddamned thing is weird you got it triple weird by the way wheres that fruitcakes office he sent me up here to bring him back his special pipe tobacco it figures mix some grass in it which office earlier i saw him and the doctor go in that first door on the right then later before he left he went in here the guard tilted his head to indicate the door behind him whose place is that i dont know his name but hes the top banana they call him the ambassador the killers eyes narrowed the ambassador yeah the rooms fractured half of its blown apart by that fucking maniac but the safes intact which is why im here and another guy outside in the tulips must be a couple of million in there for extracurricular activities or something else said the intruder softly the first door on the right huh he added turning and reaching under his tunic hold it said the marine why didnt the gate send word in here he reached for the handheld radio strapped to his belt sorry but ive got to check you out buddy its standard the killer threw his knife as it plunged into the guards chest he hurled himself on the marine his thumbs centering on the mans throat thirty seconds later he opened the door of havillands office and dragged the dead man inside they crossed the border in full darkness business suits and regimental ties replacing the rumpled nondescript clothes they had worn previously added to their attire were two proper attache cases strapped with diplomatique tape indicating government documents beyond the scrutiny of immigration points in truth the cases held their weapons as well as several additional items bourne had picked up in danjous flat after mcallister produced the sacrosanct plastic tape that was respected even by the peoples republic respected as long as china wanted the same courtesy to be extended to its own foreign service personnel the conduit from macao whose name was wong at least that was the name he offered was impressed by the diplomatic passports but for safetys sake as well as for the american for which he said he felt a moral obligation decided to prepare the border crossing his way its not as difficult as perhaps i led you to believe before sir explained wong two of the guards are cousins on my blessed mothers side may she rest with the holy jesus and we help each other i do more for them than they do for me but then i am in a better position their stomachs are fuller than most in the city of zhuhai shi and both have television sets if theyre cousins said jason why did you object to the watch i gave one of them before you said it was too expensive because hell sell it sir and i dont care to see him spoiled hell expect too much from me on such considerations thought bourne were the tightest borders in the world patrolled they were directed by wong to enter the last gate on the right at precisely he would cross separately a few minutes later their redstriped passports were studied sent to an inside office and amid many abrupt smiles on the part of a cousin the honoured diplomats were rapidly passed through they were instantly welcomed to china by the prefect of the zhuhai shiguangdong province control who returned their passports she was a short broadshouldered muscular woman her english was obscured by a thick accent but was understandable you have government business in zhuhai shi she asked her smile belied by her clouded vaguely hostile eyes the guangdong garrison perhaps i can arrange auto transport please bu xiexie said the undersecretary of state declining and then for courtesys sake reverting to english to show respect for his hosts diligence in learning it its a minor conference lasting for only a few hours and well return to macao later tonight well be contacted here so well have some coffee and wait in my office please thank you but i think not your people will be looking for us in the kafie dian the cafe over on the leftright sir on the street welcome again to the peoples republic your courtesy will not be forgotten said mcallister bowing you are with thanks replied the heavyset woman nodding and striding away to use your words analyst said bourne you did that very well but i should tell you shes not on our side of course not agreed the undersecretary shes been instructed to call someone either here at the garrison or in beijing confirming that weve crossed over that someone will reach sheng and hell know its me and you no one else hes airborne said jason as they walked slowly towards the dimly lit coffee shop at the end of a dingy concrete walkway that emerged on the street hes on his way here incidentally well be followed you know that dont you no i dont know that replied mcallister looking briefly at bourne sheng will be cautious ive given him enough information to alarm him if he thought there was only one file which happens to be the truth he might take chances thinking he could buy it from me and kill me but he thinks or has to assume that theres a copy in washington thats the one he wants destroyed he wont do anything to upset me or to make me panic and run remember im the amateur and i frighten easily i know him hes putting it all together now and is probably carrying more money to me than ive ever dreamed of of course he expects to get it back once the files are destroyed and he does kill me so you see i have a very strong reason not to fail or not to succeed by failing the man from medusa again stared at the man from washington youve really thought this out havent you thoroughly answered mcallister looking straight ahead for weeks every detail frankly i didnt think youd be a part of it because i thought youd be dead but i knew i could reach sheng somehow unofficially of course any other way including a confidential conference would entail protocol and even if i got him alone without his aides i couldnt touch him it would look like a governmentsanctioned assassination i considered reaching him directly for old times sake and using words that would trigger a response pretty much what i did last night as you said to havilland the simplest ways are usually the best we tend to complicate things in your defence you frequently have to you cant be caught with a smoking gun thats such a trite expression said the analyst with a derisive laugh what does it mean that you were led or misled into an error policy doesnt revolve around a single mans embarrassment or it shouldnt im constantly appalled by the peoples cries for righteousness when they have no idea no concept of how we have to deal maybe the people every now and then want a straight answer they cant have one said mcallister as they approached the door of the coffee shop because they couldnt understand bourne stood in front of the door without opening it youre blind he said his eyes locked with the undersecretarys i wasnt given a straight answer either much less an explanation youve been in washington too long you should try a couple of weeks in cleveland or bangor maine it might broaden that perspective of yours dont lecture me mr bourne less than fortysix per cent of our population care enough to cast a vote which determines the directions we take its all left to us the performers and the professional bureaucrats were all youve got may we go inside please your friend mr wong said we were to spend only a few minutes being seen having coffee and then go out on the street he said hed meet us there in exactly twentyfive minutes and twelve have already elapsed twelve not ten or fifteen but twelve precisely what do we do if hes two minutes late shoot him very funny said the analyst pushing the door open they walked out of the coffee shop and on to the dark bruised pavement of the rundown square fronting the guangdong checkpoint as it was a slow time at the gates there were no more than a dozen people crossing the thoroughfare and disappearing into the darkness of the three streetlights in the immediate vicinity only one was working dimly visibility was poor the minute mark passed and was stretched to then approached bourne spoke somethings wrong he should have made contact by now two minutes and we shoot him said mcallister instantly disliking his own attempt at humour i mean i gathered that staying calm was everything for two minutes not close to fifteen replied jason its not normal he added softly as if to himself on the other hand it could be normally abnormal he wants us to make contact with him i dont understand you dont have to just walk alongside me as if we were strolling passing the time until were met if she sees us the lady wrestler wont be surprised chinese officials are notoriously late for conferences they feel it gives them the advantage let them sweat exactly only thats not who were meeting now come on lets go to the left its darker away from the light be casual talk about the weather anything nod your head shake it shrug just keep up steady lowkeyed movements they had walked for about fifty feet when it happened kam pek the name of the casino in macao was whispered shot out of the shadows beyond a deserted newsstand wong stay where you are and make a show of conversation but listen to me whats happened youre being followed two points for a brilliant bureaucrat said jason any comment mr undersecretary its unexpected but not illogical answered mcallister a safeguard perhaps false passports abound over here as we happen to know queen kong checked us out strike one then perhaps to make sure we dont link up with the kind of people you suggested last night whispered the analyst his words too low to be heard by the chinese conduit thats possible bourne raised his voice slightly so that the conduit could hear him his eyes on the border gates entrance there was no one whos following us the pig soo ever so sir it is why i must stay out of sight anyone else no one that i could see but i dont know who is on the road to the hills ill take him out said the man from medusa called delta wo objected mcallister his orders from sheng may include confirming that we remain alone that we dont meet others you just agreed it was possible the only way he could do that is to reach others himself he cant do that if he cant do that and your old friend wouldnt permit a radio transmission while hes in a plane or a chopper it could be picked up suppose there are specific signals a flare or a powerful flashlight beamed up telling the pilot everythings clear jason looked at the analyst you do think things out there is a way said wong from the shadows and it is a privilege i should like to reserve for myself no additional charge what privilege i will kill the pig it will be done in such a way that cannot be compromised what astonished bourne started to turn his head please sir look straight ahead sorry but why he fornicates indiscriminately threatening the women he favours with loss of employment for themselves and their husbands even brothers and cousins over the past four years he has brought shame to many families including mine on my blessed mothers side why hasnt he been killed before now he travels with armed guards even in macao yet in spite of this several attempts have been made by enraged men they resulted in reprisals reprisals asked mcallister quietly people were chosen again indiscriminately and charged with stealing supplies and equipment from the garrison the punishment for such crimes is death in the fields jesus muttered bourne i wont ask questions youve got reason enough but how tonight his guards are not with him now they may be waiting for him on the road to the hills but they are not with him now you start out and if he follows you i will follow him if he does not follow you i will know that your journey will not be interrupted and i will catch up with you catch up with us bourne frowned after i kill the pig and leave his pig body in its proper and for him disgraceful place the female toilet and if he does follow us asked jason my opportunity will come even as i serve as your eyes i will see his guards but they will not see me no matter what he does the moment will be there when he separates himself if only by a few feet in the darkness it will be enough and it will be assumed he has brought shame to one of his own men well get started you know the way sir as if i had a road map i will meet you at the base of the first hill beyond the high grass do you remember it itd be hard to forget i nearly bought a grave in china there after seven kilometres head into forest towards the fields i intend to you taught me have a good hunt wong i will sir i have reason enough the two americans walked across the ravaged old square away from the dim light into complete darkness an obese figure in civilian clothes watched them from the shadows of the concrete walkway he looked at his watch and nodded half smiling to himself in satisfaction colonel soo jiang then turned and walked back through the manmade tunnel into the stark immigration complex iron gates and wooden booths and barbed wire in the distance all bathed in dull grey light he was greeted by the prefect of the zhuhai shiguangdong province control who strode purposefully martially enthusiastically towards him they must be very important men colonel said the prefect her eyes not at all hostile but instead with a look that bordered on blind worship and fear oh they are they are agreed the colonel surely they have to be for such an illustrious officer as yourself to make sure of their requirements i made the telephone call to the man in guangzhou as you requested and he thanked me but he did not get my name i will make sure he has it soo broke in wearily and i will keep only my best people on the gates to greet them when they return later tonight to macao soo looked at the woman that wont be necessary they will be taken to beijing for strictly confidential highestlevel conferences my orders are to remove all records of their having crossed the guangdong border that confidential ever so madame comrade these are secret affairs of state and must be kept as such even from your most intimate associates your office please at once said the broad shouldered woman turning with military precision i have tea or coffee and even the british whisky from hong kong ah yes the british whisky may i escort you comrade my work is finished the two somewhat grotesquely wagnerian figures marched in waddling lockstep towards the streaked glass door of the prefects office cigarettes whispered bourne gripping mcallisters shoulder where up ahead off the road on the left in the woods i didnt see them you werent looking for them theyre being cupped but theyre there the bark of the trees gets a touch of light one moment then its dark the next no rhythm just erratic men smoking sometimes i think the far east likes cigarettes more than sex what do we do exactly what were doing only louder what keep walking and say whatever comes to mind they wont understand im sure you know hiawatha or horatio on the bridge or some chant from your wild college days dont sing just say the words itll keep your mind off things but why because this is what you predicted sheng is making sure that we dont link up with anyone who could be a threat to him lets give him that reassurance okay oh my god suppose one of them speaks english its highly unlikely but if youd rather well just improvise a conversation no im not good at that i hate parties and dinners i never know what to say thats why i suggested the doggerel ill interrupt whenever you pause go ahead now speak casually but rapidly this is no place for chinese scholars who speak fast english the cigarettes are out theyve spotted us goon oh lord very well ah ah sitting on oreillys porch telling tales of blood and slaughter thats very appropriate said jason glaring at his pupil suddenly it came to me why not shag oreillys daughter why edward you constantly surprise me its an old fraternity song whispered the analyst what i cant hear you edward speak up fiddillyeyeeee fiddillyeyeowj fiddillyeyeeee to the one ball reilly thats terrific interrupted bourne as they passed the section of the woods where only seconds ago concealed men had been smoking i think your friend will appreciate your point of view any further thoughts i forgot the words your thoughts you mean im sure theyll come to you something about old man reilly oh yes i remember first there was shag shag and shag some more shag until the fun was over and then came old reilly two horse pistols by his side looking for the dog who shagged his daughter i did remember you belong in a museum if theres one in your home town but look at it this way you can research the entire project back in macao what project there was another that was always great fun a hundred bottles of beer on the wall a hundred bottles of beer one fell down oh lord its been so long it was repetitious reduction ninetynine bottles of beer on the wall forget it theyre out of earshot oh earshot thank god you sounded fine if any of those clowns understood a word of english theyre even more confused than i am well done analyst come on lets walk faster mcallister looked at jason you did that on purpose didnt you you prodded me into remembering something anything knowing id concentrate and not panic bourne did not answer he simply made a statement another hundred feet and you keep going by yourself what youre leaving me for about ten maybe fifteen minutes here keep walking and angle your arm up so i can put my briefcase on it and open the damn thing where are you going asked the undersecretary as the attaché case rested awkwardly on his left arm jason opened it took out a longbladed knife and closed the case you cant leave me alone youll be all right nobody wants to stop you us if they did it would have been done you mean that could have been an ambush i was counting on your analytical mind that it wasnt take the case but what are you i have to see whats back there keep walking the man from medusa spun off to his left and entered the woods at a turn in the road running rapidly silently instinctively avoiding the tangled underbrush at the first touch of resistance he moved to his right in a wide semicircle minutes later he saw the glow of cigarettes and moving like a forest cat crept closer and closer until he was within ten feet of the group of men the intermittent moonlight filtered through the massive trees provided enough illumination for him to count the number there were six each armed with a lightweight machine gun strapped over his shoulders and there was something else something that was strikingly inconsistent each of the men wore the fourbuttoned tailored uniforms of high officers in the army of the peoples republic and from the snatches of conversation that he could hear they spoke mandarin not cantonese which was the normal dialect for soldiers even officers of the guangdong garrison these men were not from guangdong sheng had flown in his own elite guard suddenly one of the officers snapped his lighter and looked at his watch bourne studied the face above the flame he knew it and seeing it confirmed his judgement it was the face of the man who had tried to trap echo by posing as a prisoner on the truck that terrible night the officer sheng treated with a degree of deference a thinking killer with a soft voice xian zai said the man stating that the moment had come he picked up a handheld radio and spoke da li shi da li shir he barked raising his party by the code name marble they are alone there is no one else we will proceed as instructed prepare for the signal the six officers rose together adjusted their weapons and extinguished their cigarettes by grinding them under their boots they started rapidly for the back country road bourne scrambled round on his hands and knees got to his feet and raced through the woods he had to reach mcallister before shengs contingent closed in on him and saw through the sporadic moonlight that he was alone should the guards become alarmed they might send a different signal conference aborted he reached the turn in the road and ran faster jumping over fallen branches other men would not see slithering through vines and linked foliage others would not anticipate in less than two minutes he sprang silently out of the woods at mcallisters side good god gasped the undersecretary of state be quiet youre a maniac tell me about it it would take hours with trembling hands mcallister handed jason his attaché case at least this didnt explode i should have told you not to drop it or jar it too much oh jesus i isnt it time to get off the road wong said forget it were staying in plain view until we reach the field on the second hill then youll be more in view than me hurry up some kind of signals going to be given which means you were right again a pilots going to get clearance to land no radio communication just a light were to meet wong somewhere at the base of the first hill i think he said well give him a couple of minutes but i think we can forget him too hell see what i saw and if it were me id head back to macao and twenty thousand american and say i lost my way what did you see six men armed with enough firepower to defoliate one of the hills here oh my god well never get out i dont give up yet thats one of the things fve been thinking about bourne turned to mcallister quickening their pace on the other hand he added his voice deadly serious the risk was always there doing things your way yes i know i wont panic i will not panic the woods were suddenly gone the dirt road now cut a path through fields of tall grass what do you think those men are here for asked the analyst backups in case of a trap which any lowlife in this business would think it was i told you that and you didnt want to believe me but if something you said is accurate and i think it is theyll stay far out of sight to make sure you wont panic and run if thats the case itll be our way out how head to the right through the field replied jason without answering the question ill give wong five minutes unless we spot a signal somewhere or hear a plane but no more and that long only because i really want the pair of eyes i paid for could he get around those men without being sent he can if hes not on his way back to macao they reached the end of the field of high grass and the base of the first hill where trees rose out of the ascending ground bourne looked at his watch then at mcallister lets get up there out of sight he said gesturing at the trees above them ill stay here you go up farther but dont walk out on that field dont expose yourself stay at the edge if you see any lights or hear a plane whistle you can whistle cant you actually not very well when the children were younger and we had a dog a golden retriever oh for christs sake throw rocks down through the trees ill hear them go on yes i understand move delta for he was delta now began his vigil the moonlight was constantly intercepted by the drifting lowflying clouds and he kept straining his eyes scanning the field of tall grass looking for a break in the monotonous pattern for bent reeds moving towards the base of the hill towards him three minutes passed and he had nearly decided it was a waste of time when a man suddenly lurched out of the grass on his right and plunged up into the foliage bourne lowered his attache case and pulled the long knife from his belt kam pek whispered the man wong yes sir said the conduit walking around the trunks of trees approaching jason i am greeted with a knife there are a few other people back there and frankly i didnt think youd show up i told you you could get out if the risks looked too great i didnt think itd happen so early on but i would have accepted it those are impressive weapons theyre carrying i might have taken advantage of the situation but added to the money you afforded me an act of immense gratification for many others as well more people than you can imagine will give thanks soo the pig yes sir wait a minute said bourne alarmed why are you so sure theyll think one of those men did it what men that patrol of machine guns back there theyre not from guangdong not from the garrison theyre from beijing the act took place in zhuhai shi at the gate goddamn you youve blown everything they were waiting for soo if they were sir he never would have arrived what he was getting drunk with the prefect of the gate he went to relieve himself which was where i confronted him he is now next door lying in a soiled female commode his throat slit his genitals removed good god then he didnt follow us nor did he show any indication of doing so i see no i dont see he was cut out of tonight its strictly a beijing operation yet he was the primary contact down here t would know nothing of such matters broke in wong defensively oh sorry no you wouldnt here are the eyes you hired sir where do you wish me to look and what do you want me to do did you have any trouble getting by that patrol in the road none i saw them they did not see me they are now sitting in the woods at the edge of the field if it would be of help to you the man with the radio instructed the one he reached to leave once the signal was given i dont know what that means but i presume it concerns a helicopter you presume the frenchman and i followed the english major here one night its how i knew where to take you before a helicopter landed and men came out to meet the englishman thats what he told me told you sir never mind stay here if that patrol across the field starts coming over i want to know about it ill be up in the field before the second hill on the right the same field where you and echo saw the helicopter echo the frenchman delta paused thinking quickly you cant light a match you cant draw attention to yourself suddenly there were the sharp but muted sounds of objects striking other objects treesl rocks mcallister was signalling grab stones pieces of wood or rocks and keep throwing them into the woods on the right ill hear them i will fill my pockets with some now i have no right to ask you this said delta picking up the attache case but do you have a weapon a threefiftysevencalibre magnum with a belt full of ammunition courtesy of my cousin on my mothers side may she rest with the holy jesus i hope i dont see you and if i dont goodbye wong another part of me may not approve of you but youre a hell of a man and believe me you really did beat me last time no sir you bested me but i would like to try again forget it cried the man from medusa racing up the hill like a giant monstrous bird its lower body pulsating with blinding light the helicopter descended onto the field as arranged mcallister stood in full view and as expected the choppers searchlight zeroed in on him also as arranged jason bourne was fortyodd yards away in the shadows of the woods visible bujt not clearly the rotors wound down to a grinding abrasive halt the silence was emphatic the door opened the stairs sprang out and the slender grey haired sheng chou yang walked down the steps carrying a briefcase so good to see you after all these years edward called out a taipans first son would you care to inspect the aircraft as you requested there is no one but myself and my most trusted pilot no sheng you can do it for me yelled mcallister several hundred feet away pulling a canister from inside his jacket and throwing it towards the helicopter tell the pilot to step outside for a few minutes and spray the cabin if theres anyone inside he or they will come out quickly this is so unlike you edward men like us know when to trust one another were not fools do it sheng of course i will under orders the pilot stepped out of the aircraft sheng chou yang picked up the canister and sprayed the immobilizing fog into the helicopter several minutes elapsed no one came out are you satisfied or should i blow the damn thing up which would serve neither of us come my friend were beyond these games we always were but you became what you are i remained what i was we can correct that edward i can demand your presence at all our conferences i can elevate you to a position of prominence youll be a star in the foreign service firmament its true then isnt it everything in the file youre back the kuomintang is back in china lets talk quietly together edward sheng glanced at bourne in the shadows then gestured to his right this is a private matter jason moved quickly he raced to the aircraft while the two negotiators were standing with their backs to him as the pilot climbed into the chopper and reached his seat the man from medusa was behind him an jing whispered jason ordering the man to keep silent his machine pistol reinforcing the command before the stunned pilot could react bourne whipped a strip of heavy cloth over the mans head bridling it across the shocked open mouth and yanked it taut then pulling a long thin nylon cord from his pocket he lashed the man to the seat pinning his arms there would be no sudden liftoff returning his weapon to the belt under his jacket bourne crawled out of the helicopter the huge machine blocked his view of mcallister and sheng chou yang which meant that it blocked theirs of him he walked rapidly back to his previous position constantly turning his head prepared to change direction if the two men emerged on either side of the aircraft the chopper was his visual shield he stopped he was near enough it was time to appear casual he took out a cigarette and struck a match lighting it he then strolled aimlessly to his left to where he could just barely see the two figures on the other side of the helicopter he wondered what was being said between the enemies he wondered what mcallister was waiting for do it analyst do it now its your maximum opportunity every moment you delay you give away time and time holds complications goddamn it do it bourne froze he heard the sound of a stone hitting a tree close to where he had walked out on the field then another much nearer and another quickly following it was wongs warning shengs patrol was crossing the field below analyst youll get us killed if i run over and shoot the sound will bring six men rushing us with more firepower than we can handle for christs sake do it the man from medusa stared at sheng and mcallister his selfhatred rising close to exploding he never should have let it happen this way death by the hands of an amateur an embittered bureaucrat who wanted his moment in the sun kam pek it was wong he had crossed through the woods on the second level and was behind him concealed in the trees yes i heard the stones you will not like what you hear now sir what is it the patrol crawls up the hill its a protective action said jason his eyes riveted on the two figures in the field we may still be all right they cant see a hell of a lot i am not sure that matters sir they prepare themselves i heard them theyve locked their weapons into firing positions bourne swallowed a sense of futility spreading over him for reasons he could not fathom it was a reverse trap youd better get out of here wong may i ask are these the people who killed the frenchman yes and for whom the pig soo jiang has worked so obscenely these past four years yes i believe i will stay sir without saying a word the man from medusa walked back to his attache case he picked it up and threw it into the woods open it he said if we get out of this you can spend your days at the casino without picking up messages i do not gamble youre gambling now wong did you really think that we the great warlords of the most ancient and cultured empire the world has ever known would leave it to unwashed peasants and their illborn offspring schooled in the discredited theories of egalitarianism sheng stood in front of mcallister he held his briefcase across his chest with both hands they should be our slaves not our rulers it was that kind of thinking that lost you the country you the leaders not the people they werent consulted if they were there might have been accommodations compromises and you would have it still one does not compromise with marxist animals or with liars as i will not compromise with you edward what was that with his left hand sheng snapped his briefcase open and pulled out the file stolen from victoria peak do you recognize it he asked calmly i dont believe it believe my old adversary a little ingenuity can produce anything its impossible its here in my hand and the opening page clearly states that there is only one copy to be sent by military escort under ultra maximum security wherever it goes quite correctly in my judgement for your appraisal was accurate when we spoke over the telephone the contents would inflame the far east make war unavoidable the rightwingers in beijing would march on hong kong rightwingers there youd call them left on your side of the world foolish isnt it i had a copy made and sent to washington broke in the undersecretary quickly quietly firmly i dont believe that said sheng all diplomatic transmissions by telephonecomputer or by pouch must be cleared by the highest superior officer the notorious ambassador havilland wouldnt permit it and the consulate wouldnt touch it without his authorization i sent a copy to the chinese consulate shouted mcallister youre finished sheng really who do you think receives all communications from all outside sources at our consulate in hong kong dont bother to answer ill do it for you one of our people sheng paused his messianic eyes suddenly on fire we are everywhere edward we will not be denied we will have our nation back our empire youre insane it cant work youll start a war then it will be a just war governments across the world will have to choose individual rule or state rule freedom or tyranny too few of you gave freedom and too many of you were tyrants we will prevail one way or the other my god thats what you want you want to push the world to the brink force it to choose between annihilation and survival thats how you think youll get what you want that the choice of survival will win out this economic commission your whole hong kong strategy is just a beginning you want to spread your poison to the whole far east youre a zealot youre blind cant you see the tragic consequences our nation was stolen from us and we will have it back we cannot be stopped we march you can be stopped said mcallister quietly his right hand edging to the fold in his jacket ill stop you suddenly sheng dropped his briefcase revealing a gun he fired as mcallister instinctively recoiled in terror grabbing his shoulder dive roared bourne racing in front of the aircraft in the wash of its lights releasing a burst of gunfire from his machine pistol roll roll if you can move roll away you sheng screamed firingtwo rapid shots down into the fallen undersecretary of state then raising his weapon and repeatedly pulling the trigger aiming at the zigzagging man from medusa running towards him for echo shouted bourne at the top of his lungs for the people you hacked to death for the teacher on a rope you butchered for the woman that you couldnt stop oh christ for those two brothers but mainly for echo you bastard a short burst exploded from the machine pistol then no more and no amount of pressure on the trigger could activate it it was jammed jammed sheng knew it he levelled his weapon carefully as jason threw the gun down pounding towards the killer sheng fired as delta instinctively pivoted to his right spinning in midair as he pulled his knife from his belt then planted his foot on the ground reversing direction and abruptly lunged towards sheng the knife found its mark and the man from medusa ripped open the fanatics chest the actual killer of hundreds and wouldbe killer of millions was dead his hearing had been suspended it wasnt now the patrol had raced out of the woods bursts from machine guns filling the night and the field other bursts came from beyond the helicopter wong had opened the attaché case and found what he needed two soldiers of the patrol fell the remaining four dropped to the ground one crawled back into the woods he was shouting the radio he was reaching other men other backups how far away were they how near priorities bourne raced behind the aircraft and over to wong who was crouched by a tree at the edge of the woods theres another one of those in there he whispered give it to me conserve your ammunition said wong theres not much more i know that stay here and pin them down as best you can but keep your fire low to the ground where are you going sir circling back through the trees thats what the frenchman would have ordered me to do he was right he was always right jason dashed deeper into the woods with the bloody knife in his belt his lungs were bursting his legs straining his eyes peering into the forest darkness he threaded his way through the dense foliage as fast as he could making as little noise as he could two snaps thick twigs on the ground broken by having been stepped on he saw the shrouded silhouette of a figure coming towards him and spun around the trunk of a tree he knew who it was the officer with the radio the thoughtful softspoken killer from the beijing sanctuary an experienced combat soldier take to the flanks and outflank what he lacked was guerrilla training and that lack would cost him his life one did not step on thick objects in the forest the officer walked by crouching jason sprang his left arm circling the mans neck the gun in his hand slammed against the soldiers head the knife once again doing its work bourne knelt down over the corpse put his weapon in his belt and took the officers powerful machine gun he found two additional clips of ammunition the odds were better now it was even possible they would get out alive was mcallister alive or had a frustrated bureaucrats moment in the sun ended in perpetual darkness priorities he circled the fields curving border to the point where he had entered it wongs sporadic gunfire was keeping the three remaining men of shengs elite patrol where they were afraid to move suddenly something made him turn around a hum in the distance a bright fleck in his eye it was both the sound was that of a racing engine the fleck a moving searchlight scanning the dark sky above the descending trees he could make out a vehicle a truck with a searchlight operated by an experienced hand the truck sped off the road obscured now by the high grass only the bright searchlight was visible moving faster and faster towards the base of the hill barely yards below priorities move hold fire bourne roared lurching away from his position the three officers spun around in place on the ground their machine guns erupting bullets spraying the space from which the voice had come the man from medusa stepped out it was over in seconds as the powerful weapon blew up the earth and those killers who would have killed him wong he shouted running into the field come on with me seconds later he reached the bodies of mcallister and sheng one still alive one a corpse jason bent over the analyst who was moving both arms his right hand stretched out trying desperately to reach something mac can you hear me the file whispered the undersecretary of state get the file what bourne looked over at the body of sheng chou yang and in the dim wash of the moonlight saw the last thing in the world he expected shengs blackbordered dossier one of the most secret most explosive documents on earth jesus christ said jason softly reaching for it listen to me analyst bourne raised his voice as wong joined them we have to move you and it may hurt but we havent a choice he glanced up at wong and continued theres another patrol on its way here and its closing in an emergency backup and by my estimate theyll be here in less than two minutes grit your teeth mr undersecretary we move together jason and wong carried mcallister towards the helicopter suddenly bourne cried out christ wait a minute no go on you carry him he shouted to the conduit i have to go back why whispered the undersecretary in agony what are you doing sir cried wong food for revisionist thought shouted jason enigmatically as he raced back to the body of sheng chou yang when he reached it he bent down and shoved a flat object under the dead mans tunic he rose and ran back to the aircraft as wong was carefully gently placing mcallister across two of the back seats bourne leaped in the front took out his knife and slashed the nylon cord that bound the pilot then cut the cloth that gagged him the pilot had a spasm of coughing and gasping even before it subsided jason gave his orders kaifeiji ba he shouted you may speak english the pilot gasped i am fluent it was a requirement airborne you son of a bitch now the pilot snapped the switches and started the rotors as a swarm of soldiers clearly visible in the helicopters lights broke into the field the new patrol instantly saw the five dead men of shengs elite guard the entire squad began firing at the slowly ascending aircraft get the hell out of here roared jason the armour on this equipment is shengs armour said the pilot calmly even the glass will withstand heavy fire where do we go hong kong shouted bourne astonished to see that the pilot now ascending rapidly powerfully turned to him smiling surely the generous americans or the benevolent british will grant me asylum sir it is a dream from the spirits ill be goddamned said the man from medusa as they reached the first layer of lowflying clouds this was a most efficient idea sir said wong from the shadows at the rear of the helicopter how did it occur to you it worked once before said jason lighting a cigarette history even recent history usually repeats itself mr webb whispered mcallister what is it analyst how are you feeling never mind that why did you go back back to sheng to give him a farewell present a bank book a confidential account in the cayman islands what it wont do anybody any good the names and the account numbers have been scissored out but itll be interesting to see how peking reacts to its existence wont it epilogue edward newington mcallister on crutches limped into the onceimpressive study of the old house on victoria peak its huge bay windows now covered by heavy plastic the carnage all too apparent ambassador raymond havilland watched as the undersecretary of state threw the sheng file on his desk i believe this is something you lost said the analyst angling his crutches and settling down in the chair with difficulty the doctors tell me that your wounds arent critical said the diplomat im pleased youre pleased who the hell are you to be so royally pleased its a manner of speaking sounds arrogant if you like but i mean it what you did was extraordinary beyond anything i would have imagined im sure of that the undersecretary shifted his position easing his wounded shoulder into the back of the chair actually i didnt do it he did you made it possible edward i was out of my element my territory as it were these people do things the rest of us only dream about or fantasize or watch on a screen disbelieving every moment because its so outrageously implausible we wouldnt have such dreams or fantasize or stay mesmerized by invention if the fundamentals werent in the human experience they do what they do best just as we do what we do best to each his own territory mr undersecretary mcallister stared at havilland his look uncompromising how did it happen how did they get the file another kind of territory a professional three young men were killed quite horribly an impenetrable safe was penetrated inexcusable agreed said havilland leaning forward suddenly raising his voice just as your actions were inexcusable who in gods name do you think you are to have done what you did what right had you to take matters in your own hands inexperienced hands youve violated every oath youve ever taken in the service of your government dismissal is inadequate thirty years in prison would more suitably fit your crimes have you any idea what might have happened a war that could plunge the far east the world into hell i did what i did because i could do it thats a lesson i learned from jason bourne our jason bourne regardless you have my resignation mr ambassador effective immediately unless youre pressing charges and let you loose havilland collapsed back in his chair dont be ridiculous ive talked with the president and he agrees youre going to be chairman of the national security council chairman i cant handle it with your own limousine and all kinds of other crap i wont know what to say you know how to think and ill be at your side oh my god relax just evaluate and tell those of us who speak what to say thats where the real power is you know not those who speak but those who think its all so sudden so so deserved mr undersecretary interrupted the diplomat the mind is a marvellous thing lets never underestimate it incidentally the doctor tells me lin wenzu will pull through hes lost the use of his left arm but hell live im sure youll have a recommendation to forward to mi in london theyll respect it mr and mrs webb where are they in hawaii by now with dr panov and mr conklin of course they dont think much of me im afraid mr ambassador you didnt give them much reason to perhaps not but then thats not my job i think i understand now i hope your god has compassion for men like you and me edward i should not care to meet him if he doesnt theres always forgiveness really then i should not care to know him hed turn out to be a fraud why because he unleashed upon the world a race of unthinking bloodthirsty wolves who care not one whit about the tribes survival only their own thats hardly a perfect god is it he is perfect were the imperfect ones then its only a game for him he puts his creations in place and for his own amusement watches them blow themselves up he watches us blow ourselves up theyre our explosives mr ambassador we have free will according to the scriptures however its all his will isnt that so let his will be done its a grey area perfect one day you might really be secretary of state i dont think so nor do i agreed havilland but in the meantime we do our jobs keep the pieces in place stop the world from destroying itself thank the spirits as they say here in the east for people like you and me and jason bourne and david webb we push the hour of armageddon always a day away what happens when were not here her long auburn hair fell over his face her body pressed against his her lips next to his lips david opened his eyes and smiled it was as though there had been no nightmare that had jarringly interrupted their lives no outrage inflicted upon them that had brought them to the edge of an abyss that held horror and death they were together and the splendid comfort of that reality filled him with profound gratitude it was and that was enough more than he ever thought possible he began to reconstruct the events of the past twentyfour hours and his smile widened a brief curtailed laugh escaping from his throat things were never as they should be never as one expected he and mo panov had had far too much to drink on the flight from hong kong to hawaii while alex conklin had stayed with iced tea or club soda or whatever newly reformed drunks want others to know theyre staying with no lectures just quiet martyrdom marie had held the eminent dr panovs head while the noted psychiatrist threw up in the british military aircrafts suffocatingly small toilet covering mo with a blanket when he fell into a dead sleep she had then gently but firmly rejected her husbands amorous advances but had made up for those rejections when she and a sobered mate reached the hotel in kahala a splendid delirious night of making love that adolescents dream of washing away the terrors of the nightmare alex yes he remembered conklin had taken the first commercial flight out of oahu to los angeles and washington there are heads to break was the way he had phrased it and i intend to break them alexander conklin had a new mission in his fragmented life it was called accountability mo morris panov scourge of the chickensoup psychologists and the charlatans of his profession he was next door in the adjoining room no doubt nursing the most massive hangover of his life you laughed whispered marie her eyes closed nestling her face into his throat what the hell is so funny you me us everything your sense of humour positively escapes me on the other hand i think i hear a man named david thats all youll ever hear from now on there was a knock on the door not the door to the hallway but the one to the adjoining room panov webb got out of bed walked rapidly to the bathroom and grabbed a towel whipping it around his naked waist just a second mo he called out going to the door morris panov his face pale but composed stood there with a suitcase in his hand may i enter the temple of eros youre there friend i should hope so good afternoon my dear said the psychiatrist addressing marie in the bed as he went to a chair by the glass door that led to the baicoty overlooking the hawaiian beach dont fuss dont prepare a meal and if you get out of bed dont worry im a doctor i think how are you mo marie sat up pulling the sheet over her far better than i was three hours ago but you wouldnt know anything about that youre maddeningly sane you were stretched you hadto let loose if you charge a hundred dollars an hour lovely lady ill mortgage my house and sign up for five years of therapy id like that defined said david smiling and sitting down opposite panov why the suitcase im leaving i have patients back in washington and i like to think they may need me the silence was moving as david and marie looked at morris panov what do we say mot asked webb how do we say it you dont say anything ill do the talking marie has been hurt pained beyond normal endurance but then her endurance is beyond normality and she can handle it perhaps outrageously we expect as much from certain people its unfair but thats the way it is i had to survive mo said marie looking at her husband i had to get him back thats the way it was you david youve gone through a traumatizing experience one that only you can deal with and you dont need any chickensoup crap from me to face it you are now not anybody else jason bourne is gone he cant come back build your life as david webb concentrate on marie and david thats all there is and all there should be and if at any moment the anxieties come back they probably wont but id appreciate your manufacturing a few call me and ill take the next plane up to maine i love you both and maries beef stew is outstanding sundown the brilliant orange circle settling on top of the western horizon slowly disappearing into the pacific they walked along the beach their hands gripped fiercely their bodies touching sc natural so right what do you do when theres a part of you that you hate said webb accept it answered marie we all have a dark side david we wish we could deny it but we cant its there perhaps we cant exist without it yours is a legend called jason bourne but thats all it is i loathe him he brought you back to me thats all that matters
