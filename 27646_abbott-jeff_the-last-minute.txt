the last minute jeff abbott part one a very private war manhattan upper west side i knocked on the green door and knew that in the next five minutes id either be dead or id have the truth i needed the man opened the apartment door just as i raised my fist for the second impatient knock he did not look like a man who traded in human lives he looked like an accountant he wore a dark suit a loosened tie with bands of silver and pink and a slight air of exhaustion and impatience his glasses were steelframed and rectangular his lips were greasy with takeout thai and the remains of a meal maybe his last scented the air he looked at me he looked at the pixie of a woman standing next to me then he looked at his watch you and your wife are late mr derwatt he said one minute late there were several misconceptions in his statement first my name was not derwatt second the woman standing next to me mila was not my wife third we were exactly on time id even waited for the second hand to sweep past the twelve before i knocked but i shrugged full of graciousness and he opened the door and mila and i stepped inside he looked her over he did it all in a second but i saw it she was glancing at the two thicknecked thugs who stood by the apartments dinner table then she cast her gaze down as if intimidated nice bit of acting that mila could stare down a great white shark i offered the accountant a handshake frank derwatt this is my wife lilia mr bell he didnt shake my hand and i let it drop down to my side i threw in an awkward laugh for effect i was wearing jeans and a navy blazer with a pink polo underneath mila had found a horrible floral skirt that i suppose approximated her bizarre idea of what an american suburban housewife would wear she clutched her pink purse we looked like we were more interested in country club membership than an illegal adoption i thought we were meeting alone i said mila stepped close to me like she was afraid the accountant dabbed a napkin at the thai sauce smearing his mouth i wanted to seize him by the throat throw him against the wall and force him to tell me where my son was but that would only get my son killed so i stood there like i was the nervous suburban wannabe dad that i was playing face the wall one of the big men said he was a redhead with his hair sliced into a burr and freckles the size of pebbles on his face both of you we both did i set down the small canvas briefcase i was carrying i didnt argue i was supposed to be a nervous lawabiding citizen and although i have been those things in the distant past i wasnt right now no wire no weapons just me and my shining personality and a rage i kept caged up in my chest the redhead searched me thoroughly then he did the same to mila frank she said about halfway through a tinge of fear in her voice she was selling it just be patient honey itll be over in a minute i said and then we can get our baby mila made this soft hiss of assent the patient sigh of a woman who wanted this deal to be her gateway to happiness mr and mrs derwatt are clean mr bell the redhead said he stepped back from us i took milas hand for just a moment sit down mr derwatt the accountant said excuse the mess we decided on an early dinner i dont usually meet with clients at night i knew that normally the accountant would now be on a commuter train back to new jersey i had checked into every nook of his life a wife two sons a mortgage on a cozy little place to live a life full of promise all the sweet elements id once had and had lost the accountant and his toughs studied me let them i thought id been careful one opened the briefcase he dumped the bricks of cash out onto the table and began to sort them mr bell glanced at me my wife and i i lied weve failed to conceive after three years of trying it has nearly destroyed our marriage im eager to give my wife a healthy happy baby you could adopt through legit channels yes but um some of my business practices i dont care to have them scrutinized by wellmeaning social workers we simply wish to acquire a child mila moved close to me you have done our background checks yes we wish to make our selection and get a child its not that easy mrs derwatt ive brought the down payment we select our child and then we go get him or her he blinked at me that was what was agreed i said the moneys all here mr bell the redhead had counted with the precise quickness of a man used to handling banded stacks of cash twenty thousand dollars there were some anomalies in your background checks mr bell said anomalies i do not know this word mila said shed thickened up her eastern european accent um questions mrs derwatt i held my breath we had been very very careful in setting up these identities mila had worked on them while we tried our best to find any link to the one clue we had to my sons whereabouts a photo of a woman leaving a private clinic in strasbourg france soon after my sons birth i had been told shed sold my son we still did not know who the woman was but using milas considerable resources wed found a surveillance photo of her arriving in new york a week after my sons birth walking out of the terminal with this man mr bell whose face was in a criminal database maintained by the state of new york for having been convicted of embezzlement six years ago and had gotten parole we matched him to the airport photo found out where he lived where he worked and who his associates were slow plodding detective work but it had paid off we had sent out feelers as potential adopters of a child provided background gotten this meeting to pick out a son or daughter but now we could not find a complete enough history for mrs derwatt before she came over from romania mila was from moldova but the languages are identical she turned to me and said in moldovan we will have to kill them i forced a smile she doesnt understand what you mean i said to mr bell in english you said you met mrs derwatt through an online dating service that matches western men with eastern european brides yes what does this matter weve brought the money we want a child shes romanian why not adopt there mr bell said you could just go to eastern europe and buy yourself a kid like you bought yourself a wife nice sneer at the end somewhere wed left a hole in our story or conversely this was a test i put on my outraged face we dont care where the child comes from i told you i cannot use normal channels as many of our clients cant mr derwatt so you understand why we must be so cautious our potential parents are dangerous people my business is my business ive provided you with what you need to know about me anything more could be compromising for me or for you mr bell asked darling lets gather up our money i said to mila were leaving i continued to play the outrage card dont touch the money mrs derwatt bell said we had a deal i pointed at the laptop on the table pay a deposit pick a baby from the list pick him up and pay the rest we can decline to do business with anyone who makes us uncomfortable what is problem mila said maybe you make misunderstanding and this is easy to fix she tried a bright smile with him you claim to be lilia rozan from bucharest immigrated here three years ago no claim am that particular lilia rozan is currently in a cancer ward in new jersey misstep wed used a bad identity mr bell stood a little straighter he was nervous but he had the muscle here so mr derwatt we want to know who you and the lovely missus are were wanted by the police i said we had to lie mr bell smiled details please the two men were on each side of him they didnt have their guns out but they thought they didnt need to we were unarmed i looked at mila look our moneys good as anyone elses please the bald man moved behind mila she clasped a hand over her wristwatch we want to know who you are right now or he starts in on your wife mila turned hands clasped together as if in prayer oh no please dont hurt me we just want a baby please thats all we want he shoved her into the wall she kept her footing but tears sprang to her eyes oh please i stayed very still the bald man glanced back at me frowning with disgust that i would let him manhandle my woman and in that second mila pulled the watch from its band connecting them was a thin steel wire she leapt onto his back and looped the garrote over his neck the watch and the band serving as handles so that she didnt slice her fingers off his yell became a gurgle in an instant i hammered a fist into mr bells chest and he went heaving into the air and landed on my money the redhead started to draw but he couldnt decide for one crucial second whether to shoot me or save his buddy now purpling under milas wire as he swung the silencercapped beretta fs back toward me hello selfpreservation i launched into him i levered the gun down as he fired and he hit his own foot he howled and i slammed a fist into his solar plexus and then into his throat he staggered back and we fought for control of the gun he was bigger than me i wrenched the gun pushing it back toward his chest his eyes widened as he realized the barrel was going to slip under his chin it did and i squeezed his hand and his own finger pulled the trigger a spray of blood and flesh fountained as it carved a path into his face he looked surprised before the bullet distorted his flesh i freed the gun from his fingers and whirled aiming at milas opponent but that guy was already gone shes not big but still a hundred pounds hanging onto a wire a throat cant survive the trauma the bald man lay in a sprawl at her feet she hovered over mr bell panting you all right i asked her she nodded i felt a tickle of bile at the back of my throat and i swallowed it down you killed them mr bell said gasping people say the most obvious things when theyre in a daze they sell people i said theyre worse than ill ever be who are you i didnt answer im just a man who wants his stolen child back my son ive never seen except on this video being carried by a woman who sells human beings for profit my child i was much closer to finding my kid than id ever been and i thought of the times i rested my hand on my wifes pregnant swell feeling the bubble of movement beneath the skin knowing it was a baby but not knowing it was going to be daniel this unique and special person who id never gotten to see with my own eyes hold with my own arms im coming i told him my breath like a prayer on the air mr bell swallowed his mouth quivered as he looked at the dead men okay you can have a baby whichever one you want i want one born on january th at a private clinic in strasbourg called les saintes his birth name on the certificate was julien daniel besson but his real name is daniel capra this woman took him from the clinic all weve been able to find out is that she travels on a belgian passport under the name of anna tremaine now i asked around and i found out that you work with anna tremaine he gave a halfnod he was scared to death blinking at the bodies of the muscles where is my son i asked very quietly i didnt handle that placement anna would know oh god please dont hurt me dont lie to us mila held up the watchgarrote slicked with blood im not lying im not i squatted by him put the silencer still warm against his modishly unshaven cheek did anna know you were suspicious of me um no we initially reject every adopter we claim they arent suitable that theres a hole in their story our clients are normally so desperate they will do almost anything not to be rejected usually we can pressure them into qualifying by sharing information that is valuable you know insider info on a company or they can render services to us that can be useful later extortion and blackmail as if illegal adoption wasnt enough what charming people so you meet us we pass your test then what i call anna we set up a meeting you give her the rest of the money then she makes a phone call and the child is brought to you has my son been sold i told you i dont know please please watch him i said to mila i opened the laptop on the screen was a catalog in pdf format pictures of babies countries of origin description of parents if known but no names the spring catalog featured over two dozen children beautiful kids on the auction block i scanned it quickly none were listed as being born in france and i didnt see what the point of lying in the catalog would be youre going to call anna tremaine and youre going to set up a meeting mr bells lip trembled where is she based her cell phone has a las vegas area code but thats not where she necessarily meets people he added in a little rushed lie las vegas will be just fine i decided id make it extra easy for anna tremaine you tell her that mr and mrs derwatt have checked out and that well be in vegas tomorrow night to collect our child and pay the money you have to pick one then what a child you have to pick a child this one i just pointed to the infant whose picture was on the current page of the digital catalog okay his breathing slowed ill do it please dont kill me call her now and if you say a single syllable that i dont like i will kill you and i slipped milas garrote around his throat the bloodied wire lay against his shirt and i tightened it enough so that the steel lay against his soft throat i gave him an address in las vegas to suggest as a meeting place he nodded he dialed he waited i leaned close enough to hear yes anna its bell the couple today the derwatts they checked out okay theyve made their selection which one number fourteen i could hear the barest scratch of pen and ink all right they dont want to meet in new york i think they would be willing to come to las vegas a pause all right do you know a place called the canyon bar just off the strip oh wonderful she said hipster parents they suggested meeting there tomorrow evening at nine i thought she might suggest her own choice but any public spot could be put under surveillance our locale was as good as any other thats fine she said all right ill tell them thanks youre welcome the conversation felt off tense but he hadnt said anything i could pinpoint as a signal to her the wife and kids all right yes anna thanks for asking he swallowed against the wire brent starts flag football this weekend jareds joined swim team oh thats nice all right ill see the derwatts tomorrow how will i know them shes very petite darkhaired hes about six foot wiry dark blond hair green eyes nice looking couple tell them to get a table preferably in the back order me a martini three olives and leave it at the table with a seat for me i dont like the look of anything in the bar i skip the meeting and no baby ill tell them very well anna said bye he hung up the phone and dropped it to the floor shivering under the wire waiting for me to kill him mila knelt to meet his gaze youre not going to die youre going to talk youre going to tell me everything you know about novem soles who novem soles also called nine suns what i dont know what you mean i mean the criminal ring that anna works for i only know anna shes selfemployed i pushed up the sleeves on his shirt there was no marking tattoo a fiery nine transformed into a blazing sun novem soless mark of ownership id seen it on too many arms back in amsterdam i checked the arms of the two muscles one had a tattoo but it was the chinese symbol for luck hadnt worked shes not working for herself i said she works for an incredibly dangerous group of people they were plotting a mass assassination a month ago you screw them over you die mr bells lip trembled he was trying to find his bravery but failing you see them mila pointed at the bodies he nodded youre not going to be like them unless you make trouble youre going to be locked up in a room and wait until weve taken care of anna and you tell my people all you know about anna tremaine and her operation mila said everything and then youre going to go back and live with your family and youre going to stay the hell out of illegal activities he nodded call your wife tell her you need to go out of town for a few days then call your office he nodded eager hopeful he would live when he was done he handed her back the phone she took a pair of handcuffs off one of the dead men and cuffed bell i almost saw him shiver in relief if she was cuffing him she wasnt killing him i had the information i needed finally i was going to find my son cable beach the bahamas it was a breaking of the rules punishable by death his project his failure his only shield was that he controlled access to many secrets that made their work and their profits possible he smoothed out the thin strip of blond hair that bisected his scalp a lowcut mohawk and tugged at the jacket of his armani suit he stood on the porch of the large house and waited for the other eight to arrive in the darkening evening rain slashed the beach wind whipped the waves thunder thrummed the sky and the world appeared to have been smeared with gray paint alongside the sodden beach ran an equally sodden road with a sign marking that it had been closed for repairs over the course of two hours eight cars came down the rainsmeared asphalt and went around the windbuffeted sign without the slightest hesitation each of the lincoln navigators with its windows tinted against prying eyes had been hired out from a local company that usually specialized in transporting film actors and rock stars around the island the passengers in each car in this case were not famous and each liked their anonymity the house nestled in a private cove the drivers helped their passengers inside each had packed light and carried a single bag the drivers all former military now security for hire from a variety of englishspeaking nations then took up stations around the house to ensure that no one approached via boat or car or plane shortly after the last passenger arrived the sky began to break the clouds parting as if a curtain was rising on a stage the early evening stars as witnesses the house smelled of italian cooking a heady mix of oregano garlic simmering beef and red wine the host for this gathering of the nine suns or novem soles as it was also known had spent part of his wandering childhood in rome he loved food and his nanny had taught him how to cook so for dinner there was salad grilled fish hearty pastas and fine wines imported from tuscany and piedmont the nine men and women ate and sipped wine and chatted about the worlds events a financial crisis in south america the increasing violence between muslims and christians in nigeria the latest scandal in the american congress and the opportunities for expansion that all three presented the man with the blond mohawk accepted compliments on the food he smiled and encouraged the quieter members of the group quiet that is in the way of cobras observing considering when to strike to join the conversations he had wanted to arrange prostitutes for the visiting group but had been sternly warned that given recent events this was no time for debauchery he missed sex he was reduced to being a spectator nowadays but even watching a feeble substitute was better than nothing in these rooms they did not use each others names they were known by their responsibilities the banker the general the diplomat the courier titles passed down through long years or kept by the original members of the nine the blond mohawk was called the watcher it was a role hed fought hard to get and he had no intention of losing it now the watcher waited for the banker and the general to get into their usual bickering but for once they did not he heard english spoken russian practiced the silk of arabic whispered these gatherings were always a good chance for everyone to practice their foreign language skills but the meeting would be conducted in english the groups lingua franca after supper the nine gathered in the large den the watcher stood at the head of the long table he took a calming breath that he camouflaged under a welcoming smile he was the youngest cant be scared boy be tough im a firm believer in bad news first the watcher said as you know our recent mass assassination plot in the united states failed silence among the nine it seemed like all the goodwill engendered by his fine food and wine evaporated like ice on summer concrete a smuggling ring that we used as a cover to get experimental weapons into the united states was destroyed the ring was infiltrated by a former cia operative named sam capra he should have died in our bombing of a clandestine cia office in london dedicated to stopping illicit transnational activities his office was part of the special projects branch which as you know does the work that even the cia is not supposed to discuss the mention of special projects caused a bit of a stir in the room glances exchanged water sipped eyebrows raised these days special projects is specifically interested in any criminal nonterrorist activities that can affect american national security he paused they stared waiting he tapped on the laptop button and a picture of sam capra appeared on the screen brownishblondhaired greeneyed the lean face of a runner midtwenties boyish capra survived only because he walked out of the office before it was bombed however and was regarded by the cia as a likely traitor due to financial irregularities committed by his wife and the inconvenient fact that his pregnant wife had told him to leave the office right before it was destroyed capra escaped from the cias custody went searching for his wife infiltrated our group in amsterdam and disrupted the assassination plots the nine waited while the watcher took a long drink of water he studied their faces most of them would not have been recognized by any government official any police department any journalist any intelligence service they were for the most part so ordinary frighteningly ordinary the person who might sit next to you on the subway or stand behind you in the grocery store line or drop off their child at the same time you did at school they came from around the world yet they all seemed to have that same suburban sameness it was the watcher thought a superior camouflage yet they had come so close to delivering a historychanging death blow to american stability to bringing the country to a level of chaos that promised an erosion of the rule of law and in turn enormous profit look how far weve come since the early days the watcher thought a tremendous lesson could be learned from a tremendous failure they were unbloodied and unbowed you will note that we lost our main cia contact he was killed in action by capra we have since lost two other lowlevel contacts i recruited inside the cia theyve been arrested fortunately we did not deal face to face with them and they cannot betray us so right now we have no eyes inside the cia the banker asked we have an eye or two that never blinks he smiled let them know he still had information feeds inside the agency but not exactly what kinds i do not know if they can see as well or as far the watcher cleared his throat he could have shared a file two inches thick on sam capras life with his compatriots but hed decided not to play up the mans importance we do however have leverage over sam capra we have his infant child children sniffed the banker she was a chinese woman petite thin with a lovely face that could have sold cosmetics by the tonnage she made a frown as though the word held a sourness control countered the general control of a puppet with no strings for us to pull while we have control over his kid theres no way the cia will let him close to any information that is useful to us the diplomat said he spoke with a deep baritone a south african accent hands tented before his face i say we kill him show that we cannot be defied sam capra the watcher said doesnt know that our group has steered him from six years ago that we have guided his life as surely as a hand on a rudder we made him into what he is not the cia the setback with his wife was unfortunate but he only knows us as a name that means nothing a vague threat he doesnt know who we are he doesnt know how we came to be he has damaged us like no one else has the general said i truly prefer that he be dead we should not be killing cia agents unless absolutely necessary the historian said he was a heavyset russian head shaved bald muscles thick under the black of his tailored suit it provokes attention it is bad for business hes no longer with the cia he is useless to us he cannot hurt us he cannot find us he dies at our hand the cia will be coming to investigate i agree several of the others murmured the watcher scanned their faces taking the temperature of their reactions the banker stared at him and he nodded at her and said you have a thought to share yes you wanted us to finance your ability to spy on very specific people i want to know how much of that ability has been compromised by this failure the whole reason we were able to attempt a project of this scale was because of me because i have made it easy for us to access information that is critically damaging to some of the most vitally placed people in the world and use it to force them to do what we need we had a failure it doesnt change the fact that i i mean we now own several people in key positions in government and business around the world so you want to mount another project using your resources the bankers tone mocked him in another time he would have slapped her across the face torn her silk suit from her body taught her who was master his jaw quavered those days were done instead he nodded gravely yes but first i want to clean up the mess that sam capra made for us but i want you to understand why its a risk the banker nodded we had an asset in amsterdam a computer hacker who had helped me with infiltrating the laptops of our targets so that we had a free view of the classified information that came into their systems nic ten boom hes dead killed by capra there is a loose end there that we have only now discovered what who the general asked a young chinese graduate student a computer hacker named jin ming was present at a shootout in a rotterdam machinists shop that was owned by the smuggling ring we used in amsterdam he was nic ten booms hacking assistant if you will ming is in the hospital recovering from his wounds the assistant may know nothing he may not i would very much like to know if he is going to be a problem we know that nic ten boom was most ambitious he had to be careful here in checking my own computers logs i found out that ten boom was trying to learn more about us and about our organization when he died we hired him to spy for us but he was starting to spy on us then im glad hes dead and you should hire with a more careful eye the banker said nic was attracted by success he wanted to move up the ladder the watcher shrugged he didnt seem to realize we require success before promotion kids today are lazy the general said everyone else involved in the amsterdam operation is dead either killed by capra or by one of our people edward who sought to minimize our risks by eliminating those who could identify him edward is dead there was no sentimentality about the death of a hireling i did not know until now that this young man ming was alive he was grabbed by the cia from an internet cafe then we assume ming gave them the rotterdam address they took him in when they raided our smuggling operation and ming was shot apparently both our side and the cia left him for dead he is in an amsterdam hospital under police guard so have him killed the banker gave a dismissive wave of her hand i can assure you if there is a surfeit of anything in the world its chinese grad students i will but why ive told you all this is because its all part of a bigger picture we have shaped sam capra over the years like he was made of clay and i dont intend to let that wheel stop spinning until he is molded in just the way we need the time has come i have thought of a way in which mr capra can be invaluable to us because we have his child the banker said you just got a new pawn on your chessboard darling she actually smiled at him he did not like her changing his metaphor you have to seize what advantages you can the watcher said he felt the tension in his chest begin to loosen at any moment any of the others would have been in their rights to call a vote on his life they hadnt the cia will never trust him while we have his child ever the general said oh i know i intend to take full advantage of that its not like theres a surplus of highly trained cia operatives on the market and most of them would never consider working for us but he will the banker said the watcher nodded yes he will he was going to get to live another day he decided amsterdam the netherlands the woman who was not a nurse but was dressed like one entered the hospital shortly after pm amsterdam time while a group met and talked in the bahamas and sam capra got the best lead yet on his son the woman had been most careful to forge her credentials with care she had stolen a nurses uniform earlier in the day from the hospital laundry shed had to settle for buying shoes that looked good enough to pass the real trick was getting the passcard for the secure floor where her target slept that had taken time to pierce the hospitals security provider database to imprint a card with the necessary code to break into the police departments voicemail system and finally find a message that told her which room held jin ming but she had done it and when she saw him she was going to kill him jack ming was playing the quiet game the one where you tried to see how long you could go without speaking he was going on three weeks now three weeks of such careful cultivated silence that he wondered if his voice would still work he lay in the hospital bed the sheets pulled up close to him like a damaged cocoon his throat bore the raw scar from where a bullet had furrowed across skin and muscle the giant bruise on his temple from where hed fallen against a piece of machinery the injuries had kept him in a coma for nearly two weeks the doctors and the nurses and the police investigators all called him jin ming which wasnt his real name and he did not correct their mistake keeping quiet became an exercise like writing a program with the least possible lines of code or breaking into a database in the fewest most elegant steps how long could you play the quiet game his father and mother had made him do it when he was a child and playing loudly or asking one of his endless questions about why was the sky blue or why did they fight so much or why couldnt he buy a toy he wanted and they would flash angry eyes at him his father looking up from one of the books he always was reading his mother from her desk where she seemed to live be quiet jack youre bothering me lets play a game see how long you can be quiet but it was never a game they were never quiet a proper quiet game involved a stare down this was simply a way for his parents to put him on a shelf so he stayed quiet he had woken up sure that he must be dead a bullet had scored along the flesh of his throat another centimeter and he would have bled out in moments his carotid artery emptying on the cool concrete floor of the smugglers den near the rotterdam port but the artery went untouched three days after he woke up the police moved him from rotterdam to a hospital in amsterdam he slept but it was strange when he was wheeled inside they put a sheet over him like he was a secret they wanted to keep he had his own room he didnt have to share he wondered what this meant he wanted to ask for a computer but he didnt want to speak not talking was weirdly very liberating he didnt have to tell the truth he didnt have to lie after all these months he did not have to keep pretending to be someone he wasnt at night he dreamed of the red notebook nic drunk had told him the people we work for would kill us if they knew i had all their secrets all bound up thats my insurance policy the red notebook if its a secret why tell me youre drunk and foolish jack thought but there was no point in stating the obvious because if something happens to me i want them to suffer nic had said in a beery slur the red notebook you find it at my place hidden youre smart enough to find it it will bring the nine suns down the nine suns nic invoked them like they were cartoon boogeymen jack didnt do an eye roll no one wants to kill you nic jack had said stop being so dramatic but in the machinists shop with the smugglers working for nine suns in front of him and the cia behind him hed seen nic lying dead on the floor before all the gunfire erupted if he had to protect himself he needed to find nics red notebook which was slightly difficult to do from a hospital bed earlier that day theyd sent a new police inspector as if a variety of interrogators would suddenly get jack to speak the doctor says that you should be able to talk the police inspector said his name was van biezen and he sat at jacks bedside and he watched jack ming watching him he held a notebook in his lap and jack could see the words on the paper jin ming graduate student in computer science at technical university of delft found shot near bodies of known criminals including hacker nic ten boom refuses to speak no medical reason for not talking the writing on the inspectors notebook looked as exact as a computer font the precision scared him this was a man like his own father a man who was going to ferret out truths jack stared at the policeman i understand the wound in your throat was fortunately rather shallow your vocal cords are not damaged mr jin jack didnt speak we need to know your connection to the dead men in the machinists shop nic ten boom and the pauder twins jack stayed quiet i know youve been told ten boom is a known computer con artist did you know he was also a suspected internet pornographer van biezen let the next two words detonate a soft bomb in the quiet hum of the room child pornographer bile inched into the back of jacks throat this was new he hadnt known that about nic it was a most unpleasant surprise he closed his eyes and he tried not to shiver when he opened them van biezen still sat across from him he specialized in creating custom videos you want a certain kind of child doing a certain act he could deliver jack gritted his teeth closed his eyes no no no he had intended on complete silence but now a sickened moan rose in his throat like a bubble loosened in a bottle the first real noise hed made in weeks our informants say nic ten boom had a rather global clientele what can you tell me about them jack wished he could die snap his fingers stop his heart every time this gets worse he thought i think it cannot get worse and it does it does but he kept his mouth shut the pauder twins are known freelance enforcers for a variety of criminal enterprises now mr jin how does a nice graduate student in computer science get caught in a shootout with such bad people jack said nothing i think your silence is to keep yourself from lying about who and what you are van biezen said i think its been tolerated far too long you wont even write a note on a pad but you are going to talk to me jack raised an eyebrow van biezen opened a file lets see whats true today shall we you are jin ming and you are a chinese citizen born in hong kong you speak perfect english according to your classmates at delft thats all we know im waiting for you to explain to me how you ended up in a bulletridden shop full of counterfeit cigarettes and dead criminals jack had imagined how to answer this during his enforced silence his false identity backed by a computer record in the universitys database and inside a distant beijing database of all students abroad had held up he could survive this and vanish again so he spoke his first words in weeks i was kidnapped the words sounded scratchy like sandpaper grating against wood van biezen raised an eyebrow at the unexpected sound of jacks voice he speaks very good he cleared his own throat kidnapped yes grabbed from an internet cafe over on singel the cafe sprong on april ask the barista there three men came in and they pretended to be with the police they pulled guns on everyone and ordered us to be still then they took me with them they beat me up and they took me with them to that shop why would they kidnap you i believe because they wanted my computer skills youre a hacker i am the opposite he injected dignity into his halflie check my work in grad school speak with my adviser we have then you know my thesis subject is computer security no one knows system weaknesses better than a security expert i specialize in rfid chip programming you know the chips that are placed on products to stop counterfeiting and to facilitate tracking he paused may i have some water van biezen gave him a glass with a straw sticking out of it the water tasted like heaven to jack check the date im sure there was a police report filed the barista was mad i will and how did all these three men end up dead jack kept his gaze steady on van biezen the cop had misunderstood he thought the three dead men nic and the twins were his kidnappers jack nearly wept with relief if he mentioned that a team of three cia agents hunting one of their own named sam capra had kidnapped him right now it would be unwise he preferred to approach the cia on his own terms because he had already decided that the cia was going to help him get out of this mess he swallowed and continued other men came in and shot them i dont know why except well they had crates of cigarettes i assume they were smuggling them if the cigarettes were stolen then they might have wanted me to reprogram the rfid chips in the crates so they could not be tracked van biezen said they werent stolen cigarettes they were counterfeit brands then i guess they wanted me for some other reason van biezen did not look impressed he said so when we check your phone records were not going to find any calls to nic ten boom or the pauder twins they were strangers to you yes strangers to me he had been careful to use only the prepaid phones given directly to him by nic his own phone and email records were clean im going to check your story i hope for your sake it holds true it will so why did you not speak for so long jack said nothing he put on his mona lisa smile and stared back at the detective hed returned to his quiet game van biezen left and jack leaned back against the pillows he considered the cia had killed nic and the other men in the warehouse and left him to die or maybe theyd thought he was already dead he had no idea but hed been here a while he had his own hospital room theyd brought him here covered and he was under police protection were the police hiding him they must be which meant maybe nine suns and the cia werent looking for him that was buying him time very precious time he couldnt waste lying in a hospital bed he needed that notebook he was not going to ask the police for help or for protection the only protection was the notebook full of nine suns secrets and nic had hidden it somewhere he had to get out and he had to find it the men who had taken him from the internet cafe would want it the cia who had been hunting this group nine suns must be special international if the cia had an interest they paid money for information they protected informants he could see his only course of action perfectly clear he could find nics notebook and sell it to august and then could go into hiding for ever he could not trust the police he knew nic had broken into the police departments servers even if the police hid him nine suns could find him he needed the most powerful ally he could muster it would have to be the cia jack ming studied the white purity of the ceiling of his hospital room all he had to do now was to get the hell out of this hospital and find the red notebook the door opened a nurse stepped inside she was tall and blackskinned and had a strong face that wore a frown he blinked he wasnt dreaming she closed the door and turned to him his eyes widened in shock a nurses uniform well ricki said she came close to the bed leaned down to his ear youve been a lot of trouble to find jack decided to keep his ongoing silence although he could not believe she stood before him do you know how worried ive been i could kill you for not letting me know youre okay jack made a noise ive had to hack into you dont want to know how many databases looking for you ricki was originally from senegal in west africa and her accent fueled by anger chopped the words into shards arent you going to say anything he shook his head pointed to the surgical scar on his throat she cant know what ive been doing he thought i cant put her in danger are you kidding me i go through hell to find your hidden ass and you arent going to talk to me his heart felt like it would burst he let his lips form the beginning of a word i am so glad youre here please get me out of this but then he stopped ricki had known nic slightly he couldnt connect her to novem soles he had to keep her away from these lunatics so he shook his head no then she fell onto him crying softly putting a kiss in his hair not on his lips theyd broken up weeks ago she held him and he thought he might cry he might let out all the emotion penned up inside him out like a longechoing wail she sat next to the bed he pointed at her nurses uniform and raised his eyebrows she shrugged i had to wait for the night shift and if i get caught im arrested i had to sneak down here and talk my way past the guard because he hadnt seen me the door opened the guard peering in ricki had his wrist as though taking his pulse jack gave the guard a nod the guard shut the door the police have been hiding you ricki leaned close in her whisper hiding him and yet shed found him he loved how smart she was he wanted to take her hand but theyd broken up he reminded himself she kept hold of his wrist ming and it shamed him she didnt know his real first name what have you gotten involved in he shook his head pointed at the surgical scar you dont fool me you can talk god knows most days you never shut up he closed his eyes dont protect me ricki said let me help you the police officer outside opened the door and rickis voice shifted into a louder tone so everything looks okay sorry to have woken you she stood nodded smartly she glanced at the police officer and she walked out without a backward glance let me help you no one though could help him unless he found nics red notebook upper west side manhattan its not easy getting two bodies of heavyset men out of an apartment we had to assume the apartment was tied to bell and right now we didnt want people looking for him or linking him to two dead guys we didnt want his name in the papers i called bertrand to help he showed up an hour later with a moving van and crates he brought mila a moving van uniform and a cap that seemed to cover most of her face he raised one eyebrow at the bodies muttered something in his haitianaccented french and got to work the bodies were loaded and gone within fifteen minutes he took bell too now uncuffed from that corpse shot up with a load of tranquilizer and put into a crate youre not taking him back to the bar i asked you want me to carry an unconscious man past customers mila always seems to assume im brain dead ill stash bell where he cant be a problem and have a little chat with him a man with a family to consider he wants to keep a nice life he will work with us you go arrange travel to las vegas i waited until they left i watched the street to see if they were followed the cia had left me alone since id declined to return to the embrace of their employ although i thought it likely that they might be checking in on me i didnt see a sign that anyone was following mila and the truck i walked out onto the street i glanced at the faces of those near me and committed them to memory it was eight blocks to columbus circle the early evening breeze felt good against my face the night was oddly full of music from the buildings i passed i heard the soft tones of a mahler symphony the spice of cuban salsa a thunderous beat that drowned out hiphop lyrics music was something people living a normal life got to enjoy when your child is missing you live in a limbo a purgatory without clocks a room without windows without doors pitched into black and all you can do is fumble along in the darkness and hope you find the knob to the door or the sash of the window that is hope that you can throw an exit open let light flood back into your prison and standing there will be your child safe and sound i had no intention of staying in limbo i spotted the first tail boarding the subway one car down from me a sixtyish woman hair styled short dark glasses delicate blue earrings shed been standing on the corner down from mr bells building when i walked out looking away from me id walked at a good pace and shed kept up i stayed on the train so did she i got off at the next stop which was seventh avenue so did she and a moderate sized crowd of people i slowed forcing her to get ahead of me i had to figure she had at least one partner someone who would stay with me if she peeled off someone i hadnt seen when i exited the building the woman pushed slightly ahead of me by the crowd climbed the stairs to street level and she had to choose she went left with brisk heelclicking purpose i headed right i didnt look back to see if shed turned to follow me i didnt hurry i wanted to see if she would backtrack i also wanted to see who was sticking close to me i turned into a small convenience store and i browsed i bought a bottle of red wine a couple of apples and a wedge of cheddar cheese i took my time waiting to see what fly would stick in the honey seven other shoppers in the narrow aisles i glanced at their faces their profiles without them noticing one was familiar hed been on the subway with me late twenties a bit older than me dark hair wearing a yankees cap and a dark tshirt and a light jacket although itd been a warm day jackets change your appearance to the casual eye and theyre easy to ditch so are hats i paid for my purchases and i headed back toward the subway station i didnt look back but in the rearview of a parked car i saw the yankees cap coming behind me i ducked into a clothing store at the next corner at a distance he followed and in one of the mounted security mirrors i saw him enter the store i grabbed a brightly colored shirt that would have embarrassed a peacock off one of the racks and i asked the clerk where the changing room was she nodded toward the back and told me i couldnt take my grocery bag in with me like id planned to shoplift some ugly plaid i gave it to her to keep under the counter and i went into the changing area four saloonstyle doors a tailors stand with a triptych of mirrors i went inside one of the changing rooms and i waited if hed seen me come with just one shirt he might wait he might still think i hadnt spotted him at no point had i looked at him directly so i decided to really really consider the merits of this kaleidoscope of a shirt five minutes ten the clerk hadnt come back to check on me yet then i heard him i knew it was him because he gently pushed open one saloon door then another if he was just looking for a place to try on clothes he would have stopped with the first one if i was wrong i would apologize he pushed on the unfastened door to my cubicle and i seized his hand i levered him forward hard slammed him in the wall i smashed his face against the wall and he ooofed you got to love an oof then i cracked his head again i wrenched his arm hard against his shoulder blades checked the left ear empty right ear oh there it was like a tiny beige fleck of wax the earphones get smaller every year i reached down flicked off the lead for his mike under his shirt who sent you i asked he didnt answer special projects that was the secret cia branch i worked for they have trouble saying goodbye he didnt answer he tried to lever back and free his arm i kept my grip above his wrist on the cloth of his shirt i dont believe in giving multiple chances to cooperate i battered the juncture of neck and shoulder twice and he folded i took the mike the earplug and put them on switched them to live i searched his pockets there was a wallet that i left alone but a telescope palmsized i took it i put the unconscious shadow up on the small seat in the changing room he was breathing just fine gato respond he was being called i knew the voice so i answered in special projects code he did a fournine id heard him speak in the grocery the barest tinge of a boston accent when the cashier asked if he had coupons so i copied it it only had to be good enough and im a decent mimic fournine meant the subject had cut me loose in a crowd lucky respond now the speaker was calling the other agent i figured this was the older woman from the subway i looked around for her as i tossed the shirt i hadnt tried on back to the clerk and scooped up my bag of groceries i hurried back onto the street i dont have visual confirmation she said he did not return to subway station she had hung close to the subway to pick me up if i doubled back return to base the voice said well see if we can pick him on the traffic cameras yes please return to base i waited i had nothing more to contribute to class discussion as gato so i stayed quiet if the unconscious man was found an alarm might be raised and i had to hope that they were the only two on me normally a team of four would have been used either i didnt matter or resources were thinner than usual i didnt care about the reason this stopped now i melded into the constant stream of pedestrians on seventh and cast my gaze down the street with my palm curved around the telescope as though shading my eyes i caught the woman walking away from me back the way wed come she pushed back her hair and in the telescope i could see her blue earrings id noticed before i followed at a distance several blocks later along west th street i saw her approaching a parked van it advertised a floral delivery service i thought that was funny because its an old cia joke that langley does more to keep florists and chocolatiers in business because spouses get neglected and we have to make frequent apologies i dont have to worry about that any more i ran i caught up with her put my palm under her ribs and gently and rather gentlemanly i thought propelled her forward open the door i ordered she did she was smarter than gato she tapped on the van door three times and it opened my best friend sat on the other side august holdwine is a smart minnesota farm boy big broadshouldered cherubfaced with a blond burr of hair and ruddy cheeks and eyes of skypale blue i love him like family he frowned at me well you can wipe the cheshire cat smile off wheres my guy sleeping it off dont tell me you actually hurt him bruises heal hes okay and probably awake now he might be too embarrassed to check in i left him his cell phone call him you assaulted a cia officer and you used the names of your childhood pets for your team stupid i glanced at the woman lucky was the nice cat so august says get in the van sam he said lets talk that might be an illegal action you arent supposed to be operating on american soil go get yourself a coffee august holdwine said to the woman well talk later back at the office your earrings i said to her the blue is a shade too bright against the gray of the street and the buildings too memorable but they do set off your eyes dont be a punk she said and she turned and vanished into the river of people get in august said please that would be stupid if the point of following me is to grab me its not its to talk to you you could walk up and say hello not while youre with that woman mila he tossed his headphones on the computer keyboard in the back of the van no ones here august dont lie to me are you thinking im going to lead you to her but i needed to know why august and the cia were interested in mila i needed to know now so i got into the van august moved up into the drivers seat where to august said what about your guy he can find his way home where can we go and talk in private i know a bar amsterdam jack ming couldnt sleep he watched the clock tick toward midnight he remembered reading once that there were eighteen million cellular phones in the netherlands and it frustrated him that not a single one was within reach with one call he could be out of the hospital his bill settled safe under arms he should have asked ricki to leave him hers but her showing up had surprised him too much and shed left before hed thought to ask august that had been the muttered name of the kind cia officer whod grabbed him the one who stopped the others from beating him further that was the name he was going to use when he phoned the cia he would call and ask for august that was his ticket to safety to money to freedom ten minutes after ricki left van biezen reappeared in his doorway looking tired and rumpled looking ready to go home your story checked out about being grabbed from the cafe i thought you would want to know he raised an eyebrow to see if jack would speak am i going to be released now from the hospital or our protective custody both i cannot speak for the doctors but i think you should be careful these smugglers were apparently part of a much bigger criminal enterprise what do you mean on ten booms laptop we found evidence he had been hacking into police databases downloading classified documents relating to farranging investigations the sort of information that a criminal network would like to buy i know nothing about whatever this man was doing jack said and if you are going to question me further along these lines i would like to see someone from the embassy and i would like a lawyer i wasnt questioning you i was warning you these are dangerous people mr jin van biezens voice was measured and careful sleek as a diplomats just like his mother are you planning to return to hong kong i understand you have not given the doctors a clear answer just a bit of a sarcasm in his tone i havent decided i am already ruined for this semester i have much work to do he paused you said you were giving me a warning do you think im in danger we have kept a guard by your room hes not for show immediately after van biezen stepped out a polite functionary from the chinese embassy stepped in now that he was speaking to be sure that he was all right and that there was no issue of embarrassing the motherland with the police it was frightening to jack because he had no desire to be shipped off to hong kong and the fact that a bureaucrat was here so late at night made him nervous but his false identity held yes he said as jin ming his parents and his grandparents were dead he had no family back in china he had been careful to craft an identity without family the chinese diplomat was concerned for his wellbeing and jack reassured the man he was the innocent victim of a crime he thanked the embassy visitor and when the man had left jack stared at the window he wondered if his mother was looking for him he thought not she didnt want him he had been lucky too lucky and it was time to place a surer hand on the reins of his own fate he couldnt sleep he got up for a walk each day the doctors had encouraged jack to walk to stretch his leg muscles even if it was just around the floor for five tottering orbits ambling past rooms and equipment in the hallway his mind full of ricki and his rapidly unraveling situation he was walking back to his room and as he turned the final corner he saw from down the hallway a man he didnt know in an orderlys uniform enter his room his police guard was gone jack stopped the man looked short thickly built he shut jacks door behind him he knew the nightshift orderly he had seen him on the opposite side of the floor during his walk if ricki could steal a uniform he can see im not in the bed jack thought he must think im in the bathroom he ducked back behind the corner keeping one eye focused on the door after thirty seconds the man stepped into the hallway heavy eyebrows pale skin a soft mess of a mouth a bottom lip long ago disfigured in a fight youre a loose end jack thought and now either someone who knew nic or someone who knows novem soles has come looking for you they know youre alive theyve either waited for the guard to go to the bathroom or theyve paid the guard off they want to be sure you cant talk and if he was wrong then no harm done but if he was right the man saw jack the twisted lip smiled he raised the eyebrows as if in greeting like he was a friend come by to talk to jack jack ran or rather jack stumbled in a loping run he wasnt entirely recovered from the bullet that had grazed arteries and windpipe he wore a bathrobe and the hospital gown and flimsy slippers the nurses had given him he saw a stairway and he hit the door leaning out into the cool slightly stale air of the concrete staircase his mind moved as fast as it did when he was crafting a software program if the guy was here to silence jack he would expect jack to try and escape most immediate escape meant down toward the ground floor so jack headed up he wasnt used to physical exertion and little black clouds dotted his vision his breath sounded loud in the stairwell he hit the next floor opened the door stepped out into the unit more recovery rooms but this floor was less crowded he was on the opposite side of the floor from the main nurses station an old man in a brown bathrobe walked past him ambling with an insomniacs shuffle carting an iv feed on a wheeled pole jack moved in the other direction he had to hide get to a phone get ricki to come and pick him up at a nearby pub or cafe he couldnt stay out on the streets of amsterdam dressed like a patient even in the worlds most laidback city around midnight it would attract too much attention he looked like someone who might have wandered away from the hospital and needed help he opened the door of one room saw an elderly woman sleeping inside he eased it shut behind him he heard the stairwell door open with a steely crank as it did he stepped into another patient room this one holding two beds both empty he left the lights off an iv pole stood on duty by each bed a drawn curtain dangling between them he had no real place to hide he pulled the curtain partway between the beds and ducked behind its cover the iv pole clanking into the wall behind him next to him was one of the adjustable wheeled tables for patients to use while lying in bed he closed his hands around the cool steel of the pole he heard the door open maybe a nurse coming to see why he was trespassing in this room he couldnt see through the curtain he heard two footsteps and then silence the nurse wouldnt just stand there right he asked himself he was suddenly consumed by fear and certainty that this man was here to kill him jack pushed the patient table into the curtain the two bullets sang out cut through the fabric pounded into the wood the impact was louder than the firing jack moaned in fear without thinking that he was baiting a trap as the man stepped around the curtain jack swung the pole like a baseball bat and he caught the mans face between the bushy eyebrows and the tattered mouth uggghhhh the guy grunted jack rocked his feet swung again in the same vicious arc hit again and again and then there was an oddly wet noise that sounded final the guy collapsed onto the floor shuddered shook gasped he looked at jack with blind surprise then his head fell back and a sagging shift downwards trembled through his body the mans nose was a splintered mess jack had not known he had the strength it was as if all the energy hed stored in the past few weeks roared out of him when he needed it the man was very still jack knelt by him dropping the pole with a clank to the tiled floor he tested for a pulse found nothing but a warm and sudden silence in the mans throat bone shard jack thought first blow broke the nose second sent a bullet of bone into the brain he clapped his hands over his face in shock he had killed a man killed him because he was going to kill you jack picked up the gun and he stood he footed the body under the adjustable bed he picked up the gun and put it into the pocket of his robe he stepped back out into the hallway in the next room the old woman still slept he went through her bureau and he found ten euros and a mobile phone he took it feeling guilty about the theft and he laughed because he didnt feel guilty about killing the man he hurried out into the hallway and back down the stairwell in a few minutes he was in his room sitting on the edge of the bed who could he call ricki he could call her they were still friends he still kind of liked her even though shed only really been his girlfriend for five whole minutes after he arrived in holland after hed stepped into the secret life hed made for himself and clearly she cared about him to have gone to so much trouble to find him he cajoled her into coming and picking him up and bringing him clothes to the hospital the police had taken the clothes in which he had been shot as evidence and they were stained with blood anyway ricki agreed and said shed be there within an hour he told her to meet him at a coffee shop nearby that he knew well when he got off the phone he lifted a pair of jeans from a room down the hall where a man lay zonked out on painkillers and grabbed a rugby jersey from the mans closet he left sneaking past the nurses riding the elevator down stepping out into the cool quiet of the night there was an old cafe down on the corner he walked out into the street they found out youre still alive theyre coming after you youve got one weapon to fight back if nic was lying about that notebook youre a dead man midtown manhattan near bryant park we walked into the last minute my bar near bryant park the last minutes a nice bar elegant refined oriented toward jazz the bar itself is exquisite connemara marble the mirror behind the bar is huge and ancient a leftover from a new york establishment from before the civil war we get a bit of tourist trade any highend bar in new york does once good reviews land on yelp or on the guide sites but we get a lot of midtown office people bored wealthies regulars who actually know what goes into a proper oldfashioned or sazerac the postwork crowd had started to melt away eloise is at the piano softly playing a thelonious monk arrangement shes older than god but the sparks of jazz in her body are apparently going to keep her alive forever when id acquired the bar from mila a few weeks ago it had been called bluecut but id renamed it the last minute was my base of operations in searching for my son and it reflected my sense of urgency and my determination that i would never give up i nodded at the bartender and pointed at a stool for august he sat then i went back behind the bar to make our own drinks which is a statement in itself i knew i had to let go of some secrets right now to protect others august looked like what he is a minnesota farm boy of swedish and german descent he glanced around at the beautiful people at the elaborate decor at the shimmer of lights hed met me here for a drink a few weeks before and five minutes after he left mila showed up and gave me ownership of the last minute and of thirty other bars in cities around the world i hadnt told him because so far he didnt need to know but as i moved to the other side of the expanse of connemara marble he raised an eyebrow at me you bartending now i gestured openhanded at the charm and the glory the last minute is mine the bar is yours yeah he glanced around at the finery and absorbed the news well i was going to order a beer but if you own the joint then ill have a martini made with good gin all right i crafted his martini with all the care you would take for your best friend having his first cocktail in your new bar i slid a plymouth english gin martini in front of august two olives not the most expensive gin but really a strong choice for a martini august took a sip and nodded in approval i poured another one for myself lets go sit in a booth he said old banquettestyle leather booths lined one wall they provided a modicum of quiet august followed me to one why have you bought a bar he asked i need a livelihood to support my search for my son i said there was a lot more to the story but he didnt need to know how id come into possession of the last minute and its thirty sisters around the world milas bosses a group known as the round table who claimed to be a force for good in the shadows had offered me the bars as a cover to travel the world to track down my son and to do the odd job for them that required my skills you could have come back to work at the company they dont like to accuse you of treason and then backtrack by offering you gainful employment my past with the cia was a sore spot with him he almost cringed as i spoke to camouflage his embarrassment he glanced around the bar drinking it in as carefully as hed sipped his martini some spy he couldnt keep the surprise off his face really nice place sam so now you know where to find me why are you following me he twisted the toothpick holding the olives this woman mila who helped you fight novem soles in amsterdam i want to know about her theres nothing to know sam lets not insult each other fine i thought id play you followed us today mila too yes i had had an early dinner in a favorite old haunt of mine that must have been where augusts watchers had picked me up then mila and i had met in central park then gone to the apartment address bell gave us she hadnt been here at the last minute in weeks and shed left with bertrand and with her cap and sunglasses and moving van uniform the followers must not have spotted her leaving else they would have followed her not me why i want to know who she is stop following her and ask her im not going to kidnap her off the street because the cia isnt supposed to operate on american soil and yet here you are tailing people i guess i should be grateful you havent set the fbi on me august took an appreciative sip of the martini i dont need to kidnap her when i think youll tell me what i want to know i slid the olives off the stick with my mouth and dropped the toothpick next to my glass mouth full i said cant talk youve really picked your side havent you sam youve picked this mila i can rely on her i told you we would help you find your kid i told you i would handle it myself because you think you still have enemies in the special projects branch yes who would use my kid against me youre paranoid you get to be after you get framed for treason august he took another sip of his drink youre trying to find the woman who took daniel no luck yet im betting youre close august go home let me get my kid back have you made progress can we help you i trust you but if you tracked my kid and theres another traitor inside the company working for novem soles then well maybe my kid is dead right now they dont know what im doing and i have to keep it that way i get him back thats all i care about im not in the revenge business we dont even know what novem soles is he said some of the thinkers at the cia are arguing that novem soles actually stands for nothing special they could just have been a few guys who decided to make some cash committing corporate espionage and smuggling weapons they got a gang of lowlevel thugs to tattoo themselves and talk like they were part of a big deal and maybe its all just a grand illusion i dont think so i said i think theyre big i think youre right my hope is that mila could tell me exactly what and who they are if she knew that theyd all be dead im glad mila and i are on the same page then what were the two of you doing today up on the upper west side meals on wheels august tapped a finger against the base of the martini glass look i want daniel back for you more than anything sam but you cant grab him back and just let these people roll on i am going to do whats best for my kid and me i gestured toward his martini i want out august i want a normal life again they took it from me and im going to get it back and what run a bar yes sam you did us and the nation a good turn here in new york you sound like an award plaque he ignored my sarcasm i wont ever forget it but ive had to argue repeatedly not to pull you back in ive protected you because were friends i did it because i know you want it this way but novem soles is much much bigger than you im running a task force in special projects on finding information about this network what they want who they are he turned the martini glass theyre something new different i would expect a terrorist group to try to do a mass assassination but not a criminal group whats the profit in it for them who are they why are they doing what theyre doing it makes no obvious sense good luck so let me help you well find them together i let the piano music wash over me for a moment a few weeks ago i saw a redacted document from a company file it claimed that i could be controlled through my son inside the company august on your side of the fence im not exactly looking for help he said where did you get this document it doesnt matter well ive certainly never seen it sam and documents can be forged this wasnt because its true i can be controlled through my son which is why i and i alone am going to get him back youre not alone there is mila theres no record of her in any government database we can find her name is mila right so the only reason you are following me is to find her yes then youre wasting your time i dont know where she is now or where she lives im sorry would you like another martini before you go no thank you i saw her i think in the internet cafe in amsterdam when we grabbed that chinese hacker that was tied to novem soles i showed her picture to some people in europe who provide us with information now and then at a cost well if i wasnt with her i couldnt say if you saw her or not i risked a smile the scene was vivid in my head id tried to infiltrate a criminal ring in amsterdam and the chinese hacker was some poor college kid theyd used to research my forged canadian identity and had gotten caught by august the hacker had died in a shootout later that day where most of the ring died as well and id barely escaped with my own life mila had been watching me from the same internet cafe across the canal youre scraping the bottom of the barrel august said she does not have a nice reputation i said nothing theres a price on her head did you know that august delivered this with the kind tone of a friend breaking bad news a cool million dollars for your mila preferably alive the words hung in the air i distantly heard the trill of piano jazz the clink of the crystal a drunken bray of laughter from a guy whod had a pint too many i mean you can have someone killed rather cheaply these days under ten thousand theres been a price deflation on hits what with the economic downturns but a million on her head sam august gave out an amused whistle thats trouble some very bad people are looking for her to collect that payday i wonder what she did thats worth a million dollars maybe he already knew he had been my one true friend in the cia and until he proved otherwise i had to consider him a friend one of the waitresses passed i pointed at augusts martini and raised two fingers augusts brain needed picking we could protect her sam in exchange well find out who has the contract on her and well make it go away once again i said nothing i couldnt negotiate on milas behalf someone must truly truly hate her it did not surprise me makes you wonder who shes pissed off who put out the hit we picked it up on chatter online he leaned forward youre welcome youre not helping me sam she can tell us what we need to know clearly shes connected to movers and shakers she armed you she financed you she got you into the netherlands and into the uk and into the united states with no trace of entry she helped you get inside a major criminal ring that was planning the biggest assassination plot in american history he shook his head we want to know who she works for and what she knows about novem soles sam give her to me you have a very vivid imagination maybe i did all that hard work not on your own you didnt have the resources the money you following me today is no different than when you had me living in brooklyn waiting to see if someone from novem soles tried to kill me or grab me i dont work for you august i quit the company so you worry about your projects and let me worry about mine let me talk to mila sam please we can help each other im not going to repay any help ive gotten from her by handing her over to you for interrogation if she wants to talk to you she will the silence between us felt like one youd find at a poker table when the cards still hold every possibility and the only measure you take is in your opponents face i dont want to play hardball with you august you dont even know where the hardball court is located now youve learned you cant follow me and youve had your most excellent drinks i stood i have to go tend to my business i find it fascinating that you now own a bar whered you get the money good night august who are you working for sam what have you gotten yourself into hanging with a woman who has a milliondollar bounty on her head you and i both know that only happens when you get down and dirty with the very worst im going to find my son no matter what it takes remember that he was silent staring at his martini glass i know he wanted to help me he was my friend but he couldnt you said you wanted your life back if that means working for special projects again and it should then have your lady friend talk to me tell me whos been helping you give us them and get what you had back the company showed me zero loyalty in my hour of need august let me guess youll run straight to them and tell them i own this bar now although its none of their business and i want them to leave me alone he sat silent for ten long seconds i dont need to tell them your business you may not think it sam but ive always been your friend he looked more angry than hurt and i knew he wasnt playing me he stared at me in the crazy hours right after you were accused of killing everyone in london special projects i thought do i know him do i really know him could what they say be right you could have fooled me could have fooled everyone else you could have been the worst murderer and traitor in cia history but then i thought no if he killed them he wouldnt have been so stupid about it to be there when the bomb blew he would have vanished because sam is not stupid sam always does a calculatedly good job i missed august hated to admit it but i did i wanted to trust him but i couldnt trust special projects not after what theyd done to me a compliment thanks i can encourage mila to talk to you but i dont know where to find her and thats the truth getting your kid back thats huge to me but im going to find mila sam with or without your help and if you get in my way the friendship does not trump my duty he folded his heavy arms august played college football at minnesota and hes a lot bigger than me more pure muscle i am smaller and faster and a little less naive the worst enemy is a onetime friend i knew that im not your enemy sam and i wont be unless you choose to be mine his word choice made me feel like hed read my mind he picked up the martini finished it with a toss its too warm now its no good things dont stay good he said and i knew something had happened i hope you get daniel back safe and sound you know i hope that more than anything else sam i know i used to fight with my brother danny and the awkward awful silence between us felt like the one now between me and august a bitterness that could be sweetened with a word but neither of us was willing to add that ingredient he turned and he walked out and i turned to go upstairs to pack for las vegas the round table had a private jet i could use and i wasnt waiting a moment longer i would head for vegas tonight amsterdam jack and ricki had met under less than auspicious circumstances she appeared in a hackers chat room when he was still in new york city looking to trade piracy software for counterfeit dvds jack didnt think film piracy was really very cool he knew it was theft but in her postings ricki was funny and charming and she was dutch and so he thought she was hot no one on the hacker discussion group knew he was jack ming the guy the new york police wanted to bring in for questioning i got to run and hide my parents are so uncool hed written come and hide in holland she wrote in answer so he had just on impulse and he and ricki had met for coffee in delft after he arrived on a fake passport a friend back in new york helped him get instead of the dainty dutch girl he imagined ricki was half a head taller than him and an immigrant from senegal she was funny smart pretty and oddly tough he was thoroughly overwhelmed and intimidated by her he didnt know what to say their coffee dates became fewer he figured she was disappointed in him he was a geek on the run and he kept too much hidden in himself for her taste how unappealing was that the hacker community tended toward what jack thought of as a distant tightness they stayed close online but they didnt hang out much in real life a person who was socially nimble behind the cocoon of a screen could be one who consistently missed normal interaction cues in a cafe or a pub ricki was one such individual she arrived at the coffee shop thirty minutes late stuck a wad of cash into one hand and a bag of cheap clothes into his other hand and said you owe me whered you get the clothes all the stores are closed she shrugged old boyfriend before you left them behind but i think they should fit youre about the same size he tried to ignore the stab of jealousy he felt yes i know im going to owe you more i need a place to stay just for tonight please ricki rolled her blacklined eyes now youve decided to talk just one night he glanced in the bag the clothes were a lot more colorful and stylish than he would have selected what kind of trouble are you in nothing major i just need a place to crash do the police know youve checked yourself out of hospital information was currency look ill write a program for you a trojan thatll send you back information from the infected computer could be valuable ricki touched the corner of her mouth with her tongue please be greedy jack thought please you dont need to bribe me to help you jack she looked wounded i took a huge risk to find you oh he said no i didnt mean i didnt mean that i was going to give it to you as a gift for helping me his voice trailed off she sighed so smart so clueless buy me a coffee with the money i brought you and well go back to my place im just glad youre okay you are duh no ive often wished you dead honestly you are dumb as a rock but ricki smiled at him a short sweet flick of a smile and it nearly made him cry he was so happy to see a friendly face he changed clothes in the tiny bathroom of the cafe he bought her a coffee to go he wanted to put as much distance between him and the hospital as possible he felt hed nearly gone insane waiting for her the first thing he thought when he saw her apartment was blink and wonder where she actually lived because there was hardly space for her in the rooms when theyd dated months ago shed never let him come to her place she was in amsterdam he lived in delft and she came to see him not the other way around the apartment was small one entire wall was full of bookshelves each holding at least two dozen dvd burners on the opposite side of the wall he saw neatly packaged dvds mostly of films currently playing in theaters hundreds of them he started doing the math in his head its probably about fifty thousand dollars worth she said wow and you sell these on the street she had not really talked much about her work i used to thats how i came here from senegal the counterfeiters start you off selling on the streets i sold dvds better than anyone i got promoted now i have a street team dont you get caught not me she laughed the machines whirred all creating illicit product machines began to beep completing their copying and she started to pull the finished discs from the machines she tossed him a tshirt from a freshly opened box for a new vampire film that wasnt out for another three months with a still shot of the main characters at a critical moment silkscreened on its chest so you got shot and had a vacation courtesy of the police she said she glanced at the raw scar on his neck he would jack thought need a scarf the thought of wearing the vampire shirt while having a healing neck wound nearly made him laugh yes youre a dangerous boy now jack she touched the skin below his scar who shot you excitement brightened her dark eyes i was in the wrong place at the wrong time excuse the cliche in my case its apt nic was shot to death she said it was in the news yes when you were shot no before he was dead before i got there well that wasnt in the papers her voice rose why not because it wasnt why her voice sounded accusatory because i suppose the police were protecting me and what now theyre not now theyre not he weighed his choices he had few i killed a man there tonight ricki she laughed then she didnt she sat and stared at him he fought down a surge of shivers maybe some tea he asked yes but decaf you dont need any more stimulation you wont sleep at all tonight she got up and microwaved two cups of water and stuck a decaf english breakfast teabag in each cup he watched the steam curl and stayed silent while he let her process his confession she produced a bottle of brandy from her cupboard and raised eyebrows at him and he nodded ricki dosed both cups he thought she might keep quiet she would never go to the police not at all but now he had to win her sympathy to earn her continued help she came looking for you he told himself she must want to help you at least until she finds out how dangerous this could be the man was sent to kill me i have to vanish for a while im not so scared of the cops but the cops cant protect me and im not going to jail they wont let people like you and me have a computer in jail ever she folded her arms as though his dire prediction made her cold she was immediately weighing her options he could tell she wasnt easily given to shock will you help me he asked who wants you dead nic got me involved he did work with a group called novem soles or nine suns she shook her head what theyre catholic computer hackers uh no theyre afraid i might know more than they think i do im a loose end im a mouth that could talk do you really know anything that could hurt them no he said it wasnt exactly a lie the notebook nics selfdescribed nuclear weapon there was no point in mentioning it to ricki the less she knew the safer she was so what you run for the rest of your life this guy you killed it was selfdefense right her voice rose slightly you wont be able to finish school i was kind of bored with school you and me were not suited to day jobs she gave him a shy smile and sipped her tea so you run and to begin with i equip you well if you can ill pay of course what do you need a laptop i need to be able to transfer my money to a new account i need to get documentation so i can get out of the country under a new name and i know somebody who might be able to hide me from these guys and i need a way to contact him without him finding me after i give him a call i want to see him on my own terms i can spare you a laptop a yearold macbook pro with the latest operating system i have an anonymiser program on it that can shield you from being easily traced is that good enough thank you to hackers laptops were like racehorses they always preferred the most muscle a yearold computer was an antique to jack he routinely bought a new system every six months but it would do ricki tapped her lip a passport and credit cards i know a guy in brussels who works wonders but hes not cheap he can probably have you a passport in three days another day to overnight it all right your money i can ask a guy in russia he moves a lot of funds for me but i cant promise could you just withdraw all the cash yes but id prefer to keep it electronic less likely to lose it he did not want to add that he didnt care to keep tens of thousands of euros hed earned hacking for nics criminal ring about his person he wanted the money moved cleanly hidden where he could reach it under a new name and where he wouldnt have to worry about customs or the police freezing his accounts if they figured out jin ming was a lie he was a potential murderer in their eyes now everything had changed he needed to keep as many of his secrets close to him as he could okay this guy you need to contact he doesnt want to be found he is part of a bureaucracy that can hide me government yes dutch no american ricki stared you want me to penetrate a toplevel american government network did you go to a smoke bar after you left the hospital no ill do it but if i run into a wall i will want your expertise flattery was the most potent currency in the hacker world that and respect acknowledgment of skills she didnt smile until shed lifted the tea cup and she thought jack couldnt see her grin i thought you might have some programs to help me chisel my way in i might you hungry yes very i can cook some pasta open some wine oh i didnt think about giving you more alcohol are you on meds i would very much like a glass of wine and no i have no meds now that would be a challenge she said get an online pharmacy to send you what you need without placing an actual order she laughed and so did he and for a moment the memory that he had killed a man albeit an assassin edged from the center of his thoughts he was always happier when he had a problem with which to play is that all you need yes he said but it was a lie he knew where nic lived and nic being dead and the police would have had all his computers confiscated since he was a known con artist and trader in online filth so had the police found the notebook and taken it surely that would be news if a murdered mans notebook could blow open an international crime ring but the police could keep the discovery silent the same way theyd shielded his name and location while he recovered ricki brought him wine and sat down next to him close to him she smiled at him warmly was surviving a shooting was that sexy hed avoided most girls at delft because he didnt want to risk blowing his cover story girls always wanted to know about you to delve into secrets but ricki had secrets of her own she might not ask too many more questions they drank the wine and before he knew it before he could analyse it hed taken her wine glass and set it on the coffee table and he was kissing her warm mouth she kissed him back he was alive hed forgotten how good it could feel so he did all the things necessary for living he kissed her he laughed with her they ate dinner they made love then they lay in bed and watched a movie shed stolen from a studios laptop a film that wasnt hitting theaters for another three weeks when she fell asleep and the movie was over jack began to think he needed a way to figure out where nic would hide his most potent and powerful secret of all and he would have to start by breaking into nics house tomorrow morning las vegas i hit the ground wrong i rolled too sharply and felt a pull in my shoulder i stopped and the early morning desert sky loomed above me back in my london days i ran parkour extreme running where you vault up walls and use handholds and drop from heights without breaking bones hopefully it had been my release from the tension of work exploring abandoned spaces turning walls into roads using precision to power through a space in a more efficient way but i was out of practice when your child is missing you dont really want to take the time for exercise id arrived around midnight las vegas time last night and couldnt sleep too wound with excitement and tension today was a waiting game with the rest of the day to kill before anna tremaine arrived for our meeting so id gotten up early to try my luck against gravity it was am and the quietest hour in vegas and no one around to see me run id decided to run through an unfinished building not far from my bar the last thing i needed to do before capturing anna and i had every intention of taking her prisoner was to hurt myself so i wouldnt be at peak condition but the parkour helped my head when i had to plan a run a vault a leap that i could barely make only then i didnt think of daniel then i didnt think of lucy distraction is a sure way to break a leg or an arm i got up dusted off my butt looked at the wall before me five feet high beyond its rim was air i was tired of the walls around me the false ones in the shapes of threats and violence i wanted my son back that was the only wall to conquer i ran at the wall did a saut de chat jump of the cat i went head first my hands landed on the walls top surface my legs powered past my arms as i flew from the wall i landed fair and kept running i hadnt had a clean run since the bombing when my wife was taken from me before my eyes in a london street and i did a parkour run through a remodeled building bombdamaged scaffolding collapsing around me running like i never had before to keep her in my sight to not lose her but of course i did lose her and in a worse way than if she had been kidnapped and killed i vaulted up a narrow staircase in the unfinished motel bouncing off the walls feeling the sweat explode from my skin burning off the too many drinks of the middle of the night the worry about daniel the stress over whether i might be arrested or grabbed by augusts team to force me to tell them more about mila and the round table i reached the roof and the desert early morning sun shone on me las vegas even at its edges is never entirely hushed i wished there were neighboring roofs i used to run the council housing projects in london and on a roof i felt like i had wings i ran in a circle here staying warm building up my power stopping only to study the balconies jutting off the side of the building wondering if i could navigate the seven stories in a series of controlled jumps and drops from balcony to balcony who needs stairs dropping from balcony to balcony might attract attention the police are rarely parkour fans i studied the line of movement it would take to do the balcony drops part of my mind said too risky but another part wanted to feel like id pushed myself like i was testing myself for the final stretch of confronting anna tremaine and getting my son back i wanted to be sure i still had my nerve my daring drop roll vault drop again roll i played the run in my head i dropped down to the first balcony and from the edge of my eye i saw the car on the facing road brake to a halt i should have checked first id needed to be sure that i didnt have a witness someone who might call on the crazy guy doing the balcony surfing i stood up from the balcony the road near the unfinished motel was empty except for the one car stopped at a light at a deserted intersection okay i thought not me it stopped for a light a green light i could see the double glint of binoculars past the window i dropped back out of sight waited i heard the purr of the cars engine moving i glanced over the edge i could see the driver below a sleeve of purple jacket a snug knit hat pulled tight over the head the car sped away maybe he just stopped because he saw you jump thats it yes thats all but the run was ruined for me i dropped down the rest of the balconies and ran back to my car mila would be here this afternoon and then anna tremaine and by tonight i hoped i would have my son back amsterdam the doorknob to nics apartment turned under his hand unlocked but jack stood and knocked for the fourth time his heart hammering in his chest if nic had a woman or a roommate still living here that person was also likely connected to novem soles but he had to know and he couldnt wait the police were looking for him the dead man had been discovered at the hospital the papers carried a picture of both jacks face and one of the man hed killed the online news site had the most uptodate information and by noon amsterdam time the police had released the mans identity a czech immigrant named davel who had an arrest record a meter long mostly as a rented enforcer for eastern europeans who were muscling into illegal activities in the west a hired thug sent to kill jack and hed ruined jacks plan to slip out of sight jack remembered hollywood blockbusters about a man on the run being on the run could look like a bit of a lark you could always outpace and outthink the pursuers it was not fun jack was sick with the thought that even walking on the street he would be seen noticed made for the man on the front page of the paper he pushed the door open and called out hello no answer the apartment was small and not tidy old newspapers sat stacked unread on a coffee table he could smell spilled lager a muted television played in the corner offering news of the world ignored he had the gun hed taken from his assassin in his pocket he stepped down the hallway to where a door was half closed and inside the room lay an old woman she slept a vodka bottle clasped loosely in her hands her pose could have been a poster highlighting the blight of alcohol he glanced at the label very cheap vodka the kind the university kids with no money drank and the room smelled as though she didnt invest much in soap either she looked like a female fragmented version of nic strands of red in the graying hair short stocky a fleshy mouth nic lived with his mother at his age jack couldnt imagine of course jacks mother didnt want him around he stepped out and made sure the rest of the apartment was empty he guessed a back bedroom had been nics large desks with a slight settling of dust with clean spots where computers and monitors had likely sat naturally the police had taken all of nics gear it was evidence he was a hacker and a scumball and hed been murdered he searched the rest of the room nothing electronic remained he saw no papers no records the room had been picked clean except for nics computer books no sign of a notebook he didnt even know how big it was which could affect where it was hidden he checked the room a final time being extra careful and then went back to the old womans bedroom she was snoring now he sat on the edge of the bed and shook her awake he thought she would scream in horror at a stranger in her room her eyes stared at him muddled then widened in fear who get away from me i wont hurt you im a friend of nics friend of nics she spat at him made her face a scowl i am he gave me a job she stared at him get out of my house he pointed to the healing wound on his neck the people who killed your son did that to me i want to make them pay he tried to smile what did you say in a situation like this i am his friend i promise you his friends got him killed and now the police they say all these lies about my nic that he did terrible things mrs ten boom please let me help you he got up and jetted water into a clean glass and brought it to her she drank it down and then she glanced at the vodka bottle uncertain he poured a tiny bit into the glass she took a tiny sip as though embarrassed and then looked at him with sullen eyes ill leave you alone jack said but i know of a way to get back at the people who hurt nic like avenging nic was his motive lying to a grieving mother gosh he was so proud of himself these days a slow throb of headache began to pulse in his temples he looked at the vodka glass instead of her which was fine as she was looking at the vodka as well how nic was researching the bad people who led him astray he learned their secrets i helped him a bit but i dont know where he would have hidden the information he kept everything on computers i dont even know how to work one i dont like them she flapped her hands as if computers were gnats floating near her face her voice turned a bit petulant its a notebook with printouts in it from the computer where would he keep it her gaze went sly how do i know youre not a cop or one of the people who hurt nic if i was a cop id arrest you and take you down to the station jack said if i was your enemy i would not pour you vodka you waited a long time to come the people who shot me killed nic he said i just got out of the hospital you see the news last night yes she blinked at him and then sipped the vodka as though it would sharpen her recollections rather than dull them and maybe jack thought they would yes i remember you nics friend at the coffee shop the smart boy from hong kong yes maam yes all right give me some more he dribbled more vodka into the glass feeling guilty with each chug of the clear liquid no vodka like morning vodka he thought she drank it down wiped her mouth with an agespotted hand i cant help you the police came they took all the computers they said there were dirty pictures on them and they said nicky had hacked into the polices own computers she threw up her hands hes dead no one cares about his reputation any more except me well i do do you remember him having a notebook maybe one that he would have hidden she blinked considered drank more of the vodka these seemed new questions to her jack thought ones the police hadnt asked he poured another few fingers of vodka into the glass this notebook will protect you and it will protect me think but you know him and his computers he did everything on them she blinked again slurped more of her poison but he asked me to go to the store just this once and buy a red notebook and tape something he needed for writing and photos we didnt have any photo albums not after nics father left i dont like them a few photos still dotted nics room but jack noticed he hadnt seen any in this room or the outer room a lot of painful history in this apartment he thought that he understood so nic asked you to buy a notebook for him yes a big one and it was red can you tell me where it is no jack thought his patience would explode and scatter his brains around the bedroom he took a calming breath she was old drunk grieving and she was his only hope did the police search the entire apartment yes did they give you a list of what they took she considered this yes they did where is it i dont know and then a rare neuron fired i signed it on the kitchen table jack got up and shuffled among the debris on the table found it a list from the amsterdam police department offering an inventory of what they had seized four laptops two desktop computers financial files cell phones jack wondered if any record there would lead back to him it made him feel as though time were moving faster he felt feverish but there was no mention of a notebook the police hadnt taken it i have to know where that notebook is he tried to keep the panic out of his voice she had followed him out of the bedroom i dont know you dont have any money do you or income now that nic is dead it was a brutal truth she didnt look at him nic made so much i didnt have to work because corporate espionage spamming and porn paid so well jack pitied her if he sold the notebook he would have to make sure she got some of the money think where would nic have hidden the thing that mattered to him most did he have a storage unit another apartment anywhere no no they said he did videos jack had to tear the words out of his mouth um illegal ones did he have a place where he might have filmed them she bit her lip and he could see that if shed known about her sons horrible activities shed chosen to ignore them she sat down mrs ten boom please he told me he had stopped doing that her lips tightened into a line he promised me where he had an apartment he paid cash for it i think under a different name do you know where it is well he never took me there she said with some indignation but once long ago i followed him he told me hed quit i wanted to be sure it was like an addiction you see the irony seemed lost on her so i followed him and i saw another man bring three teenage girls to his door she blinked i came home and i had a drink and she left the sentence unfinished but he could guess that painful moment would have been when her drinking started in earnest he said nothing for a long minute hed thought this woman a stupid old drunk and now he had an idea of what the knowledge of her sons crimes had done to her he was my baby every person who does wrong in this world they were once someones baby full of hope and promise he was so smart where did i go wrong where did i bend him the wrong way nothing he did is your fault jack said trust me on this one she heaved a deep sigh and it seemed to take an effort to tear the words out of her chest i can take you there she got up and went to the kitchen drawer she pulled it free and turned it over under it was a key taped into place this is it she said this is the only one weve got jack was afraid to take the bus or the train with his face in the days papers so hed borrowed rickis little car he was such a smart boy like his father nic was always good at math i was terrible at numbers he got fired from his computer jobs though he was smarter than his bosses they didnt like him jack didnt respond to this hollow praise he turned into a parking lot down from a series of apartment complexes the neighborhood was bad and graffiti in a halfdozen languages marred the walls jack felt sick nic traded filth jack didnt want to be here if hed known this about nic he never would have worked with him but what was done was done and so now he had to see this through the address was an apartment in a section of de pijp that retained the original gritty feel of the neighborhood untouched by the gentrification that had pervaded this part of amsterdam in recent years the halls were clean but they smelled of cigarette smoke and a heavy delicious scent of turkish food cooking jack and mrs ten boom walked up the stairs and found the door jack slid the key in and unlocked it and stepped inside mrs ten boom following him a slight humming noise coming from her throat she was afraid of what they might see here jack did a quick survey of the small cluttered apartment in the kitchen were bottles of whisky and cans of soda and bags of candy lures or bribes the apartment made his skin itch with distaste he poured mrs ten boom a generous shot of whisky and turned on the tv to distract her it was hooked up to a dvd player and a childrens show was already loaded bright colored dancing flowers and music jack thought he would vomit he quickly switched the television to a news network here mrs ten boom have a seat best if he searched alone he thought jack began a methodical search of the apartment he started in the bedroom going through every lining of clothing every container in the closet every box under the bed nic had weapons hidden in this place a mm glock a beretta pistol a hunting knife with a wicked looking edge jack put those in a separate box he tore apart the mattress dismantled the bed pulled the headboard free in the bedroom closet was a set of expensive camera gear he searched through the equipment bags nothing he tore up the carpet nothing a bubble of panic rose in his chest he finished in the bedroom he went into the bathroom searched every inch he found a thousand euros hidden in a large plastic aspirin bottle he went and pushed the cash into mrs ten booms hands she stared at it in surprise then put it in her pocket he went into the kitchen there wasnt much food inside the refrigerator bottles of beer sandwich meat cheese furred with mold jar of mustard he closed the door on the rising smell then he pulled the refrigerator out from the wall a layer of dust and grit lay on the floor he began to search the cabinets and the drawers removing dish towels boxes of sugary cereal bottles of hard liquor nothing he pulled up the tatty lining paper to see if anything was hidden underneath zero luck when the cabinets were empty he inspected them tapping on them the top cabinet sounded different he tapped again then he stepped down and found a knife and worked it against the corner of the wood it gave slightly he stuck the knife in and the wood folded back there was a hidden hinge wedged in the space was a red book large with a moleskin cover and an elastic band to keep it closed he pulled the red notebook free he sat down on the kitchen floor and flipped through the pages in the den he could hear mrs ten boom dribbling more whisky into her glass moaning a soft keening of grief the first few pages were numbers just numbers in two columns maybe a code or maybe passwords or maybe account numbers they were written in a neat spare hand as though they had been carefully copied he flipped to where the columns of numbers stopped next page was a photo a lean whippet of a man hed never seen before older caucasian in a gray suit walking with another man and a woman the woman was asian striking in her twenties the other man was tall heavyset black also in a fine looking suit scowling behind them was a rather grand house with a huge porch and columns with a curving driveway in its front he had no idea who these people were were these three of the nine suns he realized he didnt know if nine suns referred to nine specific people or if it were simply a dumb code name written below the picture in the same precise handwriting first day at the nursery the nursery but there were no children in the picture he flipped through the rest of the book it seemed that nic had printed out an image from the computer screen capture and just taped it into the book the red notebook was fat with paper he studied photos of people sometimes what appeared to be family photos or people in meetings talking together in a range of settings street plazas sidewalks office buildings he did not recognize any of the faces next were printouts of what appeared to be emails and transcriptions of phone conversations ones where secret illegal deals were struck between competitive companies where bribes were subtly offered where threats were made the email addresses included government offices in the us across europe and in japan and brazil across africa and some of the worlds most powerful corporations it was like a jigsaw of highpowered whitecollar crime many pieces and jack couldnt see how they all fit together then a series of photos that looked like passport pictures a dozen people and in the top left of each photo a small notation eliminated and a date people that novem soles had killed he flipped through the photos he didnt know who any of the people were there were no identifiers spreadsheets partial with items bought and prices paid office rental in london purchase of c for london bomb bribes to police inspector in oslo jacks stomach churned this is what his hidden programs had plucked for nic financial information that could gut or elevate markets corporate secrets a money trail of death leverage for blackmail if this was how novem soles was going to control people in key positions and these were the people they used as levers then one could deduce what their intentions and their targets were and what their next major plot would be he read through the mass of stolen gems but no pattern formed maybe this was simply a way to control people in powerful positions who had troublesome secrets and could be manipulated other pages were filled with code with more numbers that meant nothing to him but here was his shield here was his sword if he could not make full sense of it then he knew who could he found a landline phone in the apartment he picked it up and was relieved to hear a dial tone it hadnt yet been disconnected he unplugged the phone and plugged its cord into the macbook pro that ricki had loaned him he activated a cheap throwaway dialup account getting through to the cia would not be easy he would have to write a vivid note that would seize their attention past all the cranks and weirdos who saw a conspiracy in every shadow and emailed their theories to the agency he needed to jump to the front of the line of incoming emails on the cias website he found a standard email form for people to share information or comments with the agency he typed in the message page i have critical information for a cia officer named august who was in amsterdam several weeks ago i offer serious actionable dirt on the group called novem soles this offer is only good for three days he entered in a prepaid cell phone number hed bought after leaving rickis apartment he did not sign his name he reread the message if he got too specific august might figure out who he was this was tantalizing enough he decided he would talk to august and only august august had kept him from being hurt worse august had argued to leave him in the van safe from danger he pressed send he stood closed the laptop mrs ten boom we should go no nic will be here soon wont he she was drunk again a crooked smile back on her face shed refilled from one of the whisky bottles nic will be here soon oh god jack thought he couldnt leave her but now that hed contacted the cia he had to move quickly he couldnt be anchored with the old drunk woman but he couldnt leave her here either in the horrible place of her sons worst crimes lets go back to your place mrs ten boom she hit on the whisky bottle again and she lay down on the couch i want to stay here please he stood watching her and then he said goodbye thanks for your help she was asleep holding onto the last shred of her son jack ming stumbled down the darkened stairs clutching the most important book in the world to his chest nolita manhattan august holdwine took the subway to nolita the neighborhood north of little italy he walked under the bright morning sky the safe house sat above a clothing boutique off mott street he went inside and in the kitchen he found his trackers waiting for him the guy who sam had manhandled sat at the wooden table sourly drinking a caffe latte ignoring cuban pastries theyd picked up from augusts favorite neighborhood cafe instead of eating he pecked on a laptop keyboard writing up a report on how you got played last night august asked a complaint against you for not taking sam capra into custody after he attacked me be smarter next time august said email that to me and my supervisor if you must but why dont you think about it some more you should have grabbed him the tracker said we got you breakfast by the way did you spit in it thought about it thought youd make him come back here and talk detention hasnt much worked with him in the past august said so finding this mila woman what do we do now the woman tracker asked august considered that thought had kept him awake much of the night he was charged with finding mila but what if despite sams protestations this mila was helping sam find his son was he going to interfere with that duty and friendship were often uneasy partners but duty had to come first didnt it his phone rang he answered and listened and hung up then he went upstairs to a makeshift office and locked the doors then he called the cia headquarters back we have a phonein langley had told him on his secured phone asking specifically for you to call him at this number its an amsterdam exchange prepaid phone no record of owner that only meant the phone had been purchased in amsterdam the caller could be anywhere it rang nine times nine novem did that mean something then a male voice came onto the phone hello the tracking would begin immediately august thought the phone was connected to a laptop showing on its screen a map of the world numbers began to flash across the top as the software traced the callers location yes my name is august i understand youve been trying to reach me yes i have male american no discernible regional accent about a subject of mutual interest oh my god you sound like a bad movie the voice said young august thought younger than me novem soles youre one of the guys looking for them arent you a slight shaking in the voice yes well i can give novem soles to you how i have information for sale information for sale august repeated he would be repeating much of what the caller said it was a standard ploy to extend the call simplify the trace the price is ten million dollars i cant pay that amount the laptop screens map trimmed down where the call was originating from europe then western europe theyve got their fingers and reach into governments around the world i think i am giving you a bargain lets say i agree to the price what are your terms i will deliver the information to you and you will place the funds in a numbered account in the caymans i want immunity from prosecution for any crimes i may have committed then the cia gives me a new identity i want sanctuary where they can

what the proof is i have the proof what is it names locations operations its a notebook a notebook full of details on the people in government and business that novem soles owns scan the pages and email it to me the call searcher narrowed the netherlandsbelgium luxembourg glowed bright green on the map and once ive done that then you have the proof august and im left out in the cold without

buy my safety and my future ill meet you in new york in two days where and when exactly in new york ill let you know the line went dead august sat and studied the laptop readout the call had come from amsterdam the city where sam had wrecked the novem soles plot novem soles in english the nine suns the name for the criminal syndicate that had been behind the london bombing that had branded sam capra a traitor their reach was unknown but they had coopted at least one high government official in the united states and had attempted to deliver a shattering blow to american society their ambitions sam had claimed were limitless a criminal organization not terrorist in its ideology but one that had tried to destroy a cia office and wreak political havoc in the united states what kind of criminals were these he had no answer the entire novem soles cell in amsterdam had been killed the only survivor was lucy capra caught in that comatose netherworld between life and death lucy knew some of the secrets of the group but she was beyond helping him august replayed his recording of the conversation who was this guy he wondered he kept using my name like it was a point of pride that he knew it he said i was a nice guy have i met him before i thought i knew the voice but now he wasnt sure sam capra might be paranoid about how deeply the criminal networks claws reached into the government but august holdwine was not he dialed his bosss number he had to report the offer but he knew what the bureaucratic response would be why pay off an informant when you could fold him under your wing and keep him shuttered up until he was ready to talk for free miami florida fourteen minutes and thirtyseven seconds after august holdwine said the phrase novem soles into his phone a text message appeared on another smart phones screen outside of intracompany communications there had been no mention of the phrase in the governments phone and email monitoring database for weeks since sam capra made his one and only statement for the cia the public did not know the phrase a large percentage of the worlds communications were vacuumed into the data tanks of the national security agency to be studied and filtered in the neverending torrent of words novem soles was a distinct outlier novem soles were two words so unusual so unmistakable that the small bit of software hidden on the servers was able to find within a few hours any mention of the phrase and identify the sender and the recipient and provide a text transcript of the conversation during which the magic words were uttered this transcript was sent to one mans cell phone he knew then any time when anyone in the united states was discussing novem soles it was as the watcher put it to his peers an eye that never blinks the watcher stepped out from the thrum of a restaurant on south beach a place that supposedly provided the best gourmet breakfast in miami but the watcher was unimpressed he knew he could have done a better job in running it and hed thought of buying it how nice it would be to run a restaurant and have a simpler job it was a cloudy rainy day and in the morning haze of patio he studied the readout it was the transcript of the entire call from the langley office to august holdwine someone had information on novem soles to sell someone who had called from an amsterdam number and had called the central intelligence agency with an offer he felt a jolt of nervous energy ride along his bones the watcher closed the phone he thought sam capra now as soon as he had it rang again he studied the phone log and answered bonjour a womans voice said we have a problem greenwich village new york braun didnt return from langley to new york until midafternoon the study in the special projects office smelled of fine cigars and exquisite coffee august felt he should decline the coffee he felt jittery enough but you did not often say no to a legend and ricardo braun was a legend so august sat down in a heavy leather armchair a fragrant brazilian brew steaming from his cup he had only been to the study once before ricardo braun was an early retiree from cia whod come back into the fold a few weeks earlier when special projects needed mature steady guidance after the disasters of the past few months he made august feel like an ox braun was a spare sleek man bald with a strong runners build in his late fifties with gray eyes and an air of unfailing confidence he wore black slacks and a crisp white shirt he had what appeared to august to be the worlds most elaborate coffee machine and he turned from it now holding a thick mug of a brew that smelled amazingly rich a curl of steam snaking from the porcelain what do you want me to do august asked well write the informant a check of course braun said am i supposed to do all the thinking august realized it was a joke so he ventured a smile above my pay grade but not yours ricardo braun said were not paying this guy ten million dollars not someone who isnt willing to come in not someone who wants to hand us off what might be worthless information and vanish before we can confirm it he sipped at his coffee he cant vanish he said he wanted protection from us exactly what id say if i planned to vanish braun arched an eyebrow he cant think he can hide from us novem soles certainly has hidden themselves well what do we truly know about them nothing dead ends and nowheres braun looked at the bourbon in his glass but didnt taste it do i open a case file special projects operated by a unique set of rules free from cia bureaucracy but records still had to be maintained for the branchs own reference special projects could access and use company databases but it was not a twoway street the branch had its own computer network its own protocols for accessing information from police and corporate databases some were illegal it was this willingness to bend the rules that put special projects apart from the regular operations of the cia yes do but we dont report anything yet to the company he got up and walked to the reinforced glass in the study we know this group penetrated the company once already more than once through bribery well not on my watch i didnt give up daily rounds of golf and marlin fishing to come back and fail he turned back with a stern stare at august we are not alerting any other traitors who are looking for a mention of novem soles in an email or a report or a conversation i want this off the books for now find this informant bring him in and well see what hes got braun paused did you get anywhere with capra he spotted our shadows took out one who got too close and then bought me a martini at a bar he now owns over by bryant park called the last minute braun smiled a bar if i wasnt so irritated with him i think i might get to like him he wont give any information on this mila woman and he claims not to know anything more about novem soles i get the sense hes moved on with his life well past us hes a businessman now hes wanting out of the game and his kid no news so he says i dont believe hes sitting around doing nothing braun said you dont twiddle your thumbs if theres a chance of finding your kid now he picked up his mug and tasted the rich brew within the best coffee ever it was so rich and perfectly roasted his tongue nearly went into shock braun gave him a smile this is a guy august thought who appreciates caring for every detail august knew braun had read sams file he may have run into the same walls we have could your informant know anything about the capra baby i have no idea i did not ask guilt surged up through his chest the conversation didnt lend itself to detailed questioning that child could be used as leverage only to a point sam wouldnt act against us if ordered he would tell us of any demand made against him for his childs safety braun raised an eyebrow does your father love you august yes sir would he kill to save you if push came to shove august said if im being honest yes my dad would sam might cut your throat to save his kid get the meeting but be very careful braun fixed him with a look langley says this informant asked for you that means he must know youre running the task force this could be a meeting just to kill you or grab you to see what you know youve made me eager to get back to work august stood can i ask you something it came up in talking with sam yes this mila woman he slid the picture over to braun she was with sam again last night we lost her braun studied the picture i told you before i dont recognize her i was out of the field for several years though we picked up some chatter there is and has been for the past three years a milliondollar bounty on her head ive never heard of a bounty that high funded by a crime ring how on earth has she survived three years very good or very lucky maybe no ones gotten close to finding her braun studied the photo again she looks like an elf seriously put pointed ears on her and shed be the perfect santa claus line monitor at christmas this big a bounty and no one even knows who she is incredible where was this chatter its come up on a few discussion forums usually of extremists looking for funding who posted the bounty it leads to a gmail account thats never been accessed or i should say has only been accessed by a nontraceable computer are the details in your report yes ill write it up for you tonight braun handed him back the photo make it happen august get us this informant get us this woman or august thought sourly get another job the internet cafe was near the nyu campus he walked there an hour after august left he did not wish to use a ciaowned computer he also wanted to finish the exquisite pot of coffee hed made ricardo braun went inside and ordered a decaf with little hope that it would match his palates demands and sat at an internet terminal situated far from any other patrons he opened an email account he had established six years before and that he only checked very infrequently it was a hidey hole for him on the web and he remembered a message hed seen two years ago there were only a couple of dozen messages in the account all old but kept squirreled away for when they could be useful requests for information offers of payment cia pensions were not what they should be and although hed had family money braun felt that more cash was never to be turned down as long as his small creative side jobs did not hurt the country he loved he saw nothing wrong with it he was simply careful to clean it through investments the cia did watch the incomes of its former agents the message had held a picture of the woman called mila hed seen her face then for the first time that fine elfin face he checked the photo stashed in the email address it might well be the same woman the cut of her hair was different but the bones were the same in her cheeks the turn of the mouth the sharp haunted eyes mila the photo of her was one with a gun in her hand wearing a leather jacket and leather pants glancing about a room the sort of photo that looked like it had been lifted from a private security camera he reread the message text to to get details on job high dollar he wondered if the job was still open he texted on a phone that the cia did not know that he owned he got an autoresponse directing him to a private website providing him with a password braun jumped to the site its url was a wild mix of numbers and letters not the kind of site that someone would ever accidentally stumble upon he entered the password the site opened it showed more pictures of mila shot from the same camera and the text in five different languages million us for this bitch i want her alive braun stared this was the gold standard of hit contracts a million dollars was usually a sum reserved for leaders of state heads of organizations braun himself had spent cia dollars to kill a rwandan warlord for special projects for a hundred thousand a drug kingpin in ecuador for twice that amount braun had his own address book he could call upon when regular cia personnel were not an option who was this woman and who had the deep pockets to off her he glanced at the last update a month ago a single message contract is still open an email address another blind one he sent an email is contract still open i have a lead on an associate of hers but i need to know im dealing with someone who can guarantee payment he closed the email account the website he erased the browser history he left the internet cafe and went and ate lunch standing up in a narrow studentgeared pizza joint chewing on a thick slice drinking a coke a million dollars the terms of the reward preferred that she be alive that complicated things braun ate his lonely pizza then walked home and sat in his leather chair and thought about novem soles and mila and how he could collect that million dollars las vegas its not everyday that you a inspect a new business you own and b make plans to meet a kidnapper there happy partiers filled the canyon bar escaping the touristswollen casino hotspots searching for revelry and the next place you wanted to be seen i was planning how to capture a woman whod stolen my child the canyon was not a tourist trap bar like so much of the vegas nightlife scene id noticed in the first hour there this evening that the servers and bartenders were extremely capable attentive engaging focused of course when id come around and introduced myself to the staff they might all have switched to best behavior but you cant hide sloppiness in the running of a firstclass drinking establishment id seen one server gently talk an indecisive customer out of ordering a chocolate martini and into a handcrafted oldfashioned a real drink for a real person the decor was highdollar carefully sculpted beams of wood undulated along the curving walls the tables were of polished granite the chairs covered with faux rare animal hides the canyon was a destination bar for those too cool for the strip or who wanted a break from the casino nights and the nervenumbing rattle of slots dice and chips the crowd was youngish a mix of more daring visitors and wellheeled locals there was a dance floor small and the dj was mashing classic massive attack with the latest hiphop stars word play and drum beat i watched all this from the security cameras mounted in my office on the second floor of the bar i scanned the crowd i knew annas face from the security photo and the passport photo wed acquired tall dark hair a beauty mark near the curve of her mouth but those were elements easily changed i didnt see anyone who fit her description in the crowded club but i did see a face i knew apparently a recent arrival there she was mila sitting at a back table her hair dyed auburn now or wearing a good wig flirting with some thickshouldered guy who wore a welltailored gray pinstripe suit his face was familiar and that worried me until i recognized him a guy who once played tight end for the new york giants dude probably thought he was about to get vegaslucky mila wowed him a champagnefueled smile although the wine in her flute appeared to be untouched his was empty he refilled and guzzled his twice while i watched i guessed she was conducting her own surveillance observing every face that came and left the bar she had to be careful now that the company had resumed its interest in me i went downstairs to a corner booth that id reserved for myself i wore my hosting clothes a pinstripe suit a white shirt a graysilver tie in your own bar you have to look better than a lawyer sharper and the jacket hid my browning pistol and my slacks hid my knife strapped to my calf mila got up whispering something that was i am sure most promising to her male camouflage but came over and sat at my table i understand i am to be your wife every time i play this role there is trouble shed taken a later flight than me best if we didnt travel together she flew under an assumed name but no one tailed me at the vegas airport i made sure i like the auburn i said thank you i could see the giants ex glaring at me waiting for her return why did you sit with him i generally ignore your american football i thought maybe he was a bodyguard for anna i have talked to all the large muscular men here she surveyed the crowd thin pickings she might send a woman you dont have to work the crowd for long we just need to get anna up in the office then we force her to tell us where my son is simple mila said i see no reason for this to be complicated you are always such an optimist mila crossed her legs inspected her fingernails this woman anna tremaine she tells you the name of the couple who bought your baby great what do you do with her then lock her upstairs for a few days while we go collect your son i raised an eyebrow you will have to kill her sam your bloodthirstiness is really not appealing truth is often very ugly like the orange dress of that woman at the bar mila said an upstairs office is not built to keep a hostage for the long term and you cant let her go she will warn whoever bought daniel so they can run you have mr bell stashed away back in new york no mr bells very small brain has been plucked he is back with his family and now he is in our pocket when we need him he is a puppet on the string for me he knows we killed two men yes so he wants to stay on my good side i let the sounds of the party rise and fall around us i have a plan i am eager to hear this brilliant strategy ill hand anna over to the cia she can tell them all about her employers it was certainly better than handing mila over to them mila seemed to sense the direction of my thoughts what would you do to get your son back anything anything covers so much she glanced across the bar at her neglected conquest oh your american football player i left him uncomfortable with anticipation he does have a nice thick neck though i like a thick neck nice to hang onto that neck is not supporting a large brain ha brains mila gave me a sideways glance brains do not matter so much as heart sam she pounded her chest with her little fist look we get anna tremaine upstairs to finalize our purchase after she talks i load her up with an anesthetic and we leave her locked up in the apartment we find where daniel is and i go get him and you keep an eye on her and then what we give her to august holdwine and special projects and she can tell all she knows about novem soles i have missed the exciting announcement where you have rejoined the central idiot agency mila said i thought you worked for me and what does the round table do with her mila you just told me id have to murder her am i supposed to think you wont im hurt the cia wont ah yes she will be their prisoner who goes on trial no they will make a deal with her protect her to talk to tell what she knows this is the way the world works she sells your baby she gets a plea bargain a new life tucked away on the other side of the planet in sydney i sometimes think half of sydney must be people hiding from the rest of the world she picked up my bottle of pellegrino water took a sip theres a price on your head i said she stopped midswig she set down the bottle of mineral water her gaze met mine is mila short for a million because thats the price tag huge for a hit on someone who says shes a nobody its gone up she said the power of compound interest then she laughed or compound hatred mila who wants you dead besides you dont joke dont joke at all about this she took another long drink from the pellegrino bottle it doesnt matter sam i believe it has the slightest of bearings on working with you she rolled her eyes i want to know who wants you dead what so you can help me kill my tormentor im not going to kill him him someone beyond my reach she said its an uncomfortable fact of life like the most beautiful shoes hurt your feet the most she shrugged as though my words my concern were nothing more than mist in the air if were working together i deserve to know whos hunting you just because there is a price on my head doesnt mean there are takers have you killed everyone whos come after you you make me sound so bad i know you perhaps were unfamiliar with capitalism growing up in moldova she answered my comment with a roll of her eyes but let me tell you a million dollars on your head is going to lead to an endless supply of candidates stepping forward they must find me then they must kill me she shrugged its like the words at the end of a commercial for a contest many will enter few will win the many have failed no winners so far people have already been trying to kill you i felt a creep of shock along my skin id been worried about the cia finding her but they just wanted to talk to her august didnt want her dead she didnt shrug again because i think she read me and she knew pretend indifference would only make me mad look there is a man who is very angry at me i humiliated him it was worse than killing him who not anyone who you should care to know sam who mila we get daniel back first then we will worry about my problems she smiled i know how daniel dominates your every thought i am flattered you are concerned about me i felt a sick mix of rage and annoyance and fear for her mila is not exactly my friend shes not exactly my boss i dont know what exactly she is but i could hardly let her be targeted and killed if i wasnt going to give her up to august i sure as hell wasnt going to give her up to some hired killer and once you have daniel you will want a calmer quieter life sam this is only natural there is no way that i am abandoning you life is a series of abandonings she finished the pellegrino now how did you know that my head had a price tag attached to it august told me when i talked with him at the last minute its flattering to be on his radar screen i must have a file at the cia now how exciting what percentage of the world has a file there minuscule i feel special she inspected her nails again should i friend august on facebook he wants me to hand you over to them so you can tell them what you know about novem soles and who you work for they are intensely interested in you i am interested in august in what he can find out in how good he is and in who will try and kill him when he finds out more about novem soles you still think there are people working for novem soles inside the cia its a given she watched the football player hed made friends with two blondes who looked like theyd missed the turn to the playboy mansion if august is good at his job likely he will die if he is bad he will retire and get a nice gold watch because he was never a threat to anyone do you know if theres a mole of course not and i am hurt you think i would keep such juicy gossip quiet plus if i knew i would sell his name to the cia i adore free markets you told me when we met that youd seen the tapes of when the company interrogated me i said you have your own mole inside again the sideways glance well i didnt find the tapes on youtube sam if you must know i stole them off the server you stole data off a cia server i didnt want to know more i am making you nervous mila said ill go upstairs and wait for our friend to arrive ill keep an eye on the cameras i watched her go up the stairs at the back of the bar anna tremaine was coming the crowd had filled out the bartenders moving in a constant blur of service the music pulsed i scanned the crowd looking for anyone suspicious who might be here backing anna but maybe she didnt need or want security maybe this would be easy she didnt know she was coming onto my turf for me the bar was both public and private so many potential witnesses around would tie her hands but i could get her upstairs and then id have the truth but i felt haunted by the person whod been watching me do the parkour run maybe the driver had just been curious maybe it was nothing more maybe i hadnt made a mistake what would you do to get your son back it was the simplest question in the world with the simplest answer but if i made the wrong move i could easily end up dead or in prison or with daniel no safer than he was now right now somewhere a husband and a wife were holding my child calling him their own did they even know he was stolen did they care did they love him as much as i did though id never even held him here she came anna tremaine i recognized her from the video in the french clinic she was a tall woman with wide shoulders and the bearing of an athlete graceful men noticed her as she walked through the crowd you could see gazes flickering to her as she moved she was dressed in black fitted jeans and a colorful shirt and an aquamarine and silver choker covered her ivory throat she was coming though not from the front door but from the back where the restrooms were maybe shed slipped in a back entrance she looked about thirty ravendark hair a hard cold face that was beautiful in technical proportions but not because of warmth or kindness i stayed perfectly still as she sat down across from me i didnt stand this was the woman whod stolen my child all i wanted to do was to fling the table aside and close my hands around that bejeweled throat and force her to tell me where daniel was that time would come now i had to prime the trap mr derwatt yes hello ms tremaine yes your drink i gestured at the martini shed asked to have ready as a sign it sat a bit warm three olives she could choke on them as soon as i made her tell me where daniel was that was only for an identifier a bottle of amstel light and please tell the waiter to open it at the table very cautious she didnt want to risk a drug being slipped into her drink i waved over a waiter repeated the order i kept my voice steady this was a business meeting and she was treating it like a potential trap which it was of course your wife isnt here her voice was soft i suppose you think a woman who steals and peddles babies would sound like the creaking crone from a fairy tale she sounded educated a french accent but very slight as though she spent most of her time conversing in english my wife is considerably nervous about this arrangement shes upstairs she wants to continue to pursue conventional adoption but i shrugged i felt sweat trickle down my spine dampen my armpits i didnt get this nervous in a fight then my mind shut clear and i knew what i would have to do this was worse than crossing a minefield but she was here in my bar my home ground and she wasnt leaving without telling me where my son was the waiter returned with her bottle of amstel he opened it for her at the table she thanked him he left and then she took a long sip your wife isnt upstairs your wife technically your exwife is in a ciarun hospital in bethesda maryland in a coma from which she is unlikely ever to recover shes your ex not because you are an asshole who divorced a critically ill wife but because shes a traitor who saved your life and then tried to kill you when you came after her she picked the wrong side and she paid the price i kept my gaze locked on hers well anna tremaine was no fool your name isnt frank derwatt its sam capra she took a dainty sip of beer you enjoy playing monkey in empty buildings when youre not creating trouble for us fine who needs masks wheres my son anna see i know more about you than you do about me annas not my real name wheres my son i leaned forward i could produce the browning under my jacket in one second i didnt care if i set off a panic in the canyon she was going to tell me an hour ago a friend of mine left a halfpound of c explosive in the ladies room her smile went coy she uttered her threat in the same tone as you might say i love what youve done with the place the trigger is under my control you raise a hand against me and this bar burns with everyone in it she glanced at the partiers the light pulsing in time to the music laughing drinking oblivious i cant say theyd be a real loss these people are nothing they serve no purpose unlike selling children i battled the rage rising in my chest the rage was like a strange heat i had killed before for the first time a few weeks earlier and in normal circumstances it wasnt ever anything you wanted to do again but her i could kill her she smiled the cats smile at the mouse wriggling under its paw i sell happiness mr capra i give desperate parents exactly what they want where is my son you keep asking like im actually going to tell you she took another swig of her beer scooted a bit closer in her chair like she had a cute story or a joke to tell me as we sat enjoying our evening in the primo bar i wont tell you where your son is i will tell you how you can get him back how i want you to kill a man for me she enunciated each word carefully as though i were impaired when i didnt respond she said its not like you havent killed before not in cold blood will it make it easier to swallow if i assure you he deserves it who my employer has a traitor we want him dead she smiled we have your son so i think what we want is what you want kill him yourself hes not under our control at the moment i think you are particularly placed to be able to find him and reach him you kill him for us and well give you back your son alive and unharmed and i should believe you why why if we wanted you and your son dead you would both be dead she smiled tasted her beer again because you have no choice sam that seems to me to be common sense you must do as we say we own you she leaned back a little your child is cute he favors you in the eyes he has his mothers mouth you sold him so you were told but we didnt we kept daniel close in case he was useful to us i think it was a smart move you want me to kill a man my mind felt clouded there must be something very special about this man he must be hard to kill or hard to reach or hard to find and failure as they say is not an option if you dont kill him maybe we wont kill daniel you will never know but we wont sell him to a sweet and kind family there are all sorts of unappealing people who will buy a baby i wanted to fling the heavy table into her face but i bottled the rage stuffed it down not the time but i was going to make those words taste like ash in her mouth uh uh anna said anger is destructive here is what happens now nod if you understand me ive grown tired of your voice slowly i nodded your target will be in new york tomorrow youll have a partner in your hunt a woman whos a wizard at finding people who dont want to be found shes gifted and motivated just like you anna gave a smug laugh she sounded like a bird chirping so get to new york find him and kill him i need a guarantee that you will give me daniel she pulled a photo from her jacket and slid it across the table to me i knew it was daniel i knew it just like a soldier long separated from his child by distance and normality gets a picture and can see both himself and his wife in the babys face he was wrapped in a blue blanket green eyes looking up at the camera not a smile on his face but he wasnt crying intrigued with the contraption above his head that was taking his picture one arm reaching up his mouth a toothless curl cheeks full and fat he looked good he looked loved thin blond hair crowned his head like mine when i was a baby before it darkened like his mothers i gritted my teeth now when youve killed the target and daniel is returned to you we are done you dont keep coming after us you dont help the cia or the fbi or anyone else in pursuing us you retire from the grand game go be a good daddy i want the protocol for the exchange when the target is dead you will phone a number that i give you when we have confirmed that youve completed your side of the bargain then the child will be left with a note with your contact information at a church a dna test will confirm that the child is yours simple no youre asking me to trust you far too much you do not have a choice sam if i cant kill or find the target she made a slow little wave with her hand then i guess youll have that picture of him as your only memory would you like to keep it put it under your pillow if you hurt or sell my son ill kill you shut up do you really think you should threaten me right now he could get by with nine toes as easily as ten my mind went blank in the way not of shock but of the way of calculation i didnt believe in a truce not now they were not going to threaten my child and go unpunished but i didnt let the decision show on my face so who is this target you want dead she slid another photo from her jacket to me him his name is jin ming at least thats the name he used i think its an assumed name i studied the face i recognized him although id only seen him for a few moments i think youve made a serious mistake part two the red notebook las vegas you want me to kill a dead man i shook my head i hope youre better at killing someone than finding a pulse hes not dead i hadnt had but a moment to look at him hed been sadly caught in the crossfire between piet and his thugs and augusts cia team and he looked dead enough to me but i was running from the cia then and desperate to get piet the one surviving smuggler out of harms way where i could put him to use piet had been my sole link to edward the kidnapper of my wife and my son so id made a mistake who exactly is this jin ming a graduate student from hong kong attending the delft university of technology focusing on computer sciences and hes a threat to you hes just a geek a kid his age is irrelevant youre going to find him and kill him before he surrenders to the cia you have two days jin ming had walked in with august and the rest of the cia team if he wanted to turn against novem soles would he turn to august perhaps this was why anna was eager to use me i could get close to august and therefore close to jin ming why hasnt he surrendered to them already i asked i dont know he set up a meeting with the cia in two days in new york so get there and kill him he has the goods on you poor poor you and we have the goods on you sam your child i shut up kill him before that meeting so it never happens and he never passes on whatever information he has you do that you get your son back you dont your son is gone forever she slid an iphone to me this is yours you do not tell anyone what you are doing anyone between her threat of a bomb in the club and my son she had me pinned i hate being pinned really really hate it im going to leave now she held up the remote control another iphone with a call number selected you do not follow me if you do i call the cell phone attached to the c and we have bits and pieces of drunken dancers landing in the parking lot the signal has a fivemile range she kept her thumb right above the number one tap and we were all done goodbye anna i said ill see you very soon no you will never see me again do your job earn your son and then go on your way she stood dont test that im bluffing she moved toward the front door and a drunken guy bumped into her and for one moment i thought her thumb would hit the screen she recovered and she pushed roughly by the drunk i saw her go past the bouncer and out into the desertcool night i ran toward the back of the club as mila zoomed down the stairs evacuate i called to her right now anna didnt want me dead but i couldnt risk that there was a bomb here in a bar full of innocent people mila sprinted toward the djs stand and before i reached the ladies room the lights were up and her voice boomed out over the loudspeakers the music silenced people hello attention please please move to the exits in an orderly fashion we need to clear the building immediately there is no danger no fire but please move outside and across the street i heard groans of dismay but the staff moved quickly through the crowd herding them i busted into the ladies room three women at the mirror fixing makeup hey get the hell out of here one turned and screamed at me fueled by cosmopolitans evacuating the building out now there were six women total in the room and i hustled them out fast where would she have put it the ladies room boasted a mirror edged with a fake lasso to continue the canyon theme stars to duplicate the night sky glittered on the tiled ceiling i looked in each stall nothing the air vents it would have taken her minutes to unfasten the grates and put the bomb in she would have been noticed with a steady stream of customers i looked under the sink nothing then i turned my face level with the paper towel dispenser and beneath it the metal disposal bin you needed a key to open it to access and pull out of the trash can i peered down into the piles of dirty paper towels jammed my arm down as far as i could reach at the bottom i ran into a package rectangular i felt a flick of wire along its edge slowly bracing myself against the wall i pulled my arm up the distant hum of people evacuating was growing quieter i pulled the package free from the pile c it was wrapped in gift paper that read babys first birthday four wires led off a cell phone a cheap prepaid model to curl into the packaging i had no idea which wire to cut no idea if the bomb was functioning i ran out the back door several patrons had gone out this way and i saw people getting into cars leaving the canyon now that the party had ended i ran holding the package trying to find a deserted spot where i wouldnt put anyone at risk a small shopping center stood to my left and i arrowed behind it every store was in darkness gingerly i unwrapped the package careful not to disturb the wires it was simple three of the wires were fakes going nowhere taped under the paper a blue one fed from deep in the explosive to the cell phone i pulled out my pocket knife and i cut it i leaned against the building and then twenty seconds later the bombs phone rang when my heart settled back into my chest i answered you bitch i dont like being called names anna said you can tell how serious we are you dont deviate from the plan you dont cross us youre an idiot to give me a job and then risk blowing me up a minute later there was no risk you did exactly what we knew you would do just keep doing what we tell you anna hung up my hands wanted to shake and i wouldnt let them i fought the fear down i walked back to the club lots of the patrons had left but a good sized crowd remained in the parking lot curious or optimistic i took it as a compliment to the canyon that they hung around i was sure many had walked their tabs it didnt matter mila met me at the front door is everything okay yes what happened she knew who i was the trap was on me not anna ah sam i am sorry what did she say i took a deep breath rough night lets talk tomorrow you have a place to stay her gaze burned like fire what are you not telling me samuil tension broke her voice she only used the slavic form of my name when she was upset theres nothing you can do mila thank you for coming this is my problem and mine alone now if she knew who you are then she had a reason to come meet you realization dawned in her eyes daniel she wants to make a deal for daniel this is now my problem i said again thank you for your concern do not do this alone what is the ransom god let me help you i cant tell you shell kill him i kept my voice from breaking just barely sam so much in that one syllable pain for me desperation to help a simmering fury i play by their rules and that means no you hanging around go mila im sorry the approaching whine of police sirens sliced through the night now empty the bar was quiet the air weighed like steel between us i have to go i have to be on a flight in two hours if you want to help me deal with the cops oh and theres a pound of c explosive behind a dumpster in the shopping center get rid of it im not really inclined to leave it lying around sam her mouth worked what do they want you to do it has nothing to do with you i said my voice rising her face was stone this was the woman who had helped ensure the cia didnt find me while i hunted for my wifes kidnappers the one who had given me every support in my new life she deserved better than my silence they want me to kill a man who someone who is a threat to them you commit one murder for them to save your son they can ask for a thousand more they can tell you a thousand lies make a thousand promises give you a thousand orders and you will be their slave to save that child i couldnt breathe i dont need you debating me i do what i have to do then go go before the cops want to talk to you mila didnt wait for me to answer she bolted past me and out the door toward the arriving police cars i stood in the mess of knockedover chairs and halffull drinks and the eerie serenity of a bar that has been emptied of people in a matter of minutes the light machine kept playing and gleaming dots danced along my face my skin get to the airport get to new york find and kill this jin ming save my boy henderson nevada leonie opened her eyes then blinked shed fallen asleep at the desk and her cheek felt mashed and droolstained charming she thought wiping at her face with her fingers the computer kept playing music from rent turned low set on repeat she preferred songs with a story these days shed filled her itunes library with musicals and movie soundtracks she hit the space bar and the rising voices imploring her to live for today went silent she blinked again in the sudden quiet forcing herself to stay awake my god what happened to me fourth or fifth time shed fallen asleep while working this week it was getting to be a bad habit shed had an early morning she glanced at the clock shed fallen asleep after putting the baby down it was close to pm exhaustion had caught up with her she was still in tshirt and jeans and got up from the desk in the corner of her bedroom shucked her clothes put on thin cotton pajamas she brushed her teeth wiped the sleep from her eyes now shed probably have trouble going back to sleep and the baby would sleep straight through the night oh well she could get some work done leonie had decided early on that they called it single motherhood because you had to make every single second work to your advantage honey her wellmeaning octogenarian neighbor mrs craft would say why dont you hire a nanny im sure you can afford it and mrs craft would look around at the granite countertops the vaulted ceilings the plush persian rug over the immaculate hardwoods i dont like having strangers in the house leonie said a nanny once you get to know her shes no stranger and leonie had just shrugged instead of saying what was in her heart i cant take the security risk i cant have a nanny finding out what i do the load of long solitary working hours and taking care of taylor was endurable taylor was worth every sleepless night leonie brewed a pot of hazelnut decaf and switched to the chicago soundtrack on her ipod connected to a small set of speakers the saucy strains filtered out quietly over the bedroom she opened her laptop and checked her emails she kept several anonymous accounts to stay in touch with clients nothing from gunnar she heaved a sigh of relief as clients went gunnar was being rather difficult kept changing his mind on what he wanted first he wanted to relocate to new orleans no he decided it was too close to atlanta he would see someone he knew in the bars of the french quarter too likely hed be found then he wanted canada no he realized actual winters with actual snow took place in montreal now he wanted panama but had started making noises about there being nothing to do in panama as though the entire country lacked nightclubs or movie theaters beaches or bookstores she couldnt start creating his fake life without him choosing where to hide she wanted to say when you leave your old life behind you leave it behind and not soon enough for me and you have to decide but you had to avoid getting too snotty with gunnar or any desperate client she knew that too well handle him with care get him set up where he could never bother her and his life would start again panama she would tell him that was the solution to keep him safe she was the expert after all he would simply have to listen to her he couldnt continue to waffle once a person had made the conscious decision to vanish and contacted her for help then indecision was a nightmare it made exposure much more likely a slip of the tongue time spent on a traceable computer researching locales and such any of those mistakes could return to haunt you if you had ever looked in your browser at seattle or vancouver or paris then you needed to cut them from your vanish list fine decision made she would create him bank accounts in panama find him a suitable house in managua in a good neighborhood where he would not attract interest get him a private spanish tutor one who could be trusted make him a new zealander she could get the right kind of paper for that passport and the watermarks within two days she would rely on her network to cobble together a new name and a new world for him best to get started now she got her coffee ignored the thirst for a cigarette six months now no smoking and then she heard the traffic noise outside a car rushing past a rise of night breeze and then a flap of curtain the sound seemed much louder than it should she paused chicago s singing murderers in the middle of the cell block tango listened again she heard a hard gust of wind there was a window open somewhere a cold itch wriggled between her shoulder blades she got up from the computer and went down the hall she stopped at the nursery door eased it open the door faced the window which looked out onto the backyard the window stood open the pooh bear drapes dancing in the gust her heart shuddered to stone she hurried forward in the dark the moonlight gleam showed her the crib was empty her baby was gone she screamed short and sharp picking up the waddedup yellow blanket as if taylor might have shrunken and fallen into its maze of folds her scream turned molten in her throat she stumbled through the house be here be here be here she said to herself but the rest of the house was empty and the fear and the shock juddered through her like a hammer hitting bone the phone stunned she stumbled to it picked it up pressed the then the then she stopped what was she going to tell them my child is gone questions would be asked who are you maam who is the father how long have you lived here who might take your baby from you what if their questions pierced the truth that she lived here under a false name that she wasnt who she said she was she hung up the phone she had to think before she called the police she had been so careful she had hidden so well no one knew where to find her except the phone rang in her hand and she nearly dropped it as though the sound could turn to heat scald her skin she stared at the screen the number blocked hello hello leonie how are you a womans voice gentle and known to her anna tremaine where where she sobbed into the phone oh are you missing someone young mothers can be so forgetful where is my baby she screamed now the fear was gone snap vanish just a fury in its place annas voice was calm let me assure you your child is safe a ragged moan escaped leonies throat are you listening leonie anna said it will be tiresome if i have to repeat myself why have you done this why because leonie you are going to do something very important for me and youre going to do it right away no argument leonie forced herself toward calm what do you want youre so good at hiding people for us darling but can you do it in reverse can you find someone whos hiding yes leonie said it was inconceivable to give any other answer shed do anything for taylor all right if you have another client right now get rid of him she thought of gunnar he needed to be hidden okay whatever he couldnt decide what he was doing or where he wanted to go screw him for eternity he would have to wait okay please dont hurt taylor please please get a hold of yourself i need you to be calm you could have just asked you could have just asked me for help you know i would i already the womans voice was a slow purr i needed an assurance you would act ill do whatever you want youre going to work with a gentleman he like you is very motivated to do a good job for us i dont work with other people you will now leonie unless youre willing to pull the trigger on a gun yourself and kill a man in cold blood your job is easy all you have to do is find a target this man will then kill the target and then you get taylor back easy panic churned her guts she sank down onto the couch okay she thought this is the reality of the moment deep breath and deal um who is this man im supposed to find and who is it im working with i love the smell of cooperation in the morning anna tremaine said youre very good at making lastminute travel arrangements darling ill let you meet him at the airport his name is sam capra he can tell you the details anna is taylor all right perfectly fine asleep on a blanket leonie felt fear like ice pierce her skin she forced herself to listen intently anna or one of her people must have taken the baby in the past couple of hours while she was absorbed in her work or dozing at her desk which meant that anna might still be in las vegas or was in a car she tried to hear the hiss of tire against road on annas side of the phone she heard nothing if anna was pulled over then there might be traffic as the background noise a clue that would tell her where anna was the rumble of an eighteenwheeler a whine of engine passing annas car she heard nothing she cursed herself for not listening sooner but shock had frozen her she tried to manipulate her memory force herself into replaying every word of the conversation again every nuance because if she did what was asked and her child wasnt return ed the person she would be finding and killing was anna tremaine you know not a hair on the head will be hurt anna said in a babyish singsong havent i always been nice to you check the email address we used in the past details will be there and final instructions pack a bag for a few days be at your smartest be brave do a good job leonie for your childs sake then the phone went dead in her hand final instructions leonie got up and ran toward the laptop las vegas i hurried toward the ticket counter at mccarran when a woman stopped me she was slightly built auburnhaired with a full mouth and purplesmudged eyes she wore jeans and a green blouse and carried a small briefcase and a travel bag she was pretty but she looked like shed had a night as rough as mine sam capra her voice shook slightly i nodded i have your ticket for the flight to new york i just bought it for you okay i said this was the woman who would find jin ming my motivated partner as anna had said she gave me the ticket her hand trembled then she looked at me studied me as if my face were an interesting map then she turned away from me and went and sat down the security lines were long but moving i followed her we were being forced together and i did not want anyone else knowing my business especially when my business involved killing a man who are you leonie im supposed to come with you she wiped her nose with a tissue why to help you find the target i dont need help well im helping you because they have my kid so you dont get a vote she said this staring straight ahead not looking at me i sat down next to her anna took your child yes my daughter taylor leonie didnt look at me we should go through security we dont want to be late for the flight you could go to the police not an option she looked past me at the crowds people seemed oddly happy and energetic in the las vegas airport happy to leave because theyd had a great time or happy that theyd just arrived flush with money and with promise and ready to spin the wheel why not our lives are not each others business im supposed to go on a job with you i want to know what the hell im signing up for youre signing up to do what anna tells you she has your kid too right i said nothing im sorry im supposed to help you find this guy jin ming we neednt talk unless were discussing him one stray tear of upset tracked her cheek and she wiped it away with quick resolve how are you going to find him there is no place on earth he can hide from me she stood we should probably go through security i could use a drink i really hate flying we had thirty minutes before they would be calling our flight i followed leonie to a private lounge where we were admitted by our first class tickets inside was a scattering of business types and lushedup couples a few keeping the vegas party going one guy lubricated with gin and tonic complained with his megaphone voice about having lost ten thousand dollars i would have traded problems with him we sat down in a far corner a sleek hostess truly sleek her hair was gelled back in a severe cut her dress was silver she looked like her day job was testing wind tunnels brought leonie a large glass of pinot noir and me a whisky neat when did your kid vanish i asked she took a fortifying sip of the wine earlier tonight anna or her people took her from her crib while i was working in my bedroom i fell asleep at my computer i never even heard them in my house the moment her voice started to quake she caught herself listen to me she looked at me unlike most parents of missing kids we know exactly what we have to do to get our kids back and we know who has them we cant waste mental energy on blame we have a job to do our kids need us she nodded took another sip of the wine wow do you double as a life coach on weekends no wheres your husband im a single mother she watched past my shoulder the drunk complainer order another round wheres your wife ex in a coma coma yes one of annas buddies shot her in the head a few weeks ago she let five seconds pass that sucks really what else do you say then she said i mean im really sorry im not quite myself this evening of course she wasnt she had to be in deep shock whats your connection to anna none of your business i dont know you sam all i want is my child back thats all she rubbed at her jawline glanced at the clock she did not want to seem to look at me her daughter had been kidnapped only hours earlier her selfcontrol was extraordinary i reached out and touched her hand with my fingertips just a reflex she flinched were on the same side im in your shoes they have my son too so anna told me she studied her wine do we have to talk beyond finding jin ming seriously it occurred to me that maybe she was a plant someone anna sent along to make sure i killed jin ming and didnt try to use him back as leverage against novem soles i didnt know if she really had a kid or really had suffered a kidnapping tonight she could simply be a convincing actress she could be lying through her teeth but i couldnt get anywhere with her if she knew i harbored suspicions she was supposed to be a panicked mom i was a desperate father let us i thought play true to our parts yes we do have to talk i know you are upset i know what youre feeling because im feeling it too if we cant trust each other we wont get far in finding jin ming she gave me a doubting look i tell you where he will be you kill him thats all we have to discuss she took another hit of the pinot leonie listen this is the single worst day of my life you are a dude who kills people so i dont want to know you i dont want to be your friend or join your support group for parents of kidnapped kids i just want my taylor home she picked up the wine glass she stared past my shoulder toward the loud group in the back corner if those assholes are on our flight i may end up punching someone a dude who kills people that was so not what i was but now wasnt the time to reassure her i wasnt some slavering axwielder winning her trust would be a slow process this target what can you tell me about him what does he know about novem soles i dont know she didnt flinch at the name of the group shed heard it before you must that knowledge would be key to tracking him predicting where he will run who he will ask for help all you need to do is kill him she set the wine glass down hard youre the bullet im the brains i just tell you where to shoot the bullet doesnt need any details except a location well did anna threaten your daughter if you tell me something youre not supposed to i would say kidnapping in itself would be threat enough i know anna children are simply a commodity to her products that other people make for her and from which she profits shell kill or sell our kids and well never find them if we give her anything other than complete obedience was she trying to provoke me see how id react i studied her again fierce intelligence in the eyes i leaned forward has it occurred to you that neither of us is getting our kid back we have zero guarantees shell honor her side of the bargain we need to find a way to protect ourselves to make sure she hands the kids back we could trade her ming alive for the kids you listen to me leonie pointed a finger at my face you hear every word im saying dont you dare think of going against anna if we deviate from the plan anna will kill the children she lowered her voice to the barest whisper we are doing exactly what she tells us to do if you try to fight back well you wont youll kill me ill do anything for my child anything stare down between us we are on the same side i repeated this is crazy please sam lets just try to get along out of necessity id mishandled this but where was the primer for this situation i got up and fixed us two sleek plates of appetizers laid on the sleek buffet by the sleek hostesses leonie watched me i brought back her food set the silvery plate in front of her thank you she nibbled at a meatball then at a carrot stick out of politeness you hold yourself together remarkably well for someone whose child was just taken i said i have the advantage my child was taken weeks ago i have had time to adjust thats a white lie she said i dont think youre adjusted at all its all stifled just inside i ate a slider sipped at the whisky she looked at me inside im a wreck when my kid and my wife were taken i couldnt eat or sleep for days i was also framed as a traitor undergoing interrogation in a ciarun prison in poland but that was an avalanche of detail right now for leonie your wife was taken i thought you said annas people grabbed my wife when she was seven months pregnant ive never seen my son face to face she just stared at me for a long moment how awful i am sorry let me guess why you cant go to the police anna provided you with your baby girl she ate some more of the carrot she did not seem the type for an impulsive admission why would you say that you said you work on hiding people which suggests to me you are breaking a few laws committing forgery for new papers maybe credit fraud you know her she got you your kid what anna giveth anna taketh away she was good at concealing her emotions after all me dissing her was nothing compared to the agonies she must be feeling for her kid and the only sign of betrayal on her face was the momentary quiver of her lip no taylor is mine but ive done work for anna sometimes the children she places with parents note she didnt say the unthinkable word of sells need birth certificates i forge them for her and ive helped hide people she sent to me did you do a birth certificate for julien daniel besson my breath couldnt move in my lungs i leaned in close and she leaned back i grabbed her hands again that was the name my son was given at birth he was born in france julien daniel besson i didnt but if annas using your child as leverage against you then she hasnt placed him shell only place him now if she doesnt need him any more her words were a knife across my throat she saw it im sorry sam i really am you help her forging certificates i thought i could hear the soft burr of her grinding her teeth its not a choice i stared at her they have more dirt on you i didnt know yet if i could trust her cornering her about her secrets wasnt going to win her over to my side i am not up for twenty questions she stood dont talk about defying anna we do what she says and nothing else im not putting taylors life at risk and you shouldnt be endangering your own childs life either she spat the last word like i was the scum of parenting there was no point in saying youre wanting us to entrust babies to killers and murderers okay leonie okay calm down i dont need to know you you dont need to know me she downed the pinot noir in two hard gulps picked up her bag lets go get on our plane flight las vegas to new york we sat together in first class most of the cabin weary from partying in the desert and not looking forward to a work day tomorrow in new york slept i watched an old movie aliens on my personal viewer in the chair back and thought now theres a movie about how you save a kid i had seen the film a dozen times before and i could watch it without thinking without having to follow the story leonies eyes were closed she had spoken so few words to me on the flight i felt sure no one believed we were traveling together i got up to splash cold water on my face in the lavatory most of the other passengers were locked in their own digital cocoons watching movies on their personal movie screens or hooked into their ipods or ipads technology has made it easy for us to be totally alone in a crowded room i envied those who slept i needed sleep badly but i couldnt settle my mind ive never been good at sleeping on planes i sat back down and leonie opened her eyes she stared at me blinking as though unsure where she was wakening i was surprised shed managed to doze off the adrenaline shock from her daughters kidnapping was fading the inevitable exhaustion settling into her she looked guilty at having done anything as weak and selfindulgent as sleep when i knew it was the bodys natural response to cope with crippling stress you okay you want something to drink its the bar owner in me i always want to offer a drink the flight attendants should just let me man the beverage cart they could go watch the movie she shook her head the silence hung like smoke ruining the air i started to put my earphones into place no point in talking with her she put a hand on my arm your son he was given that name if you got to name him what would it be daniel my ex did get to name him for my late brother her mouth pursed like she was tasting the name when did daniel vanish right after he was born ive only seen a picture that anna gave me and youre sure she gave you a photo of your kid i am show him to me i showed her the picture of daniel that anna had given me she studied it then looked at my face hes a handsome boy hes never been held by either of his parents i said but there hes smiling how does that affect a kid to not have been held except by people who want to use you the words spilled unexpected i didnt talk about daniel who was i going to talk about him with my crazy moldovan boss with the milliondollar price on her head my old friends in the cia who werent my friends any more my customers at the bar no every flick of pain i felt about daniel coalesced in my chest i shut my mouth i didnt want to talk about him when you get him back then dont ever let him go she handed me the photo how did you and your wife ever cross annas path my wife got bought by novem soles she was a cia officer she was a traitor it was a strange thing to say in the hush of a first class cabin i glanced up from the photo the flight attendants congregated in the galley ahead of us people either slept or sat earplugged into oblivion yes let me talk about my wife the love of my life the woman i gave my life to the woman who betrayed both me and country and then tried to save me let me talk about the most incomprehensible person i ever knew and how machines keep her breathing and digesting and living like a ghost bound in flesh im sorry that sucks i was figuring leonie was a master of understatement now it does leonie pulled a photo from her purse it was worn dogeared from too much handling as though it had lived a hard life inside her wallet this is taylor she was a bigger baby than daniel a few months older roundercheeked with darker hair and soft sweet brown eyes shes a cute girl yes very so never a husband were not involved any more i prefer to deal only with actual human beings these days not an amicable parting she took taylors photo from me and carefully fitted it into a back slot in her wallet away from the credit cards i could see a smear of ink drawn on the back as she worked the photo into the slot she dumped the wallet in her purse no how will you explain to him that taylors gone he is utterly indifferent to her he couldnt care less hes seen her once and made it clear he didnt care to see her again how old is taylor now almost a year she took a heavy restoring breath so taylor is my life sam everything well get her back well get them both back anna must get both kids to new york her voice was just a whisper if she sticks by the agreement im wondering how shes doing that so quickly with mine because theyre lying to us i said quietly her gaze snapped to mine they might give us our kids back but theyre not going to want us anywhere close by after we deal with the target i said this phone call this church pickup it has to be a lie leonie they dont want us getting caught you dont linger in the area after a job you create distance she was silent she tensed when i said the word job as though the drowsing businesspeople and hungover vegas escapees around us would translate job into hit youre not used to violence i said she didnt look at me no she rubbed at her face she leaned close to me i could smell breath mints on her mouth dont take this the wrong way but you dont look like much of a killer i had killed never before my wife had been taken but i had killed multiple times to save myself or save others since my life had been derailed by novem soles i would like to say it weighed on me heavily this human cost but that would be a lie theyd taken my wife my child theyd gotten in the way of me getting them back theyd tried to kill me why should i feel guilty the deaths were nothing i savored and i never wanted to kill again i dreamed about it sometimes and i didnt want to think that the experiences were rewiring my brain like a soldier who sees the worst horrors in battle but this kid this jin ming hed been grabbed by the cia clearly in amsterdam forced to give them access to the machinists shop where the gunfight erupted and now he was turning against novem soles i ought to be applauding him protecting him picking his brain putting him into my own witness protection plan so he could tell me what lovely dirty secrets he knew and then i could start slicing the core out of the socalled nine suns he and i could have talks the best talks ever instead i was going to kill him i closed my eyes he was what twentytwo twentythree at the beginning of his years the thought that someone barely out of his teens could be a mortal threat to an international criminal syndicate that was my theory as to what novem soles was fancyass latin name aside maybe one of them had read a branding book and wanted to sound more gothic ancient or mysterious interested me i didnt need to think about him just kill him be a weapon i could do that and id worry about the mental cost later or maybe not worry about it at all but if i did that what sort of father would i be for my son im not much of a killer i said to leonie but i will be flight las vegas to new york in first class we got a decent dinner shrimp salad and steak medallions a potato galette and a wannabe creme brulee so its up to you to find our guy where do you start beyond knowing hes in new york city if you dont mind ill keep some secrets to myself i think we need to discuss our options if they betray us if i lose taylor its over for me anyway im not continuing to breathe sam im not existing then there was nothing more to say the flight attendant stopped and asked us if we wanted coffee we both declined leonie announced she would sleep the rest of the flight i closed my eyes and thought about a plan of action one thing i did do i surreptitiously snapped a picture of leonie while she dozed i thought for some reason that it might be valuable to have a photo of her she was a woman with a lot of secrets and i might need to know more about who she was we landed at laguardia late delayed by dodging a goliath of an early summer storm raging over kentucky and ohio we rented a car no way i was trusting cabs and the subway during a manhunt and drove to a midtown manhattan hotel the claiborne where leonie had already booked us rooms across the hall from each other the rest of the hotel seemed ready to rouse the city stirring awake but i was already dead on my feet my energy was gone because we had no clue where jin ming was go sleep leonie said at our doors i cant i cant have you hovering over me how are you going to find him she patted the laptop raised the cell phone its what i do bullet she tried a smile but it was an awful desperate thing and she knew it sorry just trying to stay sane jin ming vanished from holland no trace there is always a trace she said always new york city jack had a window seat on the flight from brussels no way he was going to fly from amsterdam novem soles would be watching he thought the train stations and the airports ricki drove him to brussels and left him at the airport he went into a bathroom stall and shut the door then he oiled and combed down his hair to look like his new passport picture he stuck a thin bulbous piece of plastic in each cheek to subtly change the shape of his face he put in the false teeth they slid over his own teeth this meant he could not eat during the flight but he didnt care he put on a pair of slightly tinted glasses they were not to change his eye color but ricki said that every bit that made him look less like himself or hid him helped shed almost cried as she slipped the glasses on his face he exited the stall and gave himself a short quick glance in the mirror he couldnt stand and preen or adjust the implants he still looked like jack ming but not exactly and with any of the biometric scans at customs in the united states if he was on a watch list perhaps this would give him a cushion he wore a white shirt and jeans and sneakers and looked anonymous he had no trouble in the brussels airport he tried not to watch everyone for fear of looking paranoid but he kept scanning faces looking for another face looking back at him he took his seat an older lady sat next to him immediately produced a thick novel with a swordsman and a dragon on the cover and opened it at the first page almost defying him to try and make conversation with her he sighed in relief he cocooned himself with his ipod and wrapped himself in beatles music he closed his eyes then woke up with a start one of the cheek implants almost half out of his mouth i could have swallowed this not awesome if he choked on his own disguise in the middle of a transatlantic flight he tongued the implant back into place and glanced at his traveling companion she was lost in her own world paying him no heed new york shrouded in cloud opened up beneath him and he stared down home never thought hed see it again never thought hed come back but what choice did he have he walked through customs the new burgundy passport identifying him as philippe lin a belgian national remembered to breathe while the customs agent inspected it scanned it asked him his business in the country he was here to visit family she asked for the address where he would be staying he gave her one provided by rickis friend she asked if he was traveling anywhere else other than new york he said he was only visiting new york because no other city could compare she looked hard at him as though his affable tone were an affront to the seriousness of the moment he thought what the hell are you doing trying to make a joke his stomach twisted dropped she was a bigbuilt older lady who did not seem at all bored by her work she glanced at her computer screen glanced at him he willed himself toward calm in amsterdam ricki sat with her hands on the keyboard she had pierced the main database for belgian passport information kept in the federal public service foreign affairs department in brussels the database was accessed if there was a question about any belgian passport from a friendly nation the imprinted number could be scanned via a watermark or entered into the host countrys passport inquiry database the confirmation was sent a returning ping of approval coming back to the countrys host system she had made a few phone calls past midnight and found a hacker in antwerp who was willing to help her all i need she said is for you to trick the system into approving every belgian passport in a time window i can do thirty minutes i dont want to leave an open feed into the system longer than that and i dont want to leave code behind the hacker said thirty minutes and if it took jin ming longer than thirty minutes to get through customs now she said into the phone the hacker pressed the button according to the airlines website the flight from brussels had landed dont be in the back of the line she thought ricki heard a knock on her door she stood up then she leaned down typed a code into the program the system logged out encrypting itself to await further instructions ricki put her eye up to the keyhole to see who was there and the door smashed inward the customs agent glanced back toward her terminal screen oh dear god jack thought im sunk the irony that he was an american trying to get into america under a false name and flag hit him hard my face how much is my face like what might be in their database what if rickis scheme hadnt worked and if he was arrested what deal could he cut im here to give the cia proof that they need to bust a crime ring yes youre welcome let me go now then the customs agent stamped the passport slid it back to him thank you mr lin enjoy your visit in the united states he nodded and he walked on the agents eyes already turning toward the next arrival in line he kept the implants in place the customs agents searched his bag and waved him through he kept his head down as much as he could navigating through the rest of the terminal sure that he was being photographed on security cameras just as everyone else had been novem soles had already shown that they could pluck data from police and government and he knew from the printouts in the notebook that they owned people inside several governments maybe they were looking for him even here he took the airtrain to the howard street station and boarded the subway to take him into manhattan no one glanced at him no one paid him any attention as the subway chugged toward manhattan he ducked his head down and spat the teeth and the implants into his palm then he slid them into his bag he needed to be jack ming again just for ten minutes just long enough to say goodbye thank you ricki he thought you got me here youre the best amsterdam you know a friend is a good thing to have the watcher sat down across from ricki she perched on the edge of the couch shivering he had forced his way in the gun steady on her you dont need to be afraid he smiled all i want is information and then ill leave and to prove it he put the gun down we have a mutual friend pierre in brussels who just rushed creating documentation for a friend of yours a chinese boy she said nothing pierre found out that we were looking for your friend after he overnighted you the false ids pierre doesnt work for you he doesnt have to work for me hes just afraid of me as soon as the watcher had received the tip that someone using an amsterdam exchange dialup had contacted the cia with crucial information on novem soles he had known it must be the chinese boy the one their hireling had failed to kill he was the only remaining loose end from the spring offensive and now he was a real danger i dont know anything about mings business the watcher smiled at her she was lovely hed spent a lot of time in nigeria in italy where many of the women in his former line of work were african he had not taken one in a long time so much for past pleasures he studied her wall of bootlegging machines you knew my friend nic too yes slightly of course you worked in film and he worked in film i guess content is really what computers are all about now remember when they used to be about solving problems thinking more creatively ricki stared at him the watcher put on his warmest smile it was a very cold flexing of the mouth but he was unaware of this he thought it looked like a real smile he smoothed a hand along his thin mohawk so you steal and copy movies and he made nasty ones i didnt know about that i just knew him because he sold me software to crack the copyright codes nic was generous and now you are generous to his friend ming ricki ran her palms along her jeans ming wanted to get out of the country all i did was give him some names of people who could help him she raised her gaze to his her eyes defiant oh a bit of spark he used to know how to stomp out that flicker of individual flame i want to know where jin ming is and what evidence he has about the people nic worked with i dont know the answer to either of those questions he is eventually going to new york i have someone trying to crack the flight reservations database to find out if hes flying from here or another city but im guessing you can just tell me and save me the money and effort his steely gray eyes looked at her then at the gun then at her again she didnt speak its really best that you help me he stood up how much is this equipment worth to you he pulled a weight from his pocket a magnet a large one the kind youd find in a factory pierre in brussels had told him what kind of work ricki did and so hed decided to take it away from her he began to run the magnet along the shelf stop it youll ruin them she stood up horror on her face yes ill erase and he laughed at the idea of it about forty thousand euros worth of business in about five minutes if you dont answer my question he thought he saw one more flash of anger in her dark eyes then she gave in he flew to dublin she said quietly then a direct flight to boston then a train to new york he was trying not to be obvious thank you he is meeting the cia there i dont know he didnt tell me he believed her he has some evidence against me what is it now her fear and he knew it was there under the surface of her false confidence showed itself i really dont know he didnt show me any evidence he wouldnt tell me and i didnt ask better i dont know better of course did he have a computer not when he got here i gave him a spare laptop what about a disc or a flash drive i didnt see one but he could have hidden it how can i reach him on the phone he didnt take a phone with him i dont have a way to call him he didnt want to implicate me if he got caught once again he believed her he has evidence i want you know it he slid the barrel of his gun along her jaw you have such a good bone structure frederique she paused he he what she trembled he left today before he left he got dressed and when he was putting on his shirt i saw he had an envelope taped to his back he lied and said it was a bandage but i could see it wasnt how big she made a rectangle with her hands maybe a bit smaller than a sheet of paper what was inside the envelope she bit her lip it made her look gentle pretty oh he thought the hunger it never went away ever ricki ill make sure your business is safe if you tell me ill give you the equipment to grow it young lady or ill destroy it your choice he could tell by her hesitation that she knew she knew maybe shed looked at it when jin ming was in the shower or while he slept it was a notebook she said like a journal a red moleskin cover and what was in this notebook photos emails screen captures spreadsheets printed out and pasted in but i didnt understand any of it i didnt he said it was stuff nic had stolen from people you were blackmailing the watchers mouth twitched did he digitize the notebook not here it would have taken a while her equipment would have to be taken or kept analysed checked to see what actions had been performed jin ming might have left a trace to follow the watcher decided he had to get to new york now excuse me please ricki he opened up his phone ordered the person who answered to come around to rickis address he said hold on one moment cupped his hand over the receiver and said heres what i can offer you ricki and im sorry its not a better deal for you my group is taking over your business you will continue to run it but we will take fifty per cent of your profits do well and well help you take over other operations in brussels antwerp and you can run them im going to have some people in here soon to go through your computers to make sure youre telling me the truth then well leave you alone you cant she said shock in her tone i certainly can now if you decline or you betray us what well do is ill have one of my employees load you up with heroin hand you over to a dealer in whores who will rape you and sell you probably to a brothel in nigeria or morocco or south east asia you might have an easier time of it in asia a girl from senegal would be considered more exotic and would be treated better she stared at him speechless jaw quivering he gestured to the phone im waiting get the hell out of here he stood up and he slapped her hard she fell across a stack of counterfeit spongebob dvds scattering them to the floor hostile takeover or heroin and whoring bitch decide i dont have all day she looked up at him her mouth trembling hostile takeover thats the right decision youll see i treat my employees very well unless you betray me if that happens youll be dreaming up chances of suicide because youll see death as the least of all evils he opened his phone made another call bring someone who knows computers i want to know what photos have been scanned here what emails sent even if theyve deleted the photos or the emails keep ricki off the systems he listened no man you dont get to rape her when youre done behave all right he winked at ricki shes one of us now he clicked off the phone i think jin ming will know when we find him that you must have squealed on him let him think you cared about him until then he calls you you say nothing you warn him our deal changes he patted the top of her head she flinched he headed for schipol airport to catch the next flight to new york a notebook of all the things to be afraid of of all the things that could destroy him claiborne hotel manhattan i awoke with a start id fallen asleep with my clothes on on the bed exhaustion piercing past the feverish high id had running for hours i hate sleeping in my clothes it always feels like the sleep has seeped into the fabric i heard the knock on the door again insistent id put out the do not disturb sign i reached for my gun and then remembered i didnt have one there was so much paperwork involved in transporting a gun id get one from my bar the last minute later sam its me leonie i glanced at the clock ten in the morning i got to my feet and opened the door i want you to order coffee and breakfast for us to your room i dont want the maid to see my room right now why not leonie rolled her eyes do what i tell you coffee two pots french roast breakfast make it big i dont know when well eat again come get me when the food is here she turned and went back into her room i obeyed her ordering us a spread and two pots of coffee i showered like a man running late pulled on jeans and a fresh shirt that i could wear untucked i checked my personal phone where mila would call me there was no message maybe shed keep her distance there was no message on the phone anna had given me the food arrived two omelets bacon bagels hash browns juice coffee a new york room service breakfast only costs a fraction of the national debt i signed the check and then knocked on her door bring it here its going to be a working meal she said she held the door for me while i carried in the big trays the walls were covered with white sheets of paper big ones as though torn from a presentation pad and scarred with heavy marker the laptop lay open and it looked like she was in a chat room an ashtray full sat next to it i didnt know you smoked i said id quit when taylor was born now ive started again and i hate it leonie sat down and began to shovel the cheese and mushroom omelet into her mouth i hate cold food she said she ate with concentration for a long minute while i drank a cup of coffee which i needed like oxygen okay first things first jin ming did not exist before he arrived at delft false identity i raised an eyebrow reached for my own plate of food his student transcripts are almost perfect you broke into the universitys server she shrugged universities are easy to hack they have to maintain large networks with lots of unsophisticated users even at a technical university think of a college as one giant coffee shop everyone with a laptop its not hard she ate some more so fast i thought she wasnt tasting the food all his documentation points to him being from hong kong makes it easy then to explain his excellent english but i dug deeper there is a jin ming from hong kong who shares his birthday on the university records he died at the age of five drowned in repulse bay our target hijacked an identity yes and filled in the back details he supposedly attended hong kong international school there falsified transcripts the actual prep school has no record of him did you break into their computer database oh no i called pretending to be from new york university i sat down why would jin ming pretend to be from china so he could go to grad school i mean people fake ids so they can clean money so they can cross borders who the hell steals an identity so that he can go to graduate school in holland and pretends to be chinese what if he got deported hed totally be screwed leonie smiled so if you see someone with a chinese passport you dont entertain the notion that hes not chinese he cant be who youre looking for brilliant i said slowly jin ming means golden name a legitimate name yes but i think theres even a sense of purpose behind his selection a golden name one perfect for him to hide behind i rubbed my forehead this is not an ordinary kid is he dumb people are easy to hunt smart people are a challenge i think hes a fugitive leonie crossed her arms someone who is hiding but badly wants to continue his education and especially at a prestigious technical university and not very many people would think to falsify chinese documents because theyre afraid of being deported to china and then not getting out its actually very smart right now when i see a belgian or a costa rican passport i straight away start to think its been faked theyre the most popular nationalities for people who want to disappear i think he picked hong kong because hed been there before maybe he could pass as a native but my guess is hes american or canadian or english or australian surrendering to the cia in new york he must be american she shrugged dont make assumptions for all their faults the cia is still the most powerful intelligence agency in the world and our mysterious mr jin may just want to deal with the biggest for all their faults i said you sound like a veteran a blush spread across her cheeks up to her auburn hair dont im not i dont have anything to do with the cia so what now you look for criminal computer science students of chinese descent who have gone missing yes actually i do she said but heres the other thing sam new york if jin ming wants to surrender to the cia why isnt he doing it in amsterdam there are agents there they could easily pick him up why does he need to run you ask like you know the answer i do right now hes wanted in amsterdam she pulled up a web page of the amsterdam english language paper he left a hospital where he was a patient a man was found dead there beaten to death with a metal pole the dead man has a criminal history as hired muscle they tried to kill him once before yes and the supposedly helpless hacker killed the thug leonie sounded almost proud of him the police seem to think jins in danger and running and are trying to get him to surrender but he could still surrender to the cia there in fact he has even more reason to because hes being hunted but hes not turning himself in to the closest cia office whats here whats in new york i said i hadnt thought of this the kid had to have a compelling reason to take the risk to come to new york two reasons i said he knows a cia contact here august had dealt with him in amsterdam maybe while in their care hed heard something that tied august to new york and wanted to meet him specifically i didnt know the whole story of what had gone on between them when august grabbed jin ming from the coffee shop leonie waited or hes from here and hes running home why run home she asked hes been very smart as to how he hid himself very if hes a fugitive from here it implies hes wanted here huge risk to return maybe he has family he wants to collect and protect maybe he needs to say goodbye to them if hes going to vanish i assume that if he was living in holland under a false name hes already vanished once before exhaustion crept into her voice we couldnt let the toxic mix of lack of sleep and emotional turmoil derail us if he was already hiding then why does he come home that seems to be a bigger risk than he needs to take i shrugged ive heard of people in witness protection coming home they just get tired of living a lie my clients dont do that once i hide them they stay hidden i dont know what possessed me nice i mean you shelter people fleeing murder raps scum that novem soles needs protected nice you dont know a single thing about what i do or who i help as if youd tell she knew more about me than i knew about her whose fault was that she raised an eyebrow at me took a long drink of coffee to let the tension melt in the room i felt mad at myself for provoking her i needed her right now moral judgments had to be saved for later if hes from new york then that narrows down the possibilities considerably i leaned forward and looked into her computer screen studying the chat room with nested columns of comments to show threads of conversation what is this site darkhand a hacker community she started to type thats how i found out about jin ming i found hackers who had existing back doors into the systems i needed to access by the way youre paying them for their time how much youll launder some money for them both are chinese they want to clean about fifty thousand bucks into us accounts youll make that happen how exactly through your bar in las vegas she knew about the canyon bar not just that it was where id met anna but that i owned it your hacker friends are not washing their dirty money through my bar god only knew what the money might be hackers might have cracked open atms for cash might have committed extortion not to bring company websites down she was involving me in new crimes she seemed almost amused at my outrage you cant refuse the deal is done its for the children she was of course absolutely right for the children the three most powerful words in the language fine i thought id deal with that problem later dont make any more promises you cant keep do you want to find this guy or not she stood up rage bright in her eyes youll do what i say no argument calm down i said i have every right to know if youre dragging me and my business into criminal activity and i have every right not to care i let five beats pass in peace so lets operate under the proposition he has a personal tie back to new york she nodded we find the tie we find him she turned back to the laptop let me get back to work thanks for breakfast and what i wait no do you have any idea on how to be useful her voice had taken on a hard edge to it i find him you kill him bullet you have the easier job i dont get to ask my crooked friends for help i said which was a lie i had resources through the round table that i had no intention of sharing with her i gave her my cell phone number she didnt write it down but she repeated it back to me where are you going she asked as i headed for the door i didnt answer her she didnt need to know her way was going to take too long chelsea new york city most code names in the company are not jokes but his was fagin charles dickenss master of thieves from oliver twist who pulled in the wayward children of london to shape them into pickpockets the fagin i knew put his own modern take on the identity i took the subway south to chelsea it was midmorning now and shoppers walked the streets eyeing the art in the many gallery windows i walked down to the last address i knew for fagin i hoped he hadnt moved i went up to the top floor of his building knocked listened i picked the lock and went inside it was a large apartment i didnt even want to think about how much it cost and still his place a picture of fagin and his wife hung on the wall smiling tropical forest behind them he was thin and wore a reddish beard and had very dark brown eyes the color of coffee dirty breakfast dishes stood stacked in the sink a coffee mug half full i lived in spare apartmentsoffices above bars i was starting to forget what it was like to live in an actual home lucy and i had owned a beautiful place in london not far from the british museum a home that was a comfort to return to in the evening full of touches of the life we were building together best not to dwell on that right now you might guess that a person named for the fagin in oliver twist would not respond to a sentimental plea to help me save my poor child it was a fourbedroom apartment one bedroom had an ikea bed a scattering of mens and womens clothes on the furniture and the floor fagin was a bit of a slob the second bedroom had six computers in it all along a table a bean bag chair a tv with an elaborate game station attached fagin still up to his old tricks two young oliver twists maybe sixteen or so sat at the computers plugged into their ipods in their envelope of music they hadnt noticed me so i went back to the kitchen got an apple from fagins fridge and washed it i took a knife from a drawer because i didnt know these sixteenyearolds and i went back to the computer room i bit into my apple and came up behind the first oliver twist he was a thin kid brown curly hair a scattering of pimples on his cheeks he was intent on what he was doing on the computer screen fingers hammering on the keyboard i glanced at the screen over his shoulder computer code but with comments written in russian i scanned them interesting mischief the oliver twists were conjuring i popped out an earplug and said hi whatcha doing he jumped out of his chair his eyes widened at the knife in my hand uh uh the other kid african american a bit older wearing a new orleans saints tshirt jeans and the ugliest yellow sneakers id ever seen bolted out of his chair i showed him the knife and he stopped what are you doing i asked again neither answered hacking into china or russia today boys i pretended like i hadnt read over their shoulders and took another bite of the apple or perhaps another country fagin loves putting the screws on egypt and pakistan again neither answered they glanced at each other silence bores me i said it makes me want to play knife games arent i nice threatening teenagers russia the saints fan said after a moment were laying data bombs into their power grid sounds very patriotic i said is fagin due here soon the saints fan nodded yes he went to go get snacks you poor deprived things didnt run out of red bull did you um actually we ran out of pepsi the thin kid said well far be it from me to interfere i said fagins an old friend im just going to wait for him slowly they sat back down and put their hands on their computer keyboards and resumed their work typing at a much slower level but neither slipped their earbuds back into place i ate my apple and watched them and waited fagin showed up ten minutes later opening his door holding a paper bag of groceries he dropped the bag when he saw me an orange tumbled from the depths and rolled to my foot what the hell sam capra hi fagin his mouth shut tight i picked up the orange and tossed it to him he caught it are you going to run or shut the door i asked he shut the door he set the small bag of groceries down on the counter he went to the door and made sure the two oliver twists were fine please i said i wouldnt hurt your kids he stole an apple said the saints fan really did he interfere with your work no they both said back to it almost as one the oliver twists put their earbuds back in place fagin set a can of cold soda by each of them the typing speed on the keyboards increased fagin crossed his arms and said whatever you want the answer is no thats a harsh hello i said i had met fagin back in my days working on the cias task force on global crime aka special projects aka the dirty down jobs we gotta do but no one is supposed to know our purview covered everything from human trafficking to arms dealing to corporate espionage in the aspect of when it threatened national security crime at this level hand in hand with terrorism is a threat to the stability of the west it reaches inside and poisons government it undermines the basic social contract down to the bone of civilization twenty per cent of the economy is now illicit the criminals are becoming more mainstream but in stopping this crime we sometimes committed crimes ourselves fagin was an example remember reading in the news when russia and its much smaller neighbor georgia got into that brief war a while back the russians launched not only bullets and missiles at georgia they took down all of georgias internet access with a massive cyber attack against critical servers the russians managed to cut off an entire nation of four million people from the internet if you were inside georgia and you tried to access cnn or the bbc web pages you got served russian propaganda if you tried to withdraw money from georgian banks your funds stayed put if you tried to email people in other parts of the country you sat and stared at your unsent message still warming your mailbox the cyber attack the russians claimed was not done by government hackers but rather by patriotic goodhearted milkdrinking russians acting independently who wanted to help fight the enemy after the war nato and the highly irritated georgians determined that some of the hackers who launched the internet attack were tied to some of the most notorious criminal rings inside russia if this vigilante hacker corps wasnt an official part of the government they were at least protected by the government and their presence gave the russian leadership necessary and plausible deniability the best hackers are not always on government payrolls sometimes you need your hackers to not be connected to you when you spend days breaking laws and flouting treaties fagin was our back pocket our deniable warrior he and his digital oliver twists when we needed things broken or stolen and there was no way it could be tied to the cia ever then special projects and fagin stepped in to pick the pocket and scurry away you dont work for special projects any more sam he said get out im a freelance consultant like you not exactly on the formal benefits package really really fagins favorite word delivered with a sneer i had once counted how many times fagin uttered really in a meeting and stopped at fifty i am here to ask you for a favor really i repeat get out im pressed for time tell me what i want to know or ill tell the north koreans about you and your crew and the russians and the chinese and the iranians fagin and his cadre of hackers spied on and created hassles for a variety of enemies maybe even some friends let me just say the french the brazilians and the japanese also all have reason to hate fagin they just dont know it you really wouldnt dare my childs life is really at stake fagin so yeah i would sit down were going to talk he sat he still looked like the computer teacher hed once been in a new york high school on the back wall was a teacher of the year award hed gotten years before back when he still taught smelling of chalk dryerase pens and fusty computer labs of course fagin had been so talented at encouraging young talent and honing minds unfortunately he encouraged them to hack into banks and government databases usually as a prank special projects had recruited him when he and his keyboarding artful dodgers tried to delve unwittingly into a front company for the cia kept him and his ipodded foundlings from a prison sentence and guided him toward more constructive pursuits to the outside world he worked as a software design consultant your childs life arent you being really melodramatic he didnt know anything about my personal life as far as i knew im looking for a young hacker of chinese descent who might have grown up here in new york oh that narrows it down he rolled his eyes really do you want the left or the right side of the phone book do you know a hacker whos vanished in the past couple of years no i saw his crossed arms tighten for just a moment i would have to ask very precise questions to get a useful answer the basic principle of fagins psychology is that knowledge and intelligence are the only currencies really i produced my cell phone i didnt say anything i just wanted him to see it right now it was more frightening than a loaded gun i think he was from new york and he did something bad enough to hide out under a false name jin ming at grad school at delft university of technology he has come back to new york at huge risk when he has every reason to dig a tunnel below a dutch canal and hide for the next ten years so im thinking its for a family reason a lot of asian kids study computers but not a lot turn to hacktivism cultural mores more respect for authority in chinese families fagin studied his fingertips not to stereotype or generalize really so how many do you know well several still a few came through my um camp ive kept tabs on them because you dont want them talking about their work with you or because youll need them again both if i show you their faces will you leave i need a name fagin and then what you dont say anything to special projects that i was here and i dont give your home address and real name to your many enemies overseas im really hurt i dont think youd do that sam my child the rules are off he stood i followed him to one of the computers i leaned close i wanted to be sure he didnt send an email to august or anyone else in special projects hackers are trickier and more subtle than pickpockets he could hit a keystroke and reformat the entire network for all i knew watching fagin at a keyboard was like watching the cobra slowly rise and undulate from the reed basket i keep a dossier on all the oliver twists he said he entered in a passcode too fast for me to register it then another one then another he had a file labeled twists and he opened it up dozens of names he clicked on a few and their files opened complete with pictures i doubt fagin had made them stand still for a picture these looked stolen from passport and drivers license pictures or even school pictures some of the kids looked to be barely thirteen or fourteen your government at work ladies and gentlemen he began to click through the photos while i watched no no no i said it would have been too much to hope that jin ming had worked for him if so then if he wanted to surrender to someone he could have run straight back to fagin none of these are jin ming jin ming jin ming i remember a jack ming jack ming that names too close to jin ming for it to be a good alias dont be stupid jin would be the surname not ming hed be called ming by his friends not jin and a good alias is one you can remember he sat down searched on jack ming on a google search news reports came up a picture oh yeah fagin said him it was the young chinese hacker thats him what did he do i only knew him by reputation supposedly he hacked bruce springsteens laptop once stole recordings of an album in development that is such heresy and thats why hes a fugitive fagin fidgeted um no he was really good at hacking copiers copiers i raised an eyebrow yes office copiers most of them have microchips now and they have internet capability they can connect to the web if they have a repair that needs to be made they can either selfdownload a fix if its a software problem or tell the repairman exactly what parts to bring and jack ming would hack copiers yes he would rewrite the software in the copier fagin tented his cheek with his tongue to do what well you could rewrite software on the chip to overheat the copier damage it or destroy it he set a copier on fire at a firm where his mother worked as a consultant the sprinklers came out caused several thousand dollars worth of damage big deal is his mommy ignoring him or and fagin gave his throat a polite clearing you could program the copier to save an image of everything it scanned and email it to you wow okay that was huge consider what a compromised copier could give you business proposals legal filings before they were given over to the court product plans confidential memos even with email now paper copies of critical documents were still used you could learn a lot about a company a project sifting through every image that came across the copier corporate espionage fagin maybe just a touch is that why jack ming had to leave new york fagin gave a slow nod he stole secrets from companies and he must have tried to sell them or somehow they backtracked the hacking to him i think if he could make copiers spy for him he could write other software to do the same i considered maybe he had maybe this was how hed stolen novem soless secrets fagin shrugged um i dont think hed come back here to see family why fagin cracked his first smile well the rumor was he caused his dads death midtown manhattan new york city his mothers apartment was several blocks north of the united nations plaza on east th street it was convenient and his mother had always treasured a smooth road in life she was not a woman who cared for bumps along the ride jack ming didnt recognize the doorman and he didnt have a key so he sat in a small elegant tea shop across the street sipping a strong cup of earl grey staving off jet lag waiting for her to come home the sky rumbled louder than the traffic the clouds began to smother the hard bright morning light a warm gusty rain began to fall fitfully he watched an umbrella salesman suddenly appear on the street corner it was almost as if the rain had conjured the man out of thin air it was unusually warm in new york after the unseasonable chill of amsterdam he thought he would never be back here he had expected a tidal wave of emotion but instead worse he felt a slow rising flood of remorse and sorrow the kind that drowned you by inches he tasted the risk like wet steel on his tongue novem soles might send a hired troll like the one hed killed in amsterdam to watch his mother and kill him if he turned up or maybe the cia had figured out who he was after he made his offer of all the moves hed made since being shot coming home felt like the most dangerous one he glanced around if her apartment was being watched then the watchers should have grabbed him the moment he appeared across the street he tucked an earphone bud into place but he kept the ipod silenced he had called the house using a prepaid phone he had bought when he arrived in manhattan as he got his mothers answering machine he had hung up and decided simply to go to her apartment his father had been wealthy and the mings had invested carefully from their days in hong kong and she still worked as a consultant from her home when she pleased mom come home he thought he tried her home phone again no answer she could be traveling for work which could mean she was anywhere from south america to hong kong to canada she could be screening her calls he could try and hack into her laptop she wasnt very security conscious but that felt like rifling through her clothing drawers or love letters from her teenage years you didnt hack your mom he waited watching the warm intermittent rain streak the glass his heart pounding she might spit in his face she might scream for the police she might call him his fathers murderer again and he wasnt sure he could take that pain fagins nest chelsea new york city fagin poured himself coffee he didnt offer me any sandra ming is former state department now she consults very well connected in both business and government she sits on boards of directors for two fortune companies americanborn but related to a prominent hong kong family the husbands name was russell ming realestate developer he died about the time that jack vanished owned properties around new york and new jersey heart attack about the time jack lit out for a moment fagins eyes went merry heart attack over his sons crimes i asked the rumor mill suggested fagin said thats a hard cross for a kid to bear i said fagin made a noise hed seen as many damaged kids as a social worker life is full of hard crosses if i could have recruited him i could have shielded him the oliver twists have never ever been caught connected to government and business i said repeating fagins own words could his mother shield him or help him reach the cia without me finding him i had one choice i had to go to the mothers house i glanced up at fagin would jack contact hackers here in town did he know any of your twists not if he wants to keep his head low if theres a price on him i might be tempted to collect it at least youre consistent fagin and what a joy that makes me but you youre not likely to turn him into the police you dont like talking to the police fagin in my defense they dont much like talking to me either where does mrs ming live fagin consulted a computer database i looked at the photo of his mother wed loaded into a browser it showed an elegant woman touching her chin in that weird authorphoto pose she was pretty but in a cold cubic way he gave me mrs mings address thank you thats it thank you youre not going to tell anyone that im here fagin wouldnt dream of it because i will tell the people who are looking for jack ming that you might know where he is and if i do that they will order me to force information from you and then to kill you you should find a better class of person for your associates fagin said and really you neednt turn into a bully tell me hacker man i said have you ever heard of a hacker in las vegas named leonie leonie growl i like kittykatstyle names fagin said just answer no but you know online we dont use our real names he widened his eyes shocking i know shes a relocator for people who want to vanish she deals with hackers around the world to get information or to help her create new identities shes not a hacker then shes an information broker hires hackers to do a bit of a job for her then uses someone else that way you never know exactly what it is shes working on or who it is shes working for you know anything about her i showed him the picture of her id taken on my phone when she slept you bored her into a sense of complacency to get this picture right have you seen her before no but isnt she the pretty one you ever hear of a woman named anna tremaine he considered and shook his head how about novem soles sounds like a catholic retreat it means nine suns in latin you ever hear of a group with that name no i got up thanks for what you could give me fagin i can give you one more thing good luck sam on finding your kid i must have let my surprise show what i cant wish you luck just keep your mouth shut fagin about me being here i dont stand between kids and their parents man by the time the kids come to me the parents have already shoved them away fagin watched sam leave then he reached for a phone sam capra could make all the threats he wanted but he did not pay the bills fagin reported the discussion and then he hung up to go see if the oliver twists were done laying their electronic mousetraps inside moscows power grid midtown manhattan new york city an hour later jack saw her his mother came along the sidewalk walking in her stiff formal way wearing a light blue raincoat her hair was impeccably styled and more gray streaked it than he remembered she held bags from a local artisan grocery and the plastic bulged with her purchases he crossed the street cutting toward her please dont turn away he thought please dont he stood and he waited for her to come to him hi mom she stopped and glanced up from the sheltering curve of the umbrella and seemed to study him as though he were a picture shed found in a drawer and couldnt place when and where it had been taken every moment of her silence was an agony he wanted the concrete beneath his feet to open like a chasm and swallow him drops of rain curtained off her tilted umbrella jack hello she just didnt seem surprised he reached for the bag of groceries those look heavy he could see in the bag rice and chicken but also oreos apples jalapeno potato chips weird she still bought his favorites she allowed him to take them yes they are thank you could we talk for a minute for just a minute she asked and now he heard the slight edge of pain in her voice not for long i know youre busy mom it had been the litany of his youth not now jack im busy yes darling ill look at your painting in a minute mamas busy i can help you with your math later jack right now im busy and finally what do the police want to talk to you about ive got a meeting with the ambassador he remembered announcing once when he was nine that he was ambassador of kidonia the nation of kids and shed laughed and hugged him and not realized he was begging for her attention he was proud of himself for keeping the bitterness out of his voice actually im not and im very pleased to see you she reached over and gave him an awkward hug the last hug hed gotten from her was when he graduated early from nyu two years ago before the fbi showed up at the doorstep looking for him he resisted the urge to embrace her to seize her hard in a hug from which she couldnt easily escape she put a hand on the side of his face he tried not to close his eyes in relief what happened to you your neck thats a surgical scar i was in an accident they shot me mom i got shot your son got shot but he couldnt say this even the thought of the words rising in his throat made him sick what accident it doesnt matter of course it matters jack why didnt you call me where have you been it doesnt matter the nakedness of the lie nearly made him gasp but instead he just held on tight to his mother after a moment her hands touched his back pressed into his flesh cautiously jack are you all right perhaps we should go inside a bit of panic edged her voice he pulled back from her and he felt mixed with the wet air tears on his face he felt mortified she said nothing as he wiped them away with the back of his hand her own face was dry as it always was have you come back to turn yourself in to the police she was a diplomat so he gave the diplomatic answer yes im tired of running im tired of hiding i wanted to see you first before i go to the police no mom i came to say goodbye he wanted to say goodbye forever i shouldnt have come its too hard well come inside well have some coffee and well call the lawyers she was still briskly efficient he thought i just want us to talk first you and me before lawyers okay his mother hurried him past the doorman and they rode in silence in the elevator up to the apartment he wanted to look at her face but instead he watched the umbrella weep leftover rain onto the floor jack stepped inside and despite the muggy warmness of the spring day he felt chilled the apartment was as he remembered magazineperfect accented with her collection of chinese art on the red walls along with photos of his mother with presidents business leaders diplomats and other notables art from her various postings in the state department hong kong vietnam south korea peru luxembourg it was as though shed played magpie around the world plucking beauty wherever she stopped decorating a nest where no other birds wished to live there was a family picture of himself and his father off in a corner on the periphery of his mothers life the edge of the circle would you like some decaf she asked do you have any regular coffee im zonked um no i now find too much caffeine disruptive only a food could be disruptive to you mom he thought jack felt torn by need and resentment two ends of the same rope tugging straight through him decaf is great are you hungry no he followed her into the kitchen watched her putter with the coffee maker how are you mom i shouldnt have come here the sudden temptation to tell her everything lay out an epic confession of the danger he faced to ask her for help was overwhelming say your goodbyes and go and dont look back ever no good will come of anything else im all right you still consulting yes here and there thinking of writing another book im glad she poured water into the coffee maker jack where have you been hiding the netherlands i suppose i should have considered that as a possibility so many young people from around the world crowding around the canals you went there for the drugs i suppose no mom i went to grad school i tried pot but frankly i would rather read a good book or see a movie she blinked a smile wavered near her mouth grad school on the run from the police you go back to school well under an assumed name how did you get a new identity transcripts how did you pay for tuition then she raised her hand as if warding off a flash of fire never mind best i dont know what additional crimes youve committed you can tell the attorney my god now the dutch will be bringing up charges against you including manslaughter he thought maybe best not to go there i would like to see dads grave there is no grave i had him cremated hes in the study hes here now she turned back toward the coffee maker of course did you think i threw him out they call it spreading the ashes mom well hes still here he wandered back into the den an urn sat atop a large bookshelf next to a row of volumes on art history it was very pretty he felt tears hot inside his face aching for release he glanced at the desk at the carpet the grief a well in him deep and dark and every awful memory rushed back in an unbidden surge how could you be so thoughtless his fathers voice rising in shock and shame the police want to arrest you what youve done is a felony i know a felony what the hell did your mother and i ever do to you to deserve this youve destroyed your life do you understand that over what pranks proving that youre smarter than everyone else because all youve done jack is prove that youre stupid beyond compare yes im sorry im so sorry sorry you did it or that you were caught i dont know i just did it youre not innocent its not a mistake no sir i did it all why why did you sell the information you stole no i dont know why i did it you expect me his father caught his breath you expect me to believe that a boy as smart as you is incapable of knowing his own motives i just did it its done jacks voice broke i love you dad im sorry i love you you love me then why do you flush your future down the toilet thats all you care about my future are you trying to suggest you did this for our attention jack oh please thats such a shallow reason babyish almost i dont know why i just dont the agony in his fathers eyes had cut jack more deftly than any ax then his father had sat down at his desk pulled a yellow legal pad toward him picked up a pencil he began scribbling thoughts on the paper we have to start considering your options your mother and i and then his father bunching up the cloth of his shirt over his chest with a surprised fist saying thats not right and then collapsing to the carpet his mother hurrying in screaming his fathers name jack grabbing the phone calling pleading for the ambulance to hurry hed set the phone down and then his mother very calmly said get out the ambulance is coming mom get out i cant i wont leave him you did this your selfish stupidity did this to him and i want you gone she knelt by her husband she didnt look at her son you have to go or the police will arrest you mom i cant leave dad you know in jail there will be no computers i dont quite know what you will do odd her calm i dont care hes dead his mother looked at him with a fierce burning glare that frightened him because it was hatred youve taken him away from me go get out of my sight right now jack i dont ever want to see you again he had turned and ran and when he went out of the building the ambulance was at the curb lights flashing too late his mother stood in the doorway watching him stare at the urn i think from a legalistic standpoint jack you should surrender to an attorney immediately i wanted a night here mom at home first please of course but the tension was tight in those two words as if she was the one who was going to be in trouble she walked back into the kitchen he followed her ill stay out of sight i know what you said before but if you didnt want to see me you wouldnt have let me come up here dont you want to spend time with me she didnt answer she upended the precisely measured water into the brewer the maker began to chug of course she said again she was turning over his crimes in her head he knew the pinched look on her face what he had done here was nothing compared to his misdeeds in amsterdam well i hacked for some bad guys i didnt know how bad they were but now they want me dead and i have a notebook that they want so badly they will kill me for it because it will blow them open and i dont even understand what i know means and im going to sell it to the cia and youll never see me again mom but you were already resigned to never seeing me again i think tomorrow we should call a defense lawyer youre right mom tomorrow okay his mother turned to him an uncertain smile on her face im right um youve never said that before i dont know what to say i wouldnt say i told you so maybe just enjoy being right for once she surprised him with a laugh all right ill bask in the glow i am happy to see you jack i really am mom the awkward silence felt like a curtain neither seemed to know what to say how to lay the first plank in the bridge i wish i hadnt gone to amsterdam mom he wanted to grab the words hanging in the air what had possessed him to confess this it was pointless hed only come to say goodbye before he vanished to australia or fiji or thailand or wherever he went with the cia money what was he hoping for she didnt know what he was here for she was just someone to whom he needed to say goodbye jail would have been better at some point id have been free now i never will be she said nothing and the coffee maker gurgled in the quiet what kind of new trouble are you in jack the back of his eyes felt warm he blinked im not in any trouble mom any new trouble he forced his emotions down but the heat kept rising into his throat dont you lie to me jack i know i didnt help you very much before she twisted the dishrag in her hands let me help you now i cant you can i i got involved with some bad people some really bad people mom i didnt know how bad she took a step forward tell me they nearly got me killed i got shot hurt bad then in the hospital they sent a guy to kill me he saw her go pale with shock oh my god jack i killed the guy i killed him and i got away and i think they will try and kill me again his mother knotted the dishrag she didnt take a step toward him and he could see her playing out the possibilities of what they should do next in her mind it was selfdefense he said tell me what happened he did did you see the gun before you hit him the question felt like a shove he shot at me mom for gods sakes dont you believe me yes of course and then you fled yes and then what he did not want to tell her about the notebook right now it lay taped to the small of his back then a friend helped me get out of the netherlands on a belgian passport he said this in the tone that he might once have used to admit he cut school you entered the united states under false pretenses with the dutch police looking for you i had to jack you always have to do the exact opposite of what you should do she put the dishrag on the counter perhaps something strong with our coffee mom im sorry then she surprised him dont apologize jack not for surviving not for staying alive i said more than i meant to she had been walking toward the counter and his words stopped her in her tracks more than you meant to you werent going to be honest with me i was going to be honest with the lawyer he lied i didnt want to burden you oh jack you think im the delicate widow it was two jabs in one youre not delicate mom i dont need to be reminded youre a widow youre still a mother the words spilled out like quicksilver faster than he could stop them youre right youre right the way i spoke to you when your father died well its done now you cannot blame me for you running away and getting into deeper trouble he blinked i dont blame you at all mom of course you do you blame me for being a bad mother you think im a bad mother no i dont he couldnt look at her face she mercifully changed the subject why exactly are these people after you its a long story im going to cancel my appointments this afternoon she said well plan out a strategy just you and me they want you dead because you know something yes maam what well i dont know anything but they think i do telling her the truth was only putting her in danger he couldnt do that hed lost his father to his mistakes he was not going to lose his mother all right but you have information you can give the police we need to be able to make a deal jack thats what im asking whats your leverage always the diplomat always the deal maker he wanted to turn around and leave just walk out the door would she call the police on him before he reached the elevator or would she let her only son simply vanish again because in the end it would be less trouble for her i can give them some names guys in amsterdam and new york well then thats a start but surely if they want you dead you know more than that not really why dont i know youre exhausted why dont you go get showered your clothes they should still fit i kept them all mom i knew youd come home you have more faith than i did jack thought suddenly the idea of his old room felt like heaven a cocoon to transform himself where he could be the old harmless jack ming again not be the kid being chased by the bad guys not be the guy sneaking into his own country under a false name not be the disappointing son coming and confessing his sins to his mother i dont want to talk to the lawyer until tomorrow though mom okay well call him in the morning he would get what he needed here for the meeting with the cia and then he would vanish this was the goodbye to his mother every moment of it she poured him a cup of coffee and he drank it down in silence it was delicious his mother always made good coffee and he thought it funny that this was the comfort food he remembered of her not peanut butter sandwiches or handmade ice cream or wonton noodles but coffee shed let him start drinking it too young never objecting when hed dump a dollop from the coffee pot into his milk just to see what she would do are you hungry she asked him now she sounded like a mom yes well why dont you go shower and get into some fresh clothes and ill make us lunch then we can talk all right she went to the refrigerator and opened it peering inside clearly hopeful that appropriate ingredients would be present he went into his room it seemed to be an echo of his old life the framed certificate of achievements from his school in math the worn paperbacks hed plowed through as a kid a neat stack of video games of which hed explored every detail of every level a row of cds hed forgotten hed owned bands that screeched about suburban angst he thought hed known then what feeling trapped was like and oh was he wrong he turned on the shower waited flicked fingers beneath the water cold he wanted it as hot as possible to rinse the dirt of amsterdam off himself he hated to stand by a shower to wait for it to warm he could go get what he needed while the shower heated his mother was busy in the kitchen he ducked out of his room padded down the hallway to his fathers study weird to think of mom living here in an apartment that seemed more dedicated to men who had left her than to her own life he ducked into the office he stepped quickly around the desk his dads heart had stuttered and failed standing in front of that desk and he didnt like to let his gaze linger on the spot it creeped him out he could still hear the thud of the body striking the floor he opened the desk drawer the keys to all seven buildings his father owned in the new york area remained in their places mother hadnt sold them thank god and he knew better than to ask he sat at the computer and brought up the ming properties website the williamsburg brooklyn property was still empty his father had not been willing to make the investment to renovate it alone and hed died before he found a partner mom hadnt done anything about it either and thank god he took the one set of keys and tucked them into his pocket she wouldnt think to miss them not with his surrender his disappearance on her mind next to the keys his fathers gun hed gotten it when he used to own buildings in neighborhoods that werent quite gentrified yet jack lifted the gun and studied it he inspected the clip three shots in it he doublechecked on the safety and he stuck it into his pocket it felt awkward he would put it in his knapsack he went back toward the shower it should be nice and steamy now and it was then that he heard the quiet of her voice she must have thought he was still in the shower she stood her back to him speaking softly over the hiss of boiling water yes hes here where do you want me to bring him he stood back from the door the notebook itching in the small of his back no i wont do that but i want to make a deal for him shock reached inside him and wrenched his stomach she had lied who the hell was she calling a lawyer so where do you want me to bring him bring him you promised mom he listened to his mother sewing up his betrayal send a car for us he might resist she dumped noodles into the pot she stirred in chopped vegetables he took a step backward not sure i can get him out of the apartment without help resist a chill flicked along his spine no no one else saw him he wants to hunker down here today silence i am so glad you called me about him thank you jack ming stepped slowly back from the kitchen he tiptoed back to his room back to the hissing steam of the shower he grabbed his backpack he left the shower jetting against the porcelain the steam curling from the bathroom like fingers raised in farewell he spared his childhood room a final bitter glance and then he hurried toward the door jack his mothers voice sliced across the room he glanced back at her goodbye mom he said you lied to me she said and he knew she meant the shower that she was the one outraged that he had not done what he said goodbye forever i still love you jack wait wait they can make all the charges go away they called me all right they called me first she knew i was coming panic flushed through him he ran not wanting to wait for the elevator feet hammering down the stairs he bolted into the lobby and out onto the street he ran the whole way to the th street subway station he got onto the first train that arrived he sat huddled on the cold plastic bench holding the backpack close to him send someone he might resist who the hell had she been talking to who would call her before he arrived this cant be not my mom he rode down to union square and then he changed trains and rode the l train into brooklyn getting off at bedford avenue station in williamsburg trust no one he thought so much for help and shelter from his mother he exited onto driggs avenue and crossed the street and watched the faces of those whod left the train with him could his mother have called someone could he have been followed her betrayal cut him to the point he could not breathe they can make all the charges go away then who the hell were they he was going to have to be very careful a plan began to form in his mind manhattan on my walk to the subway i texted leonie told her that jin ming was really a guy named jack ming and to drive our rental car and meet me at the east th street address we were so close now if i didnt find daniel well that was an option i couldnt face annas grim words i wont sell him to nice people shivered in my blood like a plucked wire daniel with my eyes and his mothers mouth handed over to someone who would abuse him use him eventually kill him when his usefulness reached its end or if he lived would the horror he survived shape him into a person bent wrong broken i had never held daniel never seen him with my own eyes but i could never abandon him to such a fate never it was strange to ride the subway knowing i was heading to kill someone a guy who smelled of mints stood too close to me a girl with purplish lanky hair stared at my shoes and through her earphones just once i could hear distant strains of mozart wandering into the train like a lost tourist two people across from me chatted in portuguese and i eavesdropped on their gossip you spend your childhood traveling the world you pick up a little of a lot of languages they were talking about a boyfriend his pros and cons his smile his cheapness in picking restaurants normal everyday talk and i was sitting there thinking about how to kill a young man in cold blood across from sandra mings apartment tower stood a sushi bar it was decorated in a spare minimalist style and in the background regrettable japanese pop played but at least at a whisper the chef seemed very angry he scowled as he chopped at the ahi the sea urchin the inoffensive salmon he muttered in japanese and i nearly told him in his own language that he might consider anger management classes i could tell from his face that he liked chopping flesh apart it was good that a man like him had a creative outlet i got my lunch and sat watching in the window the fish the rice the wasabi all had no flavor to me rain heavier in the morning had lightened now the day was gray the wind carrying the scent of the unfallen storm i had not seen any sign of mrs ming or her son arriving at or leaving the building i didnt want to think of him as a jack jack ming sounded like the name of some kid i could have known in any of the american or anglican schools id attended in fourteen different countries in my misspent youth hauled around the globe by my parents who worked for a relief agency they were good people but more concerned with fixing the world than paying more than five minutes attention to their own children i loved them and they appeared to love me and not much more else to say on that front im sure the armchair psychologists would have a field day dissecting my youth and how it related to my stolen child but its not like i could let any child be taken this way my son or not there are standards you have to fight back leonie slid onto the stool next to me you found him i did without a database she made it sound like i had somehow cheated yes she opened up her laptop and now what we sit here and wait for him to show up and she lowered her voice you shoot him dead in the street no i swallowed the last bit of sushi on my plate it offered only sustenance not pleasure waiting to kill someone makes you feel dead inside were only supposed to do what anna told us she said and i wondered what she would do if i picked up the chopstick oiled with soy sauce and wasabi and shoved it into her ear i have done both my job and a key part of your job so far i said you are rapidly losing your right to a vote in this sam okay you had resources i didnt but i found out about jack ming something you didnt know what i dont think he will come to see his mother why not she blames him for his fathers death i glanced at her how would you know i built a network of names around jack ming she said yes he went to nyu so i did searches on people that were in his facebook account before he canceled it i wanted to expand our search see how many links i could find people where he might hide i didnt ask how shed gotten this information shed worked her stealthy smoky fingers into the right database or paid off the people who could and and one of his friends wrote a blog post about jacks situation apparently his father died of a heart attack when he found out that jack was wanted by the fbi for questioning for hacking copiers and stealing proprietary information from a number of law firms and software companies he died here at jacks feet his friend wrote about this honestly people will say things on the internet now that they might once not have told their parents a little secrecy is not a bad thing i will confess i dont get the whole need to twitter and facebook and share my every reaction to a tv show or to bad service at lunch or to post every news article i find remotely interesting id spent five minutes looking at twitter once and felt id wandered into a poker game where everyone immediately displayed their hands against the cool green of the felt i suppose an exspy cannot get over his or her innate quiet the need to keep thoughts and secrets close but jack ming was a kid and hed left electronic breadcrumbs at the feet of his friends there is always a trace shed said and now shed found it his friend wrote about jacks mother she opened the laptop turned it toward me so i could read i understand grief i think because my grandparents died when i was young and my dog died last year death is part of life but what i do not understand is blame my friend jacks father died because he got a shock over something jack is accused of doing not anything proven and even if jack did do this to blame him for killing his father what kind of mother says that to her son i am thankful for my mom right now good lord i thought what did we do before blogs would anyone have written this up and sent it into the newspapers letters section or stood on a tottery soapbox at the corner of the park and brayed out their thoughts about a private family matter while still somehow making it all about themselves jack mustve confided in the friend after his fathers death i turned my gaze back onto mrs mings building doorway the doorman stood there watching the rain so our jack and mama ming are not close but hes desperate truly desperate and and what if hes turning himself into the cia then hes planning to vanish maybe he wants his mother to go with him or maybe hes coming here to say goodbye to her a final goodbye i dont know i didnt want to know this about jack ming i didnt want to know him as you know a person i wanted to know where he stood at a certain moment and where i could kill him without getting caught i closed my eyes novem soles was going to form me into a monster sure as dr frankenstein stitching together the quilt of corpses castoffs and blasting wasted vein and muscle with electricity i didnt know what i would be when i arose from the laboratory table except i hoped id be a father with his child back but i didnt want to know about jack mings problems his problems were all going to go away very soon jack mings dad dying at his feet it made me think of danny my brother not my son my brother hed died in an awful humiliating way gone to afghanistan as part of a relief team hed pushed past the boundaries of common sense in his drive to help people ventured with a college friend into the scrubby hills beyond kandahar gotten grabbed no one heard from him for three weeks and then the video flickered into monstrous life viraled by youtube danny my brother kneeling on a dried mud floor surrounded by balaclaved thugs who made him spout nonsense in a voice so quavering it was hardly his own then spoke their own sacrificial junk then cut off his head while the camera ticked off every final second then they cut his friends throat you think murder splinters a family or brings it closer together i dont know depends on how thick the glue has already been laid but execution is a different kind of murder when your brother is decapitated with an armsized knife because he went to help people and anyone in the free world can see his final moments courtesy of the unthinking unblinking internet then it is your familys worst nightmare made public made entertainment made eternal you can never block the memory of it the horror is just a few clicks away would you believe people emailed me the link to the video they did i dont know why they would what kink of cruelty drove them but they did do you think he could turn to one of these old friends i asked hes still wanted for questioning by the fbi so he might not get a warm reception from a friend who doesnt want to be made an accessory those charges will go away if he gets his meet with the cia i said itll be part of the surrender deal guaranteed but surely his own mother would be the least likely person to turn him in true shes a career diplomat she has a lot to lose if he resurfaces he could be an embarrassment so what we sit here and wait and scarf california rolls all day like private eyes on surveillance he could have already been here and gone the desperation painted her voice no i said we go in and if hes there well thats done and if hes not we find out where he is a limo slid up to the curb a uniformed man with a strong build got out spoke to the doorman a few moments later sandra ming stepped outside wheres the rental car i said around the corner in a garage i want you to follow that limo i want to know where shes going leonie slammed the laptop shut mrs ming spoke with the driver he appeared to be showing her some sort of id the doorman had taken a careful step back toward his usual perch itll be gone before i can catch up leonie said just go wheel around shell still be here ill make sure i dont know how to tail a car follow where it goes and dont get caught its for the children thanks leonie sprinted out of the sushi bar the angry chef glaring at her like she was dodging the bill i threw ample dollars at the wasabi bowl as i came out onto th into the humid curtain of the day the limo driver closed the rear passenger door behind mrs ming and ducked back behind the wheel i had to time this as carefully as a shot get across the street without being hit by either a cab or a bicycle or another car time it so i got a word with that driver i pulled my phone from my pocket placed it before my eyes the modern electronic blinder my thumbs scrabbled on the touchscreen like i was writing the most urgent message in the history of humanity i kept my gaze down hung back from the car trying to move fast enough and also not veer out of the drivers blind spot i risked a glance a taxi barreled toward me but i still had room he was clearly expecting me to jog pick up the pace new york cabbies are reincarnated kamikaze pilots and they subscribe to the inarguable theory that its best that you get out of their way its the food chain at work the limo yanked out from the curb and i stepped right in its way the right front fender clipped my leg a nice hard tap that would register not only in my pain centers but inside the limo itself i yelped and fell sprawling back into the street diving like a soccer player hoping for a red card against the opposition and the cab stopped about a foot from my head i could see the reflection of my face carnivalhouse bent in the gleam of its newly washed fender the driver and the cabbie both burst from their cars the limo driver saying nothing which made him very unusual you might expect protestations of innocence or of concern the limo driver just looked at me with eyes carved from the same indifferent chrome as the cabbies fender the cabbie practically brayed at me in english accented with a sharp hebrew the doorman though he was golden he bolted forward knelt by me sir you okay ohhhh i moaned my leg you stepped out in front of me the limo driver said its your fault watch where youre walking he spoke with a mild eastern european accent sandra ming i saw remained in the limo youre right i said shakily the doorman helped me to my feet i i think im okay the limo driver the doorman they exchanged a glance pure unease the doormans said i dont think this is the kind of guy whos gonna sue if we help him the drivers said i dont care he looked like hed just as soon run over me as he would a speed bump the cabbie hovered uncertain good you were paying attention i said to the cabbie unlike some others there i threw down the gauntlet the limo driver slid his steely stare back onto me as the doorman forced me toward the curb traffic began to back up behind the cabbie horns jeering in the infinitely patient way of new yorkers the cabbie saw i was now the doormans problem he started to slide back into his taxi and four cars behind him i could see leonie in a silver prius she wore an expression on her face that mixed nervousness with the determination only a parent can have i staggered to the curb waving off help im all right i said normally a person might ask the driver for his license or his phone number in case there was a further injury and i thought about it but i weighed that it might send his suspicions soaring i didnt like the vibe from him at all he was watching me in the way that the interviewers did years ago when i applied at special projects measuring me solely as an enemy i didnt know who he was and i decided it was best to play nice now that leonie was in position i raised a hand it was my fault youre right i wasnt watching what i was doing sorry i put my phone down at my side and powered it off the driver inspected me with a studied glance what what the hell now i said earning an oscar nomination for my role as irritated new yorker the limo driver got back into the car without another word and he inched away from the curb other cars caught in the jam had filtered past him but when he merged into the stop and start traffic leonie in the rented prius was two cars behind him she looked like she intended to cement herself to his bumper i noticed shed put on large heavy sunglasses big and dark enough that she could have done welding wearing them and her lush auburn hair was pulled back and covered with a mets baseball cap something about her look was vaguely familiar i was nervous for her she wasnt trained to shadow someone shed been up most of the night and was running on excitement and fear the driver looked like a tough customer she was clearly smart booksmart and if she was used to dealing with criminals she must have developed her own toughness she had to follow him you sure youre all right the doorman said my legs hurting and i think my phones broken i just need to sit down for a minute i was careful not to ask him to let me inside the building let it be his idea sir come here why dont you sit inside for a minute or at least wash the grit off your hands is there someone i can call for you the air inside felt nice after the humid squeeze of the afternoon the doorman pointed to a bathroom where i could rinse my bloodied knuckles and i thanked him im sure im okay i dont want to be any trouble ill just wash up and let myself back out i limped extra hard as i walked to the mens room another resident a heavyset man pushing an older woman in a wheelchair exited the elevator and the doorman moved to open the door for them the heavy man was busy convincing the wheelchair lady that going for an outing even with the chance of rain was a good idea his words running over the protestations of the woman like water gushing in a stream i washed my hands quickly then i glanced out the bathroom door the doorman was busy hailing the pair a cab i had gotten very few lucky breaks since my pregnant wife vanished but this was one of them i ducked into the elevator sandra ming was on the fourth floor the doorman would likely look for me or he might assume i slipped out when he was hailing cabs or providing directions to confused tourists so i didnt have much time no answer to the knock at the mings door i dropped to my knees and brought out the lock picks thirty seconds later the door was open i shut it behind me and listened to the hush no one was here i didnt have a gun with me and i moved through the rooms den decorated with objet dart from china from africa from south america a mayan mask frowned at me from the wall a kitchen the coffee maker was on the scent of dark french roast a caress in the air a length of hallway and a master bedroom immaculate a womans room it held a womans scent a subtle mix of irises and dior perfume my wife had worn the same scent and for a moment grief overwhelmed my caution nothing like a memory of your wifes skin to bring down the avalanche i pushed it away back down the hallway past a study where i glanced into the doorway a large desk one with a masculine weight that didnt quite match the feel of the rest of the apartment i stepped into a bedroom frozen in postcollegiate amber jack mings room a framed diploma from nyu a collection of books but not textbooks these were books he liked to read a wellworn history of hong kong had he been happy there biographies about computer pioneers like charles babbage ada lovelace and steve jobs george r r martins epic fantasies a bound collection of graphic novels of iron man spiderman the avengers from the wall jack mings face looked out at me from a scattering of party pictures the kind taken by a pro photographer at college events his smile looked pained as though the party wasnt quite his deal his hair was longer and his face was fuller his friends often had buzzed smiles and protective arms around jacks slender shoulders he had a shy but sincere grin he was just a kid goddamn it just a kid i was supposed to kill the apartment was cool but a finger of humidity slid down my spine as i walked into the bathroom i checked the tub droplets still beaded the surface the bathroom was connected to his room no reason for anyone else to shower in here jack ming had been here recently within the past hour i might only have missed him arriving at my perch at the sushi bar by minutes daniel could die because id missed him dust a light coating touched his bedroom desk it didnt look like hed set anything down in here i could see the barest indentation on the bed where he had sat hed come here hed left without his mother had he said his goodbyes was she not helping him your wanted son reappears on the run and within an hour the reunion is done and hes fled and moms in a limo with a driver who looks like he used to train boxers for the russian olympic team what had jack ming needed here something more than saying farewell to his mother i went back to her bedroom and made a fast but thorough search i found nothing of interest sandra ming had stripped her life down to the barest essentials there was a small elegant phone by the bedside i picked it up and hit star the phone rang on the fourth ring someone picked up but there was only silence i waited the other side waited i could hear a soft soft breathing i took a jump yes im calling on behalf of mrs ming the other side hung up who would she call when her son arrives out of the mists for a presumably unexpected reunion was that who had dispatched the limo driver i went into the study jack mings father russell had gotten his start in the madhouse of hong kong real estate and then set up a property development company here framed on the walls were photos of him with other famous developers new york celebrities smiling politicians several pictures of him and jack his arm around his son people sure liked to put their arms on jacks shoulders maybe he was one of those people who inspired a need to protect to shelter i tried not to dwell on those pictures he couldnt be someones son not like daniel was he just had to stay a target faceless inhuman i hadnt wanted to know about his life just how to end it there were no pictures of mr and mrs ming together the absence of a picture is also worth a thousand words a thin sheen of dust on the desk had been disturbed it didnt seem to be used by mrs ming there were no papers or files on its surface a screen saver danced across the monitor i looked at the keyboard dust on some keys not on others someone had used this keyboard for the first time in a long while jack i moved the mouse and the computer woke up it wasnt passworded the screen background was a picture of jack and his father a click gave me the most recently used applications word firefox excel i started them went to the histories of each opened the most recent files the excel spreadsheets were over a year old and had been created by russell ming as part of his business the word documents were also all russell mings mostly related to his business but one that was a letter to his son jack reading this felt like peering into a grave i didnt want to see it but you couldnt help it it was like a diary falling open to a page dear jack first of all you know this but it bears saying i love you there is nothing you can do or could ever do that will lessen my love for you i want you to tell me what it is that is troubling you so and i want the truth as much as it could hurt i want to know what you think youve done i want you to tell me not your mother lets have this be between us because i dont think that she will and there the letter stopped as though hed decided not to continue with an unspoken unspooled thought what had he not wanted to say about his lovely diplomat wife did the heart attack take before hed finished the sentence i checked the date on the document the day that hed died these might have been russell mings final writings or maybe this was when jack came into the room and it was better to talk to his son than to write him a letter daniel if i find you i promise my last word to you will not be an unfinished sentence i checked the browser history the last website visited had been about a property in brooklyn in williamsburg it was on mings company website seven commercial properties were listed and this one was empty unrented the browser showed the previous six entries were all for other ming properties jack had checked all his fathers holdings found one that wasnt in use maybe a good place for him to hide i memorized the address it was the only vacant property belonging to the management company i started to search the desk very little here russell mings expired passport pens and pencils a legal pad with a faded pencil sketch that said jacks options surrender to the police let jack and then nothing else written as though the thought had been interrupted like the word document in one drawer was a nest of keys with tags on them addresses marked in a careful blue pen i searched through them the keys for the brooklyn property were gone an empty building where he controlled access the perfect place for him to surrender to the cia and make his deal with august hed come home for the keys i looked through the rest of russell mings computer quickly jack ming was a hacker the kind of kid whose fingertips felt lonely without a keyboard he had evidence against novem soles and maybe hed backed it up here but in the machines history there was no sign of new files or of downloaded or uploaded files on this system no emails sent he hadnt even bothered to clean out the browser history maybe leonie could make sense of it i unhooked the laptop from the external keyboard and monitor maybe a thought rumbled in my ear maybe what hes got on novem soles isnt on a computer maybe its physical something hes carrying maybe a hacker who knows just how vulnerable most computers are wont trust this information to a machine i had to find him now hed taken the keys to the brooklyn building maybe thats where he intended to hide maybe where he would go right this moment morris county new jersey if there was something worse than feeling helpless it was feeling useless leonie gripped the steering wheel as she followed the limo sam had found jin ming or rather jack ming and she had done what frittered her time away trying to delve into databases bribing hackers to unlock the secrets of the man who had snuck into the country sat typing while these murderous freaks had her child and now what she didnt know how to tail anyone she kept expecting the limo to pull over to the side the driver to watch her glide past with a knowing sneer that he knew she was there and that he could lose her at any time or worse maybe he would kill her to protect mrs ming was he cia was he nine suns if he was why didnt he just hand mrs ming over to her and sam the limo headed west into suburban new jersey along highway finally turning north on toward lake hopatcong the rain parted like a curtain the sky showed elusive patches of grayblue weak sunlight fell in rays among the breaks like a handful of sand sifting through fingers she kept two cars between her and the limo and every time another car tried to edge in she would grit her teeth and stand her ground and think god dont let me lose them she nearly wrecked twice driving through parsippany cars trying to get across lanes and her not yielding an inch her hands trembled on the wheel the limo turned off the highway into a stretch of parkland she hung back it was more dangerous to get too close to the limo she craved a cigarette the limo whipped around a turn shaded by oaks signs indicated this was private property and warned against trespassing in the strictest terms she drove past and if the limo driver was watching her was suspicious of her he would think he was wrong she hoped she pulled the car off to the side of the road nosing it into a thick grove of oaks she could wait for sam that would be best and if the drivers job was to eliminate mrs ming or to question her about jacks whereabouts then all was lost she and sam had to find him first had to eliminate him before he could betray novem soles she shivered she tried calling sam the call rolled to voicemail she told him where she was and that she was going to follow the road the limo had taken on foot she kept the tremble out of her voice if you stay in the car your baby could die dont be afraid you can do this its up to you and a strength flooded her she could do this she got out of the car and she started to walk through the dense woods she could see the thin line of paved road the limo had taken she reached a fence eight feet tall another big no trespassing sign she clambered over the fence using the sign for leverage she dropped down into high grass she ran parallel to the road staying in the heavy growth of trees mud sucked at her shoes the air felt stitched with the damp rain lingering on leaves fell onto her shoulders and her head the road turned again she climbed over some rainslick rocks feeling breathless she would see what the driver and mrs ming were doing if she could she would get the woman away because if mrs ming was the key to knowing what jack was doing next then she must belong to her and sam alone nature she thought the air smelled heavy with moss and an underlying scent of heathurried decay it wasnt so bad out here maybe she should get away from the computer more she imagined going for a long hike although she hadnt gone hiking since long childhood walks with taylor secure on her back the sun warm on their faces not in vegas too hot she could take taylor to lake tahoe for a long weekend soon when all this was over stroll in the shade of the trees point out the flowers imprint good memories do the things shed said shed do if she ever had a child if she ever had another chance grief prickled her face you can do this in the distance leonie heard a woman scream short and sharp it was as though the wind carried the noise dropped it into her lap like a gift for a moment she froze then she bolted dodging through the trees she slipped and skidded down a muddy incline shed slid down to the road which curved hard and fed directly into an old house ahead of her she saw the limo parked there and no other car the house needed paint it needed a carpenter odd impressions that flickered across her mind between her and the house there was a big square of clear lawn she would have to cross no sign of the driver or of sandra ming she ran across the lawn she went onto the porch trying to be quiet the boards creaked slightly and every moan of the wood felt like a knife in the skin she kept waiting for the driver to explode out of the front door but the door stayed shut she pressed an ear to a window listened heard nothing but the rasp of her own breathing sam please where are you please get here for a moment she thought maybe whoever this is cia or whoever maybe they got sam they left someone behind at the mings to wait for jack and theyve killed sam maybe its just me left to save my kid me alone youve gotten through worse she told herself curtains thick streaked with age blocked her view through the window the porch felt exposed it offered little cover weird she thought im thinking like a soldier she crept around the corner staying on the porch toward the detached garage she stayed low and moved quickly and she was so proud of herself that for a moment she didnt feel when the taser needles hit her but the charge made her dance off the porch tumbling into the neglected rose bushes the thorns pricking her face the bolt surging pain into her bones like water flooding a pipe she turned saw the limo driver thumbing the controls for another hit the last thing she smelled was the rose petals crushed under her body like a grandmother smell her mouth twisting trying to scream for sam to help her east th street manhattan i ran back down to the lobby the doorman stood by the glass entrance and when he saw me exit off the elevator carrying a laptop he stormed back through the door well stormed rather politely sir i know you needed to recuperate but this is a private building and i punched him hard one smart blow in the tender spot between the edge of the jaw and the lip he staggered back and i hammered a fist into his gut and then into the vulnerable joining of neck and nerve sorry i said really mister he folded i knelt went through his pockets and found a passkey i stood and hurried down the hallway saw a door marked security i keyed the door with the passkey a rented cop stood before a set of monitors he charged at me going for his holster i knocked him down and i took the gun from him i told him to sit down he obeyed turn around and no im not going to kill you i slammed the gun into the back of his head three times and he went down i went to the security recording rewound i saw myself enter i saw mrs ming exit i saw people come and go as fast and as energetically as if they had espresso in their blood then him jack ming leaving alone practically running out of the building at the exit he turned left a bit more rewinding and i saw him enter the building with his mother this i played slowly on another monitor a woman got off the elevator and screamed when she saw the fallen doorman okay i was officially out of time thank you for playing footage of jack ming walking inside the building with his mother the body language was clear the kid was anxious he was holding two grocery bags and he kept swinging them over his feet a small knapsack sat on his back that hed left with as well he kept glancing about not even looking at his mother while they waited for the elevator and mrs ming you could tell this was not a happy reunion she was not touching her child she was not looking at her longdeparted wantedbythepolice kid she was looking at the tile floor and her watch did she have an appointment to keep she looked as though she wanted to wriggle free of her own skin and slither away she kept shaking the rain from her umbrella it was a constructive action something to do other than watch her kid i stopped the digital recording i erased it from jacks appearance to now and then i powered down the cameras there was no point in me being remembered either i hurried out the door past the woman crouching by the unconscious doorman she had a cell phone pressed to her ear she called to me to help her but i ignored her i let the traffic carry me along i wanted out of this neighborhood now i went down to the th street subway station rode the train to grand central got off i found a store in the terminal and put the laptop in a knapsack id bought i tried leonie on the cell phone there was no answer i didnt like that at all maybe she didnt like to talk on the phone while she drove but i figured that for me shed make an exception for a moment i felt torn i had the address of an empty building where my target would be and if youre planning to kill someone an empty building in new york city is convenient but having leonie tag after the limo driver felt like a mistake now jack had left his mother behind and maybe she knew where he was but maybe she didnt i had an address an actual throbbing clue and leonie could be off with our car on a fools errand i stepped back out onto the street trying to decide what to do the wind broke the rain clouds into jagged curls of gray the sun flooded the sky weak as tea the iphone rang inside my pocket the phone that anna had given me yes sam leonie her voice tight and stiff rattled by fear there is a certain pronunciation made when the lips are bruised you dont quite form your words right yes oh god i messed up i messed up please and then the limo drivers voice you you sent this woman to follow me who are you dont hurt her if you dont want her hurt then you come get her no not now i had the address where jack most likely had run i had jack ming in my grasp what would you do to save your child shed asked me a choice what would i do to save my child would i sacrifice this woman who was basically a stranger a little awful voice inside me said you dont need her you found jack not her what good is she what has she done to help save your kid it was from a dark corner deep in the well of my soul but when you are in a battle for your childs life darkness stands close to you whispers in your ear nine suns wasnt going to give me daniel or give leonie her daughter if jack ming breathed long enough to turn himself into the cia i strongly suggest that you listen to me mister retrieve your bitch or ill cut her throat in the background i could hear leonie gasping saying dont dont i couldnt tell if she was talking to me or to the driver then a piercing scream where are you i managed to say he gave me an address and directions to morris county in northern new jersey i clicked off the phone if i made the wrong choice i could be abandoning either a woman i barely knew who seemed to hold me in contempt to death or my own child if the situation was reversed what would i want her to do leave me to die absolutely go save the kids lady what happens to me is nothing go we hadnt anticipated an enemy beyond special projects who would not have grabbed one of us and threatened us with death caught up in the mad rush to find jack ming i had not planned for this contingency it was on me i went outside stood on the sidewalk in the warming humidity and i started to shudder it felt like every nerve in my body was wired to open current i gave myself thirty seconds of weakness and i stopped shivering then i put the decision aside leonie was in the greatest danger right now i could no more leave her to die than i could anyone else i started to walk i needed a car a couple of turns later i saw a parking garage four suited men coming down the ramp to merge into the river of pedestrians i maneuvered carefully bumping directly into the one whod had his hand in his right front pocket as he had turned from the ramp onto the sidewalk jesus watch where youre going jerkwad he snapped at me my bad im very sorry i said i turned into the parking ramp and hurried up the stairs i didnt even glance to see which keys id pickpocketed off him until i was on the second level a mercedes logo on the keychain i ran along the parked cars testing the automatic unlock until headlights on an se flashed at me one minute later i was heading toward the lincoln tunnel if you save her and jack ming gets away i had to get a grip focus i wanted to make good time the limo driver apparently had and i thought please dont let there be bad traffic or an accident dont let the guy whose car im stealing realize his keys are gone let the doorman and the guard be okay after i punched them forgive me everything i do to save my son dont let me fail along highway new jersey the garden state you tend to forget that new jersey deserves that name when youre stuck driving through an endless unfurling of suburbia i drove at top speed and the rain that had hurried in from the atlantic passed through here the rain was like a hand cleaning a slate the air smelled wet and fresh and new i drove i didnt use the cars gps if it had been reported stolen by now i didnt want the system tracking where i was i kept it switched off okay now who had leonie and mrs ming jacks mom had called someone and then the limo driver had collected mrs ming now i would not put it past special projects if they figured out like i had that jack ming was their new best buddy fagin might have tattled to scoop up mrs ming for her own protection against novem soles and they might even to lure me in close pretendthreaten leonies life if august was at this house fine wed talk and maybe hed let me take some photos of jack ming looking dead if his people had already nabbed jack but but if august was involved in this operation the limo driver wouldnt have been on the phone it would have been august right i was not optimistic that special projects had leonie it had to be the dreaded someone else an enemy i didnt know the phone anna gave me rang again as i turned into the address yes i said sounding impatient hello sam anna tremaine what i would like to know your status ill call you when the jobs done has leonie found the informant ill call you when the job is done i made the words short clipped you know she said i dont think youve heard your baby cry hes been rather fussy today well both these babies are unhappy i wonder do you think they can sense their precariousness i dont know how to describe the dark surge over my heart i dont have the words for it it was a blackness i hadnt felt it in my worst moments when i saw my brother die on a scratchy video when my wife was kidnapped in a street of fire when i was tortured and accused of being a traitor choking to death when i couldnt give the company answers i didnt know ive had more than my share of really bad moments this was even darker this was reaching into me and smearing something foul on my soul it took all my will to keep my breath steady i am doing what you asked you dont hurt him you do not hurt either of them but the jobs not done yet and you wont tell me whats happening she sighed im playing with his little fingers right now sam theyre more delicate than bone china i told her briefly what i knew and what i was doing for several moments she was silent then she said listen sam listen to your son im going to put the phone right by him and i could hear the phone a hiss of breath a gurgle my son i had never heard him a soft ahhhhhh all baby breath all happy toothless mumble then choked frustrated gurgling he wasnt happy bored or annoyed at the phone resting next to his face daniel daniel this is daddy like he could understand like my voice would mean anything to him my soft baritone was as alien to him as any other sound hed never heard my words my voice could give him no comfort id never thought about what id say to him he was a baby what would he understand id never been around babies i was the youngest in my family daniel its daddy im coming to get you he fussed he squawked he cried maybe he wanted anna to pick him up again he wanted anna the idea made me want to vomit he wanted a woman who would hurt him that was true innocence im going to be there soon son well be together okay this is daddy i love you daniel i love you i did love him i loved him sight unseen i love you i love sam annas voice was back listen to me morris county new jersey leonie looked up from staring at the floor the driver hadnt planned on two victims she supposed he only had the one set of handcuffs and hed chained mrs ming to another wooden chair hed bound leonie with rope from a closet in the house the living room was small the wallpaper old and twenty years out of fashion musty with grime the house carried the feel of a way station a place used infrequently leonie sat her knees folded beneath her watching the driver pace the floor the driver had moved into the front rooms to watch the windows for sam help me mrs ming whispered to her leonie glanced at her im curious as to what you expect me to do it wasnt the answer mrs ming was looking for hes not from the cia hes not they said they would send someone the cia yes mrs ming said leonie inched closer to her the cia is looking for your son a man who said he was from the cia called me this morning they said jack might be coming home to call them if he did i i didnt know to believe him but i went to the grocery in case i got jacks favorite things to eat her voice sounded lost leonie looked at her where is your son i dont know tell me he left i dont leonie leaned back and headbutted the woman tell me where he is mrs ming howled in anger and pain hey hey the limo driver said hurrying into the room kicking leonie onto her back stop it he murmured again into his open phone too low to hear and then clicked it off youre not from the cia mrs ming said blood oozing from the corner of her mouth her forehead vivid with the imprint of leonies head you cannot keep me here you cannot they will look for me you he said to leonie youre with sam capra she said nothing and he responded in his accented english bitch i am short on patience and he began to kick her hard the first blow sent her across the room then he asked her a question received hazily through the pain that made no sense to her at all where is the woman called mila morris county new jersey i saw the rental prius nosed into a grove of trees i turned in and climbed a wall and headed down a long paved road a sign read private drive no trespassing ahead was a long curving driveway and a house that looked like it might once have been a grand home or summer retreat from the start of the twentieth century shed tried to sneak in but i was expected zero point in anything except walking straight into the house my phone rang again come to the front door nothing funny or the redhead dies and you get to watch short and sweet i made my way to the front door across a grand porch i opened the door and stepped into a large foyer here a voice called i headed back from the front of the house and went to my left and entered what might once have been a library or study the limo driver must have been a boy scout he was extremely well prepared he aimed a gun at me and held another pressed against leonies temple he had a taser tucked into the side of his pants leonies face was bruised along the jawline hi he said you heal fast bumper boy vitamins and milk but those are not brain food he said he tapped leonies head with the gun for emphasis im thinking you know the drill im not armed i said liar if i check you and you have a gun im going to shoot off this bitchs thumbs i produced the security guards gun from the back of my pants and dropped it on the floor kick it over he said i did as he said who are you with he asked me me myself and i i said he switched the gun over to mrs mings head and she began to wail i dont believe you im not sure who youre more interested in your partner here or your target i dont want anyone hurt then who are you with im with nobody i said were looking for mrs mings son and you thought i was bringing her to him i did not now he gave a twisted little laugh now that i was unarmed he put a gun up against each of their heads toying with me im not sure which one you want alive the most he said both of them ten feet separated us plenty of time for him to shoot me if i made a move i knew at least that with mrs ming he was bluffing hed brought her here to hold her or to question her on someones orders are you with novem soles because were on the same side then and this is a misunderstanding the thought that anna could have opened up a bounty on jack ming occurred to me they just wanted him dead they wouldnt care if it was by my hand novem what nine suns sounds like a slant restaurant he seemed to be taking my measure with his gaze mrs ming stared at him with hate in her eyes youre the one answering questions not me whos your friend her name is leonie and where would i find mila i gave your friend a roughing up and she didnt know not a question i was expecting at all what the hell just happened i have no idea he eased the gun over toward leonies eye i want you to tell me how to find mila mila contacts me when it suits her i said youre going to tell me how i can find mila or im going to kill one of them he shoved the guns hard against their skulls mrs ming let out a twisted moan leonie bit her lip and her gaze locked with mine not sure which guess well know when i pull the trigger on five one two three she sometimes meets me at a bar i said in a rush she calls she picks the bar and define sometimes once a week when im in new york i lied but its on her schedule not mine he studied my face sit down on the floor keep your hands behind your back i obeyed he took the gun off sandra ming and holstered it and then he produced a cell phone from his pocket he tapped buttons and in russian he said yes sir i have him now he says the woman will meet him at a bar every week but she calls him he listened for thirty seconds yes all right he closed the phone its hard to keep three prisoners when one is unsecured right now he wanted me talking but he hadnt secured me hed used the women as hostages but he was keeping his distance from me the women were my bonds but his bonds were that he wasnt master of his own fate he had to call someone someone he called sir he had to take orders from someone and speaking russian into the phone he hadnt wanted me to know that he hadnt wanted me to know he was well not the top of the totem pole but he didnt draw the second gun again he felt very much in control i watched him he watched me a minute ticked by then another he didnt shoot any of us or ask any questions or say what was going to happen next i find silences awkward i said he clearly didnt let me guess your boss said not to ask us any questions he looked at me im sure he doesnt want you to know what the information we have is worth you might cut a slice for yourself shut up he said you bore me you didnt even try to fight coward did he tell you how much the bounty on mila is shut up he said again but after a pause i presume once he gets here all you do is dig the graves i said i bet he doesnt even give you one per cent of the cut on mila what are you paid by the hour im sure that was why you came to the land of opportunity to dust grave dirt off your hands while your boss collects an insane amount of money he wouldnt get without your help he stared at me his mouth opened and i could see a little strand of spit bridge his lips he told you to sit on us hed be out here soon or she i was quiet for a minute he didnt tell you how much mrs mings son is worth either he stared at me but he swallowed at the same time i had a noose around his neck now so to speak so i gave it a hard tug mila presently has the highest price on her head in the world for someone who isnt a head of state or terrorist and i know how to get her and youre just going to hand over that information to your bosses and let them score the profit but thats okay i guess you get to wash the limo at the end of the day i would like to know who the hell mila is leonie said shut up the driver said to her he looked back at me and laughed why would you want me to profit more than my boss it makes no difference as to whether you live or die ive been screwed over by a boss before i said very badly i dont much like bosses because i always did the hard dangerous work and they got all the credit milas my boss and im not about to die for her then i played the trump a million thats what the bounty is and i know some people who will pay at least a million probably double for mrs mings son he stole something from them they want it back your boss will be taking that money to the bank as well watch me tap dance i love to improvise he said nothing he just stared his cell phone rang again he opened it and said in russian yes he listened yes i can stay longer of course is is there anything you want me to find out from them silence yes sir he clicked off let me guess he doesnt want you talking to us i said i love being right hes been delayed and he doesnt want you knowing what we know you might decide that you could profit i dont want this man mad at me he said of course not i said he has all the power what do you have hes going to have three million dollars a million for mila a million for the kid a million for what the kid stole his mouth worked what the hell are you doing leonie said shut up she stared at me the barrel of the drivers gun still indenting her hair you and i could cut a deal i said you let these two go and you and i collect the bounties together he laughed and i trust you why because ive told you the truth and you suspect im right and your boss hasnt told you squat except spit out a bunch of orders and let you take all the risk i put a heaviness on those final words youre the errand boy youre not a player i guess youre not ready shut up leonie said you be quiet the driver said i let them go they go to the police its always delicious when a notbright person begins studying the angles no the people paying the bounties have their kids i said theyve got control over them they will go home and cry for their kids sometimes the unexpected happens sometimes a word is a bomb leonies eyes went wide with shock her jaw trembled she turned her head and the drivers gun lay square in her forehead she stared up past the gun at him coiled he glanced at her then he made his mistake he looked up at me how do i know that any of what you said is true lying is not hard i dont know why the psychologists pronounce it as difficult lying is the easiest thing in the world truths are far more difficult call your boss and tell him what ive told you i said tell him you know where mila is right now and you know shes worth a million see how he reacts see what he tells you to do what if i kill the two of them and you and i work out a deal he said testing me sam stop it leonie said her voice a razor wire i shrugged he smiled there are two kinds of killers those that dont kill unless they believe they absolutely must and those who kill with a greater ease the driver was the second type he liked the power he liked the control he was a small man on the inside and killing made him feel big i had made him feel small seen the truth of who he was its not complicated the reaction tells you whether or not you can kill them without hesitation i believe in do unto others you know you throw her away easily he said to me he looked down at leonie as though considering what a waste that would be she stared right back up into his eyes the gun pressed now against her forehead and ten feet away i could feel the fury radiating off her the fire of inchoate anger and frustration same as your boss is doing to you throwing you away later replaying it in my head i think that phrase did it an accidental tripwire inside leonies head the idea of someone being thrown away i didnt know until much later how much of a nerve i struck with her and at the time i thought she was thinking of daniel and her daughter i didnt intend for her to fight the battle i just wanted him consumed with doubt with greed and if i got him close to me to talk then i could take him that was when leonie attacked she timed it right she did her best now a person bound to a chair its not really much of an attack more of a lowaiming shove she took advantage of the fact that he was standing right next to her and she slammed her weight chair and all into him fueled by an incoherent rage because he was going to interfere and he would cause her child to die to be thrown away leonie knocked into the driver like a kneehugging tackle her feet kept propelling into him and he staggered to the side crashing into sandra ming who obligingly screamed i ran forward time didnt slow it always slows in the movies but in this dirty abandoned old house it seemed to speed up to accelerate beyond my control the drivers gun spoke twice spitting and i heard a scream close as my ear as i dived toward them the driver threw leonie off him picked her up chair and ropes and threw her at me he was counting on me being kind and catching her i didnt i ducked and the legs of the chair brushed my back she slammed into the wall behind me high up falling to the gritty wooden floor but throwing her off him meant he was offbalance both hands employed in tossing her and i charged at him i piledrove him hard into the wall jamming forearm against windpipe looking to crush it but i hit him a fraction too high and i caught more jawline than throat we snapped back into the wall and he hooked a leg behind me i fell and then i saw the gun firm in his hand and his wrist pivoted toward me i caught the guns barrel and pushed it away he lay atop me in the stronger position and i kept the gun at bay with my right hand my left hand i used to make short hard chops in every vulnerable spot throat solar plexus testicles three fast brutal ones he hissed out bad breath in sharp pain and i got a better grip and broke his wrist the crack was loud i slammed elbow into throat and he coughed and spat blood money versus child you tell me who fights harder leonie landed on us her chair splintering had unbound her from the ropes she pulled the gun away from him he tried to lever an elbow back in her face and he missed she got the gun but instead of shooting him she ran simply trying to get the weapon out of his reach she fired a round into mrs mings handcuff anchored to the top rung of the chair and pulled the older woman out of the room leaving me to fight the driver he slammed a roundhouse into my face with his good hand and i fell back against mrs mings damaged wooden chair it was ladderbacked no arms worn with age a weapon at hand i grabbed the chair with one hand and swung its weight into him then again then again each time dodging the blows he tried to connect against me he screamed in pain and frustration i had a good grip now and i swung for all i was worth one of the legs cracked separated from its weak nails and i flung it aside he rolled and i smashed the chair into the floor missing him and the seat torn from the chair skittered across the floor i was conscious of blood masking his face and coating my hands he snarled he was coming apart same as the chair he knew i was going to beat him to death he scrambled backward now fleeing me retreating back toward a window tell me who your boss is and ill let you live i said he made a noise and then he went backward through the window arms up to protect his battered body flinging himself out onto the grassy hillside it was only about a fivefoot drop but he fell and rolled like hed plunged from a great height the last big fragment of the chair still in my hand was a length of the ladderback with bits of wood dangling off it i stripped them free now all that was left of the chair in my grip was a twofoot length of tough oak its top splintered into a sharp spear i jumped out the window after him he staggered through the trees survival instinct fueling his run but id broken him maybe ribs along with the wrist and his speed wasnt top today had spun out of his control and he was bent by the reversal of fortune he dodged me through the shade of the oaks and as we ran downhill he stumbled over a white outcrop of rock and he took a cruel fall i landed on top of him knees digging in the sharp wood raised above my head talk i said he spat at me who do you work for you are so fucked you dont even know who youve pissed off tell me he smiled through a bloody gash across his mouth no i showed him the makeshift spear and said i will run this between your ribs and then stir i was told to come get the ming woman and her son if he was here bring them here see what evidence the ming kid has and to hold us yes for questioning but you know about mila my boss does he knew you were connected to her i never heard of her until tonight who do you work for i cant tell you because i dont know youre lying he has to have a name do you think hes ever told me his real name how does he give you work i get a phone call i do what he asks and a lot of money appears for me in a caymans account youre exwhat i used to be latvian intelligence he said very small spy agency didnt it pay well no money is better doing freelance work i drive limo here i do what my boss asks me he knew my background before he ever called me please he could see that if i hammered the spear into him it would slide deep into his windpipe let me go the driver said please i knew he would not have shown any mercy to me or leonie get up i said give me your wallet your car keys he obeyed he wheezed id broken ribs with the chair his face was a bloodied wreck and his shirt and pants were torn he wouldnt look at my eyes you cant leave me behind here hell kill me i know hell kill me the wooden pseudospear felt heavy in my hand but i couldnt kill him in cold blood start walking you can stop when you cross into pennsylvania if i see you again ill kill you without hesitation he nodded he stumbled fell to the ground get up i said he nodded again agreeing with me that getting up was a capital idea and i leaned down to yank him to his feet the rock crashed into the side of my head and i went down to my knees eyes thrumming with pain he scrabbled across me trying to seize the improvised spear and shoving my arm into the mud then he raised the rock again slammed it into my face i twisted my head so he missed my nose but hit my shuttered right eye it hurt like hell i felt the butt of the spear grind into the mud and so i pushed him up his feet scrabbled in the muck obliging me and then i drove the spear into him it hurt him he howled but it didnt pierce his side he writhed away and then i was on top of him and i drove it point down hard into his belly i walked back up to the house bleary with pain and my mouth tasting of puke my eye was swollen nearly shut it hurt but it wasnt anything more than a black eye i thought not a broken socket i stumbled and kept my feet moving leonie stood in the door shivering with my good eye i could see her clutching at her elbows mrs ming she said hurry in here wheres the driver dead i didnt add it hadnt been a good death to see you killed him thats usually what dead means thanks for the help thanks for shooting him once you got the gun and everything really appreciate it i had to try and help mrs ming she moaned and then i ran into the house the drivers stray bullet had punctured her chest her skin was pale and gray as a clouded sky blood easing from her mouth her nose leonie had tried to staunch the bleeding i knelt by her mrs ming her eyes fluttered open mrs ming where has jack gone her bloodied lip thinned wont tell you you people want to kill him is he going to go to his fathers building in brooklyn he took the keys from your house i think tell you nothing you want to hurt my son i can help protect your son i said liar oh god please i thought please help her talk to me mrs ming i worked for the cia i dont want to hurt your son look at me her face focused on my bruises i just killed the man who kidnapped you im trying to help you i lied to that man so im jacks only hope the cia is looking for him the cia called me she said liars all liars her eyelids fluttered her words hit me hard as a punch who in the cia called you who her lips moved and her breath gave what sounded like a final hush they wanted a deal protect jack protect me if you came i was to keep you at the house until they got there who in the cia did you talk to mrs ming but she didnt want to talk about that not with fewer breaths than fingers left mrs ming said my son help my son please what was i supposed to promise her i was supposed to kill her son to save mine i took her hand jack will be all right i said i promise you i promise you i loved him she said forgave him and the words the breath faltered and with a bubble of blood at her lips she was gone oh my god leonie said are you all right she nodded she stared at the dead woman she pressed fingers against her throat so as to be sure there was nothing to be done what do we do his boss is coming i know these are our choices i know where jack ming is hiding he might be there if we go there now or we can wait and see if the drivers boss shows up learn who were up against we cant do both jack ming she said no question manhattan leonie drove i sat hunched in the seat she smoked a cigarette blowing out the cracked window i told her she wasnt supposed to smoke in the rental car and shed given me an incredulous stare and then laughed and kept smoking the phone call came as we were driving silently back into manhattan i answered yes i said anna we have a confirmation that jack ming is going to meet his cia contact tomorrow tomorrow what time he has told the contact hell call him at noon with instructions so anna had someone inside the cia i know where jack wants to meet them so your worries are nearly at an end anna tell me no i said tell me we ran into a problem i think you might have a leak on your side impossible jack mings mother is kidnapped and now dead and so is her kidnapper if you dont have a leak then a third party is interfering in our work a chastised silence dont lie to me ill talk to you after jack ming is dead she hung up you cant cross her leonie said she holds all the cards no i said she only thinks she does so whos trying to screw us is it the cia anyone could say that theyre cia i said i dont know but as long as we find jack ming first it wont matter who is this mila how do you explain mila a friend who has a price on her head her voice was steady an interesting friend you were just trying to panic the driver i wasnt going to sell out anyone thanks for the vote of confidence thank you you got us out of that alive were in this together yes she said but now we believed it in a way we hadnt before she fell silent i thought about how special projects might have identified their informant as jack ming in the past few hours i thought about fagin i thought about him talking to his bosses at special projects and whether anyone there would hire an exlatvian spy and current limo driver to do their dirty work we drove to williamsburg brooklyn to the address of russell mings property the one for which jack had presumably taken the keys all the windows were darkened it was a squat fourstory building it wore the look of having once been a small factory it had not been redone into shops or studios or apartments for the throngs of young hip professionals and former manhattanites crowding into williamsburg the windows were boarded a sign on the side read ming properties do we break in she asked her voice was strained yes he could be inside right now i picked the locks and we went inside an alarm sounded hell i said we bolted back to the car from a side street we watched first a private security car responded the guard went inside stayed inside turned off the alarm i dont think jack ming is there leonie said after a few minutes the guard came back out locked the door did a final walkthrough around the building and then left no jack she said but hed taken these keys for some reason if he wasnt here now he soon would be i refused to consider the possibility that i was utterly wrong do we wait here wait here for him to come she said the pain in my head throbbed my eye was nearly swollen shut i was going to have a shiner and i didnt want a shiner black eyes are memorable i needed to be invisible we need a vantage point i said we need to be able to watch the building know how often the private security comes and goes we drove past the building again and our headlights danced on the sign security by proxima systems she looked them up on her iphone then she pulled mrs mings phone from her pocket listened to her voicemail and dialed the number proxima new york yes this is sandra ming of ming properties i own a building in williamsburg for which you provide security leonie made her voice brisk slightly deeper yes maam and may i have your account passcode she hesitated about five seconds jack we could hear typing and then thank you maam how can i help you i stared at her how had she known i need to confirm the security check schedule for that building ive heard from other property owners that there might be a crime increase going on in the neighborhood and i just got a phone call that there had been a breach yes maam typing noises the guard comes by at pm am am am then again at noon with up to a tenminute variant if he will be later than that we contact you do you want to increase your patrol profile not now thank you leonie said she hung up you should have canceled the service i said dryly generally that requires a facetoface meeting or a separate confirmation password leonie said i didnt want to arouse attention we know our time windows now how did you know the password because im a mom moms use their kids or pets names or a variant as passwords like eighty per cent of the time it was worth a try so we know when the guard comes yes and theres a long gap when jack and august can meet i considered and i dont think jack is going to camp out inside the building he risks being caught by a security guard as well or being noticed but we need to find a place to watch from to be sure i scanned the buildings there two away thats a hotel hotel esper williamsburgthe last minute bar manhattan leonie got the room at the williamsburg hotel a trendy highend spot with the meaningless name of hotel esper was it short for esperanza hope or did it imply you could read minds while a guest there i wondered just one room with a window facing the ming building we were going to be awake in shifts and if anyone else say a rogue element in the cia was looking for us theyd be looking maybe for a man and a woman checking in together but in separate rooms i drove back to our manhattan hotel and washed my face clean of dirt and blood i looked okay except for the black eye it wasnt so bad i gathered all leonies notes and papers and stuffed them into her small suitcase i put on fresh untorn clothes and collected our bags and checked out for us both then i took the rental and swung by my bar the last minute i looked like a wreck going in and bertrand raised an eyebrow at me i went straight upstairs there was an apartment up there but i didnt dare bring leonie to it she already knew i owned the canyon in las vegas but she didnt need to know more of my business and i didnt need mila knowing what i was doing but when i opened the door there mila was sitting at the computer a neat glenfiddich at her elbow she was typing something she looked up at me and wiped her hand back across her eyes seeing mila cry never in my lifetime i thought but i actually hadnt seen a tear you look like hell she said i know are you okay fine whats going on i need some gear what are you doing sam i am getting my son back i need you not to ask questions okay she stared at me it was weird to have mila stare at me she knew so much about me and i knew so little about her but you asked me a question i get to ask back she said what you wanted to know why there is such a high price on my head i am writing you my detailed answer youre not exactly the essayist type mila was a woman of few words please know i won awards for my essays in school she put her fingers back on the keyboard but kept her stare locked on me so in moldova a school prize is probably a goat not always once i won a copy of a wrinkle in time the message of the book stayed with me never give up against darkness and love conquers all yes samuil love conquers all or at least it tries now she looked back at the screen and when do i get to read your true confessions i am sure publishers will fight to the death gladiatorstyle for my story but you can read it first and when you tell me what youre doing and how i can help you help me by staying out of this i went into the storage closet i put two pairs of binoculars a pair of small flashlights and a glock in my bag i selected a beretta for leonie for her protection picked out rounds of ammunition i packed a burberry prosrum suit id liked shirt tie and shoes to go with it i might have to play a part to lure jack close mila stood in the doorway you dont have to fight your war alone im not alone why reject my help because you are in danger stay out of this get out of new york mila now i do not worry about muggers im serious i killed a man tonight who specifically wanted to find you wanted me to give you to him and he has a boss who wants you someone in the cia she made a dismissive wave they want me for questioning i dont think thats it at all i think someones after the bounty on you then for my own safety she coughed i should stick with you help you we will take the fight to them together no why because you want this informant alive the guy who could give you novem soles of course he could give us novem soles and maybe he in turn could give me the guy who posted the bounty she said i let her words settle novem soles has posted the reward for you she nodded one of them is behind it yes if i can kill the man who wants me dead no one will fund his revenge they wont care this is his private vendetta then why hasnt this guy in novem soles asked me for you in exchange for my son they dont know we know each other she said no one who could tell them that is still alive she paused except august and whoever he has told inside the cia why didnt you tell me because you have to kill the informant for your son the informant may know nothing about how to find the man who wants you dead she shrugged you pick up a thread unwind it it can pull apart the entire blanket my aunt always says so and she is right who wants you dead he is a man called zviman he hides from me like i hide from him there is a price on his head as well we shall see who gets bought first zviman yes why does he want you dead it will be easier for you to read than for me to tell you i have told my story only to one other person i dont normally talk about it milas voice went quiet dont joke i hurt his pride mila smiled where are you going let me do this if i can find where zviman is from jack i will thats a sweet lie sam she held the whisky glass do you want me to tend to your eye no good luck then and then mila did something she had never done before she embraced me i was holding the clothes bag and a backpack with the guns not really in hugging mode her hands ran down my back then she patted the front of my shirt be careful i hope you get your son back thank you i smiled why are you in new york shoes she said ah dont get killed mila i would miss you do not get killed sam i would miss you i left without another word my insides felt knotted i went out into the cloudsmeared starless night i was going to get my son back and nobody nobody was going to kill mila high expectations i patted my shirt pocket shed slid in a small chip thin as paper when she gave me my hug i held it up to the streetlight tracker like a modified phone sim card she wished me well but she wanted to know where i was going to help me or to fight her own battle i didnt know i tried not to care two customers were leaving the bar and i thoughtfully hailed them a cab a bit bleary from the last minutes excellent martinis they thanked me and as i opened the door for them i flicked milas tracker onto the cab floor let it take her where it would out of the battle into safety perhaps i headed back to leonie and the long night of waiting morris county new jersey it is a very small world and getting smaller he thought ricardo braun stood above the speared body of the limo driver he muttered a curse under his breath he took his gun and with care shot off the mans face he had to do this by flashlight with the moonless sky and he was careful to avoid getting any blood or tissue on his shoes or his jeans he reloaded and then blasted off the ten fingertips this would buy him at most a few days if the body was found but even a narrow margin of time had saved him in the past then he removed the limos plates and stripped out the forged registration and insurance papers its vehicle identification number had long ago been filed off he dumped the corpse in the trunk then put in sandra mings body there was a large pond on the property he found a rock and put it on the accelerator and watched as the water settled over the limo it took surprisingly little time for the car to sink he waited until the water was still the last ripple smooth then he got into his mercedes and he drove back to his apartment in greenwich village it was very late now and he sat and drank coffee and watched the stars and wondered how much in danger he was if anyone knew what he was doing and why sam capra he could have stopped him if he had not had to meet with the assholes from langley whod insisted on a quick report special projects was a beehive and only he and august knew about the jack ming affair well and now fagin but fagin would never speak eliminating fagin would create far too many questions he was golden untouchable but a healthy deposit in fagins account would ensure silence and hell most of the company had no idea sam capra had saved the cia inconceivable humiliation in the yankee stadium incident most of them if they knew who he was at all thought he was still a suspect character untrustworthy he felt a slight rage that he had allowed this to spin out of control right now he sat at his laptop and accessed a private website within the special projects computer network and clicked on an icon that read banish that was the code word august had set up for the jack ming case the only two people who could access this folder were august and braun he read heard from target via phone call he will call me again at et tomorrow with instructions for meet tomorrow then this would all be settled if ming wasnt dead before tomorrows meeting then he would take custody of jack ming tell him that his mother was already secure in a special projects safe house seize whatever evidence he had and he would make jack disappear forever the only way to be safe the only way to be sure august might be a problem but a quick reassignment to another division would solve that dilemma he was a good soldier hed take his orders in a few months braun would go out and visit him treat him to a steak dinner and tell him novem soles had been wrapped up neat as a napkin and no one would ever know ricardo braun considered the one hint that he had for his other agenda mila sam had told the driver who had relayed it to him that she sometimes met sam capra at a bar not exactly actionable information to find mila unless sam capra wanted to be followed wanted to see who it flushed out into the open it wouldnt matter though would it if sam capra was dead by tomorrow the whole incident was a shame he had studied the capra file the world still did not know that the bombing of a london office was an attack against a special projects team did not know that a cia officer pregnant by another officer committed a grievous treason did not know that more than one traitor bought not by ideology or disaffection but by cold cash had been flushed out of the company did not know that a man scorned by the company as a traitor had been its savior capra had done his duty duty it was the red in brauns blood the oxygen that he breathed duty was all duty was what forced you to push boundaries take chances give your life to something and still have the bravery to reap the rewards from it once braun had written essays and poems on duty in his journal to try to understand his own feelings about it but finally he had burned them all if capra had come back to special projects when the job was offered if he had stuck to his duty then this would not have to happen it was a shame he didnt want capra dead at the least he wouldnt be an enemy but a sacrifice that was somehow nobler braun thought with andris the limo driver dead and floating in eternal company with mrs ming he was going to need someone else to handle capra and jack ming the best thing about special projects was that since it was supposed to be separate and deniable from the company he was allowed when needed to use noncompany personnel and keep them out of the record like andris and his limo company funded by company dollars that had been washed by special projects or the sisters yes the sisters would be a good choice for tomorrow they always brightened his day brooklyn jack ming sat in a movie theater he was on his fourth feature film of the day the theaters were nice dark and quiet and he could think right now a romantic comedy indifferently written and acted played in front of him he didnt really want to see or hear anything violent or twisted he didnt like movies with gunfire not since rotterdam right now the movies hero thought his girlfriends mom had the hots for him which wasnt true but you know was just hilarious not his dinner had been a hot dog and a soda he bought at the theater and he rattled the ice in a jumbo cup his mothers betrayal had stopped itching at him he could not be surprised she would never let him do as he wanted the only freedom hed had in his life was when he had run away and worn another name in another country the notebook sat in a square taped to his back earlier in a starbucks hed sat down in a lonely corner and paged through its mysteries again account numbers pictures email addresses he studied the photo of the three people that had the words the nursery written underneath the word nursery was suggestive a place where something was born or something was protected and grown just a photo of three people but clearly three people who by virtue of being together revealed a secret about themselves if nine suns meant nine people then this was a third of them and if you could take down a third perhaps you could find out who the other six were perhaps you could cripple them he thought about trying to contact any of the people being blackmailed but he decided against it if he frightened them they might vanish and what would make the notebook valuable was if the people corrupted were still in place if they took off running or hiding then they would not be useful on one page hed found a single phone number he was so tempted to call it and fear and curiosity played over his heart more than ever the notebook was his ticket but he wondered why if his mother had called the cia they werent already there when he arrived why not snatch him up at home had they just figured out it was him if they waited for him to show up and lounge around at home they could take him with less fuss perhaps he didnt know what to believe he needed a place to sleep hostels were out of the question he didnt know who his mother would have looking for him much less novem soles if homeless people could sleep on the streets he could as well just for one night he left the movie theater and ducked into another coffee shop lots of people his age on laptops chatting pretending to write the next great american novel while they idled away their creative time on social networking sites he got a decaf and sat in the corner and opened up the notebook staring at the one phone number on the last page the last minute bar manhattan mila ordered another glenfiddich from bertrand and a bacon sandwich from the last minutes small kitchen she put aside her confessions for sam the story of herself that she had only told one person before and she opened up the tracking software on the laptop which would tell her where sam was going she studied the route from the last minute to a hotel in greenwich village to a nightclub to another hotel she didnt believe he was nightclubbing and she didnt believe whoever he was tracking was out nightclubbing either hed found the tracker shed planted on him and put it in a cab she smiled sam was no fool and now he knew shed tricked him for a moment she considered deleting the confession she was mad at him unreasonably she knew but mad all the same she was alive and she felt sure his baby was probably dead or lost forever to him no matter what promises anna made novem soles had no honor no sense of justice no kindness they would never give him his child back and she knew it and she wished he could know it as well she could not make him understand she could not force him to abandon hope she could not do to him what had been done to her she took a long sip of the whisky and put her fingertips back to the keyboard the letters on the electronic screen hanging like small curved ghosts before her eyes jfk airport the watcher stepped off the plane his mouth tasted sour from his inflight doze his suit wasnt as clean as hed like for it to be he waited for the press of folks off first class to pass to his great annoyance he couldnt get a first class seat and then he obediently followed the rest of the coach passengers off the jet the flight attendants gave him robotic nods and thanks he waited in the queue at customs for nonus citizens and finally presented his dutch passport it passed muster without a hesitation and he even managed a smile for the customs clerk who wished him a pleasant stay in the united states he stepped out into the city one of the greatest dining cities in the world he dreamed of a vacation where he did nothing but eat and talk with chefs here but he could not think of food now novem soles had found the record of jacks alias taking a flight out of brussels ricki had lied to him she would pay when he had time to focus on her jack ming was in this city now with his book of secrets sam capra and leonie jones were going to kill jack ming and then they would die it would close a book on the cias own investigation of novem soles once a former cia agent had been identified as jack mings murderer and then the circle would be closed and the circle would be safe his phone rang yes silence on the other end yes the watcher said impatiently yes hello a voice said and it was one hed listened to in the recording of the cia conversation before a voice he knew by heart jack ming hello jack ming said into the sudden silence the watcher froze who is this you dont know me jack ming said but your phone number is in a book i found may i ask who this is well no because i dont know who you are the watcher said i think you are being blackmailed jack said are you because if you are maybe i can help stop the people who are hurting you you you the watcher said who are you since you didnt say no ill assume youre being blackmailed the watchers mind spun what exactly was in this notebook a cold chill inched up his spine listen okay i dont know who you are this could be a trick to get me to say something i shouldnt play the victim draw him close tell me exactly how you got my number a friend gave me a book it has numbers bank account numbers and emails and photos in it i think its a book used to extort people all over the world people in positions of business and government silence do you fit those criteria i might oh my god the watcher said the fear in his voice wasnt exactly false he cursed he was standing out near a taxi pickup line at jfk he had no equipment with which to trace the call no way to alert any of the technical resources of novem soles he would have to draw jack in himself and honestly if you cant do that with a grad student you dont deserve your job look if this is a test ive done what you said i have everything please please its not a test im trying to help you if you can tell me who you are and what they have you doing im not confessing anything oh my god oh my god you tell me who you are where you are give me a reason to trust you the watcher made his voice a slice of panic i am going to give this information to the authorities jack said the whole book now if you want these people broken and off your back i can make that happen i can tear off your phone number from the book before i give it to the authorities that way you are never exposed you devious little bastard the watcher thought i want to kill you all myself and then youre never in trouble ill do that for you ill pull this page from the book if youll tell me what they have you doing i have to think for a minute the watcher said delaying well one minute is what you have jack ming said trying to sound tough dont threaten me ill hang up and then when the police show up at your work or at your door wanting to know why you cooperated with a criminal ring im not going to talk to you on the phone the watcher said could we meet face to face this is a paris number and im not in paris im not either im in new york it was a gamble to admit this that he was in the same city as jack ming jack was silent im here for them theyve made me come here the watcher said this as though tearing the words out of his own chest your minute is about up jack said so the watcher decided i work for a major financial services firm i give them data from my company i deliver it once a month financial particulars insider information plans for investment confidential knowledge that they can use to profit on the stock markets in france the us hong kong what did they have on you the watcher thought he had to sell this i engaged in some insider trading they found out about it they said they would expose me if i didnt help them i dont trade any more i just feed them the information if i disobey them theyll expose me and if i talk about them theyll kill my entire family so please dont tell any one please why are you in new york for them they wanted me to get some information on a stock deal whose deal i wont say if it leaks then theyll know i leaked it im sorry jack said thank you ill tear your number from the book you cant give that book to anyone the watcher said he had to try you cant youll destroy dozens of lives silence how did you know theyre blackmailing dozens of people stands to reason if its enough to fill a book the ten longest seconds at least since hed encountered mila of the watchers life ticked past youre not being blackmailed at all jack ming said youre one of them arent you no i think a person being blackmailed would probably disconnect the phone immediately and not say a word how do you know im not the police the police would show up they cant trick a confession from you not this way they could if they had a bug on your phone jack said you cannot give them that book please your number wont be in it now so why worry so concerned for your fellow victims i just dont want innocent people hurt the night breeze the smell of jet fuel in the airport wind blew over him he had to stop this little lunatic somehow very considerate of you this has been so illuminating jack ming said thank you time for plan b they know who you are jack the watcher said which means they know who ricki is and who your mother is they will find everyone youve ever cared about and they will burn them and everything you love to the ground oh yes you know why im really here im going to destroy you financially your family everything you hold dear your mother will be selling herself in alleyways after im done stunned silence on the other end what jack said finally there is another option for you ill buy the notebook ill buy your silence i dont believe you ten million its a nice round number and you can easily live off that for the rest of your life unworkable jack said ask the dead dude in the amsterdam hospital if you think im going to meet you face to face that was done without my approval in panic by a fool lets deal like adults ill put half the money in an account for you you mail me the notebook and ill pay you the other half and when i show up at your bank or move the money you find me and kill me no thank you plus you cant trust i havent copied the notebook let me propose this a cash drop we agree on a place for you to leave the notebook and a place for me to leave you cash ten million in small bills is not exactly transportable by one guy in a hurry jack said i dont trust you i can give you a better deal than the cia can twice the money and dead twice as fast jack play nice or i will burn you down youre just trying to lure me in no you know who i am i know what you are and when im done with you you son of a bitch there is no hiding place for you this little nobody threatening him the watcher heard the snap in his own voice you are nothing but a contemptible punk when you die and you will ill throw a party ill have people over for drinks and well watch you being slowly tortured to death ill have it catered it wont happen in some dark warehouse or basement it will happen with people standing around having drinks laughing while they watch your skin pulled off your eyes gouged your ears burned to a crisp someones going to burn jack said but its not me then he hung up the watcher stood there the red rage slowly building in his eyes he closed the phone and walked forward slowly to join the line of travelers awaiting a taxi hotel esper williamsburg i want to know who owns that property in new jersey i said we were in the hotel room leonie sitting at the table me standing at the window looking down toward the ming buildings boarded windows she opened her laptop it would help if we had an address its out in the middle of nowhere it was marked as river run road see you if you can find a county property map or find it on google maps she tapped and hummed under her breath leonie on a computer reminded me of my wife lucy my exwife lucy was very clever with computers too i stared out at the night and let her work she tapped found maps compared them with the route wed driven the property is owned by associated languages school a language school no wonder it was derelict didnt most people learn foreign languages these days through software programs and it was out in the boonies maybe its supposed to be an immersion program i watched her fingers fly across the keyboard she nibbled her lip in thought they have a very basic website where are they headquartered new york they have immersion programs in rural new york florida and oregon that they offer but it says their next three sessions are full maybe the driver knew that the house was unoccupied yes maybe he drove students out there before and knew it was shuttered now but it didnt quite ring true would it be shuttered if business was booming i picked up my phone sat down on the bed and called them you have reached the offices of associated languages school we offer instruction and translation services in and then the recording went into a tiresome listing of every major language spoken on four continents i considered hanging up the phone maybe thats what they wanted me to do finally i was invited to leave a message i hung up front company i said nobody makes it that hard to do business a front for novem soles maybe can we find out anything else on them yes but is that going to help us find out anything about jack ming lets not lose focus here sam if we do this right we have our kids tomorrow we vanish and we dont ever worry about novem soles again i got up and stared out the window she tapped away at her computer while i watched the night i got into proxima security she said via sandra mings account ive got access to a monitor log it will tell us if anyone enters the building and punches in a code we know the guard has the code and we can assume jack does we know the guards schedule if someone comes at a different time i think well know its jack could you disable the alarm she shook her head separate system well at least well know when people come and go ill put an alarm on my laptop to chime if theres an update to the log she said can i give you some advice no give up on fighting novem soles when this is done she said revenge is the most worthless motive in the world your wife made her choice yes you get your son back then you have all that matters all right dont try to keep fighting them go live a safe good life move on and put out of my mind that im going to kill a young man who could bring them down to save your son yes put jack ming as a human being out of your mind people put ugliness out of their heads all the time jack ming made his choice same as your wife and now hes trying to unmake it i said does that count for nothing she was silent hes trying to be the good guy if hed turned on novem soles seven months ago he might be surrendering to me and id be getting ready to take a bullet for him if thats what it took to save him leonie got up and sat at the window she stared down at the building some choices cant be unmade so we should watch for him if you want but i seriously doubt hes going to come around to be discovered by the security guard we have to trust annas source youre sure i think so hes not a trained operative daylight is easier he can see what hes facing im thinking hes camped somewhere else tonight he needs his sleep too but why not go to the cia already he must have a reason hes in control of the meeting we know he wanted to spend time with his mom but she kicked him out onto the curb and he lost his hiding place so he might be seeing another friend he might be studying the evidence hes got against novem soles and i dont know building his case he could be making this up as he goes along dont hackers improvise we didnt have an unobstructed view of the ming building we could see the back alley approaches to it but not the entrance itself the angle was impossible i kept watching the black boarded windows for any seep of light but there was none i left her at the window and lay down on the bed my head ached my eye hurt sleep just for an hour or two i thought when you got mrs ming away during the fight i wasnt trying to abandon you but only she could tell us where jack was so i thought your focus is admirable i said so is yours leonie said softly you killed that man yes i kept my eyes closed is it upsetting you should hope not i have to do it again tomorrow we listened to the distant hum of traffic the breathing of new york if only wed caught jack at his mothers house i got to see his room hes just a kid in many ways not in any ways that matter dont you start to feel sorry for him ill feel what i like thank you i said i thought i should have kept my mouth shut all i did by showing sympathy to our target was increase leonies distrust of me i knew a man who killed it never ever bothered him i opened an eye did you help him disappear too give him a new identity no i gave myself one to get away from him she sat huddled by the window knees drawn up to her chin i left him because he didnt want kids too much of a hassle with his work leonie i wondered if it was her real name it didnt matter i wouldnt ever see her again when this was done i mean you know i could have had a killer as the father of my kids theres a wise choice what a laugh he would have been at careers day leonie its okay i had killed and i was a father what she was talking about wasnt the same or was it yeah i was going to be a coldblooded killer by tomorrow all so i could be a father what a screwedup world she moved a lock of her auburn hair out of her face she came to the bed she put her fingertips on the side of my face and inspected the bruising you have little cuts here from the rock theyll heal she didnt take her hands from my face you have to kill jack sam you cant feel sorry for him you cant feel emotion for him you just have to kill him it will be easy easy because she didnt have to claim a human life i closed my eyes jack in the pictures of him in his room arms around his thin shoulders his protective college buddies looking out for the likable geek the books hed loved the gaptoothed child smiling from the photos i needed him to be a faceless stranger but his mother had died holding my hand im full of crap leonie said its never easy is it she moved her hand from my cheek to my forehead caught her fingers in my hair what i thought im just so clever you must have really loved your wife it was a strange observation to make i opened my eyes i dont want to talk about her anna told me that you tried to find your wife her way of saying you were a decent man anna didnt want me to be scared of working with you scared i was supposed to be the good guy raised by globetrotting christian relief agency dogooders the nice boy who went to harvard and stayed on track the smart brother who didnt go to afghanistan and get himself and his best friend killed the boy who became a man in the cia fueled by revenge but tempered i hoped by fairness and now what was i someone whod been accused of being a traitor because id married the wrong woman an actual technical traitor and had dodged the cia and now was in an awful limbo of untrustworthiness as far as that fine agency was concerned death is a weird thing the death for the driver was egregiously bad being impaled is never anyones exit of choice and for mrs ming she had died with an awful uncertainty clouding her mind and corroding her last moments leonie and i had nearly died tonight death makes us thirst for life and all its basics a comforting meal the breeze of our own breath in our lungs the warm press of human flesh leonie leaned down and she kissed my bruised lips no woman had kissed me since lucy i froze for a moment this was crossing a line id seen from the corner of my eye this was knowing lucy was gone and was never ever coming back and even if she did come back that i wouldnt want her back i felt myself unfreeze my whole face hurt but i pressed my lips to hers in response the kiss didnt accelerate it grew slower more thoughtful she nibbled at my lower lip sam she said very quietly yes afterwards will we be cool yes i didnt exactly know what cool meant but i wasnt going to say no she started to kiss me again with heat it didnt matter that my face ached i wanted her with a sudden fierce certainty i had not been with many women before lucy the idea that every spy is a womanizer is a patent falsehood you are usually keeping people at arms length i never had time and i didnt now but that did not seem to matter her kisses were quick and darting and urgent her tongue her fingertips were everywhere im not even sure we got all our clothes off and then i joined to her leonie groaning against me a low throaty growl her face close to mine after a delicious while she shuddered her breath warm against my bruised eye looking deep into my face as though surveying curious terrain then she laid her face on my chest i gasped in release a minute or two later her urging me on with cooing sounds her body felt lush and warm and smooth it was good but it was more comfort than passion we stripped off the rest of our clothes and clutched at each other neither of us wanted to talk we just wanted to be promise me she said lying curled next to me promise me well get our kids back i promise i said what else could i say i just had to make it true that promise bound us together that promise would change everything hotel esper williamsburg we slept late longer than we should have normally i cant sleep late in new york because the rising noise of the traffic is an automatic alarm clock when i woke up leonie was showered and dressed and tapping at her laptop no intrusions at the building other than those at the security guards regularly appointed rounds she looked up at me and gave me a wan smile what did i do kiss her nuzzle her pretend last night didnt happen my marriage with lucy full of deception and lies and my own blindness convinced me that i suck at relationships and it wasnt like we were going to have a longterm one we would get our kids and part ways and never see each other again except in our memories about the worst few days of our lives the newspaper websites in new york and new jersey carried no mention of two bodies discovered at the abandoned associated languages school in morris county ill go get us some breakfast i said leonie made the noise one makes when one is absorbed in a computer screen again like lucy what are you doing i thought about what you said last night she said im going to find out who that driver was he doesnt matter any more youre not working alone she said why presume that he is we dont know how much of a head start we have on finding jack we may have none and im not going to sit here and fret and wait and do nothing while waiting for jack to show up i walked to a diner on the corner and got breakfast for us to go mushroom and spinach omelets hash browns fruit bacon coffee orange juice you eat when you can because you never know when you might get your next meal on days like today when i came back we ate i tried to make conversation where are you from i asked she seemed to measure her answer by staring into her styrofoam coffee cup i know your real name isnt leonie that you live under a false name trust me its better you not know much about me i am infinitely boring i know thats not true i said with a smile she smiled back just for a moment you where are you from all over my parents worked for a relief agency my moms a pediatric surgeon my dads an administrator i lived in over twenty different countries before i was eighteen i finished my coffee if i dont make it and you get my son back from anna you can take him to my parents they live in new orleans alexander and simone capra theyre in the phone book are you close to them no not at all why my brother died and it ruined their hearts they either want to take over my life entirely or shut me out completely him dying made them a little crazy how did he die he went to afghanistan to do relief work like theyd done for years and he and his best friend from college they got captured by the taliban their throats were cut in a propaganda video oh my god leonie said im so sorry it was about the best thing she could say really its so horrible it shocks people you cannot imagine what it is like to see your brother die helplessly to see his friend die then to see them discussed on every news channel as though they are just names to learn danny capra zalmay qureshi not people just distant unfortunates just names that was when i joined the cia but youre not with them any more when your wife betrays the cia it kind of destroys your career path i would think a constant cloud of suspicion i stood up and shoved my styrofoam food holder in the trash so we parted ways and she had this baby while you were apart yes what was she like your wife why do you care im just curious you seem too smart a guy to be easily fooled we all have our blind spots she was one as large as the sahara to me sometimes we dont pick wisely no and the price we pay is very heavy leonie turned back to her computer any luck with tracing the driver no she said not looking at me really no track on his drivers license or his limo plates she had memorized the plates during the long haul out of manhattan and new jersey following him stolen i guess she said still not looking at me i stood up and watched the ming building with my binoculars two oclock couldnt come soon enough for me i needed inside that building now in between the last pass of the security guard and jacks presumed meeting with august and then i thought of a way hotel esper williamsburg i left leonie in her room and went down to the lobby i called russell mings property company now owned by his wife ming properties the woman answering the phone said hi may i speak to and i looked again at the name id jotted down the one under the number on the ming properties sign beth marley this is she she sounded bright and enthusiastic like talking to me was the highlight of her day im sure it was my name is sam capra and im interested in the building in williamsburg oh great i own the the last minute bar over by bryant park i know that bar she said oh thats great im interested in leasing some property in brooklyn that you own in williamsburg would it be possible to see it today today might be difficult sir what about tomorrow im just in town for the day in fact i might be interested in leasing the whole building i just happened to see it and think its perfect for what i need well okay let me do a little juggling i could hear her flipping papers sure i could do eleven oclock would that work youre so kind that will be great ill just meet you there okay thanks mr capra i hung up and went back to the hotel room well that was easy i have an appointment leonie crouching over her computer didnt answer special projects headquarters manhattan ricardo braun was not concerned with legalities as much as expediency after he had discovered the limo drivers body he had fagin and the oliver twists setting up electronic surveillance on every person in new york connected to jack ming with careful instructions to report only to braun not to august holdwine or anyone else in special projects braun preferred that jack mings identity not be known to anyone else so fagin and the twists watched jack mings friends on his abandoned facebook account which were few mostly friends from his nyu years a few family friends his fathers property company the initial surveillance centered on monitoring facebook pages and personal email accounts the only phones to be tapped via a hack were the phone of his fathers company and the cell phones of his two closest college friends the silence on jack was deafening there was no mention of him at all until a midmorning phone call struck brauns interest not because it was about jack ming no it was about sam capra braun called the sisters he hoped they could contain their crazy long enough to do the job the exact way he wanted it done he got lizzie on the phone he would have preferred meggie she was the more reasonable one but you didnt put off lizzie she held grudges lizzie listened to his instructions the two men ming and capra can we play with them for a while the sisters had a cabin in upstate new york where they entertained special guests when the need took lizzie or when braun needed someone interrogated with guaranteed results if you neednt kill them straight out theyre yours i would like to know what they both know get that out of them and report back to me what about anyone else with them he thought of august with regret you can kill anyone else if need be if there is a woman named mila with him i want proof of her death the sisters neednt know about the bounty he would collect it himself throw them a little bonus lizzie laughed thanks for the work she hung up and looked at her sister go get dressed we have a lead on the job all right but you promised to make those phone calls about the cruise her sister meggie stood up from the couch she had been reading a special projects file on sam capra that braun had just emailed her know thy enemy yes yes lizzie said ill get to it dont put it off meggie said they book up like a year in advance cruises are for old people lizzie said that is completely untrue they keep a morgue on those boats because so many old people die during cruises i saw that on tv lizzie said the sisters considered this interesting tidbit you are not going to have fun on a cruise i mean that kind of fun meggie said parameters for today capture if we can kill if we must capras sort of a pretty boy dont you think not really his file says he runs parkour that daredevil running where you jump from building to building lizzies smile sparkled do you think ill get to chase him i better use a weapon that helps me catch him no meggie rolled her eyes he wont get a chance to run lets focus lizzie your standards are far too high lizzie said not every apple has to be perfect you got to give it a big bite to see how sweet it tastes she glanced over at her sisters laptop screen at sam capras photo looking out at her brownishblond hair green eyes high cheekbones a full mouth i like his face it would take a lot of time and careful thought to ruin it truly those cheekbones probably youd need a touch of acid for them and that runners body lovely and spare braun had said i could play with them if we arent forced to kill them outright meggie didnt care much for the fixated tone in her sisters voice this was always the way with lizzie an idea elbowed its way to the front of her mind and bit down in lizzies brain with deep teeth and wouldnt let go until it was appeased her sisters hungers were dark ones guns naturally but if we want to keep them for a while i dont want to deal with gunshot wounds bandages are such a pain im in kind of a japanese mood today fine but i dont want you playing all week you said you would research a cruise and book it fine whatever ill pack along the brochures ming properties office lower manhattan my lucky day beth marley thought shed already dodged a bullet the other two employees in the office were out today downed with food poisoning brought on by a highly questionable chicken curry theyd eaten while lingering at an unforgivably long lunch yesterday one that beth hadnt gone on because you know she was too busy doing all three of their jobs and now this beth marley tapped the stack of papers straight on her desk and thought well i cant wait to tell sandra that i might lease an entire building then empress mingd have to get her ladder and climb down off my ass beth canceled her lunch with her best friend via her blackberry apologizing profusely and saying that she might pay her back with drinks later in celebration of a big deal and this would show sandra ming she could seriously handle the work mrs ming always looked at her as though she werent quite sure beth could tie her shoes much less manage properties around the city she sat down at her computer summoned up the web browser googled sam capra she got a number of hits relating to some poor guy getting killed in afghanistan with a brother who had granted a couple of interviews as the family spokesman probably not related to this client not a lot on him hmmm she googled the last minute and found the bars website shed met girlfriends there for drinks a couple of times well if he was thinking of a bar in the building it would probably be highdollar the last minute was a well done space clearly money had been dropped on it she picked up the phone to call sandra and then decided to wait until she actually had good news if she told sandra she had a fish on the line but then didnt reel it in shed never hear the end of it she was gathering her purse and her phone to leave when the office door opened which was weird because there was an electronic passkey and you couldnt just open the door oh she thought as two women stepped inside i must not have shut it all the way they were both stunning one was blonde hair pulled up into a bun tall with cool green eyes and cheekbones that beth instantly coveted the other was a brunette with lovely chocolate eyes her hair trimmed into a stylish short cut beth instantly wanted to ask where do you get your hair done both women were oddly though dressed identically in formfitting gray pinstripe suits and silky black dress shirts beth couldnt think of women who voluntarily dressed alike she thought missionaries hi may i help you she said one of the women shut the door behind her the other stood in front of beths desk and smiled yes are you ms marley yes super she gave a bright smile in return this is what were going to need from you your cell phone your car keys and the keys to the building in williamsburg also the alarm access code is there a closet where we can lock you up beth gave a nervous uncertain laugh is this a joke no were keeping your appointment at the building so cell phone please and the closet would be where get the fuck out of here beth reached for the desk phone security was one press of the button away the brunette slammed a fist into beths face hard beth had never been hit in the face in her life and the pain astonished her another blow to her throat cut off her scream a third busted her nose faster than she would have thought the brunette was over the desk and one hand was on her mouth the other on her throat crushing against her windpipe listen to me i dont wish to kill you we have a phone tap on you so we know youre meeting sam capra it would be really pointless for you to die over a cell phone and an appointment yes beth nodded too dazed to cry her nose bleeding her mouth covered by the womans hand the pressure on her windpipe eased very slightly in fact you wont die instead my sister will go kill your sevenyearold daughter in ridgewood and i will go kill your father in queens i often find people care about the lives of loved ones more than their own she gave a little shrug arent people funny terror flooded beth will you play nice nice beth nodded very eagerly now dont you get blood on my suit i will be most unhappy the brunette said as though beth could stop the blood oozing from her nose they shoved her into the small kitchen that doubled as an office supplies storage area they handcuffed her to the sink pipe now the access code if you lie to me your familys dead but well come back here first and shoot off bits and pieces beth did not lie she gave them the code the pain in her face was now agony she tried to fight back the tears very good the brunette pulled beths cell phone from her purse where are the property keys my desk drawer tagged as williamsburg her voice trembled the blonde vanished returned in a moment the keys dangling please dont hurt my family please beth chillax were all cool youre just going to tell whoever finds you that you were mugged by two big chinese guys just provide a couple of pointless yet specific details they wore red shirts they had body odor two details no other youll be very convincing you never saw us you will never speak of us if you deviate from that story your daughter and your father will die guaranteed no matter how long it takes because the threat against your family stands as long as you live it doesnt have an expiration date but if you talk then your family has an expiration date they will die and the white lilies at their funerals will be from me and my sister are we clear beth nodded tears brimming her eyes they stuffed a washcloth from the kitchen drawer in her mouth bound her lips with tape have a nice day the brunette said and they left her hotel esper williamsburg i decided to suit up for the meeting i wanted to look like a legitimate business owner for the property management company and i thought given that i had a black eye i needed every ounce of respectability i could muster and i didnt want jack ming if he was hiding in the building to see me as a soldier i wanted to look like the other side of my life the owner of a really nice bar when i worked undercover for special projects i quickly learned that most highlevel criminal groups adopt a stylish look i would prefer myself to always be in tshirt and jeans but life demands more so i figured out like a personal shopper to an assassin would what suits worked for my build as well as what i could wear if i had to fight while dressed to the nines also even though i didnt pay much attention to the last minute as i launched my search for daniel i was conscious of when i looked rattier than bertrand who always looks annoyingly dapper and the staff so id grabbed from my office above the last minute the dark navy burberry prosrum suit sleekfitting i put on a light gray shirt a soft silver tie to the back of the tie i attached a small thin fighting knife it stayed in place thanks to a customized loop id sewn in the blades handle was extremely slender and the weight of the knife kept the tie tucked against the shirt i buttoned the jacket youd have to look hard to see the blade i attached a holster to the small of my back my glock went there another thin blade was bound to an ankle i put on a pair of allen edmonds shoes with a slightly thick heel i am man enough to kick when there is a need to i left leonie tapping at her keyboard hes probably not there but if he is and i get him well have to run quickly you dont rush in if you can help it we had to be prepared for a couple of eventualities that jack ming might somehow already be here and have turned the building into his own fortress and that the cia might be here as well anna could be wrong about the rendezvous being set for tomorrow her source inside could be wrong and with our childrens lives on the line neither leonie nor i had any intention of walking into a trap if we were caught our children were lost to us would jack ming hide where he planned to meet possibly but if i were him i would try to stay on the move as much as i could hunkering down in a place tied to his father could be dangerous an unacceptable risk of course he was a twentytwoyearold grad student not a trained operative he might not think the same way i would but hed run home the most dangerous thing he could do if his false id in the netherlands had been cracked and so he might commit a whole chain of mistakes if he didnt realize that his mother was gone he might feel perfectly safe coming to this building that he knew to be empty he after all had to have taken the key for a good reason the building was enemy territory it could be a kill zone i had only seen it in the dark late last night and now it looked like a difficult place to defend it was neat red brick windows covered to keep damage and neglect at bay an outdoor market was in full swing two streets over pedestrians passed on their way to and from the stalls i walked down to the building a few minutes late if jack was inside i didnt want him to spot me until the very last minute i had no idea if he had seen me in the rotterdam shootout or if he would register my face from those horrible few minutes as i walked up to the door a volvo sedan with new jersey plates pulled up two women got out great i thought if jack ming is holed up inside and gets violent then ive got two people to protect they both wore practically identical pinstriped suits maybe mrs ming enforced a dress code they were both in their late twenties i would guess one was darkhaired darkeyed with a lovely face and a kind smile the other was blonde steeleyed a bit taller but something in her face registered wrong like the smile was just for practice mr capra this was the brunette yes beth marley we shook hands this is my associate lizzie she offered her hand i shook it and she held onto it a little longer than necessary oh what happened to your face odd tone to her question she almost sounded disappointed i thought for a moment she was going to reach out and touch my black eye surely not a bar fight beth said yes i said and that dude wont walk a check again oh rough stuff lizzie said her smile didnt waver i felt sure commercial leasing agents have seen nearly everything may i see your id beth said i understand leasing agents have to be careful going into buildings with strange men i gave her both my new york drivers license and my last minute business card which looked even sharper than i did she inspected them and handed them back to me beth gestured to the building shall we i nodded beth unlocked the door with a key with a small tag on it she stepped inside and punched in the code for the building she didnt hide her tapping finger and i saw the code was she seemed to hesitate for just one moment as if expecting the alarm to sound but it stopped its warning chime and the indicator light turned green but i stepped away from her before she could register that id been watching and turned my gaze critically to the ceiling as though i expected to see a pox of water leaks lizzie stayed close to me a little too close i didnt like her all of a sudden on the first floor was some unfinished plasterboard a wall left undone did someone start to remodel and forget to finish apparently so of course if you lease the whole space well remove any leftbehind renovations that were incomplete beth started to tell me about all the buildings wonderful features of which there were three she embellished in the way that best sales people do i let her lead me but i stepped first through every door i didnt think jack ming if hed hidden himself inside here seemed like the type to just start shooting i didnt even know if he had a gun but i wasnt going to risk the leasing agents getting hurt we walked through the building the first two floors were configured for offices beth was giving me a very generic patter on the top floor we could see the roofs of the adjoining building which only went to three floors this floor was mostly cleared concrete space so youre thinking a bar on the ground floor yes and private party rooms on the second and third floors i said office space on four oh party space i hope youll invite us lizzie said you wont make us wait in line will you can we jump the rope i gave her a smile but i didnt much care for the smile she gave me back she kept standing a little too close to me clutching her oversized purse ill make sure youre on the special guest list next door its being renovated into restaurant space beth said i believe the top floor is going to be a sushi bar theyre opening next week i think you could have a synergy depending on their clientele im all about the synergy i said i never know how the hell to use that word in a sentence the fourth floor was mostly open space russell ming was using it for storage boxes of all shapes and sizes chinese paintings a set of rounded tables in a row lightly covered with dust windows faced out onto the neighboring roof below was a skylight that looked new the sushi bar celebrating natural light i guess in the back corner there was a door i walked straight over to it and tried the doorknob locked whats in here i asked my voice sounded a little louder than id intended storage i believe dont know why it would be locked she stepped forward she opened the door with another key i tensed in case jack ming had set up camp inside the room he hadnt it was empty i tried not to breathe a sigh of relief he wasnt in the building i knew the access code now and i could pick the locks i didnt need beth and lizzie so best to get them out of the way come back and wait for jack ming you seem to be expecting to see something here lizzie said when i finished twisting the knob as i stepped away from the door she leaned against one of the square tables just counting the footage in my mind i said i like math lizzie said i like to add things up so beth said smoothly how would this property work for you mr capra i think it might work well indeed how firm is the leasing price pretty firm i would think the original owner died a couple of years ago his wife has it now and she would rather hold out than lease too cheap i had my back to them surveying the adjoining roof could he enter the building this way no i thought not well i think ive seen enough i said enough to know jack mings not here lizzie said i turned beth had a glock mm aimed at me lizzie was pulling from her oversized purse a metal chain an iron weight at one end a steel spike at the other firm in her grip surujin a weapon id seen before in japan mostly used these days for individual martial arts practice the weight dangled like a pendulum she started it on a gentle sway just above her feet hands still where i can see them please sam beth said are you kidding me i nodded at lizzies toy youre supposed to be a graceful runner i brought it to leash you in case you ran dont make me chase you lizzies smile didnt quite just look socially awkward now she looked coolly cruel i wouldnt dream of it i said we just want to talk beth well i knew now that wasnt her name but her name didnt matter said her aim steadied on my chest gun on the ground please beth ordered i obeyed dropped it to the hardwood floor kicked it over to her i kept my hands slightly raised in front of me where she could see them hands on head lizzie search him she did with gusto fingers dancing over me exploring more than she should have while beth kept the gun leveled at my head she probed my arms my groin my backside she ran her hands along my ribs and my legs lizzie found the thin blade at my ankle she ran her fingernails along the skin of my leg she was so busy toying with me that her search was incomplete shed not thought to pat down my tie boys and their toys lizzie said she flicked the knife at my face i didnt flinch she stopped a good inch away from my cheek it seemed to displease her i hadnt given the reaction she wanted i can make you flinch she said i will lizzie step back beth said lizzie obeyed the preference is not to shoot you lizzie said it makes a mess she stepped back tucked my knife in her belt she picked up the surujin and began its slow swing again there is a whole subclass of punkass killers who have seen a hong kong or tokyo gangster movie and decided to flash up their act a bit one supposes they think it makes them look more dangerous most of them are older than me and honestly should know better id dealt with one back in amsterdam with a japanese sword fetish and now he was dead lizzie just kept smiling at me like she wanted to encourage me to ask her on a date are you kidding me i said again put that down she didnt she laughed the little weight kept spinning slicing the air it sounded like a knife see with this i dont kill you i knock you around a bit bad bruises yes cuts yes but those can heal without too much care i can play with you a lot more a gunshot takes forever to heal trust me its so annoying and smelly the other one beth looked embarrassed for just the barest moment where is jack ming i dont know i thought he might be here truth thats why i was eager to look in that locked room and why you tried to shield me in case he was there with a gun oh how sweet beth said i wont shield you again lizzie started swinging the surujin harder higher it made a steel halo around her head why are you looking for him beth said well i wasnt expecting that question but i like the cards on the table in moments like this why are you lizzie threw the surujin the weight slammed into my shoulder with the force of a savage punch with a flick of the chain shed drawn it back to her whirling the weight in front of her she actually knew how to use the thing where do you go to surujin school she can break your nose shatter your teeth shred your ears with it beth said i really suggest you tell us what we want to know talk talk lizzie hissed because the people who have my child want him dead thats very moving lizzie walked to one side of me the weight orbiting her head the sound it made was an awful whirring hiss she was at both her weakest and her strongest when she threw it if i could keep it from coming back to her the spike was to stab someone tangled or stunned by the weight and the chain it was like a swiss army knife of weapons and these people they just want jack dead beth asked yes kill him and i get my kid back that is so sweet lizzie said youll be the bestest daddy ever beth said jack ming is going to die you can see it happen if you like but we do the job not you something inside me broke they had a gun on me fair enough and the one playing at samurai was crazy as hell but this was over youll forgive me if i dont trust you to do what needs doing were taking the responsibility off you man lizzie said and then what then we talk no then i go get my son if jack mings dead no thats not going to happen im sorry lizzie said i wasnt sure what she enjoyed more the stab or the twist beth said i would like to know where we can find your friend mila i dont know i said i think youre lying lizzie said this whatever youre doing on the side it ends now on the side working for someone other than special projects lizzie said were on the same side babe she made the last word sound like a plop of poison you just have to stand aside and let us clean up this mess oh these two were going to kill jack ming all right but they were going to kill august too and whoever came with him and they were going to kill me after id told them where mila was someone inside special projects was protecting novem soles and knew about the bounty on mila and had decided to kill the proverbial two birds with one stone and that someone did not care one whit whether i lived or my child lived august knew who else okay i said you kill jack ming then i get my kid back and walk away you walk away if you give us mila lizzie said i didnt nod for twenty seconds and let the agony play out on my face then i nodded once where is she beth asked shes coming here in an hour to help me dispose of jack mings body she got a confirmation he was going to be here a phone call to a friend shes hunting ming yes why isnt she here with you now because killing him is my job not hers the surujin wound in an increasing arc while i talked lashed out at me it caught me in the side of the throat as i tried to dodge and felt like a baseball bat had swung into my flesh i staggered back choking hes lying lizzie said i know a liar and hes lying hes not giving mila to us she flicked it again at me and this time i whipped out my hand and caught the weight it hurt like a hammer pounding into my palm but i yanked on the chain and lizzie flew toward me i slammed a fist into her face but she kept her grip on the chain so i threw her into beth who was holding fire to keep from shooting her partner the two women hit the floor where was my gun beth had kicked it somewhere i didnt see it first things first dont get shot lizzie clambered to her feet i whirled and powered a kick into her chest knocking her back into beth the gun fired into the hardwoods shards and splinters kicked up by lizzies foot and she screamed i couldnt tell if it was rage or pain right now the biggest threat was the gun lizzie threw three brutal sharp jabs muay thai style connecting with my jaw my nose my mouth and then kicked me in the chest strong as hell i staggered back and she whipped the weighted end of the surujin downward anchoring my hands binding my wrists together but now she didnt try to drag me back i was caught she had the other end of the chain the spike gleamed in her hand she rushed me stabbing at my shoulder just as beth charged at me gun in hand doing what i would do to subdue a prisoner with useless hands put the gun to my head order me to stand down so no i dodged two stabs of lizzies and since i was bound to her she was bound to me beth lunged at me and i drove an elbow into her nose it broke and she staggered back for just a moment that was my advantage they wanted me uninjured enough to talk to give them mila i wanted them out of the way between me and my son and that could mean hurt or dead it made no difference to me at that moment in time i seized with my bound hands lizzies arm with the spike levered it up i had to get free of her beth ignored the blood streaming from her nose raising for her shot there was a connection between them they were partners not just two people assigned to kill jack ming together she would not risk a shot to lizzies head i hoped i swung lizzie hard and her arms plowed right into beths head beth went down and i yanked again pulling lizzie along with me we trampled over beth then i yanked her back again stumbling and stepping hard on beth a second time my foot hit the gun and i kicked scuttling it into the mass of russell mings junk goddamn it lizzie screamed easily frustrated not calm i got my hand on the dangling weight since lizzie still had her death grip on the spike she jabbed the spike straight at the center of my chest hitting my tie it hit the metal of my knife instead of soft flesh i clubbed the weight into the side of her head she fell hard i pulled free from the surujin kicked back from her just in time for beth to nearly open my throat she had my blade the one lizzie had handed her from my ankle i ducked as she slashed at me she was only missing by a centimeter i threw myself back in a herkyjerky dance as she advanced chasing me the blade scored along the front of my jacket slicing the lapel she overextended on her thrust and i caught her and threw her to the side i groped at my tie for my blade my tie was gone shed sliced the whole thing off severing the silk leaving a faint score on the shirt where the hell was it beth stumbled back on her feet her hand bleeding from where the blade had turned on her lizzie untangling her deadly japanese notreallyatoy my severed tie lay on the floor between them i ran grabbed the cloth felt the reassuring weight of the knife under the silk i skidded under the row of tables bordering the boxes where russell ming stored his junk i worked the knife free from the silk closed fingers around the handle the top of the table exploded into splinters punctured by the weight of the surujin my shield the table i was under flew up the two of them throwing it off me which meant they each had one hand otherwise occupied i slashed with the knife at kneelevel i caught lizzie but not beth lizzie howled but hammered the weight into the small of my back pain exploded along my spine my knife clanged against beths slash parry slash she cut at my suit sleeve i sliced across her knuckles i backed away she stayed level knife out she knew what she was doing next to her lizzie raised and started whirling the surujin then i saw the weight in her hand she whirled the end with the spike lizzie exploded it toward me and it missed me by inches drilling into one of the crates she yanked at it with a gasp but it caught in the hole shed pierced in the wood beth crouched before me defending her partner all that mattered was that for one moment the field was equal it doesnt have to end this way bitch beth told me we are going to win we are going to wear you down the fact that she was even negotiating was telling me id fought harder hurt them more than they figured i would youre between me and my kid so you either walk away and dont look back or youre dead i said when i get you in the playpen lizzie hollered you will not ever make another threat to us again we could see trade the notebook for my son i yelled for the barest moment beth paused what notebook the one jack ming filled with dirty secrets our knives clanged as she pressed the attack behind her lizzie yanked the spike free from the crate she started whirling the damned surujin again running toward us were sort of kind of on the same side beth said whos your boss i answered lizzie whipped the spike toward me arcing hard i parried it with the blade and it slammed sideways back into beths head her temple the soft part the impact was squelchy and thudding and beth fell timbering boneless her head a sudden brutal mess on the side for a moment neither of us moved the blade was broken by the blunt weight of the spike i held it because i had no other weapon and then lizzie began to scream incoherent rage the kind of fury that rises like a storm in the soul she screamed meggie she yanked back the spike by seizing onto the chain whipping it into a cloud of frenzy i dropped the broken knife grabbed the one still clutched in beths hand i stood and the weight of lizzies surujin began to spiral around my neck instinct to save my throat kicked in and i raised my arm the weight and the chain caught it pressing it against my face the blade now above my head wedged and useless lizzie yanked me toward her the spike raised the whirring had cleaned a fair amount of beths brain and blood off of it no playpen for me no keeping me alive now now there was just the vast awful empty rage in her eyes so i flowed with the tug on the chain and i threw myself into her we crashed to the floor she hit me in the head with the spike and the weight at the same time cymballing my head i couldnt shrug free from the chain to release my arm and she whirled me loose and snapped a brutal kick into my face i fell back and then she looped the chain in a savage noose and began to squeeze her knees in my back colors swam before my eyes broke apart descended into grays i gritted my teeth the blade was beyond my reach i pulled away from her like a plow horse dragging an impossible weight grasping for the knife she howled and shoved her foot hard against my spine daniel the thought of him fueled me my hand closed around the knife she leapt over me clawing for it and this is how a person dies the pressure on the chains eased we both grabbed for the knife i could hardly breathe when she tried to pull it away i let her do the work and i just steered it with a thrust that surprised us both the blade pierced her chest she gasped a very quiet sound for such a loud bragging fool i lay beside her there was not a lot of blood because it had slid into the heart with a pure straightness she didnt die as fast as beth but then she was gone i pushed her off me special projects was basically a rogue group what happened when you had a rogue inside the rogue they know about mila and they know about my son ill do what they want and theyll just ask for mila next it wont ever end ever i staggered to my feet i pulled the chain free from my throat like a man just spared from the gallows i got to the window and i spat blood think i dug in my pocket i found my cell phone i just hoped i still had my voice special projects headquarters manhattan the phone buzzed early at am and august had changed the ring tone to match an appropriate song aretha franklins classic cover of until you come back to me hello the informant said hello august said so were doing this an hour early forgive the change of plans it didnt surprise august the informant was trying to keep him slightly offkilter he supposed it gave the informant a sense of control yes i want you and you alone showing up why those people i pissed off are threatening to kill me and say they can do it as soon as i surrender to you that theyve got people inside your team ready to bring my head on a platter that is what is known as a scare tactic my friend youre not my friend im trying to save your life yeah whatever i can assure you of your safety i am so reassured august you havent told me how you know my name ill tell you when youve made me safe august was silent you dont tell anyone where youre going you come alone understood and when ive seen the evidence we get you to a safe house and we get you your money itll be worth it august i promise they are insane that i have this insane understood dont lie to me i have had a shitty week i want this to go smoothly and to be a day you talk about when they hand you the gold watch im all for that august said go to the united nations plaza be there in thirty minutes alone like you promised ill call you then he hung up august folded the phone he headed out the door he told no one where he was going but two men on the street followed him a visitor might expect the united nations plaza would be a riotous color of international garb but it seemed most people wore the same dark suits nowadays and everyone seemed to be speaking english august stood at the plazas edge for four minutes before his phone rang you came alone as promised where are you not here go to fao schwarz on fifth ill call you there stay alone im watching how august thought he pocketed the phone in annoyance he understood the informants precautions but this seemed almost theatrical was the informant watching him now he glanced around smoothing out his pale hair with his hand he walked and doubledback he did not spot a tail the two men tracking him fell off to be replaced by two new ones one staying ahead of august one behind frowning at fao schwarz tourist children danced on keyboards and august thought they still make those kids swarmed the aisles and standing there alone childless august thought i dont want to draw attention one mother with fouryearold twin boys orbiting her gave him the greasy eyeball of doubt he told himself he was a visiting businessman buying a gift for his own child and thats how he would act the phone rang as he surveyed an astonishing display of action figures id like my own action figure august was thinking new york spy skulking guy he answered the phone youre supposed to be alone august the informant said i spy with my little eye two goobers who picked you up at un and are still with you august kept his poker face in place how did he know he had agents following him tasked to help him scoop up the informant now those guys could be your buddies backing you up or novem soles following you to get us both into a corner and to kill me dead lose them august was silent shocked do you know what they look like no august lied one is black wearing a blue suit and dark rectangular glasses the other has brown slightly longish hair wearing jeans and a maroon shirt lose them when you have lost them ill call you back he hung up august lingered for a moment in the aisle shaken and doing his best not to show it when he walked out of the store he brushed his hand twice through his thick blond hair it was a signal the meeting was off the trackers would retreat back to the special projects office he had not anticipated his shadows being spotted not by a kid he stood outside the store hailed a cab and got inside the phone rang before he had the door shut go to brooklyn the flea market in williamsburg dont be followed august figured it out en route to brooklyn the clever little punk had hacked his way into the traffic camera system and into the private security cameras at the toy store any place he sent august had an active multiplecamera presence all were very public spaces thats how he was watching august he would have an entrance into the flea markets camera system as well he called the special projects office hes tracking us via traffic and store security cameras see if you can trace him off the fao schwartz or williamsburg brooklyn flea market camera feeds hes hacking into them right now get a team to brooklyn now we need to scoop him up immediately when he gives me a final destination will do august leaned back in the cab the phone rang yes i changed my mind heres where i want you to go ming building brooklyn leonie stared down at beth and lizzie her mouth trembled i know them she said in a hushed tone i sat on the floor inspecting my injuries i was sore and exhausted but i didnt have time to hurt nothing was broken as far as i could tell i unknotted my slashed tie threw it on the floor how do you know them her mouth worked i made new identities for them as lizzie and i remembered the name lizzie had screamed meggie no those were their real names lizzie and meggie pearson they were from oregon their father he killed their mother in front of them and then told everyone his wife and kids had left him but he kept the sisters in a cage in his basement for three years when they were little the father finally got too close to the cage and the girls strangled him against the bars they were maybe ten and nine didnt you hear about that one of those stories where they were all the news for five minutes then the world forgot about them i grew up overseas no i never heard of them they got put into foster care but i dont think they ever recovered no family would keep them for long meggie was cold and calculating lizzie was crazy and vicious they were in trouble with the law a lot there was talk that they had killed a college student who knew lizzie slightly nothing was proven but he was found dead in a cage in an abandoned cabin cage playpen they had to vanish leonies voice broke oh god oh god we have to get out of here why leonie stepped away from lizzies body shuddering because someone i knew once wanted them to come work for him and he needed them to have new identities not be the least bit notorious new names new histories so they could work for him unimpeded as hired killers yes and as interrogators lizzie is supposed to be good at getting information out of people and you hid them yes thats what i did for three years hid people for him before i hid myself who the man im hiding from sam who leonie his name is ray brewster he must be behind all this he must be who is he she stared out the window through the slats her fist pressed against her mouth theyre here ming building brooklyn i stepped next to leonie and i watched through the slats august holdwine approached the building from the sidewalk via the back entrance along the alleyway alone he was in jeans a dark untucked shirt a summerweight jacket probably to conceal his weapon so if august was here where was jack ming august moved along the alleyway hand tucked under blazer being careful maybe if i stood and waved hed wave back could invite him up to hang out with leonie and me and the dead sisters after all were all looking for the same guy stay here i said to leonie shed heard my shocked intake of breath come closer to the window what is it is it ming no someone else has shown up here who the hell is that the cia she sucked in breath has he tracked him here either that or hes meeting him which means annas source is deadon right anna had someone inside special projects was it this ray brewster i wasnt sure if that theory made sense i had thought i could grab and deal with ming before the meeting before august or anyone else showed up now i was literally out of time where was ming he had to be close probably watching august to ensure that he showed and perhaps that he showed alone conditions for the meeting would have been set stay here dont let him see you let me handle this i said if this goes wrong and we get separated or im captured go to a bar called the last minute its right by bryant park in manhattan ask for bertrand tell him youre a friend of mine hell protect you she nodded you know this man she said pointing down toward august yes leonie clutched my arm you are not negotiating with this man sam you have to kill jack ming end of story you must i will your friend there walk away without a fight his name is august no i know him too well no then are you going to kill august who matters more your friend or your kid no never i thought how far would you go to save your son leonies words ricocheted around my brain quit being so bloodthirsty its not your friend and your finger on the trigger its not your conscience she flinched im not bloodthirsty i just want my child back dont you then before i could answer she made her voice a knife maybe not its not like youve seen him its not like you could really love him i yanked my arm from her hand the shock on my face must have been reflected on her own oh my god sam i am so sorry i dont know why i said that please listen to me i said right now call my cell phone ill listen on the earbud im going to keep august downstairs and talk to him but i want to know if ming comes into sight i want to know immediately if you see him she nodded dont hang up and dont panic ming building brooklyn i hurried down the stairs to the second floor were the doors unlocked i waited at the top of the stairs that led down to the ground floor august opened the door he came through with gun drawn arm extended classic stance to sweep the room he froze when he saw me i kept my hands raised empty of a weapon hi i didnt know what else to say my best friend stared up at me in shock for one moment he wavered five long seconds ticked by but he kept his gun leveled at me you look like youve been beaten to hell man yes i nodded what are you doing here sam i have a favor to ask you biggest one ever come down here i stayed put this is what i need you to do turn around and leave you hear from jack ming again you ignore it let him go jack ming is that my new friends name why would you want me to give him the cold shoulder shut the hell up and just go no why are you here sam now augusts voice rose i started to walk down the steps my gun was holstered in the small of my back my hands were in the air i knew there was a spy inside special projects another traitor whod likely been bought maybe this ray brewster and if i told august the truth the traitor could learn it no matter how careful august was it could be his teammate his boss and they would never give me back daniel if i exposed their man so i lied this is a trap novem soles wants to capture you pick your brain what are you doing here and i heard what i didnt want to hear in his voice suspicion how did you even know im here he thinks im one of them now oh my god jack ming is here i heard leonies voice in my earbud he just ran to the door from the building across the alleyway hes coming in now no time no time to react the door slammed open and caught august with its edge he staggered back i saw jack ming power up a gun aimed at augusts head drop your gun the young man screamed and august did and the young man looked up at me id pulled my weapon and he still had his gun leveled at august drop it he screamed drop it now shoot him i thought just shoot him and this is over but the gun his gun so close to augusts head i couldnt i dropped the gun you he said and i wasnt sure if he was speaking to me or to august but he aimed his glare at me i was the surprise not august the chinese hacker from amsterdam august paled you were shot you were dead i said we thought he didnt need to know i was hunting him i wanted him to think i was just as surprised as august at his identity notice my clever use of we if he was surrendering to the cia then let him think i was part of the cia even if it bought me ten seconds of confusion i would have to kill him in front of august that was that then run like a coward in the slim hope that novem soles would give me my child back august said the past is the past and im guessing since youre coming to me that all is forgiven i remembered the cia team roughed up jack a bit jack gave a little shrug we had a deal im ready to carry forward that deal lower your weapon lets talk about novem soles august said the young mans gaze slid to me i remained very still if i moved for my gun he could blow augusts brains onto the wall but then he swung the gun toward me not yet why is he here hes one of them no im not this had all gone south i couldnt draw on him and risk augusts life but for daniel to live he had to die i saw you in amsterdam he said to me you were working with nic no i was working with him i nodded toward august august thank god kept his mouth shut at this lie no the cia was hunting you youd run from them they talked about you in front of me when they thought i didnt understand jack mings mouth narrowed what the hell is this why is he here august after a long long moment august said answer the man sam i said nothing august said listen to me sam used to be cia he has fought against novem soles and hes okay i can assure you of that he stared up at me jacks hand with the gun was shaking ever so slightly the hacker had claws and didnt know what to do a weird back corner of me wanted to say your mother is dead im sorry im sorry its come to this kind of awful im sorry i have to kill you i couldnt use august to help me i said only you to come jack said to august i didnt invite him august said oh no i played my hand listen to me there are two dead women upstairs they were here waiting for you jack novem soles is hunting you i became aware of this fact and aware that this was where we were meeting how could you know because i figured out who you were really were not a chinese student from hong kong jack ming new yorker and runaway hacker i needed three seconds to shoot him i needed him not to be aiming at augusts head i know because i was smart enough to find you who are these women sam did you kill them august asked kill jack what are you waiting for leonie hissed in my ear what are you waiting for i was waiting because if i didnt kill him i wanted to find a way to burn novem soles to the ground and still get my kid back the thought had been in the back of my mind a constant trickle i wouldnt hear but consider the sisters they tried to take me without killing me and it didnt work out i couldnt end up like them ming swung the gun away from august and aimed it at the center of my chest he clutched it with the other hand and for an amateur it telegraphed he meant to fire august threw himself into ming and the bullet cracked two inches from my head i jumped down from the stairs and pulled them apart i wrenched the gun from mings hand and knocked him to the floor his gun dropped to the concrete jacks foot hit it as we struggled and it skittered into shadows beyond the dim gleam of the entry light august stood raising his own gun oh did not want that thank you i said and slammed my fist into the side of my friends head he staggered and i hit him again hard across his wrist the gun fell from his nerveless fingers what the hell he yelled and he parried my next blow what are you doing leonie who had been silent started screaming in my ear wanting to know what was happening i couldnt shoot august i wouldnt shoot him i just needed him sidelined so that i could kill jack ming i would explain later if he let me if he didnt shoot me on sight i hit august a hard right cross catching him off balance and he fell but as he hit the concrete he kicked out at my legs i hit the floor mad wed entered special projects together trained together sparred together august was bigger than me heavy with minnesota farm and college football muscle that he maintained and now he was mad at me for screwing up what had to be a career highlight he delivered a kick toward my chest and i caught his foot corner of my eye i saw jack ming scrambling for his gun he might shoot both of us i would if i were him i pulled on the foot going into a roll knocking august off balance he was bigger than me but i was more wiry and faster i couldnt think of him as a friend i couldnt not now he wrenched free from my grip despite his bulk i underestimated how strong he was and kicked me catching me in the face heel hit jaw hurt like hell where id already been battered by the sisters i felt blood on my lips august circled me a look mixing disgust and confusion on his face and hammered three hard fast punches into my chest i fell back against the wall i felt the raised thumbs of the light switches stab my spine he started to scream at ming and i stumbling back twisted to see ming running gun in hand but running from both of us throwing himself out into the alley grab him august screamed and i didnt know if he was talking to me or to a partner who was listening in same as leonie i yelled mings heading out but i already heard footsteps pounding on the stairs leonie dashed past me and august he made a grab at her but she dodged him mostly because i roundhousekicked him as hard as i could in the chest he fell but as i turned to pursue ming i stumbled over his backpack hed left it behind in his panic i fell august huffing closed hands around my throat and threw me into the adjoining unfinished wall id complained about to meggie when she was pretending to be beth marley the drywall gave way and we tumbled through it together coughing i fought to free his grip from my throat he wouldnt let go and those damn sausagethick fingers started to squeeze the life out of me he didnt want me dead he wanted me out of the way so i sagged like i was passing out he let go and levered back a fist to slam it into my face i clawed my hands around his fist and held it still why he yelled theyre gonna kill my kid if i dont i said before i could think evacuate the informant if you have him he yelled oh crap he was talking to someone he was wired a team was here i shoved him off me and i seized a splintered support from the broken wall i wrenched it free and i skimmed it right across the back of the skull he collapsed for one horrifying second i thought i had killed him i checked him he was breathing i ran stumbling into the alley after leonie and jack into whatever awaited the streets of williamsburg jack ming bolted from the building into the cool of the alleyway the red notebook wedged in the back of his pants hidden under a jacket rubbed his skin at the top of his butt he could hardly breathe this had been a trap either august had set him up or august had been set up himself there would be no surrendering to him today that capra guy was after him he stumbled he had to get out of the neighborhood neither of those guys might be here alone he heard the chook of the discharge from a small gun nearly soft in the humid air he felt the heat of a bullet whizz close to his ear someone was shooting at him he stumbled turned and saw a woman racing after him she was petite redhaired with mouth gritted she wore jeans and sneakers and a blue tshirt and she looked like a young suburban mother she stopped and she stared at him as he stared back at her backing away in shock and for a second he screamed get out of here someones shooting but she raised a gun it shook in her hand forgive me she said you have to die im sorry and she fired as he turned and ran toward the end of the alley a black lincoln navigator slammed to a stop thirty feet ahead of him blasting toward him he had nowhere to go i heard the distant pellmell of shots the space between them told me they werent fired with confidence i hit the door and ran into the alleyway and headed toward the gunfire it was the battle of the hackers who couldnt shoot straight leonie stood discharging the weapon at the running ming she hadnt hit him as far as i could see two men in suits spilled out of a lincoln navigator braked in the alley i know special projects when i see it and these two were augusts men i hurtled past leonie told her to run take cover jack stopped tottered caught between the twin threats one of the men seized him from behind as he turned back to leonie just as i ran past her and levered him toward the navigator the other man stocky short with a neck thick with muscle raced toward us aimed his weapon at me dont shoot i yelled holdwine is in trouble and he paused he knew me wed worked briefly in new york before lucy and i moved to london his name was griffith and that moment of recognition tethered to doubt bought me three seconds i wouldnt have had otherwise hes been shot by that kid i yelled hes lying ming screamed stop griffith yelled but too late i slammed into him with a jump if id stopped to throw a punch it would have telegraphed my halftruth of being on augusts side i knocked the wind out of his chest tumbled to the pavement rolled against a dumpster the other agent who i didnt know strongarmed jack toward the navigator and aimed his pistol back across the hood at me jack fought him and he had to turn his attention to jack to force him into the car and i ran toward them both the agent shoved jack into the drivers side then followed him into the navigator he wheeled hard rocketing out of the alley backing into traffic with a blaring of horns he had to wait several seconds to execute a uturn he was leaving griffith and august behind which meant they were under orders that jack ming had to be protected at all costs i ran at full throttle i hoped the adrenaline rush would make up for any lack of gracefulness like i showed in my sloppy running back in las vegas i didnt dodge into traffic behind them i read the road the direction theyd gone with a glance the level of traffic the obstacles the shifting pattern of the cars you have to read the terrain in a parkour run and thats why normally you only run where youve walked and explored thoroughly i was breaking a basic rule he was out in traffic i couldnt catch him but one chance insane but i did it running at full power i jumped onto the trunk and roof of a parked car next to the alleyway and launched myself timing it to land on the side of a moving ny metro bus barreling past closing in on them i gripped a side ad of the bus and clambered past the astonished stares of the riders onto the roof everything hurt fingers arms chest legs brain the bus driver trying to figure out what that sound of an impact was against his bus slowed no doubt the passengers were telling him a crazy man was on board i ran the length of the bus as it slowed launching myself onto the roof of the navigator just one perfect shot and my son would be safe training dictated that i eliminate the bigger threat the other special projects agent he could kill me before i got to jack and although i was willing to kill jack i wasnt eager to kill an innocent man the navigator skidded into a parked car on the passenger side i slid off the roof onto the trunk on my knees gun drawn i emptied the clip into the windshield the reinforced glass pocked but didnt surrender to the bullets i placed my shots hard and neat where jack ming sat and i swear above the roar of traffic and horns and the gun blasts i could hear jack ming screaming but the glass held through the blizzard of fractures in the windshield i could see jack scrambling toward the back of the navigator squeezing between the driver and passenger seats wriggling toward the rear exit panicking the agent was brave he was going to cover jack mings escape good guy doing his job my throat thickened at the thought of what i would have to do he jacked down his window and he snaked an arm around the windshield to fire at me i dropped off the trunk heard the first bullet kiss the paint i was trapped in a narrow wedge between the parked car and the navigator the pavement was warm the tire slanted toward me and i barely had room to curve and wriggle between the cars to get under the navigator i started snaking toward the back the cars heat radiated against me to my left the drivers door opened and i saw a foot hit the ground i shot the agent in the fleshy part of the calf he howled and the leg withdrew into the car ahead of me i saw red converse sneakers hit the asphalt running i writhed out from under the car dodging through stalled and slowing traffic the sidewalks had cleared at the first sound of the shots thank you considerate frightened pedestrians but i had to dodge cars and jack fresh and unbeaten bolted at full speed on the fast emptying sidewalks he rounded a corner and vanished i chased him he glanced back fear on his face an ache tore through my ribs in my chest where august had dealt me a beating where id thrown myself against the bus trying to sneak up on them had hurt me a cheap street market loomed up ahead one of those full of stuff like prepaid cell phones and knockoff purses and anything from lingerie to dvd players still in original packing but not sold at original prices people thronged between the booths along the edges old folks kids babies in strollers scatterings of families i couldnt risk a shot at him not there too many people jack dodged between the tables and the booths loud chinese pop and a competing undercurrent of reggae thrummed the air i risked a backward glance and saw leonie a few blocks back weaving toward us shed had the presence of mind to hide the gun i didnt see either august or his men but they would either be coming very soon or calling in reinforcements i tailed jack ming into the marketplace he glanced back every ten seconds to see if i was following we were blocks from where wed started and this crowd was calm and he wasnt eager to panic them he wanted them between me and him he wasnt screaming for help or for the police he was determined to run and he was determined to stay in a crowd the fear in his face tore at me i didnt want to kill this man august opened his eyes his face hurt everything hurt blood on the back of his head sticky he got to his feet he heard the whine of the metal door opening footsteps pounding the concrete floor he groped for his gun gone his head felt broken and dreamy and misty concussion probably a woman petite red hair pulled back into a ponytail wearing jeans and a tshirt she stared at him and raised the gun in her hand stay there she said stay right there he stayed right there he saw her gaze dart about the room she ran to jack mings knapsack lifted it almost gently before she picked it up he could see in its unzippered opening a small laptop she grabbed the knapsack put it over her shoulder she kept the gun leveled at august just stay there she ordered him who are you he said of course she didnt answer she kept her gaze on him tightened her grip on the gun she vanished back out into the alley august staggered to the door who the hell was she was she in league with ming or with sam he came out into the alley and she shot at him not close enough to hit but you know a bullet in your general direction is enough to make you retreat i told you to stay she screamed at him one of the backups griffith was lying in the alley groaning pawing at his ribs no sign of the navigator he counted to twenty and risked coming out the door again the redhead was gone he keyed his earphone two this is one report im getting the informant away were being pursued an armed male he knew your name he said you were shot and then chaos the distant thrum of metal against metal crashing the drumdrumdrum of gunshots hitting bulletproof glass grimes cussing screaming at someone to get down and stay down jack mings voice answering i am getting the fuck out of here the hostile is trying to kill the kid grimes said and then more shots grimes howled and cussed again august ran now where are you the hostile sam capra his best friend who should have wanted nothing more than an informant from novem soles coming forward was trying to kill their best hope of unveiling the rings every secret august ran i ran ahead of me jack ming dodged a booth full of dvds from bollywood and hong kong leaping over the stacked tables scattering packaging and earning a scream of annoyance and rage from the elderly vendor the man hollered at him in a quilted howl of obscene english and mandarin ming stumbled and his tshirt hiked up his back he reached for something in the small of his back and i thought it was a gun and i couldnt let him shoot the old man but it was a swath of red leather like a book or a journal firmly lodged in the back of his pants he yanked his shirt back over it he was making sure it was still there the notebook the secrets of novem soles i hollered in mandarin he stole my wallet there are decided advantages to having parents who give you a nomadic worldwide existence as a kid i can produce a large selection of random utterances in two dozen languages i knew that phrase because id had it yelled at me more than once in beijing when i was fifteen i got bored easily the vendor grabbed at jack who screamed hes lying hes trying to kill me which story is more likely to be believed in new york the vendor closed his hold on jack who kicked away from him landing an awkward punch on the mans face the old man fell back onto a stack of bollywood epics that now spread on the asphalt like a fallen house of cards i was jumping over the table when jack proved himself next vendor over was a stirfry stand and jack seized the searing hot pot and flung it at me i twisted and ducked and the scalding grease and shreds of meat landed against my jacket in my hair real honest pain i dusted the meaty napalm free from my head and shoulders and singed my palms and fingers in the process glops of grease bubbled the plastic cases of the dvds the vendor caught a small splatter of it on his arm and cried out in pain i gritted my teeth finally free of the searing mess and ran out the booth jack was gone fifteen seconds is a lifetime in an urban chase that was about what i had lost run catch him how hard could it be to kill a computer geek i saw him skid into a crossstreet and grab a cab he piled in the back and the cab roared forward i reached the intersection hurrying to its middle trying to see the cab name and a number a guy in a ducati motorcycle nearly ran over me yelling at me in furious spanish as he barreled past he called out unkind words about my mother i ran after him the ducati slowed for braking traffic the cab was several cars ahead i stayed three steps behind mr ducati just past the corner of his eye and as he came to a stop i introduced an elbow to his throat between the shielding of the helmet he wore and his jacket when i hit i dont tickle i hit hard its a lot harder blow than i look like i can deliver the guy was blocky and squat and he perched on the ducati like it was a mobile throne hed mouthed off at me the fool in the intersection and then forgotten about me his eyes looking ahead for the next obstacle i slammed him off the bike he didnt yell he just went over and he made a choking noise i knew hed recover id pulled the punch manners i said in spanish and i roared onto the sidewalk people screamed and parted out of my way i could see the cab four or five cars ahead of me to the right i was surrounded by witnesses but he was here he was here and i had to make this work the gun felt heavy at the back of my ruined suit jacket i left it there i veered the ducati hard past a parked truck between me and his cab and saw the cabs back door open swinging as the cab braked jack had jumped somewhere along the street hed seen me pursuing him i scanned the crowd alleyways streets doors then i saw him stumbling running in the distance i powered the ducati cutting across the traffic he ran up the stairs in front of a hipsterish modernarchitecture brownstone that was all glass and cube and i saw him pull a small gun awkwardly from his pocket the door opened and a young woman exited jack waved the gun in her face and she screamed and crouched obeying his order then jack vanished inside the cowering woman kept the door propped open frozen in fear i roared the bike up the stairs after him through the open door i wanted him scared i wanted him panicked i wanted him not stopping to aim at me he ran up the apartments stairs as i vroomed across the tile floor of the lobby eyes forward intent on fleeing only glancing at me i braked with a foot wheeled the ducati in a circle with a deafening screech and powered the bike up the sleek steel stairs the motorcycle jittered and roared not built for this punishment but i rocketed it the roar of the bike made him run and he was about to run out of road so to speak i spun on the landing zoomed up the next flight my spine felt like it was about to separate from my body he ran up the final flight i followed the engine huffing its protestations he glanced back at me once but because i hunkered down on the bike when he shot the bullet zoomed well past me he was unnerved i needed him to stay that way if this was going to work i reached the landing and jack ran hard down the hallway in the direction of the street toward a windowcovered dead end fear is a weird mistress she can stop you dead and cripple you or she can harden your heart with courage jack mings heart hardened in those last few seconds he spun and he fired the blasts from the gun bright and heatdizzying in the dim of the hallway i fell back off the bike and it roared forward the remaining few feet straight toward him he threw himself out of the way the bike rocketed past him smashing through the glass wall it tipped out into the sudden glare of the day and i distantly heard it crash three stories down onto the pavement for a second lying on my side time froze jack leveled the gun at me face wrenched with shock and horror i had nearly run him down with the motorcycle and the gust of wind from the window ruffled his hair now i could see every detail of his face he was barely past being a kid he fumbled at a door lock the door marked with a red exit sign the knob wouldnt move i groped at my back my fingers searching my ragged voice saying im sorry but my gun was gone from my holster he stared at me as he worked the knob oh god i must have lost it either in the jump to the car or along the hallway when i skidded then he fired the gun but not at me he shifted its aim sent a bullet into the lock of the door marked stairs the lock broke he shoved the door open and he ran i lurched to my feet as he bolted through the door i followed he hurried up a short stairway and then through a rooftop door he opened and then slammed shut on a rooftop i could be king and jack ming had no chance i grabbed the doorknob as he tried to shut it the door froze in our tug of war then the little gun appeared in the gap close by my head i ducked he fired i let go the door slammed shut i counted to ten fifteen the moment i opened the door he could shoot me in the head twenty i yanked open the door just a bit i could hear in the open air the approaching whine of a police siren this building would soon be swarming with new yorks finest and if they caught me before i could reach jack ming my son was dead i eased out onto the roof i didnt see him lots of places for him to hide water tanks ac units vents all he had to do was wait until the police showed maybe hed surrender to them and theyd ferry him to august or special projects compared with the option of dying at my hands hed prefer the police the roof was quiet the neighboring roofs were both a halfstory higher but i didnt think hed have had time to clamber up them then i saw him running he had scrambled onto the roof next door hunkered down for a moment but i could see the top of his head ducking back down hed risked a look it was a bad risk i ran toward him and scrambled onto the neighboring building there was no alley dividing the two and jack sprinted full out dodging between the obstacles on the roof and jumping across a narrow gap to the next building most people hesitate at a jump he didnt brave or desperate his arms caught the wall he screamed in terror that sort of blind terror that makes your bones hurt then he pulled himself over to safety my turn i shoved my mind into the old parkour groove see the obstacles find the fastest and most effective way over them under them through them i timed the jump and launched myself i cleared the edge of the building and landed in a roll my muscles howled they had missed this particular form of exercise i spotted ming running full out looking back at me once terror bright in his gaze then he fired a shot at me and kept going just chase him off the roof i thought if he falls hes still dead at this height and daniel is safe i ran i had to catch him daniel the son id never held crowded out every other thought but run jump catch my blood fevered my mind went primeval simple he had a head start of fifty yards on me and i had to catch him forty yards he pulled himself up a remodeling now condos available soon banner using the edge of it like a rope onto the roof of a neighboring building i arrowed straight toward him he stumbled again i glanced behind me the roof wed exited onto was empty but it wouldnt be for long the police would be swarming what with the cycle crashing and shots fired it would be more than a single patrol car responding the thoughts went scattershot through my brain in seconds i focused on running jack was running very very hard survival instinct kicked into full but i was trained in this and i was faster police i heard a voice boom across the rooftops stop lay down your weapons i glanced back two officers scrambling out the door where jack nearly shot me in the head i put my gaze back to where jack was running gone i scanned the roof i was approaching ming had been running across it stupidly in a straight line and hed vanished onto a lower roof when id glanced back at the sound of the pursuing officer now id lost him no halt the police yelled as i topped the roofs edge and dropped onto the next building hed run out of space chimneys vents a brick shack for the doorway to the stairs into the building there was equipment up here the bright blue blisters of building wrap scaffolding climbing above the farthest edge of the roof renovations were underway maybe hed ducked under the wrap which was everywhere maybe hed gone through the door if he dropped down into a buildings stairwell i could run right past him panic frosted my heart i headed for the door i had to choose now the police would be broadcasting my location and other units responding would be directed to intercept me i rounded the corner to the stairwell entrance and jack swung a heavy flowerpot at me i caught it on my arm and the bone screamed i fell back and he raised the gun it clicked empty he moaned i slammed my foot into his stomach he grunted breathlessly and staggered back police down on the ground down they were drawing closer maybe forty yards away two of them climbing up onto the roof i guess the other cops didnt want to make the same leap jack and i had made i jumped to my feet dont kill me please god dont kill me his voice pleading a voice ragged with tears he yanked on the door it was locked from inside i grabbed him with my good arm id had thoughts of trying to use him against novem soles build an insurance policy to get my son back fragments of a crazy plan that wouldnt have worked but there was no time no time for him or for me or for daniel my arm didnt feel right where hed clipped it with the heavy pot i could break his neck if i had a minute but the police were closing in on us just thirty feet away i didnt have the time i shoved him hard toward the edge of the building pushing him toward the edge keeping him offbalance in an unyielding grip sorry i said it so soft i didnt think he heard me get away from there get on the ground one of the cops bellowed at us jack fought me screaming begging if i just wrap arms around him and shove we both go over and the cops cant beat gravity i thought ten more feet no no jack screamed theyll kill my kid if i dont im sorry i yelled if we both went over maybe they would give daniel to leonie when they give her back her daughter she would make sure hes okay i knew her well enough to know her basic decency hell be dead itll be in the paper my job would be done my son free no no jack ming screamed my grip on his forearm closed like an iron cuff this is the only way i threw us both off the gravel roof and my foot landed on scaffolding this side of the building was under remodeling jack arm pinwheeling screaming grabbed at an upright bar but i yanked him away from life from safety i saw his fingertips brush the metal pole and miss the balls of my feet hit the edge of the scaffolding and i pushed beyond my hands gripping his arm into air gravity slipped its fatal embrace around us jack mings scream rose and rushed hard into my ears three stories its not far to fall but its enough the images of the alleyway below burst through my mind a memory that would only imprint for a moment before death i cant see the asphalt of the alleyway parked in the space between the buildings are big dump trucks blue canopies more scaffolding on the sides now behind us the renovation gear crowded the alleyway we plummeted toward blue canopy a surprising pond jack wrenched free from my grip two more seconds and we hit ripping the thin plastic sheet but it slowed our fall like rain striking a leaf before dripping onto the mud the canopy tore yawned like a sleepy mouth metal rods snapped loose from under the canopy cracking like bones then the tearing fabric having cocooned us spat us both free in a slow awkward tumble just below us was a truck its load covered in black plastic we tore through the plastic and hit sand a metal rod clanged against the back panel of the truck pain gripped me shook my already hurt arm a drift of canopy settled on me like a blanket i realized i was still breathing every inch of me recategorized pain but i still breathed i kicked the shredded canopy off me sand abraded my face what the hell a guy exclaimed he stood on scaffolding six feet away from me and seven feet above he hovered over me inspecting me as though he couldnt believe id fallen out of the sky what the holy hell if im still alive then so was i saw jack scurrying off the sand at the front of the truck on the drivers side of the cab the sand had scraped his face raw he bled from his ears he fared better in the fall than i did he dropped out of sight but moments later the truck gave a little shift like a door had opened and slammed closed stop i said but there was hardly any breath in me my arm the same one jack had nailed with the heavy ceramic pot didnt feel right stop him the engine started and the truck jerked forward jack bulldozed the truck through the detritus of construction the canisters of paint the stacked drywall the wooden barriers erected to keep out the curious and the stickyfingered he blared the horn skidded the truck out into the brooklyn traffic i gripped the edge of the truck with my good arm holding on for the ride the sand truck smashed along the cars parked on the side of the street metal crunched glass shattered i tried to get to my knees on the sand and then the back of the trucks bed fell open i didnt know if jack got clever and resourceful he was already that hed thought of stealing the truck before i did or if he just hit the wrong switch or if the rods that hit the truck when we fell damaged the catch that kept the hinge of the bed in place the sand spilled as though from a broken hourglass and carried me with it into a slide onto the street cars behind the truck braked as the sand exploded out onto them which was good because i tumbled out with the sand and i landed on a heap of it approximately three feet in front of a honking cab i leapt forward and the sand stopped the cabs bumper just short of my shoes i tried to scramble to my feet jack hammered that sand truck through the traffic leaving a swath i saw him barrel through a red light turn and he was gone i pulled myself out of the sand heap i saw the cab that nearly hit me was empty and so i kicked the sand heap smooth back toward the building where wed fallen there were multiple police units and officers racing down the sidewalk i felt certain someone was going to point at me at any moment i did not care to have a discussion with the police so i got into the cab there was no one in the back seat hi i said to the cabbie are you for hire he stared at my sandy self turned around in the seat gaping my oncesleek burberry suit was a ruin i was bloodied and holding my arm awkwardly and i still had that black eye i glanced at his name on the cab permit vasily antonov russian so i said to vasily in russian can you take me where i need to go speaking russian must have reassured him cars behind him were honking so he inched forward over and through the sand the cops stormed past us toward the intersection where jack had turned where do you need to go he asked me back in russian we pulled up to the intersection where jack had turned with the truck turn right please still in russian you want me to follow the sand truck he answered that would be great this man stole your truck yes sounded as good a reason as any you look like you put up a good fight for your truck i tried i said six blocks down the truck was pulled over the door stood open the cab empty jack ming was gone my arm was broken he knew my face he knew i was hunting him and intended to kill him and the police swarmed everywhere i had to retreat daniel im sorry dad is so sorry baby wherever you are take me here i gave him the last minutes address i had to hope leonie had made it there as well nice bar yes ive gotten fares there he glanced at me so where in russia are you from i guess i had no accent he could detect i once lived in moscow it was easier to lie than to explain my globetrotting childhood salted with a dozen languages before i was even sixteen ah i did not know a russian speaker owned that bar i will recommend it to the tourists and you are always welcome to come in for a drink when off duty ah thank you thank you sir i said and leaned back against the upholstery the cabbie slid in a tape of russian pop music to pass the time electrostyle sounded like tatiana bulanova so thoughtful it had a beat and you could dance to it i did my best not to pass out brooklyn you have to look normal slapping the sand off his clothes and from his hair jack ran down to the marcy avenue subway station the luck hed wheedled from the world shone on him for the last time for a while a train pulled in just as he reached the track he didnt care where it was bound he joined the press of people he sank down into one of the hard plastic seats the shock of what he had survived made him shiver no one sat next to him and that didnt surprise him he was filthy from having hit the sand his wrist hurt where sam capra had grabbed it when the lunatic the absolute fricking crazyass lunatic had thrown them both off the side of the building he leaned forward clutched his elbows with his palms the gun hed taken from his mothers apartment was gone dropped on the roof before the fall the clip was empty anyway he should have shot the man dead when he had the chance but he didnt know if he could fire a gun into another human beings face at pointblank range and hed taken the chance to run but that sam capra bastard was crazy he had thrown the two of them off a building the notebook a cold terror seized him if hed lost that he had nothing to bargain with for his life he felt its cool weight in the back of his pants the red leather had slipped further down caught in his boxers one strip of the tape torn loose the other still thank god in place he pulled out the notebook ignoring the momentary stares from the women sitting across from him not much in new york rated more than a momentary stare including producing a notebook out of your underwear he brushed the gritty sand away from the red leather hugged the volume close to his chest he couldnt go home his own mother had betrayed him the cia had failed him novem soles had sent sam capra and that redheaded woman to the rendezvous point to kill him novem soles had infiltrated augusts group they knew about the meeting what do i do now he thought where do i go and for the first time jack ming didnt know an answer or have an idea he pulled up his knees and he rode the train under the great beating heart of the city the only way at the moment he knew how to hide what do i do the notebooks weight in his hands like gold all he had hed lost his knapsack his laptop sam capras odd words rattled in jacks head i have to theyll kill my kid if i dont im sorry what did that mean and the redhead im sorry im sorry you have to die why the hell were novem soles flunkies apologizing to him it made no sense but he was willing to die to kill you he apologized for having to kill you thats not the act of a hired killer thats not the action of a cia agent gone bad thats the act of a truly desperate man theyll kill my kid jack ran his fingers along the edge of the notebook well im sorry for that sam capra he thought but im not dying for your kid sorry his first impulse was to run and keep running maybe until he hit the pacific ocean or the andes sounded like a masterful plan but you cant run forever running is what they expect you to do you have to stop them or youll never breathe free look where running has gotten you nowhere nearly dead alone fight back do what they dont expect which means using the two weapons you have your brain and this notebook not weapons bait bait to lure them in at the time and place of his choosing he started to think about a plan and he wondered that if someone would be nice enough to turn on his lost laptop he could remotely access it and he could set his burgeoning plan into motion the last minute bar manhattan sandy and tornsuited and armbusted i entered the last minute looking like the sort of guy i myself would throw out fortunately i still had the black eye to make me look even more respectable i saw leonie sitting alone at a corner table a barely touched pint of guinness in front of her her eyes widened when she saw me the bartender on duty a guy i didnt know actually started coming around from the bar to hurry me out a few patrons stared at me just to see how long and how noisy the ejection would take uh sir do you need help the bartender asked this was the polite first volley second volley to be now get out im sam capra i own the bar is bertrand here uh no mr capra hes not on duty today at least the bartender recognized my name ive been in an accident yes sir um do you want me to take you to the hospital i could feel the heat of leonies gaze on me wanting to ask is it done is jack ming dead no i want to go to the office upstairs and i want you to call bertrand and have him get here now immediately then please bring me two martinis each with two olives made with plymouth gin yes mr capra that lady in the corner table drinking the guinness shes a friend of mine comp her tab the bartender nodded eyes of customers were still on us i didnt like that are you sure youre okay mr capra yes ill be okay youre um hurt yes i know call bertrand make the martinis whats your name clark thank you clark i walked past leonie gestured slightly with my head to follow me she scooped up her backpack and her pint she waited until we were up the stairs and the door was closed behind me my god what happened she said my arm is fractured at best i emptied my pockets rental car keys wallet phone no sam what happened to jack ming i looked at her the weight of my failure suddenly felt heavier than my bad arm he got away leonie we underestimated him you were going to kill him she said this to me in the same tone as one might say you were going to pick up the milk or you were going to mail the bills her mouth trembled sam the kids they will kill our kids a knock sounded on the door i put a finger to her lips clark came in two martinis on the tray i thanked him he handed one to me and one to leonie who started to shake her head those are both mine i said my voice sounded thick leonie set the martini back on the tray anything else for you maam clark asked leonie give him credit he was trying to act like this was an everyday duty she shook her head hardly looking at him fighting for control he blinked at her embarrassed and turned back to me i called bertrand mr capra and hell be here in fifteen minutes i told him that you were hurt and he said a doctor will be here shortly if he thought it unusual that a physician would make an emergency call to a bar he said nothing times are tough and i figured young clark valued his job i realized that i might be in shock i sat down thank you clark i took a sip of the martini it was perfect like chilled steel if you make all martinis like this one you will always have a job here if you want it thank you sir you better get back downstairs yes sir he glanced at me and leonie and shut the door behind him nice kid i said leonies mouth worked as if she fished for her words you failed to kill him she said and youre going to sit there and drink a martini two martinis i dont have any painkillers james bond drank martinis when he was in a tux and moving in for the kill i drank them because my arm was broken and i had badly messed up and i had to stop and think about what to do next i fought the urge to gulp the cocktail down yesterday i speared a man through the gut and held a womans hand while she died today i fought and killed two crazy mercenaries who came within inches of killing me and i beat up my best friend and i jumped on top of a moving bus and i crashed a motorcycle through a window and i threw myself and another human being who never hurt me off a building i raised my eyebrows at her so yes leonie im gonna drink this martini right now leonie sat down in front of me tell me what happened i drank the first martini and then i told her leonie folded her hands together as if in awkward prayer we have to tell anna that jack ming is dead lying to her is a death sentence for the kids but he didnt meet with the cia and now hell be afraid to deal with them we ruined his trust in them thats the best news thats not as good as killing him thats what you said you would do you promised im so sorry ive let you down after all you were supposed to find him and i found him not you and i kept my mouth shut about your failures my words came out like a cruel stab you could have shot him in the alley and you missed so dont judge me she opened her mouth closed it opened it again i reached for her hand she let me take it im sorry im frustrated because youre right i failed i took a long sip of the second martini im sorry sam i know you tried i know im sorry dont cry were going to get them back we will she pushed her barely touched pint toward me like a peace offering you are goddamned crazy crazy does not equal efficient we would have had him if hed come and august and his men wouldnt have been there i gulped the icecold martini it wasnt really killing the pain in my arm are you okay i will be howd you get away she licked her lips i stole jacks knapsack and i ran his laptop was inside i thought maybe his notebook was in there too i dont think i was followed i saw the notebook he had it taped to his back its red i ate the olives and i took a long sip of her guinness i know it should have tasted great but i dont recommend drinking one right after two martinis lets review novem soles blackmails us into finding and killing ming but suddenly were getting hirelings interfering the sisters tried to tell me were on the same side but that makes no sense for novem soles to interfere with us maybe they thought we couldnt do the job i dont think thats it theres a third party here and that party is inside the cia serving novem soles or with his own agenda i think its this ray brewster tell me about him leonie massaged her temple he he found people who could be useful lets say people who had a natural talent for killing or for theft and instead of them being bound for jail he got them to work for him was he in government i dont think so why would he need me to give them new identities the government would be better at that than me did he find you yes id gotten involved with a forgery ring they were about to get busted he made a deal with me to shield me if i worked for him i stood i paced ray brewster might not be cia but he had a resource in special projects or he could be part of special projects the question was why would august believe anything i told him now do you think ray brewster is part of novem soles if he is then hes operating without annas approval maybe hes named in the notebook maybe jack ming has really damaging goods on him maybe the goods that he doesnt want anyone cia or novem soles to know so do you know his secrets leonie no what was he to you she didnt look at me now we were together for a while then we werent and he didnt like that since you created a new life for yourself in vegas i thought it better to start fresh is he taylors father no hes not dont ever suggest that he is i watched her i needed to know her secrets while keeping my own no way i could let her know the sisters had an interest in mila if she knew there was a bounty on mila and that ray brewster wanted it then leonie had a bargaining chip one i could not allow her to use you knew that cia contact august hes your friend she said we used to work together we we used to be friends were we any more i didnt know it might be a friendship too expensive for either of us what exactly did you do in the cia i took another sip of the martini i worked for a small secret branch called special projects august and i worked on transnational criminal rings they often have ties to intelligence groups or to terrorism very much a black ops group i think were actually hidden in the budget under vending machine contracts i was in a confessional mode thank you martini and blinding pain radiating up my arm that was a joke leonie august saw me you yes i stole mings knapsack at gunpoint before your friend could get it so he knows both our faces now leonie put her face in her hands and maybe she freaked out or she mourned or worried but she only did it for twenty seconds then she stood up okay regroup we have to figure out where jack will go next is there a place where i can work on his computer without interruption yes in there theres a bedroom then why didnt we just stay here because i didnt want you to know my business that i own this bar dont you trust me she said well i guess i answered my own question it was needtoknow the situation has worsened i have resources here resources yes okay another secret fine she stood hey do we tell anna we have jacks computer you know shes going to want all the data in it yes leonie said without hesitation maybe its enough maybe theyll trade us the kids for the laptop they could know what he knows then or the laptop could give us weapons to use against them information on who and where they are no we give it to them fear creased her voice no we dont i said we use it against them we have no guarantees theyll give us our kids back leonie we need every ounce of leverage we can get if they know we have it and we withheld it theyll kill the kids we have to do what they say exactly i wont risk any other action then they dont ever know we have it this is our guarantee leonie that we can get the kids back they want his notebook yes maybe the laptop has the same info on it i dont get why a hacker would keep a paper record of the most important information it doesnt exactly fit his psychology i dont care thats what they want we can use jack mings laptop to find where he might go next to see who he could turn to go work delve figure out where hell go if my child dies because you failed what leonie youll kill me no ill just never forgive but she knew what i would lose as well and she choked on her words okay whats done is done we have to find him she paused at the door this special projects group at the cia will be hunting us now oh definitely i thought it best not to mention that august and i had had a drink here at the last minute a few days ago and he knew i owned the bar well at least youre not dead there is that i said the phone id been given by the lovely snake anna rang leonie sucked in breath is he dead anna said by way of hello no i am very disappointed hes hurt he was meeting the cia i screwed up the meeting for him hopefully he will not trust them enough to make another approach and where is he hes running you failed me technically but i also kept him from surrendering to the cia and pretty much ruined their relationship thats not enough i probably would have killed him by now if you didnt have people interfering what do you mean ray brewster has sent three people on us who the hell is ray brewster one of your people inside the cia sam i know you are not inclined to believe me on any point but i do not know a ray brewster you have an ally inside the cia reel him in or you dont get jack ming dead or his notebook of goodies who who are these people i told her what i knew and you dispatched them they wont be troubling us any more anna was silent this isnt our doing at all its your problem put leonie on the line i gave the phone to leonie anna is taylor all right can i listen listen to her voice broke i dont know if she listened to her child or to anna but she said all right and she handed me back the phone yes the next time we talk and you tell me that jack ming isnt dead your child will suffer the phone clicked off leonie helped me shower in the apartments small bathroom the blood and sand rinsed from me i sported cuts and bruises and a nice slice across my chest blood caked on my belly she washed my hair for me in silence soaping out the grains of sand she helped me dry off and i found boxers to put on for the doctors arrival i didnt tell her annas threat against daniel the idea would unnerve her and we had to keep our focus i was horrified enough for the both of us she closed the door behind her my arm was a dull ache my whole body was a dull ache but if i was hurt then so was ming and he couldnt run as far or as fast we might have clipped each others wings i drank the rest of leonies guinness it felt good to be alive i wanted to keep the kids alive the past two days made me very tired of death i could hear the hustle of manhattan traffic outside the windows i closed my eyes and i only opened them again when the door opened bertrand stood there he wore a tailored subtly pinstriped suit on his tall frame gray with a skyblue tie he muttered something in french when he saw me which i couldnt quite hear he shook his head as he closed the door i raised my arm which screamed in protest the doctor will arrive soon sam we could be in trouble where is mila he shrugged there was a man here asking for you blond i thought it might be august no darkhaired he asked how often you came by the bar i said about once a week and you had been here yesterday he wanted to know where you lived i told him i didnt know that all i had for you was a phone number i gave him a fake one i dont think it occurred to him that you have an apartment here august would send someone the bar might be under surveillance or it might not be they cared about finding jack ming more than they cared about me special projects did not have an inexhaustible supply of resources eight people in the new york office if they needed more feet on the ground theyd have to call langley i told bertrand what happened he took away the martini glasses and the pint glass and brought me ibuprofen i swallowed four i suspect he said you arent going to find this jack ming again we have his computer leonie is going through the files alone you trust her i have to a knock on the door the doctor there are all sorts of medical professionals who are willing to practice on the side to not require you make a trip to an emergency room usually theyre doctors or nurses who have been bankrupted by a lawsuit or they have a prescription med monkey on their backs this doctor was a woman fiftyish and seemed delightfully sober she had a backpack on and blue jeans and inside the backpack was an army field medical kit doctor smith bertrand said smith i said i hope i can remember doctor im not going to say your real name doesnt quite trip off the tongue bertrand said the doctor said nothing to me except tell me what happened and does this hurt does this she did not blink when i described getting hit in the arm with a flowerpot or throwing myself off a building or landing in a sand truck she ran fingertips along my arm tested it watched me wince at worst a simple break cant you tell the kryptonite is interfering with my xray vision she said dryly i can equip you with a fiberglass cast you need to rest the arm though no more jumping off buildings okay i said she set about her work of setting and casting my arm bertrand went and turned on a television to a local twentyfourhour news station after a weather update and a political scandal out of albany involving a state senator and a prostitute the gun chase through the streets of brooklyn and us falling off the building were the top stories but they hadnt caught me and they hadnt caught jack ming i need you to move into fast gear doctor because i got places to be bertrand said inspect his head for concussion please i dont have a concussion bertrand brought me black slacks and a black shirt the doctor assembled a bandage around my arm and put on the cast i got dressed she said hardly a word she left me instructions and a large bottle of illicit painkillers bertrand stuck a wad of cash into her hand and she was gone what is it you want me to do bertrand crossed his arms he looked like he should be in charge not me special projects will be working to find him but they wont go to the police because they dont want to explain why theyre causing gunfire in the streets now i just have to figure out where jack will go sam leonie screamed sam come here i hurried into the room where leonie sat a messaging window was open on the screen leonie pointed and i leaned down and read the words you will never find me losers so fuck you jack yes hes got a remote access program hes got control of the system damn he could format the hard drive remotely he could wipe out all the information on the system i leaned down and typed i want to make a deal with you we have a common enemy in nine suns the words stood alone until another sentence appeared below them is this sam capra yes dont tell him anything dont leonie said you say you want me dead to save your kid i know but you know even if you kill me your kid is dead hes lying leonie said hes lying just to protect himself to scare us give us the notebook and well tell them youre dead i wrote you can hide or surrender to the cia or whatever i have no reason to trust you he wrote you threw me off a building im sorry we have a common enemy you know im being forced to work for them we can both be free this is a trap and im not stupid why are you even talking to me then i wrote i want you to know youve lost you will never ever find me im sorry about your kid we could fool them together give them a fake notebook tell them youre dead theyre not looking for you we get our kids back we all win no i wont risk it i took a deep breath and typed im sorry jack they killed your mother im sorry to tell you this long silence then youre lying no im not we tried to save her they took her and they killed her at a house in morris county on river run road only house on the street i expected then that he would cut off the communication he would reformat the drive he would steal our hope from us he would snap the link i offered the sparest of olive branches i killed the man who killed her if thats consolation the words just felt so empty how did they the letters appeared one at time typed slowly as though his hands were shaking they shot her we tried to help her sure you did sure you did will you listen to me i wrote please silence again i wrote they will kill you jack our only hope is to help each other we fake your death youre free of them and we get our kids back that requires me to trust you and thats not going to happen sam theyre going to want proof a body i will give them proof that satisfies i have an idea on how we can do it they care more about the notebook what the hell are you promising him leonie said anna wont believe us were not delivering a body to them just proof she wants that notebook more than she wants anything else ive read the notebook so im a dead man so are you if you read it theyll draw you in to give you back your kid and then theyll kill you there is no way out of this that works for you if you let me go i can use the information in the notebook to bring them down thats the best i can do for you no i wrote the cia is going to find you before you find me sam leonie said i feel sick is there mention of a man named ray brewster in the notebook a pause no thats the name of the man whos after you we think i dont know that name i know you dont trust me i know all im trying to do is save my son we waited for jacks words to appear if they find him first and they tell him that you offered him a deal leonie started then stopped i waited fingers poised above the keyboard for him to answer he didnt i typed into the void please dont let my son die hes never had a chance at life hes only a few months old please they wont let daniel live i feel certain you dont know how bad these people are daniel he knew my childs name a cold fear struck me is there something in the notebook about my son yes behind me leonie sucked in breath what no i wont tell you that was his insurance then to stay alive at my hands all right but then you know ive told you the truth this is our only chance for both of us lets meet silence for the thirty longest seconds of my life what do you propose we meet you give me the notebook we pose you in some photos to appear dead which i take i deliver the notebook and proof of your death i get my son back nine suns thinks youre dead and they never touch you again i have to have money that was why he went to the cia i realized he wanted to sell the notebook i can get you money i wrote how much a halfmillion and a new name and a place to hide thirty long seconds all right meet tomorrow at the statue of liberty pm then the machine whirred the hard drive reformatting he seized remote control of the system and he blanked out all the files leonie hit keystroke combinations but nothing worked the screen went gray and blue and a reformat pro gress window appeared i cant stop it leonie said damn it to hell its all right i cant believe he agreed to meet us she sounded stunned oh he didnt i said its completely a trap hes going to tell august thats where we will be he knows were after him and so is august this ties up both sides as pursuers maybe if someone inside nine suns tries to warn us its a trap jack will tell august that information will id who the mole is everyone whos chasing him tangles and then jacks running and gone but he needs money the one thing we know about nine suns is that its global so he didnt sell the information to the americans he can sell it to the british the french the chinese someone will pay and then jack hides and our kids are gone i leaned back the only trump i had was his mother what do you mean he might really want justice for his mom that might make him take a risk but you said he wasnt close to his mom shes still his mom dont you think one day taylor would do anything to save you leonie swallowed i would hope mrs ming died and hes going to feel responsible he wants to set a trap for us we have to set one for him one where we can grab him and get the notebook and then draw in anna kill him and take the notebook why is this so hard they will not just hand us back our kids leonie that notebook is our leverage we have to have it to guarantee a safe exchange for the children i do not like this we were at an impasse ive told you what im doing either you want to help me or you dont if you think you can track jack and kill him then please by all means the silence grew uncomfortable fine she finally said well do it your way not that youre leaving me much choice i told you we will get our kids back she nodded id like to eat ill have food sent up theres a menu over there order whatever you like leonie got up she stretched hands above her head she studied the menu high end bar fare a calamari panini mini caviar sliders yuck bertrand likes to experiment i can recommend the kobe beef burger and the fish and chips she put the menu down i hope theyre feeding our babies okay leonie hold it together i am i have been she steadied her voice ill go downstairs and order us some food what would you like you order for us both i like everything on the menu perks of being the owner i tried to give her a reassuring smile i supposed she might take her revenge on me by bringing back that questionable calamari panini she went downstairs and i wondered what was her limit would she break under the pressure would she decide that my way was the wrong way what would she do to save her child special projects headquarters manhattan ricardo braun held three different cell phones what he was not holding was his temper go find out who were dealing with beyond capra he said to august while i do my damnedest to help you keep your job his normally cordial calm voice trembled with barely contained anger im sorry sir you should be he snapped do as i told you and when youve got some information come see me i have to be on the phone with the gods in langley explaining how our inability to secure our informant caused a gunfight in the streets of brooklyn and ended up on the national news august tried to swallow and couldnt he turned august theres a shootonsight order on capra you should know no one is expecting you to shoot your friend but he attacked you and two other officers and nearly killed ming were not chitchatting with him again hes going down dead or alive do you understand me yes sir august went back to the conference room next to his office where the team restless and angry waited august still commanded the novem soles task force so he put all remaining six agents in the manhattan special projects office on the search for ming and capra agents headed for the ming apartment the ming properties building and one for the last minute where he had an unproductive talk with bertrand another agent monitored all incoming traffic on the emergency rooms in manhattan brooklyn and queens just as jack ming tapped the cameras of a toy store and a traffic light special projects had a birdseye into the emergency room entrances feeding off security cameras monitoring software scanned flight reservations and train ticket purchases the shoot order meant august knew he had to find sam before any of the other agents in special projects did okay first figure out who these women were the dead and the living the redhead with the gun who was intent on grabbing mings gear who was she who were the dead pair in the building special projects was not exactly equipped to work a crime scene they had possession of the building thanks to beth marley who cancelled the security service after being assured her family would be protected and the bodies a forensic team and backup agents who were willing to overlook the fact that the cia is not supposed to operate on american soil were flying from langley to work the scene but he couldnt wait on them if sam was the pawn of novem soles so perhaps was the redhead as for the two dead women if theyd been there to kill sam then the women must be an enemy of novem soles drones for a third player the thought deeply unsettled him august got pizza and a big soda and he sat down in front of a secured workstation at the back of the new york office his jaw ached from where sam had hit him but pizza was all that sounded good to his empty stomach he kept his phones earbud in place so he could get updates from the field teams scouring the city for ming and sam the company owned along with the national security agency the most advanced photo recognition software available he used a software program to assemble a face matching that of the woman hed seen reddish hair hazel eyes a small nose high cheekbones a constellation of freckles her ears stuck out slightly it made her look younger he closed his eyes repeatedly pictured her tried to cement the memory in his head her chin was a bit pointed throat narrow he guessed her height at close to feet weight maybe pounds when he finished the composite he considered where to look he loaded the reconstructed face into a search database for cia personnel he got back eightynine matches he scanned through the faces none were the woman he loaded the face into a search database for known british intelligence agents sam had spent most of his career working out of london a dozen matches none were exact he accessed a database of retired cia personnel again a scattering of matches but not his woman special projects whose purview was where criminality intersected with national security had its own set of databases he accessed them he pulled up a list of known computer hackers ming was a hacker and the redhead coming back to grab his knapsack seemed odd while the number of female hackers was growing it was still a maledominated field if shed been arrested in the united states or by a western ally for hacking her smiling face should be in this database it wasnt he got up began to pace the floor he ate the pizza chewing on the discs of pepperoni until his jaw hurt settling the hunger in his stomach he studied her face he changed the hair made it longer he put glasses on her he opened another database of cia informants people who had traded information to the company people who ranged from foreign dignitaries to common criminals the list numbered in the thousands he entered the womans face into the search parameters three matches there she was her name on the file was lindsay partridge lindsay partridge had vanished from new york two years ago on april august rubbed his eyes hello there he said she had provided the company with information on a forgery ring creating both counterfeit cash and passports no charges filed against her her name never given to the police she dropped out of the ring and vanished and the authorities arrested the remaining forgers he opened her file no other information she had not done any other work for the company he entered in a special password that would open any encrypted parts of her file which were for special projects eyes only the file was locked that couldnt be he couldnt be locked out he phoned fagin what fagin sounded tired and stressed why would i be locked out of an sp file i have a master access code i dont know the stars didnt align someone doesnt want you to see it the operation was mothballed or its embarrassing or maybe its gruesome and your delicate little eyes cant handle it august i need that file cracked well get in line were really busy fagin could sound as irritable as any corporate it help desk fill out a ticket now fagin this is highest priority he gave fagin the file details i want to know whats inside there get your smartest twist on it now or or what damn every one is quick with a threat this week really fagin hung up what did that mean hed ask fagin when he heard back from him via tunnels carved out by fagin and the twists special projects could dive into all sorts of databases even illegally to provide a path of footprints to follow august scanned her trail there were no recorded activities on lindsay partridges charge accounts past that final april date her email and social networking accounts had been abandoned shed dropped out of the graduate program in design at nyu a cia informant and art student maybe that was a first or she had design talents to be put to legitimate use she had not paid her taxes for the past two years and she had not reported any income here one day gone the next no one seemed to miss her this didnt feel like foul play this looked like someone rolling up the loose threads of her life tying them into a tidy knot walking away lindsay partridge wanted to vanish had the cia looked for her just to keep a tab on her august opened his phone and started to make calls he gathered the threads of her vanishing lindsay partridge handed her landlady a check for the rest of the years rent said she had to go home to miami for a while but never came back the landlady received a letter that followed two months later giving notice on the lease he got a copy of her transcript faxed over from nyu and called her academic adviser shed told her instructors at nyu she was withdrawing due to a family emergency returning to miami and now she was just a locked file it was like she and sam were both dirty secrets ignored and forgotten by the company he entered in the scant information they had on the sisters he fed the photos of their faces taken at the ming building into the facial recognition system to let it work its magic one had a new york drivers license in the name of amy bolton and a brooklyn address the other lacked an id on her he checked the databases amy bolton had a credit history a mortgage she worked for a company called associated languages school he checked the companys website very bare bones and pages where there should have been more detail were under construction but they offered instruction in a wide range of languages and translation services but no photos of the staff no outlining of classes or programs no listing of upcoming schedules business must not be good august tapped at his lip then went to google and entered the following foreign language schools brooklyn he got back a few results with locations highlighted on the google map of the borough no associated languages school now he wondered a modern business especially a service business needs to come up on search engines these days to thrive and here was one that didnt appear in the search results at all almost as if it were hiding he pulled up the address for associated languages school on google streetview the building was under renovation being converted into condos so much for associated languages school it was a sham the computer kept checking its digital rogues gallery for a facial match on the two women he grabbed a soda from the refrigerator and returned to his office and he activated the camera lucy capra lay in her bed the wires and the feeds branching about her she rested on her side the nurses must have come in and moved her regular as clockwork he could see the savage scar along her skull the mark where the bullet had left its fragments her ticket to this long limbo of sleep it had torn her soul and mind away if not her body the monitoring camera was fixed in place he looked in on her once a day sometimes more he wondered why he did it was a thing he would not have told sam he didnt love lucy he had toyed with loving her once but then she and sam got involved and hed taken what hed felt for her and put it away like a gift you cant use gets put on a shelf and in his moments of shame he thought thank god she didnt pick me how different his life would have been he might have been the one caught in this awful limbo instead of sam but he could not understand why she had done what she did why she had betrayed everything sam told him she claimed it was money money it boggled august she was lost in a shadow world a nothingness where he suspected not even dreams intruded but he knew that if she could have risen from the bed in pursuit of her child she would have he turned off the camera to see what the facial software kicked back to him to see what news the field reports held and then his phone rang august stared at the number on the cell blocked hello he answered you screwed me the informant yelled you screwed up im sorry jack a shocked pause and oh great screwup now you know my name yes we do all we want to do is help you all you did was nearly get me killed do you know what ive been through jacks voice quavered come in to us we can protect you im sorry i didnt know the surrender had been compromised well clearly not youre an idiot do you know how he knew no but the man that is after you is excia yes and youre going to stop him from coming after me what hes agreed to meet me tomorrow at three at the statue of liberty be there grab him arrest him and this woman whos with him who incidentally also tried to kill me and then maybe we can talk you talked to sam they took my computer and i erased it longdistance but first i set up a meeting with him youre welcome now take him out ive done your hard work for you hes after you because novem soles has his infant child as a hostage silence in the background august could hear a pulse of music a hiss of traffic im sorry for that i am but its not my problem sam capra is your problem now you want novem soles you take this guy down and then maybe ill think about coming out of hiding okay part of the info you can turn over to me does any of it include anything on his kid a long hesitation why should i tell you anything his voice went to a low whisper how do i know youre not the one compromising me selling me out well you dont you called me silence again sam capra said my moms dead august digested this then its true he wouldnt lie about it im sorry jack he said her body could be found at the only house on river run road in morris county will you go get my moms body please jagged breathing now yes of course august said you come in now though let us protect you if hes telling me the truth about my mom maybe ill tell him what this notebook says about his kid once you have him in custody ill call you back later jack ming hung up august checked the address in rural new jersey on a satellite map program a large house on acreage with a goodsized pond he scoured the database for an owner associated languages school he stood he should tell braun pull griffith down get a team together youve been compromised but someone in this office was a leak maybe he wouldnt tell anyone he sat down though and entered in a report on what he had found so far he passworded it and secured it on the private special projects network then he looked up braun stood in his doorway not holding his collection of cell phones not pleading special projects case we need to talk my office now special projects headquarters manhattan do you know what they called me in the old days august ricardo braun asked no sir august could hardly get the words out mr ideas i was the one with the fresh ideas i was willing to try what was never tried before inside the company do you know how hard it is to innovate inside a large bureaucracy its difficult he wondered where this was leading special projects was my idea i tested many ideas for ways for the company to fulfill its duty do its work the most important work in this nation braun paused not every idea is a success of course but you must have a willingness to try to fail and to learn from that failure maybe august thought this was a talk about redemption i failed today sir august said you did and ive been trying to come up with an idea or an innovation that will save you mr holdwine and i am failing braun cleared his throat i want to be sure i understand the unfolding of events you came into a rendezvous site to meet possibly the most important informant we could get on novem soles and you failed to secure it you saw a former officer on the site one who you knew could be under the control of a hostile group and you did not secure him he appeared to be unarmed sir he had clearly been in a fight appeared he beat you up and then he nearly killed your informant ive just spent the past hour on the phone to langley trying to explain how we failed to capture a computer geek and how that resulted in open warfare on the streets of brooklyn braun crossed his arms you understand were not supposed to be operating on american soil we are breaking laws here august for the common good we all take that risk that it could come back and bite us and here your team is screwing up and putting our entire branch at risk sam capra killed those two women who apparently wanted to kill ming it could be argued he saved mings life because he wanted to kill him himself braun shook his head these people have his child theyre using daniel capra for their own ends forcing him to act he told me himself i am not unsympathetic to his motivations august on the contrary it breaks my heart but we cant have him interfering in our work i cannot have it sympathy doesnt play beyond a certain point sam could tell them anything about our operations against criminal networks our operations have completely retooled since sam capra left special projects august said theyre not mining him for information theyre converting him into a weapon capra could have come to you august he could have said they have my kid and they want me to grab their traitor for them he could have worked with us if they were holding a gun to my babys head august said quietly i believe id do whatever they say i think i would first remember my duty braun said you certainly enjoy using that word august said anger rose in him you dont think sam has a duty to his family the company is family too august and you should remember that august was silent he wished braun had stayed in his glorious retirement now these two women in the building braun said were working on getting an id on them they drove a car registered to a beth marley who works for ming properties we sent someone to the office they found her handcuffed in her kitchen shes being questioned by our people but she doesnt know anything interesting braun said novem soles has capra hunting ming but who is hunting capra someone else who wants ming who wants what he has braun turned to him from the window so how do you intend to get both ming and capra im not worrying about sam i sent a man to his bar they havent seen him he may be more of an absentee owner since hes searching for his son from what the witnesses said hes hurt well monitor the emergency rooms but id rather put the people we have on finding ming not sam ming cant expose us sam can we are not going to be exposed ever we are not going to be embarrassed so im chasing him or im chasing jack ming which is it im simply being practical im thinking like the bad guys he smiled tapped his temple and august thought its not about innovation its about your ego theyre playing on sams emotional vulnerability as far as his child is concerned we cant fall into the same trap i swear to you well take capra alive if possible and if we find where his son is we will move heaven and earth to bring that baby home the line was drawn in the imaginary sand on brauns desk drawn with those many ifs he was putting catching sam for having defied them ahead of catching jack ming if you dont august said ill make sure the whole company knows that we didnt go after an employees captive child sam capra is not an employee he was didnt you just say we were all family ricardo or is that only when you make a point you wouldnt expose special projects work brauns voice went icy i would how much loyalty would employees give the company if they knew we hadnt already moved heaven and earth as you like to say to get back the capra baby if that baby isnt safe none of our loved ones are braun im tired of this bullshit attitude of ours we should have fixed this months ago we should have found and rescued that child you talk about duty what about our duty to sam i advise you to be careful about what you say next you messed up today august you dont have a great deal of wriggle room with me worry about your own duty duty innovation they have to be more than buzzwords ricardo august couldnt keep the disgust out of his voice weve kept everything about the capras quiet what lucy did what we did to sam we control hundreds of intel assets in the world and none of them knew to look out for leads that could have given us daniel capra we turned our backs on sam and we helped create this situation that gets out therell be investigations therell be cuts in funding therell be resignations the capras were an anomaly not standard operating procedure and lucy capra was a confirmed traitor braun nearly spit as he said traitor people will not see themselves as the capras it wont happen he steeled his voice i gave up my retirement to come back here after more years of service than youll ever see dont you dare to suggest that duty is simply a buzzword to me im sorry august said but there is a disconnect between what you say and what youre proposing i think you have too much emotional involvement august you were his friend youre relieved im not going to keep taking bullets for an ingrate who cant do his job what does that mean im fired of course not but turn in your gear your keys your access codes take a week off to think about what you want to do because youll never be doing field work again then crawl back to langley and you can beg them to keep you i think youll be very good at pushing paper and braun put disgust into his voice writing long emails full of bullet points i am going to write a long email mostly about you august placed his phone his gun his passkeys on the desk got up and left braun watched him go then he let out a long ragged breath worse and worse desperate times extraordinary measures august walked like a man who had no idea how close hed come to dying and hed no doubt august would identify the sisters if not the truth about them and hed already identified the redhead every data search august made displayed on brauns own computer god only knew what was in that damned notebook and exposure just couldnt happen it just couldnt happen he had to shut this down now if ming and capra were dead that was the end of it like most jobs braun thought if you wanted it done right you had to do it yourself he might need to return to a more private retirement and that million dollars for mila would be a good cushion for a new life he got up and left sam capra owned a bar so august had said and ricardo braun felt like a drink twenty minutes later when a pack of information arrived at special projects network via langley a confirmation message echoed back to langleys computers hiding inside that message was another one and that hitchhiking bit of data dropped off along the way and snaked to its natural home the tiny bit of computer code that allowed this action was very much like what jack ming had written for nic to spy on people a special projects computer had been infected weeks ago via a spreadsheet sent to it by one of the people in the company later exposed as a nine suns operative the watchers phone beeped with a new text message the last minute bar manhattan hello mila closed the door behind her i havent heard from you sam she glanced at the fiberglass cast on my arm i would have sent flowers hey mila i said i wish bertrand had given me warning she had arrived but he hadnt leonie looked up from her dinner and stared at mila who is this leonie said mila a friend and i am also his boss mila said sam we need to talk alone were busy right now leonie said i could read her expression mila was not connected to the search for our kids therefore mila was a distraction leonie didnt know about the round table the private vigilante group i honestly dont know what else to call them that hired me to run the bars and gave them to me as cover first to help me find my son and with the hope that i would do work for them in the future to be their man in havana and a few dozen other cities to leonie milaasboss must mean she was concerned with the running of the bar which paled in importance to our kids the realization went through my mind in a second leonie its okay itll just take a minute you could go downstairs and get a drink mila said helpfully perhaps one with an umbrella in it i dont want a drink leonie said the ice for the drink she didnt want found its way into her voice a coffee then although you seem anxious the decaf here is excellent mila smiled leonie didnt get up is english a second language for her mila asked me she looked back to leonie i want to talk to him alone please go downstairs now leonie got up but not with grace more with fury i stepped between them leonie please how is she your boss if you own the bar just give us a minute okay actually i need a shower ill take it now and you and your charming friend can talk leonie retrieved her bag and vanished into the bedroom she slammed the door closed she thinks she is so smart mila said she runs a shower but she tries to listen the doors are soundproofed we added those last year after bertrand and i beat up a man in the bathroom to get him to tell us i didnt need to hear about her past crimes dont be adversarial i just enjoy it where have you been here and hanging out at this bar is so dangerous you manage to break your arm i watch the news sam she went to the small bar in the corner poured herself a neat glenfiddich maybe this man you hunt is a huge threat to nine suns maybe i could find this man useful to me maybe i dont want you to kill him because i might want to have a nice long whiskysoaked talk with this man myself and let him tell me all his secrets you cant have him i said no leonie would be ready to kill mila if she interfered your child concerns me mila said her voice went low did you think i would ever let you fight this battle alone mila please dont do this you do not want my help i have my orders i am so hurt i thought only i gave you orders she took a sip of the glenfiddich mila let me handle this and this woman this leonie she said the name as though mispronouncing leprosy she is what your new assistant i did not approve a hiring she has her reasons for assisting me who is she someone with very good reason to help me do you think you can keep a secret from me that is so cute she smiled over the whisky glass mila go leave there i can slam a door with the best of them i will leave when you tell me who is this man you kill for your child no the bars which are providing you with meeting places and staying places and gettingyourbrokenarmset places were given to you easily and they can be taken from you just as easily take them then i stood i am not your enemy she set down the whisky glass do you think youre the first person ive recruited to work for the round table i said nothing she ran a finger along the rim of the glassoften the second job shows more about the new person than the first job you helped us break up the assassination plot you worked hard you made a great impression selfstarter very tough resourceful slightly crazy in a good way now you are settled into the job into working with me now suddenly i see your secrets your bad habits this is not a job for you this is my sons life at stake we are not negotiating all i want to do is to help you sure and if you get info on nine suns then all the better what is this ransom sam you owe me you know you owe me i put an elbow down on the table i rested my head against the heel of my hand they want me to kill an informant who is attempting to surrender to special projects he has information that could gut novem soles i broke up his surrender to the cia but someone else is hunting him ive killed three assassins already who tried to get to him before i could now i raised my gaze to meet hers and all three of them asked me about you me her expression was unchanged poker players should have bowed to it in respect yes someone wants to collect the price on your head this silenced her you and i have a common enemy mila tell me what youre thinking sam she said it low soft the way you might to a lover lying next to you in the warm bed the thought of mila that way jolted me sam mila said what is it americans say let us kill the two birds with the one stone the last minutes lights were low when braun stepped through the antique doors he scanned the room a dozen people at the bar mostly corporate types in suits having a drink at the end of the day one knot looked like financial types another like publishing types the financial suits were stiffer and all the way across the room he heard a woman bray a laughing comment about how to get kids to read fifteen tables half of them occupied an old lady sat at a piano playing languid soft versions of louis armstrong standards no sign of sam capra or the woman mila he noticed a tall black man in an impeccable suit behind the bar manager on duty he decided or considering the mans stately authority a partner in the business he could play this two ways either march up and announce he was looking for sam capra or sit and wait but he had no other lead and he had no one else in new york to send against his enemies sam capra had killed them all braun sat down at the bar in the dead zone between the two loud groups he ordered a harp lager he took one sip of it didnt touch it again he didnt much like alcohol and he didnt often drink it was a waste a lowering of necessary defenses he could see the range of tables the front door if he kept his eyes to the mirror at the bar he sat and he looked ahead in his particular quiet the groups on both sides laughed and talked and for an odd moment his own loneliness made him sad it was strange to watch people with friends their laughter their openness filled him with unease he had long resigned himself to his own company he got up from the bar and retreated to a corner table he watched the laughing women and silently hated them anyone you let close might have had a knife ready to slide along your throat lindsay for instance shed tired of him shed left him shed run away and after all hed done for her bad bad girl friends were too much trouble is everything all right sir the tall black man in the suit stood at his table he had a very slight haitian lilt to his voice braun brought a polite smile to his face yes fine i just noticed you took one sip of your beer and then left it does it taste all right awfully observant for a bar manager he thought yes its fine thank you i just got lost in thought is there anything else i may get you sir uh perhaps some food is there a menu of course one moment the tall man smiled and left him to his beer while he got a menu braun waited he wasnt hungry but food was good camouflage he watched the door two birds i said yes end both threats without jeopardizing your child i waited you and me we capture the informant we dont kill him we take what information he knows fake his death if need be use that information to mount a rescue operation of your child this seems clear to me as a superior solution leonie is very reluctant to defy them that is good to know then she slapped me hard i took it you bloodied their noses before they have no reason to give you back your child if they kill daniel i will never ever stop hunting them i said i will burn them down they know this theyre not afraid of you they respect you but they dont fear you my problem i said we will stay out of each others way this is not the sam capra i know she laughed and it broke something inside me i could almost hear the snapping of my heart im not risking daniels life for your agenda mila mila said if you betray us ill kill you her threat made me blink what how the hell did you get back on that track you need a guarantee that your child will be delivered to you after you kill the informant i dont intend to be the sweetener in the deal i would never betray you now she stared at the floor then her gaze met mine really not even to save your son mila dont even go there even if i offered them you that is still no guarantee i get daniel back all i can do is what theyve asked me to do why use you to eliminate this threat i dont know because i can get close to him why because youre excia because august will let you get close not any more because they have my son and they want to put him to good use i dont know and what happens next after you dance to their tune and they still want you to dance i told you they will never let you go i do this thats it no you and i must come up with a way that saves daniel and breaks their hold on you i said nothing for fifteen seconds i counted them out it takes about fifteen seconds to weigh up alternatives and make a decision in a heated conversation when you decide to capitulate undercover work is per cent acting only per cent observing she needed me to be someone and i was going to be who she needed me to be the man she wanted to see standing in front of her instead of the screwedup brawler who just wanted his son back whats your way she jerked her head toward the closed door first tell me who is the charm school dropout leonie shes an information broker she hides people who need to vanish she lives under a false name because shes hiding from a guy named ray brewster hes tied to the killers who are hunting you shes done false documentation for annas kids so anna grabbed her kid to force her to help me find jack ming so since she hides people they thought she could find ming yes they have both your children yes are you sleeping with her this was asked with a very slight tilt of the head she gave me a look best described as halfway between horrified and amused milas bluntness thank god you cant bottle it none of your business which means yes and we have another complicating factor i so did not want to have this conversation with her we were exhausted and upset a woman would have to be i shook my head gave a weak laugh is this what my life is going to be like once i find my kid and im working for you still reporting on every detail of my life forget that i wanted to know why then i thought wait she cant care what i do who i sleep with shed never shown the remotest interest in me or in anyone else she was all ice except when she had a target then she was fire you forget that we my employers and i have made a big investment in you mila go to wherever you go when youre not riding my ass go on a vacation ill either call you when this is all done or if you dont hear from me youll know im dead you dont understand our situation what its like to have a loved one taken and be at risk she gave me a sad look no one could understand your unique pain and something in the air shifted between us you asked me why there is a price on my head i think its your endless charm and witty banter i said she nodded toward the computer i wrote it down for you you read it then you decide whether or not to trust me with your childs life part three tu mori sam this is what happened this is how i came to be mila harp moldova my little town was named for a harp do you like that but i do not play three years ago the children are done with their work and have escaped into the bright sunny afternoon i mop up paint smears and bits of torn paper the art supplies are a gift from one of the families that runs transdniester the sliver of moldova that has declared itself free of the country aunt and uncle say quietly at the sunday lunch table that the whole region is ruled by crooks and outlaws not just crooked politicians but actual criminals smugglers and mafiya and drug lords who pour poisons west into austria and hungary and north to moscow kiev and st petersburg but let me be blunt what do i care where the paints and papers come from they are an extra to help my classroom the children benefit and i dont care if a mafiya bought crayons to ease his conscience the towns of northern moldova can barely afford to heat the school in dismal winter i wont turn up my nose at free school supplies you are making a better moldova darling girl aunt tells me and i want to shrug no im earning a paycheck and not having to be like my sister nelly casting her lot out into the distant world i am a homebody who likes quiet after i gather up the scraps of supplies that can be used again i take a rag and i dust the small tv the old dvd player the worn and loved books on the shelf all again from the largesse of the criminal kings of transdniester uncle would say but the machinery does not do evil and the books take no sides i dust and think nelly would do a better job nelly the sunny one nelly the smiler nelly the adventurer nelly had shown me the brochure six months ago the employment agency based out of bucharest in neighboring romania happy women in drab uniforms making military covers on hotel beds serving food to smiling diners filing papers behind a spotless desk with a computer resting on it its plastics unyellowed by age see they need secretaries and waitresses and maids and nannies nelly tells me you could get a job with a computer thats new i glanced at the marketing brochure moldova is the poorest country in europe these places all look better sunnier more hopeful i dont want to move to italy or turkey or israel i dont speak their languages but your english is good theyll always pay extra for english nelly bites the eraser on her pencil at a hotel i might meet a traveling businessmen from the west maybe america a nice guy with a good job americans like eastern european girls the supermodels have done at least that for us americans dont talk to maids i say i better spoil her dreams right away yes thats what a good sister does i hand her back the brochure a hot beat of fear probes my chest at the thought of nelly hundreds or thousands of kilometers away working a job that gives her no time to come home i could send money back to you and aunt and uncle nelly said no well i am not asking for permission why start now i say and do a sisters roll of the eyes natalia went to turkey and got a good job there are no jobs here school teaching remember you better teach them well because theyll have to leave moldova to get a job nelly said and three weeks later nelly is gone teary hugs at the train station she is taking a train to chisinau then onto bucharest then a plane to tel aviv ill write everyday nelly says hugging aunt and uncle at once and looking over their heavy shoulders at me no you wont i say nelly has always been the crier not me i am not about to start but my heart shreds so much it turns into confetti i will nelly promises ill be bored and ill have to write to send you money borrow the traveling businessmans blackberry i joke and send us an email i have seen blackberries in movies no one in harp owns one and then nelly hugs me smelling a bit of milk and goodbye cake and is gone when i am done dusting the classroom i stop for a moment the boys are playing football in the scrappy yard my favorite student is the goalie i watch the boys and remember playing on the scrubby grass with nelly when they were young nelly complained i kicked the ball too hard as though nellys legs were fashioned from porcelain i did kick the ball hard i was a good athlete one of the best at our school nellys letters arrive regularly but there is no money in them just brief words that she is well in jagged handwriting that looks unhappy nelly feels guilty about not sending money i decide but nelly wont say so the classroom door behind me opens i dont know the man standing there he is tall head shaved bald a thick lacing of tattoo crawling out of the collar of his shirt his eyes are brown and hard he is the sort of man who makes you hold your breath for a moment not in a good fluttering way he smiles i know he is not a parent not an administrator from the district his clothes are too good the suit italian the sweater underneath it silk the watch ostentatious a slash of steel on his gorillas wrist he calls my name like a question i nod a yes im a friend of nellys he says you can call me vadim and my teachers brain used to the carefully built lies of children notes he didnt say it was his name it was what i could call him what has nelly gotten herself into i think what trouble a feeling of dread pierces my stomach vadim smiles he steps inside the classroom he shuts the door the click is like a hammer hitting me in the silence i bring you a message from nelly he says oh all right i think maybe he works with her in israel maybe she actually met a traveling businessman and here he is he holds up a dvd he walks to the old machine and presses the power button turns on the television he ejects the dvd thats in there a bootlegged pbs video with a bad moldovan voiceover a science show about the universe i have been teaching the children about stars and planets he glances at the bootleg as if curious as to what useful lessons i might be teaching todays children he slides his disc into the machine and presses play i stand pierced as my sisters face appears on the screen nelly is crying shivering i have not seen nelly cry this way since our parents died seven years ago her hair is different dyed blonder and bigger as though a harsh wind has breathed it into place a toobright lipstick smears her mouth her eyes look dulled nelly says my name like its a foreign word then on the tape i hear a deep voice vadims saying tell her what you wanted to say i want to come home nelly says help me come home shes been a problem vadim says in the detached tone of a mechanic discussing a faulty carburetor or a leaking gas line shes a bit uglier than we thought she would be the customers dont like her shes not getting picked enough shes just sitting on the couch the customers i say its not a question its horror bright in my heart then a mans hand pushes nelly back onto an unmade bed the sheets are a bright eyeburning aqua blue the camera jars slightly a man heavyshouldered pale skinned climbs on top of nelly and begins after a moment to thrust his hips a thin blonde anemic mohawk tops his head nelly doesnt scream she doesnt fight she simply endures the mohawk smiles back over his shoulder at the camera then he hits nelly a slap and continues vadim watches me for a reaction then he smiles my boss you see he likes her fine but the customers are the ones who matter i can arrange for nelly to come home if you like if you like if you like i go hot and cold again my throat feels broken the searing feeling in my chest subsides a fist of ice forms in its place my mind goes blank for all of five seconds blank in a way it never has before it is all the shock i allow myself there is no time for dismay or horror what do you want i ask vadim money i want a thousand euros and i want three more three more what i say euros three more girls the silence hurts like a knife sliding between my ribs recruit three more girls for me to take your sisters place i dont move i dont speak youre a schoolteacher people trust you you can do this easily i prefer eighteenyearolds sell three innocent girls into that to save my sister my voice stays steady how i dont know because the shock is quickly fading in favor of another feeling i cannot describe a heat in the heart that is beyond rage and fury the heat of a decision made i shake he smiles like he thinks it is fear makes me tremble and if i cant find three girls please could i just pay you more money back to get nelly i dont need money schoolteacher i need product product all right i say too quickly he gives me a scowl dont bother going to the police we own them and you can hardly recruit girls if the cops know what youre doing i believe him i have no intention of going to the police right now im wondering if i murder him right here if i can clean up the blood so thoroughly that the children will not notice it tomorrow kids notice everything i swallow hard just to give a visible reaction beyond the overwhelming bitter freezing hatred i feel for this man how does this work my voice doesnt quite sound like mine ill be back in two months you bring the three girls they need to be no older than twentyfive no older you will send me their names and photos in two weeks and ill arrange their passports if they already have passports thats even better you say nothing to them except that nelly is really happy in her job working at a very nice hotel in tel aviv what if i cant recruit three girls then little nelly stays put the brothel owner might sell her down the chain to the cheaper houses either in israel or over to northern africa or he shrugs he might kill her and dump her worthless ass in the med this is your one chance to get your sister back take it ill do it ill do what you ask a shivery moan escapes my lips vadim is happy message delivered relative terrified action promised he grins now you schoolteacher youre much nicer than nelly you could turn the money quite well he smacks lips at me what is that old van halen song hot for teacher he sings it in his bad broken english off key he pulls the tape out and considerately reloads the bootleg educational dvd and then he is gone his expensive heels click on the worn tile down the hallway i go to the window and watch him walk past the boys playing their impromptu football game the ball bounds toward him and he stops it with one armani shoe gracefully he aims a polite perfect kick not to the closest child but back to the biggest tallest player on the field of course he would kick it to the biggest he is that kind of showy asshole he walks to an audi and consults a map and gets into the car and drives off a map he had more places to go along the backwater roads more people to see perhaps more families to blackmail what will you do for your sister i move as if in a dream i lock my desk i gather up my lesson plans notebook and my lunchbox and my purse i walk down the street ten minutes to home at home aunt and uncle cook dinner and watch television a romanian soap opera called only friends they say they dont care about but to which they are clearly addicted i dutifully kiss the tops of their heads uncles freckled bald pate and aunts slightly greasy gray mop and make a cup of black tea i take it to my room the one id shared with nelly and i shut the door i sit on the edge of the bed and drink the strong tea and i stare at a water spot above nellys bed my sister always said the spot was shaped like france and i told her no its a lions head i lay down on the bed and well nelly was right it sort of is like france and a lions head and i close my eyes and i think i think the problem through with the care and patience of someone building a house of cards when i see weakness i tear the tower down with a flick of my mind and i start again the puddle of tea in my cup grows cold i get up and i walk down to the hallway to the apartment at the end i knock once and the door opens after a minute it takes ivan with his one leg a bit longer to get around and he looks sleepy as though he has dozed i can hear an argument on his tv hes watching only friends too the silly old soldier he smiles at me we are only friends too but we are old friends he invites me inside asks if i would like tea and i say no thank you what brings you here teach me ivan ha what can i teach the teacher the old soldier says i look at him he sees the unspeakable seriousness in my eyes and his smile fades teach me how to fight teach me how to kill harp moldova i follow natalia from the market natalia is a petite girl and whenever i turned i could see the prominent heavy swell of her stomach pregnant natalia lumbers like pregnancy does not agree with her she has no glow as natalia reaches the edge of the market i touch her elbow and the young woman turns recognizes me and tries to smile like smiling is a flexing of the face that shes forgotten do i know you natalia says you recruited my sister to be a prostitute for vadim i see no point here in wasting time she looks like she might explode with baby at any moment every word detonates against the fortress of natalias smile the womans lips waver for barely a moment and the smile stays firm as brick i have to go natalia whispers i close a hand around natalias arm i push the woman into a narrow alley between shuttered stores where for rent signs hang in their windows like permanent fixtures broken glass from a beer bottle cracks under our shoes i smell piss in the alley natalia tries to pull away but i am so much stronger i ease natalia up against the brick wall where a graffiti artist has written unkind words about a rival football team where did they take her i ask i dont know let me go tell me or ill break your arm but im pregnant natalia pales irrelevant a broken arm wont hurt your baby how does it work when vadim gets the girls from here natalia doesnt answer and so i yank the girls arm across my knee begin to exert pressure on both sides let me assure you i mean business but youre a teacher now she remembers me yes and ill beat your ass with a ruler if you dont tell me what i want to know natalias eyes widen hell kill nelly if he knows you talked to me let me go and walk away my hands find the girls ring finger and twist it savagely natalia cries out you need to start taking this conversation seriously how does it work natalia gasps with pain okay vadim takes them to bucharest they are taken to a safe house there they are then taken to istanbul by car theres another safe house they stay there a while why to please dont make me say it since you condemned my sister to it you can say it break them in define they give them heroin they assault them for days until theyre easier to manage i made myself count to ten before i spoke and then what theyre sold to houses some in turkey to israel albania italy the prettiest ones go to dubai do you know where nelly is theres nothing you can do for nelly except cooperate with them they hold all the power if i can do nothing then theres no harm in telling me and then i see natalia is not quite human any more natalia is not just flesh and blood but she is fear she is ruled shaped made by fear she is afraid of everything this is what vadims forge has made good she she is in tel aviv i saw her there i was there too lucky strike parlor above a pizzeria there are eight girls there most from moldova or romania is vadim the pimp no trafficker he just gets the girls to where they have to be there is a man with a blond mohawk who is he his name is zviman he owns the brothel he inherited them from his father he owns a whole bunch of them around africa the middle east in russia you dont want to mess with him hes a cold bastard hell kill nelly and not blink thank you natalia you are keeping the baby the shift in tone rocks natalia and she blinks yes they didnt make you get rid of it they let me come home now she glances at the floor oh how generous of them natalia tries to nod but even that simple motion seems beyond her how many girls did it cost to bring you home she reacts as though ive slapped her i wait finally she says five including nelly natalia cant look at me i look at the broken beer bottles on the pavement my mother got the replacements she did it for me now natalia raises her face replacements the word twists like a knife in my gut i realize i have bitten the inside of my cheek and i can taste the copper tinge of my blood youre just a schoolteacher you cant fight vadim hes greased every palm he needs between here and istanbul and if you cross him nelly is dead get girls to replace her and forget about them i know your mother i say i know where she lives where she shops where she likes to drink her wine natalia blinks her vapid little mouth works in fright leave mama alone please please you keep your mouth shut about our little talk or when i see vadim next ill tell him you told me everything he will regret his kindness to you then she starts to pull away and i can tell its not enough she will warn vadim i grab her arm and if you talk to vadim i will kill your mother i will walk up to her on the street and i will shoot her in the head its more of a kindness than what you and she did to my sister can you believe i said that sam i said it me the schoolteacher and you know i meant it my voice convinces natalia is pale with terror i let her go and she stumbles away from the alley i check my watch today ivan is going to practice using the knife with me we work in an abandoned winery a few kilometers from the ragged edge of town no one is around to hear the ping of the bullets i put into the targets harp moldova i find three photos of american girls on the web that look like id or passport shots it is at a website for people arrested for stupid crimes and the girls look attractive but rough a bit down on luck i assign three false names to them and email them to vadim so he can craft fake passports i wait i go out to the abandoned winery there are too many of them in moldova now and ivan and i practice what i am going to do i wish you would let me help you he says he is an old gentleman he lost his leg in afghanistan during the war back when moldova was soviet in recent years when crime kept skyrocketing in moldova he taught me and nelly both how to defend ourselves how to kick to punch with a fist to gouge the most vulnerable areas groin throat eye now i am taking everything he taught me before everything i knew as an athlete and i am trying to become a soldier in a matter of weeks he corrects me gently when i aim the gun when i draw the knife this is a crash course and he says more than once girl im only preparing you to get killed please dont do this you fail tu mori it means you die what should i do instead i say slave up some nice girls go to the police ivan says but without much fervor i have already been on the computers searching on the web for options the united nations has named moldova as a critical point in human trade with officials in the army the police and the government suspected of profiting from the slavery who am i supposed to turn to there is no one i tell ivan just me and i have thought out my plan i was always good at lesson plans and now i have a lesson for vadim and the blond mohawk ivan nods and then he tells me again this is how you strike with the knife forward lunge no not down like that stay steady every time i begin to feel afraid i push the fear down nelly and i used to wrestle on the bed and nelly was all wriggling knees and elbows easy to get giggling and i would have to wrap my arms around nelly until nelly stopped laughing and squirming so i hold my fear the same way in a calm sure grip until the fear is silent i hang the sacks two meters high in the dim glow of the abandoned winery the rough figure of a man lies in black paint on the rough burlap light shines in bars through the worn slats ivan watches me work light begins to shine in the bullet holes i put through the painted men group of three he says thats good a triangle in the chest that will put him down i dont tell him i dream about shooting now i dream about bullseyes neatly patterned he gets the ammo from a friend on the black market i am eating up my savings i dont want to waste expensive bullets i still have to pay for my travel i think ivan is paying extra for me to have weapons and i will somehow pay him back if i live when we finish we catch the bus back into town weapons and targets in knapsacks we look so harmless but our time has come to an end so you will see vadim tomorrow ivan asks yes will i see you again his voice wavers what will i tell your aunt and uncle you tell them i will be back with nelly i dont mean once youve left i mean if he kills you tell them you werent such a good teacher then i buy ivan ice cream because he doesnt drink any more we stand in the sunlight him on his crutch licking at the chocolate in a wafer cone ready i think ready harp moldova where are the girls vadim asks no hello vadim is a businessman he has product to move he is a busy professional with a jampacked schedule vadim and i stand in the quiet of a small cafe down from the train station natalia told me normally vadim would meet the girls somewhere near the station buy them a tea or coffee and a roll be charming show them their passports offer an advance on two weeks pay say idle things about the fake hotel in sunny delightful greece where their nonexistent jobs awaited the coffee shop is warm but empty of customers except for us rain hammers down the sky looks chopped from lead olia and lizaveta are in the ladies room katerina is not here yet but she will be she wanted to say goodbye to her grandmother i say the lie is so easy but i worry that my voice shakes i cannot betray myself you did well the money i hand him the envelope he opens it peels through the bills the cafe owner standing and brewing a fresh pot does not look at me or vadim as he refills my coffee and vadim carefully counts the cash nelly i say ill bring her when i come back from israel after delivering these three you could be lying to me i could but im not he cranes his neck toward the back where the restrooms are eager to see the girls face to face to take the measure of their worth to him gauge their personalities and beauty the gleam in their expectant smiles and see if theyre suspicious that above all i glance at vadims messenger bag the flesh trafficker carries a man purse it doesnt make me laugh do you still have that dvd of nelly sure he flicks me a smile and i think you really do have no soul id like it back i dont want it showing up on the internet ah schoolteacher so proper ha i wouldnt put it up on the internet he laughs that stuff is free nowadays the restroom door opens he cranes his neck further past my shoulder he wants to see what hes buying i fling the hot coffee kindly just poured into my cup into his greasy bastard face he shrieks and totters back in the leaning chair now hes flat on the tile floor i stand and i fire the shot down into his knee i thought long and hard about this in the quiet temple of the winery discussing with ivan how best to proceed about whether i should kill him with the first shot or get him to talk i decided on the knee a horrid tatter of a scream erupts from vadims throat the cafe owner freezes then he tosses me a roll of tape from behind the counter i catch it onehanded the owner walks to the window puts on the closed sign closes all the window blinds and he walks out the back as though he has seen nothing as though he is deaf to vadims shrieks he is ivans cousin and he can keep a secret i drag vadim behind the counter he writhes on the ground red welling from his leg in hot splatters black fury and pain in his scalded eyes rage and fear dancing together i push the gun up under his chin who do you meet in bucharest i ask bitch ill kill you he screams give me the name you shot me you shot me give me the name i slide the gun like a lovers hand from his throat to his crotch boris boris chavez i search his pockets cell phone passport wallet the train tickets for him and the three girls you stole my sister i stare at him this nothing wrapped in human flesh for a moment the fear wins out in his eyes and i feel almost sorry for him then the moment vanishes he made his choices tu mori i say you die youre dead bitch youre and i fire the bullet into his head i dont pause i dont think about it do you think i am a bad person sam i walk out the back of the little cafe i might be trembling i dont stop to see if i am i stroll to the train station ivan and his cousin are going to make sure that no one will find vadim no one will know i walk fast and i board the train and find a place to sit alone an old granny perches across the aisle from me and gives me a friendly smile i nod back i am such a polite killing machine i take a deep breath i will not falter i cannot as the train pulls out for chi inau i will change there for the train to bucharest i find boriss name in the call log in vadims phone i go onto myspace using the cell phone to connect to the internet boris has a page he is young biracial with a broad smile he doesnt look like a slaver but he is and now i know who to look for at the train station hello boris and soon enough goodbye bucharest romania gray smears the sky like spilled paint but the sun has woven its light in patches through the clouds the air in the train out of moldova feels stale and cloying no one else seems uncomfortable though people read their newspapers and eat their snacks and spin their gossip i sit far away from everyone in a corner watching the countryside unfurl watching the rain thin and die ivan told me killing would make me feel funny i do did it change you sam after you first killed you seem so normal like other people while i feel like the woman who is different who is marked who maybe has no shadow maybe i breathe differently now i wanted to throw up about ten minutes after i put the bullets in vadim and every rattle and bump of the train feels like god thumping at me but then the weirdness passes because i have no choice i have done this and i will do it again boris looks for greasy vadim and three fooled moldovan beauties he stands on the edge of the station wearing clothes that slid out of fashion two years ago jeans too baggy a real madrid shirt a cap too big for his head hes here to maintain control if the product gets antsy i assume that hes armed i walk to a counter and buy a steaming cup of black tea i make sure to stand near a column so he cant see me watching him boris checks his watch digs a phone out of the deep caverns of his pockets thumbs the keyboard in my pocket vadims phone rings it chirps a ring tone of a kanye west song gold digger how appropriate i answer it hello yes this is vadims phone um where is vadim oh he is in the bathroom hes supposed to be on a train we missed the morning train to bucharest were coming on the afternoon train boris gives an annoyed sigh well he could have called do you work with vadim yes who is this olia i guess i shouldnt answer his phone but he left it here on the table he took us to lunch boris is already heading for the exits i follow he hangs up without another word and i switch off the phone he walks to a nearby car park and gets inside a van older dusty that hasnt been well cared for of course a van i think the product has to fit inside where no one can see i grab a cab and tell the driver to follow the van you want me to follow someone like in a movie the cab driver asks i am his most interesting fare all week yes like in a movie i make it sound lighthearted the cab driver is going to remember me now but that cant be helped we wind through the crowded streets of bucharest the cab driver running lights a couple of times to keep the van a few cars ahead of us in sight i hope boris is not going to a movie to kill time until the later train arrives i have not been to bucharest in years and the city seems so much bigger so much more western i remember it was once called the little paris of the east before ceau escu the maniac nearly destroyed its architectural beauty its spirit i shiver again and think i cannot be afraid now i had ivans cousin to back me up before i was on my own turf this is entirely different this is the dark unknown boris drives and drives finally he wends the van through an older neighborhood on the edge of bucharest cheap houses line the streets here not apartments of course they would need a house more privacy i shove a fistful of money at the cabbie and i get out a block away the tip is enough that the cabbie calls me kind miss and rewards me with a teastained smile i walk towards the house a single light burns i cut across to the side of the house and creep up to a window i hear the soft hiss of the television a basketball game croatia playing spain i hear boris clomping around in a household symphony footsteps refrigerator door hum of its motor click of it shutting i hear the soft pop of a bottle opening but i hear him only him i put my weapon into my hand i go up to the front door the doorbell is old and its light warms my finger moldovan and romanian are the same language really the only difference is a political label dependent on borders as he answers the door i say yes hello i am here today to talk to you about our lord jesus christ and then i stop with a firm polite smile boris holds his bottle of noroc beer and because i am a harmless petite girl he smiles at me he hesitates before he would slam the door in my missionarys face then i raise the taser and fire boris dances back the needletipped wires jolting him down into a quivering tongueless heap i step inside and i hit him again with the charge he convulses and i close the door with my butt while he dances for me the beer sprays across the hardwood floor foaming into an ugly orange throw rug hes paralysed helpless i pull the plastic restraints out of my purse and i bind him wrists behind back ankles together so tight his feet will begin to swell boris has a gun a sleek beretta lying on a kitchen counter i check it the clip is full a round loaded i pocket the gun in the back of my pants i move through the house in one room there are two beds unmade they smell of dirty man one bed has empty noroc beer bottles by it and an unsettling stain on the sheets blood a crescent of it halfway down the mattress heavy construction paper blacks out the windows like the kind i use back in my classroom being a teacher feels like a thousand lifetimes ago i can never go back i go through the rest of the house nothing no one else but a door off the kitchen is locked i scramble fingers through boriss pockets and find the keys the door opens to stairs that lead down into a basement the room is coaldark i find and flick on the light eight beds in the room three are occupied hello are you all right i call first in moldovan romanian then in russian two of the girls moan stir on a table stand i see powder syringe candle spoon equipment for a horrible witchcraft i hurry over to the young women track marks mar their pale pearly arms their flesh thrums under my fingertips chains bind them to the beds the third girl is dead eyes half open showing a moonsliver of white throat choking with bile another key on boriss ring unlocks the chains and i get the two girls to sit up they shudder and cry lost in between the high of the cruel drug and the pain of what theyve suffered i find their clothes folded in a corner and get them dressed natalia was wrong or lied this is where the women are broken and bent to force not istanbul i wasnt expecting to lead a rescue mission i was going to handle boris like i handled vadim get the information on the next stage of the trafficking trail move onto istanbul i lead the women up to the kitchen reassure them all will be fine i talk to them in what i call my teachercalm voice the two girls stare at the dazed and bound boris they dont cry they just stare at him like ive dragged in the devil in chains to lay at their feet i want to get them to safety but i need information from boris the girls seem okay for the moment just relieved to be free i ask where they are from and both are from small towns in western moldova the dead girl was from ukraine they say boris gagged stares up at me i decide to risk more time under this roof no one else is here i tear the tape off his mouth you fucking bitch we will kill you and your whole family you goddamned bitch and then i seal the tape back over his mouth they are all so unoriginal in their namecalling then i tear off another strip i play the sticky side of the tape against boriss nostrils like a teasing feather his eyes widen and he kicks against the hard tile floor trying to get away from me did he hurt you i ask the two girls ones too blissed out riding a narcotic surf to answer but the other nods hair hanging down in her eyes then im going to hurt him keep your seat if you want or go into the other room the girls stay the more sober one clutches her friends arm i put my face close to boriss six months ago moldovan girl named nelly blonde do you remember nod yes or shake your head no boris nods vadim must have told him he was going to work nellys sister to get new recruits where is she now i rip the tape free from his lips tel aviv a massage parlor called lucky strike on rehov fin its above a pizzeria this confirms natalias story who has her the man with the blond mohawk boris hesitates and so i seal the tape back over his mouth then i stick the extra strip over his nostrils i run a finger along its edge boris begins to buck his eyes roll and bulge in panic thats probably how the girls felt like they had no control no help and they were going to die boris screams behind the tape did you rape my sister did you pump heroin into her veins he writhes screams his throat raw begging now in his eyes as his body craves fresh oxygen i watch his face i count to forty he is a smoker and he didnt get a lungful before i sealed the exits i tear the tape off now boris babbles the man who bought her there is a laptop upstairs tape really is the most useful tool around the house i think i put the tape back over his mouth but not his nose i run upstairs i find a file cabinet a weathered desk spotted with beer bottle rings and a laptop i open it it awakens from sleep apparently boris was websurfing before he headed to the train station i pick through the hard disk i open a folder called product each girl has a file the top of the window tells me there are one thousand and thirtysix files i cant wrap my head around the number thinking about it is an ax to the brain i search for nelly sold for a combination of heroin and to a yaakov zviman in tel aviv the notes in the file indicate she was auctioned off at a motel room in eilat five different bidders i try not to vomit at the thought i memorize the address but i copy the entire folder to a disc and put the disc in my jacket pocket i open the desk drawer and find rolls of money euros american dollars romanian leu turkish lira and israeli sheqel banknotes i scoop them all up shove them into my pockets i close the laptop and head downstairs and hear the front door opening and a womans voice boris did you remember to feed the whores then what the hell i run down the rest of the stairway and in the kitchen is a woman standing over boriss wriggling form the woman is blonde close to six feet tall wiry hair cropped short and this woman is pulling out a gun from the back of her jacket mind goes blank i forget i have the taser and i throw myself toward the tall woman like ivan has taught me i need a punching bag now a rage fuels my blood my fist courts her jaw the blow delivered hurts my hand but the sheer force of my attack knocks the woman back into the refrigerator i hammer another fist this time into her stomach the woman swerves shoving past me trying to get room to fight back gasping i step back and aim a hard kick at the womans throat i am too ambitious i miss hit low the heel of my boot slamming into the womans breasts driving air from the lungs the womans gun clatters to the tiles the two captive girls stumble from the kitchen one dragging the other trampling over the bound boris who is trying to maneuver to his feet i throw the woman across the kitchen she lands against the counter leftovers from breakfast lie by the sink coarse bread mug of coffee the tall woman throws the mug at me it catches my temple icecold bitter coffee splashes in my eyes i blink away the sting and then i see the sharp bread knife slashing toward me the tip of the knife catches me along the edge of the hand and it hurts i cry out and the tall woman slashes back with the knife an inch from my throat the air singing i can feel the whip of the blade the slicing of air before the tall woman can slam the blade backwards in its arc and i see her reverse her grip on the knife with a nimble strut of fingers i grab the skillet crusted with leftover egg and slam it into the womans face with the force of a tennis racket she howls blood flies from her mouth i crack the skillet against the womans knife hand the knife drops to the tile it bounces it gleams i use the skillet to batter the woman down raining the blows the final barrage sends her sprawling bleeding quiet at last the two girls are gone i stand in the doorway and scan the street for them flat of my hand against the sunlight like a mama surveying the street for her kids better this way i think i have what i need the disc the address for nelly i realize then that im hurt cut across both sets of knuckles another slash across my stomach it doesnt hurt so much until i see the wounds the blood brings the sharp sting i turn and boris has staggered to his feet hopping and i pick up the skillet and i put him back down then i take the edge of the skillet and slam it into his crotch tu mori i say to him but i dont think hes listening any more i turn to the stove i crank on the gas on all the burners i open a drawer and find foil and stick a wad of it inside the microwave and turn it on set the timer to cook for five minutes i run out the door boris screeching behind the gag what sounds like a plea for mercy hes a smart boy im not all the way down the street when the back of the house explodes outwards the roof buckling taking to air like untested wings i hear the debris crashing into the yard i dont look back sam you cannot look back either redlight district tel aviv israel its been less than twentyfour hours since i left bucharest the bandages on my hands need a change and the pain from the knife cut surges up through my arm like a flickering torch i had to leave the taser and the guns behind i could not have gotten them through romanian or israeli customs without extra forms and attention and i dont want the israeli authorities having anything in my file except arrival and departure dates i sit in the pizzeria from this window i can see the men walking past the open door of the restaurant i wear dark jeans black untucked blouse dark glasses i order a steady supply of juice and food so the counter staff are not annoyed by me keeping a table i have a notebook so they think i am a writer sitting and working no cokes i cannot take caffeine on top of my nerves i feel worn down exhausted as though i am getting sick i eat a slice of vegetarian pizza i dont have much appetite the brothel is above the pizzeria the sidewalks on rehov fin or as it gets nicknamed rehov pin for penis are painted with red arrows that point to the peep shows and brothels the windows on the second stories are barred signs show women in silhouette writhing in ecstasy or bound or beckoning to men with a curled finger club joy sexxxys studio club viagra no im not making that last one up sam i watch the men as they arrive and leave many are alone and they are a mix jewish and arab and christian some look like businessmen or office workers some like foreign laborers some are soldiers in uniform apparently they rate a discount some are orthodox jews stuffing their skullcaps into their pockets as they enter the doors and pulling them out when they walk back into the accusing sunshine some are duos and trios of young men i am sure are americans college students what would their parents think i wonder i want to storm the doors but if my plan is to work i must know how busy the parlor is when it is at its least crowded but i hate every second knowing nelly is inside i know what they will do to me if i am caught they will kill me or try to break me like the girls back in bucharest like nelly so i force myself to watch to find the pattern of scumball traffic that will allow me to get in and get out with the least violence i see an older man leave return with a bag of food an employee probably there are at least two employees inside at all times one to take payment coordinate the visits one for security to make sure the girls cant leave and to make sure the clients behave themselves and maybe mr mohawk zviman maybe hes inside him i long to meet i see that there is a sudden noticeable drop in traffic before dinner time fine i go back to a hotel not the one that i am staying in to get what i need every hotel guard is armed in israel ivan told me this hed read about it in an article covering a thwarted palestinian attack where the guard shot down the suicide bomber i approach a guard at a marriott fumbling with a russianlanguage guidebook confused look on my face a wrongly folded map tourist from moscow i can almost see the thought flit across the guards face i drop the map and jet the pepper spray ive bought into the guards face with a hiss of sorry on my lips as he staggers his hand going to the gun i seize the weapon out of its holster and i run i flee out of the hotel through a shopping center into a cab the gun is cool against the flat of my stomach under my shirt i think about what to wear into battle i expect i could die so i decide to splurge only the best for the crazy teacher sam i know you have always admired my style yes the next afternoon i find a boutique at the very upscale ramat aviv mall and i buy black leather pants and a taut black turtleneck and a neat fitted black leather jacket its as close as a girl gets to armor winter has passed so i get the gear on sale but it still would cost a fortune back in moldova i use boriss cash for the purchase thank you boris the gun fits into the small of my back back at my hotel room i get dressed and then i make a secret preparation in case i am captured a final revenge on zviman or his men i check my gun if i cannot get us out then a bullet for nelly and a bullet for myself i calm myself by applying my makeup more than i would ever wear back home i look like such a bad girl red mouth cat eyes heavy on liner i laugh to myself thinking girl now you have on your warpaint i feel like a different person the schoolteacher is dead the schoolteacher has killed three people and freed two slaves and blown up a house that was nothing to what i must do now i take a cab to the pizzeria its still daylight the sun sliding its farewell into the mediterranean its the time of the predinner lull i noticed yesterday a man catcalls me as i get out of the cab and tip the driver i ignore him i walk up the steps lucky strike parlor the sign reads in both hebrew and english whose luck i wonder i go up the stairs to a door that is bloodred lucky strike painted on it in cursive black letters i resist the urge to kick in the door instead i open it like anyone else and step inside the parlor the room is cool and smells of salt of heavy perfume of beer i hear a whiny voice say cmon baby smile for me the voice has a new york crawl to it like i have heard in movies and tv it is as if i have entered a stained dream the lights in here are yes indeed a shade of red a dim bitter crimson lowgrade electronica trance music plays in the background i see a reception desk an old man sitting there he eats a cookie with his mouth open behind him is what looks like a raised platform two women sitting under sallow spotlights they wear seethrough clothing neither of them is nelly if they have heard the young mans plea they give no sign no reaction they sit very straight and they do not smile they could be mannequins i think they are just waiting for the next bad thing to happen lounging on a nearby couch are two collegeage men swigging goldstar beers wearing jeans one in an american football jersey the other sporting a sweatshirt that has a store name on it the shirt is bloodred under the glow of the lights they are telling stupid jokes in english trying to get the girls to smile like i know now tourists do in london with the british guards at buckingham palace either the girls are forbidden to laugh like the guards or they cannot it strikes me that it might be dangerous for a girl here to laugh at a man bubbles of hate rise in my chest bubbles no too soft a word sam i must be honest the hate fills me like a flooding river i hate everything about them excuse me miss the old man says in hebrew he is unsure maybe i wandered in he must think he talks to me around the crumbs of his big cookie hello there you showing up for a shift baby the boy in the storename shirt calls he raises the beer bottle toward me like a welcoming toast i am here to apply for a job i say to the old man in english the old man is speechless brow furrowing he stands up which is all i want him to do now that i see his hands are empty except for that fucking cookie i pull the gun out from the back of my leather pants and the bullet barks over the soft thrum of the bad disco music the old man drops wordless his chewing jaw gone him eating that cookie while those poor girls sit there waiting to be bought pisses me off the two americans freeze in shock the women on the platform stare one of them stands her chair tottering back to the floor youre paying to rape i say to the guys my sister is here and you are paying to rape her now wait a minute honey wait were americans i shoot them both and because they are stupid thoughtless children i fire into their legs they jerk into screaming spasms on the floor the blossoms of blood on their clothes are bright in the red lights their howls fill the room broken by gasps of air go run i say to the tired dulleyed women they run in scanty lingerie out and down the stairwell but the fear on their faces i think it doesnt tell me that theyre free off the entrance parlor theres a hallway and in its curve i see a door open a fortyish man stumbling out trying to pull up his pants panic in his eyes i see a glint of wedding ring on his hand he charges toward me and i shoot him in both knees he can explain that to his wife he thunders to the floor mewling and screeching behind him a woman screams i stop yell at the woman in english get out run the woman doesnt i repeat myself but in russian then romanian the young woman younger than nelly bloodless with fright hugs the wall naked too terrified to move where is the guard then i see a door yank open two down and across the hall from the scared girls room the college boys keep shrieking and i hear one call out for his mama like mama wants to see this no one exits the door i want to believe that its nelly or some other girl too frightened by the gunfire cowering in the doorway unsure of what to do too much hope in my heart i call nelly nelly its me silence then a bear of a man charges around the open doorway toward me a shotgun in his hands leveled at me and when he sees me slip of a girl in black leather a naked wave of surprise passes over his face he hesitates i fire and a splinter of drywall explodes by his shoulder and i shoot again he falls and fires as he ducks back and the pellets mist my doorframe into shreds i throw a hand over my face and the adrenaline masks the pain but i feel flesh pierced ear shoulders back of the neck by the flying debris i lie halfway in the room my legs prone in the hallway and i freeze my mind telling me to be still i have baited a trap by lying here where he cant see i am conscious every fiber telling me to run hide i stay still wait i steady my gun up at the shattered doorway waiting for him to creep into view playing dead he cant see my gun until hes risked a glance around the peppered wall the man with the shotgun inches down the hallway i hear the shuffle of his feet weirdly it sounds like boris struggling to breathe the americans and the married man have either stopped fussing or have died he sees my legs i imagine lying deathly still he turns into the doorway and i fire into his stomach he screams and staggers back the pain overriding his trigger finger i stand and i kick the shotgun out of his hands i think i break a toe he screams and he falls blind with pain i pick up the shotgun what is strange now is my calm the calm is a heaviness inside me smothering the pain the fear i leave him gutshot on his belt i see a baton of some sort i pull it from his belt there is a thumb control and it telescopes into a length cool i like the weight of it in my hand so i take it like a trophy what is wrong with me he has a knife too i tuck that inside my boot taking his weapons was like hoarding small treasures i had earned sam isnt that odd no one else is rushing out to shoot me i kick in the other doors mostly empty no more men but none of the women are nelly when the woman in the last room yells please dont hurt us in moldovan i lower my gun where is nelly working a party for zviman zviman the mohawk the owner smiling at me on the video over his shoulder raping and slapping my sister i must pay my respects where is this party his house i think i dont know i swear please dont kill me what is the address i dont know i dont know i believe her run this is your chance to get out now run there are six women in the hallway and four of them flee immediately hurrying down the stairs in their frilly lingerie the other two stay as though frozen by the prospect of freedom as much as the certainty of peril run whats wrong with you i know the police will be here in minutes and i dont have much time i jab the gun into the face of the gutshot man zviman where is he tell me and ill call an ambulance for you the man whispers an address and i whip him unconscious with his own telescoping baton theres your ambulance consider it called i say i shove the edge of the baton its a little bloody against the wall to close it i herd the two reluctant women out past the married client who has passed out from the agony of his broken kneecaps past the mewling college boys theyre still alive just quieter in their suffering they try and crawl and hide from me behind the couch the little darlings i am their lesson they will never forget out on the street now me and a gang of fugitive women are you stealing us one asks what stealing us to work for another brothel her question makes my heart hurt sam no honey you are free there is a hospital a few blocks away and i point them toward it police cars summoned by the pizzeria owner brake past them with sirens blaring i ignore the cars the cops the lights i guess in my leather pants they think im one of the fleeing prostitutes i herd them into the hospital emergency arrival zone and then im gone i have a man or something that calls himself a man to see tel aviv israel the house is grand overlooking the mediterranean sitting atop a flattening hill not far from hatzok beach on the citys north side pimping must pay awfully well i thinks it looks more like the home of a legitimate businessman perhaps belonging to a software maven a realestate investor a wellregarded lawyer a wall surrounds the house with entrance gates i climb over the gates from inside the house i hear electronica music playing the kind westerners like and that sounds like a pulsing hump its not that different from the music inside the brothel are these men so pathetic i wonder that they need a dance beat for rape i step up onto a cool stretch of stone patio halfempty drinks line the table red wine empty maccabee beer bottles an icemelted scotch the party appears to be over perhaps bad news has been received i try the door unlocked the den is full of heavy leather couches the scent of pepperoni pizza hangs kitchenthick the sting of marijuana touches my nose i have only smelled it once back at a party in chi inau when i was in school getting my teaching license i go down the hallway gun at the ready i go past a darkened doorway and then i feel the cool of a barrel pressing into my hair i freeze drop the gun a voice says in russian i obey the gun guides me back out into the center of the hallway and a man steps in front of me physically big redhaired with heavy lips and baggy eyes i have her he calls in english from the room down the hallway comes the man with the blond mohawk its not spiky its shaved down he is as big as the russian you think he would have found a bigger bodyguard his face is unremarkable his eyes a stone gray hes dressed in a nice shirt untucked and jeans who else is with you he asks me in english no one just me if you lying to me my friend will shoot off your ear im not lying look at me garbage i look at him and he looks at me scowling then smiling you come with me he takes the gun from the russian and jabs it in my hair and pushes me along you you go check the grounds see if shes really stupid enough to come here alone call the office tell them shes here i hear the russian huffing away hes a mouthbreather at the end of the hallway is a slightly open door and in the dim light i see the edge of a bed on the bed a pale thin arm my mouth dries i used to see that arm hanging from the tumble of sheets on the bed on the other side of the room i push open the door with my fingertips nelly lies on the bed sleepy blinking like a child roused from dreams i forget myself for a moment and step forward zviman shoves me against the bed i twist trying to escape and then a fist slams into my face once twice then a kick sledgehammers into my chest his mouth is a curl of rage nelly tries to sit up on the bed you who are you zviman asks me her sister this bitch is why you shot up my place his accent is heavy he must have gotten news of the shooting at the lucky strike sent his partygoers home i wonder how he knows so soon and then the thought occurs to me anyone openly running a brothel owns himself some cops yes dont call her bitch i say he laughs i apologize bitch i didnt know i hurt your feelings bitch thanks for shooting my customers and releasing my whores bitch he laughs again aiming the gun not at me but now at nelly nelly cowers the gun lodged against her temple the police will be here i shot up your property theyll want to talk to you no they wont theres nothing on paper to tie me to the lucky strike nothing at all he shrugs i own the right people on the police force anyway all youve created is a mess that will take me about five minutes to clean up but fuck bitch you got guts i grit my teeth against the pain from the punches and kicks he gave me now who sent you he asks like were going to have a real conversation no one i came on my own dont lie to me you work for who baran markov the nigerians im not lying im her sister look at our faces you can tell he laughs stops stares hard at me tell me who hired you or you die he just cannot believe i am here out of love it tells me everything i need to know about how to kill him did you hear me you die tu mori i say back he blinks at me i manage to stand grimacing against the pain i am her sister and i came for her who do you work for no one i just decided you and your people needed to die it is so simple sam this decision you know it and i know it he laughs at me nelly opens her eyes and they slowly focus on my face softly nelly murmurs mila yes im dreaming i dont dream any more nellys voice sounds like it lives at the bottom of a well no dream im here big sisters going to work with you nelly wont that be nice im gonna sell you as a pair and i can tell that this zviman he thinks hes won he thinks hes won i dont allow myself the smile he pushes the gun under my chin he frisks me along the leather jeans the tight turtleneck the leather jacket he lets his hands linger where he likes he finds the guards knife in my boot and tosses it to the floor he takes the collapsible baton from my pocket this is natans he loaned it to me i say he tosses it in the corner you are a stupid little girl mila look at me i dont not at first frozen and he puts the gun right over my shoulder aimed at nelly ill kill your sister if you fight me so i look at him waiting and he punches me in the face once twice he kicks me in the stomach then he backhands me i land on his expensive coffee table in the corner of the bedroom scattering the sports magazines i tumble into the space between chair and table he seizes my hair he hits me again i stagger and he kicks me in the ribs i fall you stupid moldovan cow you think you sweep in here and you ruin my business what do i care that you shoot up a whorehouse i have three dozen of them around the world you cant even bloody my lip bitch i wanted to say i killed vadim i killed your people in bucharest i set your prisoners free but i dont because i want him to treat me as he does every other woman he keeps the gun in my face as he kneels over me i knew this could happen i knew it and i stamp down the terror that rises in me like fire he unzips my leather pants and orders me to wriggle out of them or hell kill nelly i obey him and the fear is hot and heavy in my throat get out of the jacket the shirt naked now bitch shaking i obey him the tile floor is cold against my back dont yaakov nelly murmurs please dont hurt my sister he leans over and he slaps her hard ill do what i like and you keep quiet or shes dead nelly snuffles mouths at me im sorry yaakov zviman kicks out of his pants he is a big man at least feet meaty armed legs thick from old work a hard flat stomach on the lower part of his arm i see a weird tattoo a sunburst in the heart of a stylized number nine he slips off his shorts i force myself not to close my eyes i lie still he pushes the gun against my throat surveys my body with a hunger uglier than lust you look better than your sister whore do you know how much youll fetch in dubai less because i might cut out your tongue but still a sister act he puts one hand on my throat the other down at his naked groin he positions himself and slides into me and screams an incoherent shattering shriek of pure agony this is my revenge i did the unthinkable i clutched his hips twisting and his scream rose beyond human hearing he writhed trying to pull out of me and away from me and then froze realizing that the horrific pain was only getting worse he dropped the gun cringing like a kicked dog trying to curl into a protective ball i shoved him free of me and he howled like a wounded beast i felt blood his on my thighs hanging onto his penis covering most of it clutching at it was a piece of rubber blood now soaking its edges i slam a kick into his torn groin and he folds sobbing shattered by pain i grab the gun and level it at him my hand is steady i hear running footsteps the russian bodyguard tearing down the hall toward me drawing his gun i have an advantage because the hallway narrows his options but the advantage will be gone in six seconds and i aim and fire like im aiming at the painted figures on burlap in the dusty air of the old winery a triangle like ivan taught me i hurt everywhere but my hand stays steady as a wooden beam the russian crashes to the floor he doesnt move or groan or keep living zviman sobs in hysterics and clutches at his torn genitals he huddles against a wall get it off me how do i get it off me he screams nelly i say calmly is anyone else here nelly stares at the wreck of zviman no go get your clothes then go wait downstairs im using big sister voice now no argument you dont need to see what happens next nelly stares at the bloodsmeared floor at zviman curled into a ball how did you just do as i say here take this i hand her my gun she stares at it and nods she hurries down the stairs i stand above zviman sweat pours around the blond strip of hair look at me garbage i say using his own words i quickly get dressed i wait for him to look up into my face its an inverted rubber lined with little serrated metal razors they dig into the flesh and they dont let go i got the idea from reading about deterrents to rape in africa some women in south africa make these to scare off attackers or to mark them forever you find the most interesting things on the web you know he gasps sobs he apparently is done with calling me names now garbage you want the razors out of you yes he makes a mewling noise i can remove it without further harm wheres your laptop zviman gags and points down the hall gun on him i force him to crawl down the hall and sit up into a chair blood and bile cover him disobey me and ill twist the knife so to speak i say whatever you want please please he can hardly speak the words i want your bank accounts i say what why the agony whittles his voice to little more than a whisper restitution give me access to the accounts or ill twist the device and no doctor will be able to save your dick do we understand each other he nods disbelief and fury and agony all contorting his face i open a web browser and he murmurs the web address for a major cayman islands bank he spits out his login and password and i type them he has several accounts i open balances on each one holds seven million american dollars in another nine hundred thousand in another two million the accounts in the bank total close to fifteen million us dollars thats all ive got the rest of the money goes back into the business please get it off me get it off me dont be such a crybaby its what i used to say to the children who whined a million years ago when i was a teacher i push him out of the chair and do an etransfer of funds into my own cayman account set up last week i learned how to do it on the web the caymans are eager for business i have set up instructions for that money once deposited to be instantly wired into a second account in switzerland he will never find that money but i turn off the laptop quickly strip out the hard drive put it into my pocket youre just a thief zviman screams take it off me no the women youve abused they get this money it cant make up for what you did to them but at least you wont have it then i lean close and spit in his eye he cringes rage and agony alternating on his face you said youd remove this so i did well im not a doctor the only way i know to get it off is to yank i reach for him no no he screams wriggling away fine leave it on its a nice accessory im sure the doctor will have to talk to the police what with you being an assault victim my people will kill you for this he points at the tattoo of the sun inside the nine blood dots the colors they will kill you for this they will kill you a thousand times bitch youre stealing their money too im not sure you will still have people if you cant pay them i wish i had a camera for the shock on his face he realizes without his money he has no power no empire nothing ive burned him to the ground sam and i am going to dance in the ashes i even know which dance i will do lets do the twist i reach for the device he screams again and lurches away blood leaks out of the contraption no power no hope knowing youve lost everything my voice is a steel whisper thats how my sister and those women felt now thats you he makes a broken sound i stand you probably want to get to a hospital youll need to get the barbs loose from the flesh its going to take multiple surgeries im not going to kill you you alive and hurting and ruined is infinitely more interesting to me my voice is taunting now id hurt him id hurt him so badly every day would be a pain just like mine had been since vadim walked into my classroom with his horrible images gunfire a scream downstairs nelly i rush toward the sounds nelly screaming my name and then a slicing boom of gunthunder an awful silence not even zviman calling then he shrieks im upstairs help me help me grab this bitch shes stealing my money i run halfway down the stairs and in the den i see a man thicknecked cheapsuited holding an assault rifle hurrying toward nelly who lies in a crimson spread on the imported italian tile holding the gun i gave her the thick neck looks up at me he fires and the stairs erupt around me and i flee she doesnt have a gun zviman screams shoot her the thick neck thinks he has all the advantage now so he charges into the hall im in a doorway the telescoping baton firm in my hand and i slash it down at the gun the baton cracks his wrist but he keeps a grip on the rifle i whip the baton across his face breaking his nose he staggers back i drop the baton and grab the gun we struggle for it but i have not had fingers and wrists whipped five seconds earlier i work a finger on the trigger and slam the hot barrel into his chest kicking him against the wall the gun shreds him loudly redly and before hes dropping dead im running down the staircase i kneel by my sister gone gone i took my eyes off her for only a few minutes and i failed her if i hadnt bothered with stealing his money ruining his business exacting my revenge if we just got out slowly i dont know how much time passes but i walk back upstairs zviman is gone a heavy smear of blood mars the wall and sill of one window hes gone out onto the roof i go to the window and the roof and the street and the yard are all empty i pick up my knife and put it back in my boot i find mercedes car keys in zvimans abandoned pants and i gather my sister in my arms and i drive the mercedes from the house the empty grand home built on human suffering nelly i failed you tu mori lesson learned sam saving matters more than destroying sydney australia sydney is a nice city it has an endlessly beautiful harbor and excellent restaurants and the australians are an astonishingly friendly nation i go for long walks along the rocks the ancient by sydney standards stretch of bayline where the convict ships dropped both anchor and prisoners a miserable human cargo i am a miserable human cargo the breeze off the harbor is a near constant presence and i feel standing still but leaning into the wind as if i am running i am free yet i am a prisoner i stop on my morning walk and across the stretch of water i watch tourists snap photos of the iconic opera house in a moment i have to go back to the house aunt and uncle grow concerned if i am gone too long neither has good english and i slowly teach them they are learning by watching aussie soap operas which are even juicier than their romanian counterparts i do not want to risk hiring an instructor people talk and i know there is the possibility that zviman with his dicedsliced penis is looking for me and my family a welldressed man a bit younger than me stands a meter away he has dark moussed hair a quiet composed face gray slacks a bright orange shirt that looks expensive not a businessman type not exactly more like a young man who wants to be an actor he has a wry smile on his face a cool million he says as if speaking to the wind his accent is british educated i think he must be on a handsfree phone or he is trying to impress me by randomly announcing a large sum of money he looks like any of the men who approach me on the nights when i wander to the nicer bars to escape the prattle of aunt and uncle so i pay no attention to him a cool millions the price on your head its a rather hefty incentive to find you just how you found nelly usually such fees are reserved for heads of state or particularly annoying warlords in backwater lands now i jerk a glance at him fear a hot lump in my throat did you know he blows out a plume of dunhill smoke ive seen pictures of zvimans um tattered sausage most difficult to get did you know he didnt dare go to a hospital to have your delightful mousetrap removed went to a very dodgy private clinic in strasbourg france on a friends private plane im sure it was the longest flight of his life i had to pay quite a horribly sizable bribe to said clinic for a singularly unappealing photo the young man gave a delicate shudder i dont walk around sydney with a gun but i still carry the telescoping baton in my jacket pocket you have me confused with someone else no mila i dont he smiles not mocking friendly a million on my head so i say i didnt steal all his money then the young man clears his throat zviman did more than sex slavery love he was well still is one of the biggest smugglers in the mediterranean ordnance drugs military surplus even flowers and fish you bloodied his nose and of course you bloodied his privates and smartly done that but hes still operating he runs with a dangerous crowd you broke him though with the theft it takes money to run smuggling routes so hes gone under the radar as they say ive heard now hes trying to get into blackmail on a whole new scale using computers to gather nasties about people blackmails all about information and we live in an information age dont we he sent you if they can find me here they can find me anywhere ah no if his tattered dicklessness had sent me youd be dead days ago and murking up the harbor my sweet im not your sweet no but a lad can dream he gives me a handsome smile what do you want i want you i want you to do something constructive with all that grief and anger i failed my sister mila i failed mila you are a schoolteacher from a little slice of nowhere and you destroyed a major trafficking operation you killed them and you stole a huge chunk of their money do you know how rare honest daring has become in our overcautious world i want to toss diamonds at your feet woman you are incredible i stare at him as though i would like to slap him my sister is dead your praise is smoke to me then i look at the cold steel of the harbor what you did what i did failed i watch him all i got was money is that why youre here you want money for your silence no not everyone would have sent rolling stone magazine that database of trafficked girls who their buyers were and a bank account where zvimans illicit money was you created quite a little tempest from the shadows there love dictating that the cash go to the women who could be found very generous but you dont need to buy my silence mila i mean you no harm all i want is to buy you the best lunch in sydney and a drink i say i can use a drink i think yes love what would you like to drink i dont have a favorite you look like a glenfiddich girl to me that is what whisky i cross my arms i have never tried it and after i have introduced you to the delights of a fine whisky then i want to offer you a job i am in australia under a false name i dont have a work permit nice man sorry you dont need a work permit if i could find you so can zviman and with a million dollars on that lovely pixie head of yours its only a matter of time he leans forward we can hide your aunt and uncle better than you ever could we can hide you but i think you might go mad sitting around and reflecting about what happened to nelly you saved so many lives mila you did good you could do a lot more good or you can sit around with your aunt and uncle watching aussie tv to teach them english and knowing that the man who destroyed your sister is still out there and is hunting you down he risks a smile if you keep moving youll be much harder to find what i did was crazy decidedly i am only crazy when helping my sister on zviman did you see a tattoo a sun in the middle of a nine i close my eyes remembering seeing it on zvimans arm yes i saw it it was ugly you dont know how ugly i think that tattoo is a mark one that says he owes allegiance to something more than his own criminal ring something bigger badder than him that is not my problem no your problem is that with a milliondollar bounty on your head you are going to have every scumball hired killer hunting for you dozens of them mila i can help you hide your family where they will always be safe but you cant have a normal life not until zviman and his bosses are put down they wont let you have a normal life who are you with were the opposite of mr zviman and his friends what are you the police he smiles the cia he smiles again shakes his head the mi oh mila those are all so twentieth century he laughs and i decide i like his smile the round table is so much more come to lunch with me lets talk whats your name you can call me jimmy and im going to be your best friend he held out his hand and i after a careful moment of consideration took it the last minute bar manhattan i closed the file then i deleted it im sorry i said to her i know you are mila said remind me never to anger you i have better control of my temper now sam yoga has worked wonders for me zviman is nine suns thats why you fight them yes and jimmy brought you into the round table same as you brought me she nodded ivan was my first teacher jimmy my second youll meet jimmy one day you and he will either like each other or kill each other she got up walked to the window you can understand my feelings on what youre going through with your son i stared at her back that you cannot save them an innocent caught up in this world the odds are not good and for a while i thought you were lost to us sam i meant what i said they can control you forever with daniel they tried to control me with nelly and you see what it got her dead i was going to save her i had saved her and i got her killed you were alone we have each other i was stupid but you had to try mila same as i do i can no more walk away from daniel than you could from nelly you misunderstand me she turned back to me arms crossed the man that shot nelly he wasnt even a guard at the house he worked at one of zvimans other brothels in tel aviv heard about the shootings at lucky strike came over to see if zviman was okay he sees a girl with a gun and he shoots her dead he was what you call the anomaly that cannot be planned for but such things always exist they always come up the unpredictable is what kills you if i had been with her instead of stealing his money if we had just left the moment i had her she would be alive but no i couldnt just save her i had to ruin zviman rescue and revenge no you cannot do both she swallowed you want to get daniel and bring down nine suns you cannot do both if i dont theyll never let me be i am going to do both she gave a long sigh and i thought i could still be your teacher you know what they are going to catch me one day as long as the million is hanging over my head it will happen sam she sounded resigned not on my watch i might as well help you if you will listen to me how zviman had a nine suns tattoo on him although when i saw it i did not know what it is he is part of it we must draw in zviman so he sees jack is dead we must convince him jack is dead without killing jack what about the notebook i find it fascinating that you never mentioned this red notebook when we first talked about the ransom i didnt know about it but it makes no sense that you kill jack but leave damaging evidence behind what if he hid it then you never knew it was there you think they would ask you to bring it to them after you kill jack they didnt ask no mila said they didnt ask you i glanced at the bedroom door leonie perhaps maybe they told her to handle the notebook same as telling you to handle the kill because no way could they trust you with that notebook she should have told me it is only a theory the bedroom door opened leonie stood there i have an idea on how to find jack ming she said all right i said we need to talk then its her turn to go i know i do not have a kidnapped child mila said but maybe you let me into your super secret club dont you dare make a joke i wouldnt i am helping you it is decided no its not yeah it is i stood were supposed to work together leonie said just us i am curious as to your objection i said if she helps us kill jack ming what do you care is that what shes going to help us do i thought she wanted to bring nine suns down the lives of your children trump my sense of revenge mila said yes were sticking to the letter of what was demanded of us i glanced at mila she didnt look at me leonie and she stared at each other taking the measure i am not comfortable with this but sam if you can control her and make her useful to us that is fine with me warmest greeting ever mila said i tingle two guns are better than one leonie i said she looked at us both and then she surrendered all right thank you mila if we get taylor and daniel back i will be eternally grateful you said you had an idea on finding jack i said his phone number is the first step she said if i can get that i can get his call log i can start on that right now maybe i can find a way to see if any new numbers are calling anyone he knows via his facebook network or any of his family or other contacts all right i got up somewhat painfully where are you going mila said im going to see if i can use an old friend everyone can use a friend leonie said i mean literally use him god forgive me i walked downstairs and i noticed the older elegant spare man in the corner drinking a pint i noticed everyone but everyone else at a table was in a group he was the only one flying solo someone who might want to observe the bar but garner less attention would not sit at the bar you are kind of front and center sitting at the bar everyone can see you and you craning your neck around to watch the rest of the room is noticeable this may sound paranoid but this is how my mind works especially with the thought that august might be watching the bar to see if i turned up here i didnt like the look of him he watched me but in the mirrored back of the bar when i left the last minute i waited at the next corner for him to exit five minutes ten minutes he didnt he wasnt tailing me i called bertrand the guy in the corner drinking his beer yes anything odd about him no have you seen him before no never he has ordered one harp and he drinks it slowly hes not stirred from his table since you left well then if mila did mila get here before or after he did before we need to be very cautious of anyone alone watching for mila or for me go do what you need to do bertrand said mila and i can handle any trouble that arises well i said are you sure did she tell you about when we had the bathroom soundproofed uh sort of all right ill be back soon i walked into the night part four the nursery ollies bar brooklyn i sat on the crates of beer and when ollie came in and switched on the light and saw me he nearly had a heart attack jesus and mary he yelled then he stared at me you what the hell are you doing here i owe you a gun christ almighty you could have given me notice when you left a few months ago when the company decided to take me out of their private prison in poland and dangle me as bait for nine suns theyd gotten me a job bartending here at ollies my decision to slip the companys leash to go hunt for my wife necessitated i give ollie no notice when i left my job i had also stolen the gun from his safe but to my credit i left an iou you know it hurts it hurts to lose my only good bartender ollie was famous for bemoaning the sad quality of his hired help and for you to be a thief i left an iou which i believed oddly ollie said i didnt call the cops on you the gun wasnt registered anyway ollie i said dryly i lost it but i brought you a better one i handed him a sleek beretta and a box of ammo id taken from the last minute this is fancy he said ill never learn to shoot it you never learned to shoot the other one i said true where did you go i went to go find my wife and my son for some reason i was done lying with ollie id answer a direct question as much as i could he was a good man mila adored him had wanted to buy his bar for years she and i had first met here she was scouting me as a possible recruit this confession made ollie blink did you yes thats good im trying to find august without using a phone i said i thought you might be willing to pass him a message for me are you allergic to phones no i hear they might cause brain cancer ollie was happiest when worrying hes out front and hes had a bit much is he alone yes although theres a goodlooking lady eyeing him up four stools down i am not one to interfere with the course of true love but do you think you could get him back here to talk to me without anyone knowing why should i do you a favor sam after how you treated me ollie do you want to retire yes i will buy this bar from you when you retire you dont have to worry about that ill pay a more than fair price he blinked quit your joshing how many guys would come back and make stealing a gun right not many but could i get that in writing like the iou i was good for yep i tore a label off a case of newcastle brown ale and wrote on the back i promise to buy ollies bar at a fair price when hes ready to retire samuel clemens capra thats your full name you poor kid ollie inspected my handwriting for legibility and legal loopholes huh i thought your answer would be because im a nice guy well that too okay ill tell him i need him to help me move a beer keg hes drunk enough it might work thank you ollie two minutes later august came into the backroom oh hell he said hi he regarded me with a shake of his head and sat down on a stack of cases of heineken what the hell are you thinking well taking you in with a broken arm should be easier youre not taking me in were not going to fight we have to figure out a way to work together are you okay im sorry i hit you i had to have three stitches he pointed at the back of his head the kumbaya approach is a little late sam you cost me my job today i let ten seconds tick away i couldnt tell if he was furious or numb im sorry well that happens when you are supposed to pick up an untrained asset who tells you to lose your tails because hes hacked the camera system following you and you and your team cant subdue one exagent and you lose your asset his voice rose in anger im sorry i know you are doing this for your kid but hell you cant do this sam youre in my custody august if you want your job back listen to me i think bringing you in will get me my job back it wont because something inside special projects is broken and you know it august frowned at me you know special projects has been compromised either you have a mole or your communications or networks are being monitored weve found nothing jack ming in his old new york hacker days his specialty was getting computer systems as in printers to send him information secretly tiny little sneaky bits of code that hide in other programs and harvest him what he needs im pretty sure thats exactly what he wrote for nine suns and theyve been using these software spies to extort and control people in key positions in business and in government august rubbed at his chin every traitor weve arrested since lucy they claimed they were blackmailed into doing this we didnt believe them either your systems have been compromised or someone else has turned bad hell august is not a big cusser august youre not the traitor are you no he raised an eyebrow well i said i had to ask august tapped his foot against the concrete those women you killed what do you know about them they were accused murderers a sister act who got a fresh start and new names a man named ray brewster hid them and used them as hit women for hire the guy i killed in new jersey who kidnapped jack mings mom i think he might have worked for brewster as well someone who gives murderers and psychopaths fresh ids and a job as hired muscle do you know ray brewster no august shook his head do you know the name lindsay partridge no shes your redhaired sidekick i waited exforger and counterfeiter cia informant we paid her off well then two years ago she vanished she gives people new identities now novem soles has her kid too part of her file is locked i cant open it even with a special projects access whats her secret i dont know i said who are these bastards one of them is a sex slaver named yaakov zviman he seems to have moved into extortion as his mainstay but hes the one who put the million dollars on milas head i think hes a power in the organization you ever hear of him no i think that whatever information jack ming has relates to whatever zvimans doing now for nine suns maybe its the list of people that they control we get that we cut off a major source of information for them the kind of programs ming wrote would give nine suns power over people who could help them profit august ran a hand through his blond hair have you heard of associated languages school yeah the owners of the property where mrs ming was taken old abandoned house in morris county august stood and began to pace by the cases of beer this fine language school also employs one of the dead women meggie or lizzie pearson those were their real names lizzie struck me as a person who would not work well with others so theyre nine suns since they were trying to capture me and i was nine suns errand boy i think not i believe they are working for someone else who wants to collect the money on mila they talked about putting me in a cage and extracting information from me apparently kidnapping and interrogation were their specialties so we have nine suns after jack ming and then a third party and we dont know how and even if theyre connected we do not i would love to have access to special projects files to see what we have on the women but im supposed to go back to langley next week and ill be given a janitorial job or maybe fry cook in the cafeteria thats honest work nothing wrong with it august said my career is gone sam i considered was your boss eager to get rid of you not particularly but today was a massive screwup a head had to roll and it wasnt going to be his although he could survive the bullet he could survive anything why hes retired officially just brought back inside a couple of months ago to stiffen our backs and straighten our spines very old school very much concerned about the honor of the company protecting its reputation his name is braun did you ever meet him no he retired before our time and came back after after you left special projects if you came back to him with new information would he listen maybe is there anyone inside who would help you august sat back down on the cases of heineken he looked more tired and frazzled than id ever seen him maybe griffith yeah i kicked him kind of hard and i winged the other guy in the leg is he okay yes and you tried to murder ming in front of him he shook his head why am i talking to you sam were done we have to be done i have to rebuild my career im nothing without the company and yes i know thats pathetic you dont have to tell me i hope you find your kid more than anything i hope that but i dont see how i can help you i can give you jack ming what i can give you jack ming august stood up from the beer cases then he sat back down but youre going to kill him yes i am i said and then im going to give him to you the last minute bar manhattan mila watched the man sitting at the corner table on the security camera she had never seen him before he ordered a small appetizer of tapas slowly finished his pint of lager do you know this man she asked leonie leonie leaned over and studied the face on the camera no i havent seen him before mila had stepped back from the monitor and watched leonie the lay of her gaze the set of her shoulders the curve of her mouth i guess sam was wrong then they watched the man in the corner get up and leave money for his tab and walk out i dont think sam is wrong about much leonie said so what is your plan mila said you and sam get to save your babies and live an exciting ontherun version of the brady bunch im quite sure ill never see sam again when this is done does that make you happy sam is only a friend i am his boss that is all then i guess youll never know what youre missing that parkour running does hone a body and hes been alone for so long poor thing alone i am sure you are not for long ever mila seemed to stumble over her english your jealousy translates clearly do not confuse jealousy with concern for a friend i dont think im confusing anything sweetie mila gave a thin smile do you know what i like about sam he is clueless he does not know he is attractive he does not think about it and if you told him he is handsome he thinks you are just being nice he is down on himself right now because he blames himself for daniel being in danger he loved lucy very much and he doesnt trust his instincts now about women he does not know he is a really good guy so it is easy to take advantage of him right now leonie was silent for ten long seconds hes not a fool and im not taking advantage of him i am sorry for what you are suffering your child being taken i would not be myself the sympathy seemed to take leonie aback i understand you want to help us mila thank you im not exactly myself at the moment and maybe wed get along fine under other circumstances but sam and i have to do what were told and you will forgive me if the involvement of others makes me nervous milas phone vibrated in her pocket she gave leonie a searching glance and then she answered her phone she listened this is a private call sorry do you mind leonie got up from the monitor i need a cigarette anyway she retrieved her pack from the desk ill be back in a minute leonie walked downstairs the bar was full people milling about drinking the music stopped she stepped into the warm damp of the humid evening and lit her cigarette the first two drags calmed her nerves the man whod sat in the corner of the bar now stood on the corner of the street watching her did mila have a camera on the front of the bar she assumed there must be one these people whatever mila and sam were were as organized as nine suns she made a show of her pack being empty shrugged in annoyance and then she turned and walked in the opposite direction from the man she turned left at the light and walked down to the next corner she stopped inside a store and bought a fresh pack of cigarettes then she stepped outside and fished one out and made a show of patting her pocket the man she knew as ray brewster stepped forward offered her a light she glanced behind her scared to see if mila was following her he said you look well lindsay id like to say ive missed you but i dont care to start a chat with a lie not when we need each other why are you here she managed to keep her voice steady two reasons she waited first when you and your boyfriend kill jack ming i want whatever evidence ming has on the nine suns thats not possible you make it possible i cant steal it i need it to ransom my child then you are going to tell me where the exchange happens with nine suns i want to know why do you want it she drew hard on the cigarette have you switched sides no sweetheart i have just the one side mine as always i cant no lindsay you will she looked down the sidewalk again no sign of mila and the other reason have you seen a woman named mila shes connected to capra why i want her leonie drew on her cigarette one problem i can make go away she thought two words shes upstairs and mila would cease to be trouble she knew ray brewster well enough that smarmy bitch would be as good as taken or dead as soon as she stepped outside the last minute but she knew she didnt want to be that person she didnt want to be a traitor to sam no matter the acid dislike she felt for mila it gave her a momentary pleasure to deny him i dont know any mila any woman who capra works with shes moldovan so shed speak with an eastern european accent shes petite pretty vicious no hes not brought his friends around me i have to go now this is my phone number he recited a number and she repeated it back to him you get me that evidence and you give me mila if she shows up you and your child if you get taylor back will be safe from every threat her skin went cold you know about taylor did you think you could hide from me really thats awfully selfconfident why did you leave me alone then the last two years i didnt need you lindsay now i do and if you dont do what i say exactly then i will make taylor go away and leonie jones will never see her child again she wished she could stub the lit cigarette into his eye and the line to blackmail me forms here youre such an asshole cant you just leave me alone after what you did no sweetheart i wanted you to feel nice and happy and secure until i could take it away from you nine suns just beat me to the punch she blew smoke into his face you still forging identities passports caring relationships he laughed really the last is what youre best at faking thats a compliment from the biggest fraud of all you cant wound me you already cut out my heart lindsay and now ive got the knife at yours she smoked in silence he tipped her chin toward him what they know i know you really should give up smoking sweetheart when this is all done youll be the last one standing alongside me and then you can go take your fake self and live your fake life he turned and he walked away from her she finished her cigarette horrible habit shed stopped now twice before and the thought brought her to tears get a grip she told herself she went back into the store bought some chocolate m ampms and walked back to the bar mila was off the phone and on the computer where did you go i was out of smokes she held up the candy from the store and i thought id make a peace offering isnt chocolate the universal language yes mila said i believe it is manhattan the watcher stood surveying the manhattan skyline he had spent the past twenty hours trying to suck every bit of information he could out of the extortion network before jack ming shut it down if they were unable to kill ming and retrieve his evidence he wanted to sell to the cia then the watcher was going to lose his entire power base among the nine and he would have to rebuild it would be all right he had rebuilt before after mila stole most of his money hed fought and scrabbled his way back but to lose the information feeds that had given him gold from wall street firms from the white house from congress from the british parliament from a good percentage of the fortune that would be devastating the fearsome crime rings of the twentieth century the mafia the yakuza the colombian drug lords the mexican cartels had never had their own spies their own conduits to the highest powers in the land this information had been oxygen to the blood of nine suns knowledge that let them smuggle with impunity keep the police at bay in a dozen countries sell secrets to government and competitors and in turn own those buyers by virtue of their crimes the extortion network that jack mings software made possible had netted them tens of millions of dollars worth of information in a matter of months and the watcher needed to find something to replace that power base and he had an idea his phone rang and he answered this is jack ming the voice said my favorite person the watcher replied i want to make a deal with you with me i doubt that no i do you wanted the notebook ill give you the notebook ill sell it to you i do not believe you i cant sell it to anyone else heres what we do you deposit ten million in an account i provide when i have the money i will call you and tell you where to find the notebook how can i trust you conduct a poll im pretty sure ill be seen as more trustworthy than you look this is the deal if you dont want it why would you deal with us when we tried to kill you not to be overly blunt i will keep a few choice pages for insurance if anything happens to me they come to immediate light you could blackmail me again you could kill me again thats true i thought you preferred to deal with the authorities they lost my trust trust so fleeting all right jack where would you like to meet jack hesitated well do it all by phone are you going to fax me the notebook jack no then we will have to meet and have your bitch sam capra show up and throw me off a building no thanks arent you a smart lad and arent you a right bastard using his baby seriously had a chat with him did you i figure out things on my own asshole the notebook tells me a lot oh jack the watcher said i look at you and i realize i mishandled the entire situation i shouldnt have tried to get rid of you i should have offered you a job youre a smart smart kid im smart enough to know ive got your golden goose here i get my money you get your notebook and then we walk away you could have copied it and if anything happens to me a nice copy of it will show up in the cias mailbox along with a letter of explanation so you leave me alone and you have nothing to worry about so where shall we meet in central park in the ramble north of the bow bridge tomorrow at three when ive confirmed the money is safe in my account then ill give you the notebook a lot of faith for me you want your notebook dont you yes i do jack give me the bank account jack gave him the account for a swiss bank the watcher wrote it on the palm of his hand if youre one minute late or i dont like the look of anything there im gone and ill just drive by langley and toss the notebook on their front porch he hung up the watcher clicked off his phone most interesting that unexpected either jack ming had decided to bait a trap with himself or hed decided that his need for money so he could vanish trumped all so should he have sam capra there to kill him if capra knew that someone from nine suns was meeting jack ming he might try to seize him as a hostage to guarantee his sons release but he wouldnt take the risk that was the beauty of owning a child this way the parent would never be able to cut the strings jack ming clicked off the phone he sat on the edge of his bed back in his mothers apartment it was the last place he thought that anyone would look for him his mother was dead and his father was gone and now he was truly alone in the world he walked to his mothers room it was so spare so absent of her to be the place where she spent so much time he had wept for his father for days for weeks but he could summon nothing for his mother except a promise im sorry i got you killed im going to kill them for you mom it would be so unexpected he thought hackers hid in the shadows they did not face threats in person they lurked they moved the intangible data they did not cause bloodshed well he was done with hacking tomorrow he would either die or he would kill he didnt much care if he never saw a computer again he had an identity and he could get a new one ricki could help him again she had the contacts he wanted to cry for his mother but he couldnt maybe later he picked up his cell phone and he dialed amsterdam it was very late there actually early the next morning ja she sounded sleepy ricki its jack oh my god where are you it doesnt matter i just want you to know that i want to thank you for helping me what was he going to say to her my mom died and well youre the only friend i have left there wasnt much to say about him and his mom ricki started to cry im sorry im sorry what they came after you were gone they came and they made me tell them where you went and they wanted to know what you knew about them im sorry they said they would kill me if i didnt talk its okay its okay are you all right not really they they took over my business i have to work for them now or theyll kill me theyre taking all the money oh ricki oh god im so sorry she sounded as though she might cry but she didnt i dont know what to do listen tomorrow i will either be dead or ill have the money to vanish forever do you want to vanish with me what go off with you it that is just stupid and crazy i like you that much jack said im sorry i waited until now to tell you ricki gave what sounded like a halfsob halflaugh why would you trust me not to tell them they own me now because well i dont know i do trust you do you want to come with me i would have to walk away from everything she said its not yours any more she sniffed true yes jack i think i would like a new start okay i kind of love you a little i know ive known for a while i love you a little too his chest made a slight lurch okay thats good then well dont die now she said she started crying again i wont i wont ill call you back when i have the money and ill tell you where to go if i dont call you figure out some way to get out from under these people just walk away if you have to ricki you dont want any part of them i know im going to mail you a key to a locker it has a copy of the notebook if i die then its yours and you can do with it what you want if youre too afraid of nine suns then give them the key and theyll burn it and ill already be dead so i wont care or come to new york and get it yourself and give it to the police or to the fbi or sell it to the brits or the french i wouldnt deal with the cia but if youre okay then ill be gone when the key gets here it wont matter if im okay ill have the copy with me you just be ready to get on a plane okay i wish i was there with you i do too ill call you tomorrow night im going to be an optimist and pack my bag all right i love you the three hardest the three easiest words to say i love you too he hung up if ricki had kept her mouth shut his mother might be alive but ricki would be dead he couldnt know how it would have turned out and he couldnt hold it against her if someone had said in his senior year of college he would get caught hacking cause his father to have a heart attack dodge arrest hide out in holland and fall for a senegalese movie pirate well it wouldnt have ranked very likely in his mind welcome to life life something so sweet something worth fighting for he had to get ready for tomorrow he didnt have his gun any more and he didnt know where he could get another one you had to get close to hand over a notebook a hand had to reach out to you his mother wasnt a great cook but shed loved having a gourmet kitchen in a drawer he found a pearlhandled chopping cleaver he liked the unexpected the last minute manhattan the bar was closed mila had vanished into whatever back corner of the night she lived i was exhausted as i walked up to the apartment and reset the bars alarm system leonie sat at her computer i couldnt be on a computer so much i sort of hated them where have you been leonie said im not going to tell you but its going to get us our kids back i said she looked at me and she said all right i went into the bedroom i fell onto the bed bad day broken arm missed the target didnt get my son back exhaustion surged through me like a fever we all looked at that man in the bar you thought was suspicious he stayed another hour and ate some tapas and he left so maybe he was just a nobody i said i know your name was lindsay partridge once she sat on the beds edge her back to me i reached over and touched her shoulder and who told you that someone in special projects the cia has a file on you you know what i dont miss partridge family or partridge in a pear tree jokes i dont miss those at all i think id still like to call you leonie thats fine thats my name now the cia file on you has sections that are locked i cant imagine why im just a soccer momwannabe whos good with computers id really like to know why you ran i needed a change brewster has to be deep inside the cia or some group the cia helps you were given a lot of money yes to hide people off the books yes that isnt in your file so im told so your file is about work you did for the cia or for brewster on behalf of the cia she rubbed at her face i think its safe to say he did favors for the cia i didnt say anything to this she had done dirty work and doing it for ray brewster meant like me she was a cia dirty secret i felt her back tremble under my fingers you went and talked to your friend august yes he got relieved of duty weve declared a temporary truce so you can find jack ming yes were not going to be able to find him theyre going to kill our kids listen to me as long as were chasing him they have every reason to keep taylor and daniel alive she seemed to decide not to cry but i could feel the shudder under her skin the tenseness and i rubbed her upper back with my fingertips onearmed man gives massage she said house special i said i should be tending to you youre the one went off a building i dont make a habit of that i said i dropped my hand from her back she looked over her shoulder at me if taylor dies my life is over done i will have nothing dont talk that way its true it only feels true but there would be nothing left for me revenge if they hurt the kids i couldnt bring myself to say kill then i am going to hurt them like theyve never seen revenge isnt a reason to live mila once told me revenge is underrated she might be right i dont think i could kill someone unless it was for taylor leonie stayed on the edge of the bed i lay on my back well if someones about to kill me and you can stop it feel free she laughed not really a laugh but a cross between a sigh and a smile all right deal even if jack ming is operating under a different name he needs help resources he cant access money in his name or his mothers right now im sure august froze those accounts so who are his friends who will he turn to thats where we need to go yes she said so i checked his facebook page not as jack ming but back in holland as jin ming he only had ten friends on it i imagine posing as a chinese student he decided to keep a very low profile ten is a nice workable number now in holland hes wanted for questioning about the death of that man in the hospital so it would have to be a good friend i waited so i got into his university records again he had a majority of his classes with two of his friends a dutch kid and a chinese kid i checked their university email accounts and there was no sign that jack has contacted them but i found a photo of jack with one of them on facebook and so i looked at all the photos of jack on facebook the majority of the photos where he is tagged on facebook belong to a girl named frederique diagne called ricki for short shes from senegal but lives in amsterdam he is tagged in fourteen of her photos not in any others girlfriend hard to say the most recent photo is from five months ago they might have had a falling out i asked around my hacker network and two of the guys told me theres a prominent female copyright pirate in amsterdam from senegal her hacker code name is rttavi what does that mean rikkitikkitavi its a kipling story about a mongoose that kills cobras i remembered it now you think this ricki is rttavi yes so i paid a guy to get into her phone log she got a call about an hour ago from new york jack it seems a distinct possibility so i checked the line that called her it has only called four numbers she showed them to me written large on a legal pad with a black marker one of those is augusts cell phone and this is the main number for central park conservancy the other two rickis phone in amsterdam and an unknown you cant trace it no the last number is israeli i havent been able to access a call log for it israel zviman was from israel but why would jack ming be calling the people who got his mother killed because he wanted to find them and kill them himself do you want to call ming she asked me and what apologize i stared at the israeli phone number well i could think of one good reason but it was suicide for him alone to try and take them on it fascinates me that hes calling central park why do you call an info line maybe to get their hours or to find out if there are events going in a certain section of the park you think hes meeting someone there yes its open its crowded he might feel comfortable meeting there to do what i dont know but i do know what hes actually going to do tomorrow he doesnt know it yet but i do i took a screen capture from the security monitor tape of the man in the corner august didnt have a phone of his own in special projects you are only allowed to have a phone that can be monitored by the group and hed said hed surrendered his to braun unfair maybe but you give up a certain expectation of privacy when you do this work if he had his own phone then i could send this to him tomorrow hed get one id send it then i stood and i winced my body hurt and i didnt want leonie thinking much more about this phone number your arm is hurting let me get you a pain pill i cant be fuzzy i have to be ready it wont make you fuzzy for tonight here i grudgingly took the pill swallowed it with cold water you rest i stripped out of my clothes put on pajama pants i dug from a bureau lay on the bed i closed my eyes i thought she would show more reaction when i knew her real name but what really did it matter when our children were in danger i looked through the bedroom door and she sat at the computer desk looking at her picture of taylor the wornwithlove picture i closed my eyes again darkness fell on me leonie awoke me when she slid into bed next to me i raised my head up with a start is this okay she asked i can sleep on the couch no its fine i lay back down sam what i opened my eyes i must have bruises going to the bone i thought granules of sand had been driven past my clothes into my skin leonies face was close to mine i blinked hazy with sleep the pain wasnt so bad the pill must have taken off the edge i feel sorry for you she said softly i dont do pity i hate it i got it from every kid who felt bad for me always being the new kid in school the new american who couldnt decipher the slurs or the namecalling in the native tongue well dont you havent even gotten to hold your child i stared past her into the darkness my skin itched under the cast probably along the stretch of arm where daniel should rest when i did get to hold him time will come i said yes i want that for you more than anything it is the best feeling ever nothing matches it for love for terror for hope that sounds like a slogan for parenting and you and i can be the poster children for single parents in the dim light from the streets glow i smiled i shouldnt be on anyones poster she lay close but not pressing against me for a minute the only sound was our breath in the room the soft grind of the air conditioner the distant murmur of the city i turned my head to say something i dont remember what and she kissed me softly then more insistently her mouth hungry nipping at my lips the kiss grew deepened her tongue tracing a delicious path the first time was from fear and stress what was this i was half dead but i felt my blood stir i tasted salt the sting of her tears i didnt mean to make you cry i said i could smell toothpaste on her breath shed brushed her teeth before she came to me you didnt why are you alone with a child i wanted to be alone i never believe that no one wants to be alone like that her hands had moved to my chest her fingernails moved along my skin and my breath nearly left me you dont have to use your arm you know ill do the work she kissed me again how sore are you the correct answer was very but i said not a bit probably people whose kids are in mortal danger shouldnt be having sex together were wrecks its not like this moment could bring intimacy or grace but there was none of that only an exhausting fierce rawness of energy and anger and fury at one point her atop me and deep in her pleasure she hammered at my shoulders forgetting in the dark that i was a bruised beast it was pain and glory all at once that or she decided to fake an orgasm and beat the snot out of me at the same time she collapsed on me when we were both spent and her body was warm and wonderful and rich lying against mine silence only broken by breathing i nuzzled her hair that was good she breathed yes very for me i said and very for me she cupped my face in her hands we have to get them back sam we cant fail i know i know we will tell me what youre planning no i cant why because if i do youll say no dont dont you trust me her breath seeped against my throat her nails traveled my chest yes so tell me tomorrow jack ming goes down and our kids are going to be okay all right she lay next to me not cuddling but lying there present our breath close together i suspected she wanted to beat me to a pulp in her trembling anger but she needed me functioning so she let me keep my secrets while she kept all her own i got up while she slept put on my clothes despite my exhaustion and slipped out into the night the last minute bar manhattan upstairs sams phone buzzing woke leonie she groped across the empty bed for him he was gone she sat up and grabbed for the phone yes leonie let me speak to sam she didnt know this voice it was the phone anna tremaine gave them as the lifeline to nine suns to get their instructions but it was not anna on the phone a mans voice crisp and precise and cold hes hes not here where is he i dont know i was asleep who is this this is the man who can have your kid killed with one phone call please please dont i presume you are capable of taking a message yes tell sam i will call back in one hour i am not happy that he is not near this phone what if i was calling him to tell him that i knew where jack ming was then id go kill ming she said we already know where hes going to be tomorrow central park central park doesnt quite narrow it down does it were finding out where i promise yes i believe you would youre an excellent mother you just saved your child from unnecessary suffering a flash of horror danced through her ill call back in an hour and sam better have a good reason for his absence the phone went off with a click ming apartment east th street the flame burst up from the pile of garbage bags across the street drawing the night doorman out onto the sidewalk and hurrying over to the sudden sputtering fire he did not see me slip inside the lobby while his back was turned while he had a cell phone pressed to his ear to summon the fire department i spent six months of naughty teen years in jakarta kids there used to burn trash for fun and they were most clever about how to torch with efficiency i took the stairs up to the mings apartment floor i picked the lock to the apartment it was still and dark and airless but i could smell the odor of antiseptic cream and muscle rub i turned on a light and jack ming lay huddled on the couch curled up into a fetal position i thought he would have been in the bedroom jack i said quietly i moved toward him his eyelids snapped open no one sleeps that great when theyre on the run trust me i know and a scream formed on his mouth he bolted from me grabbed a ceramic tray off the coffee table threw it at me i dodged it im not here to hurt you i said calmly from under the couch cushion he pulled out a pearlhandled cleaver im not armed i said i just want to talk to you he charged at me and he swung it at me twice the blade made a sharp hiss in the air desperation and fear colored his face he had no skill i wasnt really comfortable fighting him with an edged weapon onehanded so i kicked him hard against the wall and then slammed my foot against the wrist holding the cleaver pinning his hand to the wall i am not here to hurt you i am here to talk to you i dont believe you i would have kicked you in the throat just now and broken your windpipe i said i pressed harder with my foot he winced and the cleaver clattered to the floor i am not here to hurt you i am here to talk to you i said again im going to let you go now so we can talk like adults i have a proposition for you and i released his wrist as a precaution i put my heel on the cleavers blade he smacked a punch against my arms cast and yes that did indeed hurt a lot i grabbed him by the neck jack please i was careful not to hurt him he grew still may we talk after a long moment he nodded can we go sit down in there and talk like two adults he couldnt keep the surprise off his face he sat on the couch i sat on the leather ottoman next to it i left the cleaver on the floor but i was between it and him well he said you dont appear to be killing me yet i have decided that even though ive been told to kill you that is not how i am going to get my son back he stared at me his mouth working jack breathe its okay how how did you find me i got hurt in the fall i figured you did too and you lost your knapsack you were back accessing your computer very quickly using remote software hard to download and install that on a coffee shop or library computer and if i was hurt id run home no one would think you would come back here but you could mend here and have a computer and call people who might help you and have a nice private conversation and probably have an easier time accessing your mothers bank accounts and such it was worth a try jack said nothing im sorry about today i said i know i scared you i do not accept your apology all right i am very mindful that you could have shot me in that hallway rather than shooting the lock on the door he rubbed his palms on his knees the only way nine suns is going to leave you alone is if we convince them that you are dead they have to believe youre gone for good for you to have a life and for me to get my son back now if we can make them think youre dead then we both have a chance he shook his head i dont believe you do you believe they have my kid yes you said that theres something in the notebook about my son yes what is it please where he was born how much the doctor was paid how much the forged documents cost to get him an american birth certificate who has him now someone with the initials at anna tremaine anything else he bit his lip for a moment considering no where is the notebook in a safe place and i dont care if were new best friends now im not telling you i want you to go to your computers browser and enter in a web address he didnt move go ahead i want to show you something slowly he got up and went into his fathers study he sat at the computer i gave him the url the prompt then asked for a password he looked at me and i gave it to him he typed the webcams screen opened lucy lay in her eternal bed hooked to wires and tubes and a computer whose uncaring graphs and bars showed her lungs still breathed her heart still pumped you and i have nothing in common i said except nine suns has destroyed our families that is my wife they took her and they made her into a person i never knew and then they put a bullet in her brain now they have my son he is only a few months old i have never seen him in person never held him i pulled the photo from my wallet and i handed it to jack he looked at it wordlessly then he gave it back to me your mother was killed by a stray bullet when i fought the guy who kidnapped her if i could have saved her i would have only to get her to help you find me no did i kill the men from the cia who were supposed to protect you i knocked them out of the fight but i didnt kill them did i shoot down anyone who got in my way while i was chasing you and what you want a good citizen medal i held your mothers hand while she died jack she asked me to help you i had to lie to her then and say i would help you i dont want it to be a lie jack closed the browser window lucy vanished why would you risk your babys life to protect me because i no longer believe theyre just going to hand me my child i know too much im too big a threat to them they have to be destroyed and youre the guy who can bring them down the notebook doesnt contain the names and addresses of nine suns it gave me one phone number for one of them the person who set up this extortion network it mostly just names people that theyre using people theyve spied on using your software yes wouldnt it be nice if we could turn that around on them jack said what do you mean do to them what they did to these people spy on them using your code jack ming got up from the desk i followed him into the living room he picked up the cleaver off the floor and i tensed but he went into the kitchen and he set it on the granite counter top and who gets the information you when i get my son back im done if i dont then i send them to hell however long it takes i crossed my arms i know you must think august holdwine is a screwup but hes not you can trust him and hes being moved back to langley out of the group that was supposed to protect you theyve been dirtied but hes clean jack ming blinked at me and i didnt blame him not trusting me so cards on the table so to speak i know you called ricki diagne in amsterdam maybe for help maybe because shes someone special to you if you dont trust the cia there is another group of people who could hide you think of them as the flip side of nine suns my friend mila works for them and i think they could hide you and ricki too if you want just about anywhere in the world especially if you could help them spy on nine suns your friends are the round table yes are they in the notebook theres reference to them that made me uneasy it could mean someone inside the round table had been compromised maybe into giving up secrets he shook his head round table nine suns who the hell comes up with these names every group needs a mythology the round table was full of knights who wanted to do good nine suns is from an old chinese legend about the near destruction of the world the names say a lot about each side i tried again can i please see the notebook no you cant i think you can understand that i need to keep a trump card to myself the urge to ransack the apartment and find it was strong but he needed to trust me so i nodded the cell phone in my pocket rang i answered it leonie sam nine suns just called on the iphone anna gave you they want to talk to you and they want to know where you are all right im on my way back where are you i needed some air sorry you couldnt get that here with me just a dash of bitter im on my way i turned off the phone theyre calling me with instructions on your meeting i suspect so i can ambush you jacks throat worked so how do we do this youre in you made your point plus what if i say no you kill me then right you have no choice i always have a choice so do you i want them taken down i cant do it alone i know that will you trust august i could tell it wasnt an easy decision but after thirty seconds jack said all right fine sit down heres what we do the last minute bar manhattan youre going to kill jack ming the mans voice was slightly accented israeli i felt sure this was zviman the man whod nearly killed mila who she had emasculated and enraged the man responsible for the horror that milas sister endured the man ultimately responsible for nellys death at central park in the ramble its heavily wooded not one of the busiest sections this afternoon a bit before three all right i said he and i are going to meet north of bow bridge it will be crowded he wont be willing to step into any more private areas of the park so he has to go down without drawing attention youre not from here are you i cant kill a guy by bow bridge and not have it go noticed look youve drawn him to the park you get whatever youre buying from him and then hes my problem im not funneling him money hes dead before then and then i get what hes carrying which meant he would want to see the notebook kill him quietly break his neck or use a knife the man i believed to be zviman said dont think for a second you can skimp on the job i dont ever think for a second i said i clicked off the phone leonie lay on the bed did he tell you what to do yes but youre working a scam dont bother to lie yes all right she said and i could hear the tone of surrender in her voice what do you want me to do the ramble central park manhattan a guy with a broken arm in a fiberglass cast just doesnt look threatening ted bundy and buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs used arm casts as camouflage to lure in women to help them so they could commit abduction then they turned the casts into weapons of course they didnt actually have broken arms i did its hard enough to kill someone when youve got two good hands i was only going to get one chance i sat on a bench north of the beautiful ironbuilt bow bridge a book in hand a yankees cap pulled low over my head waiting i was on the edge of the ramble a dense wooded area planted by hand well over a century ago now mature woodland with a maze of walkways cut through its growth i saw at least four different passersby with binoculars and field guides this was a prime birding spot i also saw teenagers who looked like they might savor a bit of privacy but this stretch of park at least this afternoon wasnt quite as busy as the zoo or the playgrounds or the mall now and then a family milled by joggers jogged a pair of lovers leaned into each other walking hand in hand i still dont like to see couples nothing against them im all for love and commitment it just reminds me of what i thought i had and never truly did with lucy i thought we would grow old together i thought we would be grandparents together daniel bringing us his own children to spoil and love we should have had years to spend in parks tossing crumbs hearing the lull of the breeze in the trees watching the sunlight shift its mosaic on the grass now i sat alone on a park bench waiting to murder someone my orders were explicit when the nine suns contact i knew it was probably zviman but i wasnt going to admit to him i knew who he was walked away from jack ming i would intercept and kill ming i didnt believe for a second that mings bank account would go unhacked nine suns wasnt going to give him ten million dollars the day was grayish clouds grappling with sun for a momentary dominance i sat with my sunglasses and my book i checked my watch time on the under side of the bench i groped and my fingers found tape i pulled the tape free in my hand was an earpiece i thumbed it into place hello sam the voice slipped into my ear i said nothing cat got your tongue no i just have nothing to say to you i put my gaze back to my book i have taken precautions if i do not call in to a number and give a correct passcode your son dies dont decide you can kill both ming and me or take me hostage for your son i can follow orders i played with your son the other day zviman said my blood went cold hes very responsive for a child i dont know a lot about babies but your little lad looks you in the eye i enjoyed getting to hold him wordless rage i know youll do a firstrate job then youll get to see your son i hope i dont cry family reunions make me tearful i saw a man move from the walkway to a dense copse of black locust trees a good thirty feet off the path he stood in their shade and produced a smartphone from his pocket the blond mohawk was a trimmed ghostly strip of hair i knew his face from milas description it was zviman he didnt walk funny though i didnt look at him but i felt quite sure he looked at me i kept scanning the approaches then i saw jack ming dressed in jeans and a giants windbreaker and a giants baseball cap he was holding the red notebook in his left hand and had his right hand in his pocket the stiletto i had hidden in my cast felt heavy the handle of the blade id cut down to conceal it rubbed against my wrist bertrand has an interesting collection of knives at the last minute here he comes i said i see him zviman said look at him he thinks hes tough i wonder how he thinks he got tough sitting at a keyboard all day the hatred in his voice was thick i glanced around two people binoculars up looking the opposite way focused on their birding a couple and a single man heading toward bow bridge a young woman ipodded lost in her music rather than birdsong and park noise ming had his back to me jack ming stopped and glanced around then he looked right at zviman and he walked to the tree i waited the ramble central park manhattan courtesy of zvimans earpiece i could hear the conversation hello jack lets set the conditions if i dont come back from this meeting a friend calls the police and gives them your description he already took your photo with a telescopic lens jacks voice was steady i think youd have to shave off that velcro strip on your head and wear a wig to make it out of the city jack please dont insult me zvimans voice was kind im a businessman im here to make a trade we both end up happy he shrugged look im not unmindful you wrote the code that let us steal the secrets i respect that what youre getting could be considered a fair cut move the money zviman held up his smartphone so jack could see its screen he keyed in the account transfer code and kept the phone raised so jack could see the blue progress bar fill as the dollars and cents jumped from an account in the caymans into a swiss account silence between them done check it for yourself if you like zviman said at the word done i stood jack ming still had his back to me i moved forward silently across the grass weaving in between the trees my hand on the hidden stiletto handle in the cast jack brought a cell phone up from under the red notebook he kept his right hand in his pocket no one watching would like that hed apparently preset the phones browser to his bank account and he hit a refresh button i kept approaching keeping the center of his shoulders as my axis of approach i moved quickly and quietly across the damp grass the page isnt loading jack said a tinge of nervous frustration in his voice the internet so unreliable he thumbed a button again still locked up im not giving you the notebook until the moneys in my balance zviman smiled with infinite patience thats fair i was twenty seconds away youre trying to cheat me jack said and he pulled the gun from the pocket of the windbreaker i was still ten feet behind him but now running at full force no attempt at stealth jack jabbed the gun toward zviman as though counting on his targets own flesh to muffle the sound of the shot zviman jumped back wrenching jacks arm up and by then i slammed my cast into the side of jacks neck he staggered and i yanked him backward away from zviman and he tried to aim the gun at me i folded his elbow back toward him and he made a little mewling protest as the guns barrel touched his stomach he bent and i got a hand on the trigger and the shot wasnt as loud as it could have been i moved the gun to the chest and pulled the trigger again and he fell to his side two small bright blossoms of blood on his shirt he gave a hard wet cough of red and then he lay still among the trees i pulled him back against the trunk of the tree and zipped up the giants windbreaker to cover the blood make it look like hes sitting he wont draw attention that way zviman moved away from me staring at jack the stiletto drop it what i was trying to raise and settle jacks head so it didnt loll and i couldnt get the angle right you didnt need the knife but youre not getting armed into a car with me i dropped the stiletto to the ground kicked it behind the tree hey hey a tall black man with a birding book and binoculars had wandered closer to us directing his shout to a bird in a distant tree but he seemed absorbed in his lenses which were aimed in the sky above our head he could notice jack or us at any moment and i heard zviman suck in a hiss of breath go walk now before he sees the blood i used my sleeve to wipe jacks mouth blood away zviman knelt picked up jacks phone and the red notebook it was one of those classic leathercovered ones with an elastic band to keep it closed it was smaller than i thought it would be he started hurrying away from the body flipping the pages dont run i said to him keep walking normally he glanced back the tall black man still studied the sky then glanced at his birding book then at the treetops again zviman and i continued our steady walk where are the children i asked wait were not clear yet we cut across bow bridge silent with each other and headed down to the nd street transverse that sliced through the park zviman hurried to the street and raised his arm for a cab welldressed guy moneyed a cab stopped within thirty seconds releasing a pair of tourists clutching beatles memorabilia who looked like they intended to go pay tribute to john lennon over at strawberry fields new york luck we both got inside zviman gave the cabbie the address of a parking garage a dozen blocks away he raised a finger toward his lips like i was stupid enough to speak in front of a witness he flipped through the pages of the notebook shaking his head little bastard he said more than once little rotten bastard we got out of the cab he paid we took an elevator up to the ninth floor and i followed him to a black bmw sedan where is my son i will take you to him right now anna told us the children would be left at a church and we could collect them i dont know where the hell you are taking me i am taking you to your son mr capra and you can either get in the car or not your choice i got into the bmw he wheeled back toward the park driving with confidence and not a little verve he held on tight to the red notebook at the southeast edge of the park he pulled up to the curb leonie stood waiting on the sidewalk so far no distant cry of siren or ambulance she saw me in the passenger seat and she got into the back seat is he dead she asked hes dead practically killed himself zviman said he glanced back at leonie gave her a nakedly appraising look i wanted to say isnt that wasted on you but i kept my mouth shut he pulled away from the curb punched a button on his phone cleopatra i guessed it was his code to say all was well ming is dead i have the notebook and im bringing the happy parents to the nursery get the kids ready he clicked off the phone and then i call again in thirty minutes with a different passcode to let her know that you havent tried to hijack the car if she gets the least bit suspicious that youve betrayed me en route the kids will suffer guaranteed sit back and enjoy the ride behind me leonie made a noise in her throat zviman smiled at her in the rear view mirror all right mr capra ms jones lets go get your children dont move the tall black man said they could drive back by to see whats going on jack ming left his eyes half open he bought it he mumbled through closed mouth it helped that you pulled and died by your own weapon i think it worked yes he wants you dead and sometimes the eye sees mostly what it wants to see my name is bertrand im a friend of sams were going to get you to safety jack stayed still through his halfmast eyes he could see a woman standing behind bertrand holding a video camera when it looks like youre shooting a youtube video no one thinks you were actually shot bertrand reminded him the woman was a small pixiefaced type very pretty with big sunglasses shoved up to her dark hair ten twenty minutes passed a couple of people strolling by gave them curious glances but the presence of the woman shooting video answered unasked questions okay get up bertrand said we walk quickly the woman murmured to bertrand he couldnt quite hear what but her accent sounded russian or something bertrand said good luck and be careful he and bertrand headed one way the woman the other and if theyre watching us right now if this wasnt enough sam is a dead man jack thought and ive given them back what they wanted most and my mother died for nothing bertrand hurried him through the park they went in the opposite direction of zviman and sam toward belvedere castle and the th street transverse wait bertrand said wait jack thought his heart would explode suddenly scared that their ruse had been discovered a ford sedan pulled up next to them at the wheel august of the cia and in the back seat impossibly ricki we thought it best to get her to safety bertrand said but i didnt want you distracted by knowing she was close sorry we have a private jet jack hardly heard him he was in the back seat embracing ricki who kept covering his face with kisses safe she was safe the car pulled away bertrand gave a quick wave and vanished back into the park thank you thank you he said to august thank sam and his friends august said he thought of that crazy sam capra and his baby and jacks heart felt heavy jack were going to get you and ricki to langley youll be safe there and i understand you made a paper copy of the notebook yes he said but you cant have it not yet the car stopped august turned are you serious sam promised to give you me august jack said not the notebook he needs the original notebook to get his son back if he makes it back with his son you get the notebook if he doesnt get his son back then the copy i have is his to do with what he wants august stared think of it jack said as the map of sams revenge parking garage near central park mila put the camera in a bag in the back of the van she pulled off the dark wig shed worn under a stylish hat shook her sweaty hair free and pushed the black sunglasses back on her head now sam had forgotten for a moment that he worked for her he had forbidden her to come after them ridiculous he could not go off with a man as evil as zviman and expect to have an exchange go smoothly and she did not trust leonie and although sam had been clever enough to slough off her tracking chip the other night leonie was not the chip went into the pocket of the light jacket leonie wore that mila had lent her from the apartment over the last minute from the back of the van the same one she and bertrand had used to move out the corpses of the bodyguards what felt like a thousand days before when she and sam had pretended to be baby buyers she pulled out a gps device a slight red gleam showed her leonies position she could follow unseen at a distance she heard the footsteps behind her as she shut the door she turned and the taser needles hit her shocking her then a tall spare man stepped forward and closed a damp cloth over her face the man who sat at the last minute the man sam thought suspicious youre my milliondollar baby mila he said to her before the darkness closed in braun handcuffed mila all with the van doors closed he heard the laughter of children a family walking past the van as he worked he made sure she was secure he had no intention of underestimating her he relieved her of the knife in her boot and the gun at the small of her back he bound her feet with rope he examined the gps reader clever either lindsay or capra were tagged and mila was going to follow them he could see that they were now off manhattan heading north into westchester county a cold tingle touched his spine no surely not surely zviman was not taking them there he took the keys from her pocket he opened up his phone he sent a text message to the email address where the reward had been posted i have your mila and i want to collect the million caught her trying to help your friends in the car may i make your day and bring her to you on highway north we headed north and east leaving the city well behind cutting up past irvington heading on north i wondered where we were headed peekskill albany the catskills a silence filled the car because zviman said no talking zviman put on the satellite radio and tuned it to the alternative classics of the eighties he even sang very softly under his breath barely audible the cars elvis costello and god help us katrina and the waves i did not trust this man in a good mood no one spoke for an hour at least and as we passed newburgh i couldnt contain myself further where are our kids i said at a safe place zviman said ill take you there and then you may have this car to go where you please considering you killed a man in the park i wouldnt return to new york for a while im sure ms jones would like to get home to las vegas he sounded so calm so reasonable i felt like i was going to jump out of my skin youre probably thinking sam that youre surprised we struck you a deal very i wasnt thinking he wanted to let me out alive now i was going to have to fight my way out i felt sure and i didnt know how i was going to do that while holding a baby the obvious answer was leonie have her run to safety with the kids if at all possible and leave me to deal with zviman i dont think the cia will be offering you a job again zviman said now that you killed their prize asset of course they didnt see you kill him but youll be the prime suspect unless you could convince them that you werent trying to kill him but protect him from a danger within the cia i should update my resume i said and im not that good an actor to pull off that lie in fact with jack ming dead theyll be hunting for you if you gave them someone else as mings killer well you might be in the clear with them nice for you that would be for you and your son his voice was like a knife why are you so concerned about what happens to me we made a deal and i intend to stick to it what you think im going to kill you i think youre going to try that would undo all thats been done done to make you who you are sam zviman said youve been a longterm project for us you could still be of value to us weve watched you for years now weve been interested in you for a long time i stared at him he didnt look at me he almost smiled as he drove how could i have been a longterm project for a bunch of criminals that that doesnt even make sense i said of course it does he said we think long term youve been thinking in terms of hours days weeks how do i find my wife how do i get my son back small problems we think in terms of years you have gone from being a problem for us to becoming useful to us we were willing to sacrifice your usefulness because you could kill ming for us and he was a tremendous threat but no one can prove that you killed him you could still serve a purpose i had a sudden weird sense that i was a piece on a chess board not the king and some giant hand had flicked me around the squares i have no interest in being useful to you i want nothing to do with you i am getting my child and then we are done i never had the pleasure of meeting your wife he said but i think we all felt her loss this is to make you snap i thought he wants to worm under your skin get you off your game nothing but lies and distraction im not discussing my wife with you youre ready to quit the battlefield i stared straight ahead you said more than once i think when the company kept you in their private prison and you slept on stone floors and that the world believed that you were guilty that all you wanted was your old life back my old life is gone no its not not exactly he said now be quiet well have plenty to say when we get where were going along highway north leonie had wedged the cell phone in the calfhigh boot she wore she kept her eyes ahead occasionally glancing out the window trying not to appear as though she were listening to the awkward conversation to ray brewster she texted north on past kingston min ago she turned off the phone and she slid it into her boot the two men in the front seat locked in their discussion locked into their anger and mistrust did not notice braun drove aggressively and fast and closed the distance between himself and zvimans car to ten miles he glanced at the text message he was entirely sure of their destination all stories he thought come back to their beginning all circles must close zviman opened his phone as he had done every thirty minutes for the past two hours he pressed a number when anna answered he said pericles yes all is well he clicked shut the phone my fist slammed against him hard then i grabbed his head and pounded it against the steering wheel leonie screamed what are you doing what are you doing the bmw veered across its lanes narrowly missing a semi that laid on its horn like a stuttering war cry it is very hard to fight a man onehanded i know where were going i yelled at her he can be our hostage to get the kids then she understood leonie snaked her arm around zvimans throat and levered back he gagged and spat arching in the seat i hit the brake with my foot and levered up the parking brake the bmw howled and bucked but we stopped i took my good hand and pounded five blows into his sorry face it felt good he finally sagged beaten out oh god oh god leonie said panic jagged her voice listen to me i know where were going now the company that was a front for the sisters for the house in new jersey i looked them up they owned another retreat off this highway about five more miles up thats where were going and now we can trade the kids for him what if youre wrong leonie said oh god what if youre wrong i hauled the unconscious zviman into the back seat drive i told leonie i accessed the associated languages school website north about four miles then turn onto mountain bridge road if we drive up into a bunch of execs learning spanish im going to kill you sam her voice was a ragged broken shock ill kill myself i said associated languages school near the catskill forest preserve new york the building was a long low affair hidden in the dense growth of red cedars and sugar maples with a curving gravel driveway before it it looked like a grand mansion one perhaps left over from the catskills borscht belt days a shrunken resort a toy ignored and misplaced in the heavy forest the windows were boarded the grass around the building needed cutting abandoned like the house in new jersey or if not abandoned then not in use to help tourists conjugate their french verbs or contract out to business employees who needed to master spanish or farsi in between shuffleboard and trout fishing what do we do leonie said as she pulled up to the shuttered house we trade him for the kids and we get the hell out of here sam we did what they wanted but were done playing by their rules i said what about what he said about you being some kind of project ignore him i said no one emerged onto the porch i opened the car door got out put both hands on zvimans head one along the jaw the other on the throat honk the horn leonie hammered twice on the horn it sliced through the hush of the woods a moment later the door opened anna tremaine stepped out onto the porch she wore a creamcolored tshirt and green cargo pants she was pale and did not look quite so confident as she had a million years ago in las vegas she held a gun in her hand hello i said were here to pick up our kids my voice rose i didnt sound quite human so i see who else is inside anna there were no other cars parked in the lot she just stared at me i held zviman up answer me or i break his neck let him go now she raised the gun toward leonie no ill shoot her and ill snap his neck answer me whos inside no one she could be lying its what i would have said if there was a full house of guards okay drop the gun i dont believe you can break his neck she said with your arm in a cast its all in the fingers and the biceps baby and those are working just fine i strangled zviman more than a little he obligingly purpled and gagged for me i thought about what hed tried to do to mila and what hed done to nelly and it took control not to crush the life out of him okay sam lets talk my friend already maimed the son of a bitch i will be happy to finish him off please sam let him go anna said lets all calm down and i am done negotiating with you i screamed at her im not sure id ever quite heard my voice sound this way this is what is happening either you drop that gun right now or the next sound you hear is his vertebrae snapping this is the extent of our talking then silence the wind crying in the trees annas gaze went to zvimans purpling face and she dropped the gun i doubted he would have done the same for her leonie go get it i said leonie hurried up to the porch she took the gun eased it away from anna okay stay calm anna tried to smile at leonie leonie i want you to know ive taken good care of and leonie shot her in the heart a curl of smoke a flower of blood on annas tshirt and then she fell wordlessly leonie ran inside the house damn it i hammered a fist into zvimans face and dropped him to the gravel i tore into the house after her the house was old perhaps a grand country estate built back in the early s the entranceway was hardwoods with a large staircase leading up to a mezzanine on the second floor sheets covered most but not all of the furniture leonie ran searching through the adjoining rooms study library dining room kitchen leonie come back here i yelled at her hell if anna was lying we could be gunned down and she had the gun not me taylor she screamed i lost her then heard footsteps caroming up a flight of stairs i couldnt see i followed the noise through the kitchen a bottle was warming on a stove i saw a formula box on the kitchen island the remains of a grownups meal of steak salad and french fries a couple of soiled bibs a noise between grief and joy surged in my throat beyond the main room of the kitchen was a servants staircase she had already run up to the second floor daniel i screamed like he was going to answer but my mind was shuttered or sharpened im not sure which on the second floor i saw a hallway of rooms one of them open i ran into the doorway leonie standing at a crib picking up a baby holding the child close to her shoulder in a mothers embrace nearly weeping in relief i looked around the room there was only the one crib i bolted down the rest of the hallway opening every door next was an empty bedroom a womans clothes tossed on the foot of the bed no crib annas room the next was another room mens clothes littering the floor where zviman had stayed the other rooms were empty no no i screamed daniel i ran back to the first room leonie stood there holding the baby cradling its blond hair against her shirt blond hair i remembered the weathered picture handled with love the smiling darkhaired girl taylor was a bigger baby and brownhaired sam leonie said and her voice turned into a broken sob sam im sorry and she pointed the gun at me in the back of a van this was how mila thought it might end bound and handcuffed riding in a bounty hunters car to be delivered to her fate because zviman wanted her alive six had tried in the past three years and six had died two had come closest handcuffing her which she respected it was much quicker than tying her with rope or even plastic cuffs and binding her feet the first of the two were exira seized her outside the adrenaline bar the round tableowned drinking spot in london in the hipster hoxton neighborhood kenneth the manager of now sams bar in london saw her grabbed injected in the neck with a sedative and forced into an audis trunk kenneth had caught up the kidnappers on the a and shot the driver through the car window the car crashed and kenneth shot the other kidnapper then politely carried mila out of the trunk she was grateful of course but humiliated to be saved the second time was barely three weeks ago two filipinos trying their luck they had gotten her handcuffed in her apartment but before they bound her feet she had to put it bluntly kicked and stomped the two of them to death the unpleasantness made for a gruesome evening when all shed been in the mood for was a nice thai green curry for dinner a cold bottle of lager and watching emmerdale on tv but both times shed had to have kenneth slice the cuffs off her then of course she had to vanish and get an entirely new apartment under a different name on the other side of london very inconvenient it made her think those were the last two attempts word had spread among the shadowy vines that connected hired killers that she was very dangerous kill four people who come after you and everyone recalculates the value of hunting you down she blinked back slowly from the chloroformed unconsciousness her nose ached and her lips were thick where hed hit her she could see on the van floor splinters from the boxes where she and bertrand had loaded in the dead guards she and sam had killed when they got the best lead on anna tremaine and daniel she should have swept it more thoroughly why are you in new york sam had asked her when hed come to the last minute after leaving las vegas and she answered with a smile shoes he thought she was being mila joking parrying his question but what sam had not quite learned was that she spoke the truth more often than not she had indeed gotten shoes in new york custommade boots she eased the back of her heels closer to her hands on the left boot she maneuvered her fingertips into place and gave the heel a slight twist and push all at once like on a medicine bottle the right heel popped off embedded in it was a handcuff key a universal key especially made for her by a master locksmith who had once been the kgbs finest lock designer she freed the key from the heel with a finger flick and then repositioned herself gently trying to ease the key into the lock i can hear you you know the man driving the van said nice sleep i had bad dreams baby youre about to have much worse but then your dreams will end you have a poetic soul i have received many compliments in my life but that is a first thank you mila what is your name oh i should keep some secrets im just a nobody i have seen your face on a camera a picture i think sam will send to the cia silence ah you do not like that mila said you are a nobody they will know yes my name is braun he said it with pride i want you to know whos beaten you after others have failed well mr braun i will pay you more than a million dollars to let me go tempting but this isnt about money its about cleaning house setting a mistake to right i understand thats how you got your start setting a mistake to right its hard to be the star of your own legend i find your confidence in the face of death charming i like you if mr zviman wasnt so specific about getting you alive and in a state to be tortured i might give you a mercy bullet his voice sounded almost merry out of respect i am curious why would you be when youre about to die i wouldnt bother learning new facts i would be reflecting on all the old choices that brought me here we have a duty to learn more from our mistakes i mean youre one of my mistakes and im learning from you i would have liked to have dinner with you mila talked to you you fascinate me both you and zviman he wasnt talking about her but she wanted him to keep talking he would be less likely to notice anything she did i am not sure how i am your mistake mila said the handcuff pick slid home now if it would work it better she had paid very good money for it you zviman two sides of the same coin my dear i mean theres an irony that im going to profit from my mistake but after all i am cleaning up the mess i was retired i had a place to live in florida i was going to focus on golf and fishing mistakes shouldnt come back to haunt you at that point in life mistakes should die first and then let you die this braun was a crazy man the handcuff opened she gave out a little sigh i do not know what you mean i am not a coin no mila youre a jewel but you are worth a great number of coins retirement doesnt go as far as it used to he gave a sigh now i can retire in peace knowing my past mistakes are rectified it should really help my golf game she eased a wrist free she was careful not to make a clicking sound now the other heel she loosened it and wedged in the heel was a small sheathed knife she flicked off the sheath and the knife forged from japanese steel rested in her hand it was actually harder to cut the ropes around her feet than open the cuffs it required more movement to saw through the fibers well i find it odd that i am your mistake when i have never seen you before are you my long lost father mr braun not biologically but yes i am your father in a manner of speaking okay she thought entirely crazy you cannot answer straight questions she said you must have been cia you talk all vaguely just like sam yes hes the problem isnt he it all comes back to him she felt the van slow make a turn they had been driving north in a relatively straight stretch she couldnt see but she assumed he had the gps monitor up in the seat with him were here mila here where it all began he said where it was all born he stopped the van well thats not good he said i better not be too late and then he got out of the van and slammed the door mila writhed slashing at the ropes she had maybe eight seconds before braun opened the vans rear door not enough time the nursery leonie my glance kept flickering between the gun and the baby what are you doing she wept tears bright on her cheeks im sorry i cant let you take him that is daniel where is your child she glanced at daniel he cooed and moved against her gently as though he knew the smell of her skin the swell of her breast i shook my head no no hes mine im all hes ever had all hes ever known she said hes not yours any more his name is daniel taylor jones i sometimes call him dat like in a peekaboo game i go who then i go dat and he laughs fresh tears but her mouth curled into a twist of resolve he is my son i said and she steadied the gun okay okay i said i raised my hands leonie we can talk about this no no talk i am leaving with my son the child in the picture you showed me that was my first child my daughter i had to leave ray brewster when i got pregnant i didnt want him to be the father he wouldnt have let me be tied down with a child in case i ever had to run with him children complicate everything so i went she steadied her voice i would have liked someone like you sam i so dont want to hurt you i dont want to i will keep him safe in a way you cant not with the life you lead the enemies you have so move to the wall and keep your hands up and let me leave what happened to your daughter as long as she was talking she wasnt shooting me or leaving she died she died and i thought the grief would make her body fold meningitis it takes them so fast she i had done work for anna on the babies new identities she gave me daniel she said he could be mine a replacement but hes not i loved taylor just as she was she was the greatest sam oh god i bet she was my own face felt hot and heavy leonie please but but she gave me daniel and i love him just as much her voice broke to a whisper and you are not going to take him away from me i could see how zviman and anna had planned this ending i the excia killed jack ming the one man cia special projects wanted more than anyone else then i died at leonies hand when my defenses were down when victory was in my grasp leonie as a partner would ensure that i would not betray or move against nine suns and if i did she had every reason to kill me leonie would have a bigger motive for wanting me dead than anyone in nine suns i could take away the thing most precious in the world to her give me my son i said i opened my hands toward her he isnt yours im his mother im the only mother hes ever known that that traitor you married she gave him up she gave him up i never did i said you know how hard i have fought to find him and then i heard it you she screamed and the sympathy she seemed to feel for me turned instantly to venom i have fought a thousand times harder i raised a finger to my lips i heard something downstairs someones here she shook her head youre trying to scare me or trick me you want to go down there and get a weapon because ive got the gun leonie i hissed someone is downstairs she shut up my tone slicing through her fury listening i held out my hand for the gun after a moment she stepped forward hand shaking and gave it to me hide i whispered and she nodded my son gurgling against her shirt i looked at him for one second his eyes met mine his little mouth parted and a spit bubble formed and burst like a flower given a fivesecond life i have never wanted to hold another human being so badly in my life instead i checked the gun for the remaining clip and i eased onto the mezzanine but to milas surprise braun didnt come around the vans back door he walked away from the van she could hear the soft hiss of his footsteps on the gravel unloading his prisoner wasnt a priority fine by her she risked a glance out the front window braun stood by a bmw looking down at the ground talking to the ground it must be someone lying next to the car then braun shook his head and he walked into the grand house a gun in his hand she sliced through the remaining ropes kicked them away her hand went to her watch the garrotes wire was inside just as when she had used it against annas men in new york she palmed the heel of her boot with the miniature japanese knife the blade protruded between her ring and middle finger two small weapons she hoped they would be enough she let herself out of the van through the drivers door and dropped to the ground she looked under the van to see if she could spot who was lying by the bmw she saw legs but they were upright now gray pants nice shoes she heard a trunk open she peered around the van the blond mohawk yaakov zviman he looked up toward the house and she saw a rising bruise on the side of his face sam hit him she thought zviman hoisted an ax out of the bmw he took two steps toward the house then he stopped she ducked back around the van cursing the gravel it made a whispery noise that was unavoidable she froze he couldnt resist surely braun had told zviman his prize was in the van and he instead of going inside to help braun he was coming here to gloat to make sure it was her because it would only take a second he must have thought and he was a weak man and she knew he thought it would strike blind terror into her heart to see his face her being bound and helpless and it would have she knew what kind of revenge he would take on her for her maiming of him the cruelty of it would be all but unimaginable oh baby he called to the closed rear door of the van i dont have the hours it will take to do you properly not right now but in a few minutes im going to slice you up good in front of your friends and if you scream i cut a piece off them then im going to kill them in front of you and he swung open the van door and it was empty just the sliced ropes and the unlocked cuffs she could hear his suck of surprised breath let him be scared for one second she thought she rounded the vans back door and she aimed a hard punch at the side of his neck with the blade extending from her fist she wanted an artery she missed as he jerked back but the knife scored north of his jaw a hard puncture into cheek the blood welled up she aimed again at his eye he ducked she missed and grunting with pain he swung the ax but he was off balance and no muscle behind the swing and the edge bounced off the vans door four inches from her head he nearly dropped the ax she swung her fist again looking to slice his throat but he kicked her midsection she stumbled back and now he had both hands on the ax and momentum and balance her blade was a sting his ax a missile oh bitch dream come true he said ive waited for this ive so waited to feel you die really she panted he had a rage she remembered make it work for her does the thought of hurting me make you hard i mean whats left of it he swung the ax viciously in an arcing trace he missed her by inches then swung it back the blunt edge catching her hand when she made the mistake of a panicked slash the heel blade flew out into the gravel i dont even know what ill do first to you he said i made a list once it ran to three pages go get your list raggedy man ill wait at her words he stopped swinging wildly at her his grin was inhuman the stuff of a leering boogeyman he steadied the ax and they did a little dance on the gravel back and forth she badly wanted to run but her shoes were awkward without the heels and he could throw the ax into her back better to keep her face to him this went on for thirty long seconds he wouldnt quite commit she realized even as he choked with rage and spite that he was afraid of her wow raggedy man wielding an ax against an unarmed woman and still you wont fight he snarled and chopped at her missed shed had an idea and she circled back toward the van he stepped in too close and she got a grip on the handle trying to pry it from his fist he shoved her against the side of the van and powered a mighty blow the ax slammed into the steel side of the van perforating the metal it missed her head only because she fell her heelless boots slipping and skidding out on the gravel he grunted as he tried to pry the ax out it was stuck she would not get another chance she pivoted out from under the handle turned and pulled the watchs face free the garrotes wire glinted in the fading dusky light she looped the wire over his throat and threw herself onto his back then she pulled yaakov zviman tried to pry fingers under the wire but she tightened it too fast he tried to throw her free she wrapped her strong lithe legs around him ankles crossed above his ruined crotch she thought of his wicked smiling face looking back over his pimpled shoulder while he raped her sister she thought of ivan teaching her in the dusty broken light of the winery how to fight how to kill she thought of nelly lying in surprised blood the last of her life pulsing out of her and she pulled tighter he made noises no human should make he threw himself against the van trying to scrape her off tu mori she gasped tu mori he fell face down into the gravel she felt the wire slice her own flesh on her fingers the side of her hand she drove her knees into his back the handle on the fake face of the watch broke she felt it give the garrote would not work she didnt look to see if he was even still breathing through the compressed wreckage of his throat with a shuddering moan she kicked against the van levered the ax out of its torn side with a rush of strength and she avenged her sister with a final downward blow where it all began i took the gun and inched toward the mezzanines railing sam a voice calling to me i didnt know it so i didnt answer sam ive brought your friend mila i stopped i thought he was in the foyer walking along the hardwoods in the entrance now if you dont come out shes going to get hurt if that was true mila was going to get hurt anyway with zviman around his threat wasnt going to flush me out youre not being a gentleman he said with disapproval in his tone i got still i listened and then muffled i heard daniel begin to cry thats the future crying he said he started coming up the stairs i heard the creak of the wood against his heels outside i heard noises of struggle a fight zviman might be functional and he was out there with mila as a prisoner oh hell now he walked into sight we kept guns raised at each other the man who had sat in the corner of the bar nursing his pints ray brewster i dont want to hurt you he said that must be why your limo driver and your psychotic sister act tried to kill me mr brewster ray brewster was just an alias my name is ricardo braun braun augusts boss the unretired head of special projects braun shrugged kill jack ming that was fine i didnt need him exposing the truth you sam you were different you were the bridge i dont know what you mean at this distance we couldnt miss each other he kept heading toward the top of the stairs i kept moving toward where stairs met mezzanine youre the bridge between special projects and our biggest mistakes you being that bridge well i could let you and your child live mistakes i fell silent nine suns nine suns was started by special projects yes years ago may i explain why so ill pretend to listen and youll get a chance to shoot me no because you have a role to play sam if you dare i was silent he cleared his throat the cia had a long history of dealing with questionable sources people who were criminals often they were heads of state you develop a high tolerance for holding your nose but we thought i thought it was my idea what if criminals carefully selected could be put to use by the cia they know about dark corners of the world they could help us insert people into situations where we never could have access they could give us information and people we could never find on our own and why we would protect them and their interests really no different than propping up a brutal but prowestern government in the old days so we researched them people in positions of power in criminal rings from around the world and we brought nine of them here here to this house the language schools are an old special projects front he laughed you know how the cia is once they buy property they never want to sell it theyre always afraid some secret has been left behind hidden in the woodwork they came willingly not exactly kidnapped them but treated them with dignity once they were here in the lovely catskills i explained to them the opportunity they embraced it what we couldnt have foreseen was they bonded as a group i didnt anticipate they would think if they didnt cooperate they would lose a competitive advantage they understood each other they respected each other and since all nine were scattered about the world they werent well natural enemies these were men and women on the edge of the powerful rings ambitious and looking for a way to the top like zviman out there yes i recruited his father he stepped in after his dad died they went from being whoremasters who are a very useful source of information to smugglers to a supreme extor tionist and spymaster he flexed a smile almost of pride i chose well with my recruits the suns they took what i taught them about tradecraft and stealing secrets and they well formed a gang beyond a gang a metagang to grow their own power and profit with an eye i think on becoming the most powerful criminal syndicate in the world they stopped doing exactly what the cia asked for it was harder for me to shield them i retired they broke away but kept their own alliance nine suns there were leftovers of course people i recruited who were criminals but not parts of rings individuals working alone for special projects such as the limo driver the sisters the people that leonie hid for you yes odd that the psychos were more loyal than the sane criminals for me but the psychos prefer the attention and support your group inside the cia gave birth to the most powerful and ambitious criminal ring in history i said one that just tried to commit a mass assassination against our government you dont want to see those words in a news report braun said it would have been devastating cia in bed with renegade russian mafiosi and japanese yakuza and israeli racketeers he flexed a smile he held up the red notebook theres a picture of me in here with two of the suns two of the ringleaders i cant have that i cant have what theyve done tied to the cia i cant be disloyal to the company that way he pointed down to the foyer right heres where they got their name there was a tapestry hanging in the library here a chinese tapestry that showed the legend of the nine suns i think an agent had been given it as a gift from someone wed smuggled out of mainland china one of the criminals noticed there were nine suns and nine of them they picked the name almost as a joke while they sipped cocktails and i explained how the cia could protect them if they helped us i got them to use the latin form because i thought it would sound like a religious order i was worried someone in the company would hear of them and see the tapestry the company uses this facility still now and then so you came back to special projects after nine suns tried their assassination plot to clean up the mess i cant destroy them but i can keep the companys role in creating them from being exposed thats all i can do oh ill kill zviman and any other nine suns bastard i find because it tells the others to remain silent i dont mind waging a private war thats what special projects is going to have to do now thats why i wanted you me maybe now id know why he told me all this instead of just shooting at me i tried to cover all my bases he cleared his throat criminals to give me information corporations to give me information just as i found criminals who were too ambitious for their own rings i found certain people successful people who were idealistic and had money to burn and were willing to back another idea of mine a way to fight back against the suns he flicked another smile i felt the world drop out from under me the round table you started them too they didnt gel quite as fast as nine suns did but they provided a lot of good information but these were either people who had inherited vast sums or made vast sums at young ages they didnt relish taking orders from me they dont like or trust bureaucracy so they split off there wasnt anything we could do to stop them they werent going to be an embarrassment the way nine suns would be but still we created two sides and then we left them to fight it out because they began to encroach on each other after no one cared what nine suns was doing punkass criminals with delusions of grandeur please but now theyre a serious threat theyve realized that an undermined social order a chaos is where they can consolidate power and profit look at the areas of the world that are ruled by criminals parts of latin america moldova parts of africa and those are the testing grounds for nine suns vision of the world which is why i want to talk to you i can offer you amnesty sam thats why i told zviman to bring you here id worked out a deal with him mila for you he wouldnt kill you if i brought him mila i shot him i was tired of him and his excuses the bullet hit him in the shoulder in the gun arm and he staggered and screamed and clutched at the wall his gun clattered down the stairs what did mila say the unpredictable is what killls you well that cut both ways i was done with braun you goddamn it let me finish come back and work here you can tear them both down nine suns and round table project a and project b im not interested in being the consultant who fixes your mistakes you do you think theyll let you out of prison you killed the guy special projects wanted you attacked a cia team and nearly exposed them im your only choice sam im the only way to keep your freedom and have your son braun sagged on the wall i am done i said your brother in afghanistan wasnt a bunch of taliban hash smugglers that killed him it was a nine suns job initiation his gasp echoed in the foyer now youre just desperate desperate i shook my head im not getting played by a loser like you your brothers execution wasnt what it seemed he laughed do you think its just coincidence that lucy betrayed you they aimed her at you theyve watched you ever since you went into the cia theyve wanted to bring you to them both sides he stuck fingers along his bloodied shoulder christ i need a doctor did you know as a cia officer that my son was being held here his mouth moved youve run and profited from your own little fiefdom yes but im retiring i want you to have it you to take it over at least i did before you shot me he spat at me and leonie lindsay ah dont trust her shell leave you he coughed blood the father of nine suns and the father of the round table sitting before me giving me the perfect excuse to go back to the cia and get my old life back with a new mission what was i going to do with him the front door clanged mila walked in dragging a bloodied ax always a good sign you okay i called down to her yes is daniel here yes safe yes she looked up the stairs at braun and pointed this man is crazy he thinks he is my father i assure you my mother had much better taste he invented nine suns and the round table both both mila stared at him for one second ax in hand she started to step up the stairs then she stopped you should have picked a side she dropped the ax she picked up a bloodied slightly mangled notebook that he had dropped when i shot him i could hear the hiss of brauns breath he wanted it whatever jack ming had found it had to contain threads that led back to the cia otherwise he wouldnt have cared hed not chased after his frankenstein monster before nine suns wanted ming dead because they didnt want to be exposed braun wanted ming dead because he didnt want the cia exposed so drag his ass out into the light good luck braun im not going to kill you im going to let you sit and bleed on those stairs in the place where you had so many clever ideas that have come back and bit you in the ass and im leaving if i ever see you again sam you said you wanted your old life back its been your mantra from what i understand i am offering you your old life all you have to do to get back into the cia is help me clean up this mess you get what you want and so do i im not giving the cia my friends in the round table im not giving you mila and im not helping you your old life he said again yours they will give you no peace all im offering you is your only chance to regain what you lost your child your career my wife braun swallowed i can give you back what can be given what sort of life will you have with your son now do you think nine suns will give you peace my offer is the only one that makes sense for you all you are offering me is a chance to be you which is less than nothing this is a very good offer i am making if i ever see you again or you come near mila or leonie or my son i will kill you if you ever try to harm august i will kill you i almost mentioned jack ming but perhaps better if he thought jack ming was dead if i think youre thinking about me i will kill you go retire just go away im not lying about your brother lucy always said that was why you joined to get your revenge and thats why youd lie i said think about it youre bragging you founded the group that killed my brother i really would shut up now i turned and went back down the hallway i found leonie and daniel hiding in a closet its all right i said were all leaving together she clutched daniel close she had held him for several minutes and her closeness calmed him he looked up at me blinked disinterested then looked at me again one little fist raised toward me i took him from leonie i did not ask she did not fight me he was hers in a way but he was mine i tucked his little head under my arm like id seen the fathers on television do and i could smell his warm milky breath the soft weight of him the miracle of him he raised his little fist again and i kissed it the bahamas daniel was afraid of the water i held him close to me i found it hard to let him go at times it was almost as if i needed to drink in his touch he had grown used to me in the past several weeks and i liked to tell myself that my absence in the first months of his life was not impossible to overcome that being apart from me for so long at his lifes beginning wouldnt scar him i read obsessively about the topic of parental separation on google it didnt matter what the experts said i would make it right we walked in the surge of the tide and he stared down at the waves eddying around my calves i timed it carefully with the surf and after a healthy wave passed i dipped his feet in the cool he giggled as the next wave surged forward i hoisted him high out of its path and he loved being raised toward the sky we played the game him laughing until i miscued and the top of a foaming wave crept up past his swimsuit to splash his chest then he howled in dismay daniel i had learned liked his comforts leonie had taken good care of him with my fussy boy fussing i walked back up to the beach cottage i thought leonie would be inside fixing lunch but instead mila sat at the table hello i said i made daniels hand wave hello mila i went surfing with no board please mila said do not treat that beautiful child like a puppet she got up and tapped his nose playfully with her finger she frowned he is like a greasy pig sunscreen did you dip him in it i dont want him to get sunburned amazed you could maintain a grip do you want to hold him linen she said pointing to her blouse i dont want to risk a massive oil stain but she waved her greasy finger at the yawning daniel and smiled a grin that seemed too bright for the mila i knew hello pui or she chimed i had learned this meant little birdie daniel gurgled back he seemed a bit uncertain about mila i think youre a bit ambivalent about babies i said settling him into a chair and wiping his hands clean an ocean explorer deserved a snack i opened a bottle of organic pureed pears i sat down and spooned the fruity mush into his mouth daniel gobbled humans are much more interesting when they reach school age then i like them much better she glanced at me maybe by then i will retire and be a teacher again just for daniel perhaps i will open an exclusive language school she made a face i hear they are hiring uh oh ricardo braun is now a big hero i heard that he broke up a criminal ring here that was spying on american citizens and government and companies he killed the two ringleaders an israeli man a french woman of course hes a and i quote hero wounded in the line of duty retired with honors no farewell cocktail party though went back to florida living very quietly so giving august the notebook was the right thing to do that picture of braun with two of the suns sunk his comeback the lovely red notebook cant hurt us mila shrugged i tore out the pages of interest to me the ones about the round table very few but there are some useful people in the missing pages of the little red notebook i say give them a chance to redeem themselves helping us rather than being blackmailed by nine suns i shook my head on a voluntary basis she said with a cough the cia has more resources than we do to bring down nine suns and they will bring down at least a few of them that they can tie to the blackmail ring the cia will identify some of their plans but sam nine suns they will not go away some fall they will be replaced your friend braun created too good and useful a template they have made too much money accrued too much power they wont give it up i keep wondering if i should have killed him you must not talk about killing people in front of pui or she said it is bad for child development you need boundaries so brauns not running special projects no who is one of the few big secrets i do not know you really dont know i hoped august got the job hed brought in jack ming after all i really dont know dont care you you are my problem how so i knew what was coming we gave you many bars to run yes thank you bars to serve as a cover for you so you could do jobs for us ah i dont believe you are going into fights with pui or strapped to your back no so may i have the bars back she was asking so politely no i do not understand well the round table still needs the bars run right and any other employees such as yourself need to avail themselves of the bars as safe houses yes yes so let me run the bars ill make sure they turn a tidy profit and that will be enough for you for now mila drew her knees up to her chin and what about what that old asshole said about your brothers death i have daniel im not interested in the revenge game may i be honest youre still my boss i forgot momentarily right now you are captivated by this greasy child you will want to be a good and present father but you will get restless bored never of him mila nodded you will get bored of not knowing the truth nine suns had a plan for me according to zviman one cultivated over the years i still didnt know what that plan was did i want to no you will want to know what these jerks are doing mila said you and jack ming destroyed their main source of information now extortion does not have a long life anyway but they will replace zviman in their constellation of assholes and they will find new mischief new ways to earn profits or grab power or there will be some other jerk to fight because no one else knows that he is a threat or no one else will dare to fight him not my problem i said carefully until it is ah my glimmer of hope therefore you may keep the bars for now run them at massive profit or i will bring barney dvds for danny boy leonie calls him dat mila made a face for a woman who invents names she has horrible taste she jerked her head toward the sliding glass door she left when i came here your charm is contagious why is she still here for daniel how convenient his nanny is a master forger no doubt she can teach him to copy your signature on excuses for his teachers shes not his nanny well she is not his mother she is not your wife what is she aside from a champion liar were deciding mila watched the pear ooze past daniels lips i noticed there were three bedrooms here all used you can count sam she has no claim on your child her adoption was both illegal and immoral dont reward her dont let this woman into your life i glanced up at her do you think i want to send someone who loves daniel who would have died for him to jail no you cant expose yourself that way either to police questions as to where you were when daniel was born true its done i said and its my business not yours and and i will let it go mila said quietly i decided to change the subject did your cia source have anything new on jack ming yes he and his girlfriend have new names new city new jobs they have a brand new start new start didnt everyone deserve one i left mila considering whether a towel would protect her from daniels oily embrace and walked along the sand leonie stood at the waters edge the ocean surged then retreated around her feet tides where one world ends another begins i had loved when my parents in their globetrotting dogooderness were assigned to coastal areas beginnings and endings on the sand the water erasing and renewing all at once she stood in a yellow sundress a big floppy hat you saw mila arrived she said as i joined her yes we had a nice chat she still hates me she hates most people except daniel her one redeeming feature im keeping the bars i said oh so i guess daniel will be traveling with you im not sure id wish my vagabond childhood on him she looked out at the boats skidding across the sea then back at me what does that mean it means i travel and then i have a home where daniel is where i will need help are you offering me a job her voice sounded cold a job no youre the only mother hes known leonie i cannot take him from you i cant take you from him her lips narrowed if you are going to do that someday sam do it now now is easier no i know you love him and my legal standing with daniel she asked in the barest whisper a question she almost couldnt risk none right now this is a test drive leonie well see i did not feel the need to say that if she ran with daniel she couldnt run far not with me and mila and friends looking for her she scratched at her lip considering we were silent for several moments watching the water wipe the sandy slate clean thank you she said i accept i might be at home a lot i might have to travel i plan on staying well clear of trouble man plans god laughs she crossed her arms you know i didnt sleep with you because i did it because i wanted you i know i wanted you too but but we were both in an extreme mental state its too soon for me after lucy im sorry she steepled her fingers before her face and studied me and the future i dont know i wont promise something i cant keep ive had enough of that in my life all right so what city las vegas or new york do you want to go back to art school she looked genuinely surprised i i hadnt considered that as a possibility well if you want pick a good one ill pay for it or ill get you a studio if you dont want to go back to school i would rather you be back at art than forgery delight played across her face art school and daniel that was heaven you dont have any preference for a city i shrugged my folks live in new orleans but i dont really talk to them i think with daniel now maybe i should mend that fence i cant teach him the value of family if im too distant from my own yes show up with your new son and your nongirlfriend whos not a nanny and takes care of the kid they would love that im sure where else i bit my lip the wanderer gets to choose a home i like austin i like savannah i like boston and nashville i like london and paris and dublin i like all those choices she said then you decide and i meant it i didnt care where we lived i was getting a new start so was she so was daniel so even was mila wind lift me take me then settle me down id lived so much of my life planned out and i was ready for a jolt of spontaneity okay ill decide leonie said and we walked back to the cottage but in the end daniel chose that night leonie had written down a bunch of cities on slips of paper tossed them into a rainbow knit hat shed bought down on the beach she couldnt decide and had thought shed have me draw a city from the hat daniel holding onto the coffee table pulled himself standing he knocked over the hat and shook it and to his delight the scraps of paper spilled loose he grabbed one and tried to stick it in his mouth i pulled it from his little fist and uncurled the damp strip held it up for leonie to see she laughed and said sold good choice daniel i said he offered up a hand and i gave him a gentle highfive he plopped on his butt and began to fuss and then he reached up for the comfort of my arms
