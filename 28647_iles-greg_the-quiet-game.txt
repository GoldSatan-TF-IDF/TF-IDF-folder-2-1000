greg iles the quiet game the first book in the penn cage series be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap galatians chapter i am standing in line for walt disneys its a small world ride holding my fouryearold daughter in my arms trying to entertain her as the serpentine line of parents and children moves slowly toward the flatbottomed boats emerging from the grotto to the music of an endless audio loop suddenly annie jerks taut in my arms and points into the crowd daddy i saw mama hurry i do not look i dont ask where i dont because annies mother died seven months ago i stand motionless in the line looking just like everyone else except for the hot tears that have begun to sting my eyes annie keeps pointing into the crowd becoming more and more agitated even in disney world where periodic meltdowns are common her fit draws stares clutching her struggling body against mine i work my way back through the line which sends her into outright panic the green metal chutes double back upon themselves to create the illusion of a short queue for prospective riders i push past countless staring families finally reaching the relative openness between the carousel and dumbo holding annie tighter i rock and turn in slow circles as i did to calm her when she was an infant a streaming mass of teenagers breaks around us like a river around a rock and pays us about as much attention a claustrophobic sense of futility envelops me a feeling i never experienced prior to my wifes illness but which now dogs me like a malignant shadow if i could summon a helicopter to whisk us back to the polynesian resort i would pay ten thousand dollars to do it but there is no helicopter only us or the lessthanus that weve been since sarah died the vacation is over and when the vacation is over you go home but where is home technically houston the suburb of tanglewood but houston doesnt feel like home anymore the houston house has a hole in it now a hole that moves from room to room the thought of penn cage helpless would shock most people who know me at thirtyeight years old i have sent sixteen men and women to death row i watched seven of them die ive killed in defense of my family ive given up one successful career and made a greater success of another i am admired by my friends feared by my enemies loved by those who matter but in the face of my childs grief i am powerless taking a deep breath i hitch annie a little higher and begin the long trek back to the monorail we came to disney world because sarah and i brought annie here a year agobefore the diagnosisand it turned out to be the best vacation of our lives i hoped a return trip might give annie some peace but the opposite has happened she rises in the middle of the night and pads into the bathroom in search of sarah she walks the theme parks with darting eyes always alert for the vanished maternal profile in the magical world of disney annie believes sarah might step around the next corner as easily as cinderella when i patiently explained that this could not happen she reminded me that snow white rose from the dead just like jesus which in her fouryearold brain is indisputable fact all we have to do is find mama so that daddy can kiss her and make her wake up i collapse onto a seat in the monorail with a half dozen japanese tourists annie sobbing softly into my shoulder the silver train accelerates to cruising speed rushing through tomorrowland a grand anachronism replete with jetsonsstyle rocket ships and art deco restaurants a s incarnation of mans glittering destiny tomorrowland was outstripped by reality more rapidly than old walt could have imagined transformed into a kitschy parody of the dreams of the eisenhower era it stands as mute but eloquent testimony to mans inability to predict what lies ahead i do not need to be reminded of this as the monorail swallows a long curve i spy the crossed roof beams of the polynesian resort soon we will be back inside our suite alone with the emptiness that haunts us every day and all at once that is not good enough anymore with shocking clarity a voice speaks in my mind it is sarahs voice you cant do this alone she says i look down at annies face angelic now in sleep we need help i say aloud drawing odd glances from the japanese tourists before the monorail hisses to a stop at the hotel i know what i am going to do i call delta airlines first and book an afternoon flight to baton rougenot our final destination but the closest major airport to it simply making the call sets something thrumming in my chest annie awakens as i arrange for a rental car perhaps even in sleep sensing the utter resolution in her fathers voice she sits quietly beside me on the bed her left hand on my thigh reassuring herself that i can go nowhere without her are we going on the airplane again daddy thats right punkin i answer dialing a houston number back home no were going to see gram and papa her eyes widen with joyous expectation gram and papa now i hope so just a minute my assistant cilia daniels is speaking in my ear she obviously saw the name of the hotel on the callerid

house she echoes your house you mean everything as in furniture yes im selling the house selling the house penn whats happened whats wrong nothing ive come to my senses thats all annies never going to

book and its by far the best youve ever written i laugh out loud how close are you you were only half done the last time i got up the nerve to ask you about it i start to lie but theres no point i havent written a decent page since sarah died cilia is silent and i burned the first half of the manuscript the night before we left houston she gasps you didnt look in the fireplace penn i think you

make sure we do when i hang up annie rises to her knees beside me her eyes bright are we really going to gram and papas well know in a minute i dial the telephone number i memorized as a fouryearold and listen to it ring the call is answered by a woman with a cigaretteparched southern drawl no film producer would ever use for fear that the audience would be unable to decode the words she works for an answering service dr cages residence this is penn cage his son can you ring through for me we sure can honey you hang on after five rings i hear a click then a deep male voice speaks two words that somehow convey more emotional subtext than most men could in two paragraphs reassurance gravitas a knowledge of ultimate things doctor cage it says my fathers voice instantly steadies my heart this voice has comforted thousands of people over the years and told many others that their days on earth numbered far less than theyd hoped dad what are you doing home this time of day penn is that you yes whats up son im bringing annie home to see you great are you coming straight from florida you could say that were coming today today is she sick no not physically anyway dad im selling the

of heels followed by my mothers voice penn are you really coming home well be there tonight thank god well pick you up at the airport no dont ill rent a car oh all right i just i cant tell you how glad i am something in my mothers voice triggers an alarm i cant say what it is because its in the spaces not the words the way you hear things in families whatever it is its serious peggy cage does not worry about little things mom whats the matter nothing im just glad youre coming home there is no more inept liar than someone who has spent a lifetime telling the truth mom dont try to well talk when you get here you just bring that little girl where she belongs i recall cilias opinion that my mother was upset when she called yesterday but theres no point in forcing the issue on the phone ill be face to face with her in a few hours well be there tonight bye my hand shakes as i set the receiver in its cradle for a prodigal son a journey home after eighteen years is a sacred one ive been home for a few christmases and thanksgivings but this is different looking down at annie i get one of the thousandvolt shocks of recognition that has hit me so many times since the funeral sometimes sarahs face peers out from annies as surely as if her spirit has temporarily possessed the child but if this is a possession it is a benign one annies hazel eyes transfix mine with a look that gave me much peace when it shone from sarahs face this is the right thing it says i love you daddy she says softly i love you more i reply completing our ritual then i catch her under the arms and lift her high into the air lets pack weve got a plane to catch chapter one of the nice things about firstclass air travel is immediate beverage service even before our connecting flight lifts out of atlantas hartsfield airport a tumbler of singlemalt scotch sits halfempty on the tray before me i never drink liquor in front of annie but she is conveniently asleep on the adjacent seat her little arm hangs over the padded divider her hand touching my thigh an earlywarning system that operates even in sleep what part of her brain keeps that hand in place did neanderthal children sleep this way i sip my whisky and stroke her hair cautiously looking around the cabin one of the bad things about firstclass air travel is being recognized you get a lot of readers in first class a lot of lawyers too today the cabin is virtually empty but sitting across the aisle from us is a woman in her late twenties wearing a lawyerly blue suit and reading a penn cage novel its just a matter of time before she recognizes me or maybe not if my luck holds i take another sip of scotch recline my seat and close my eyes the first image that floats into my mind is the face of arthur lee hanratty i spent four months convicting that bastard and i consider it time well spent but even in texas where we are serious about the death penalty it takes time to exhaust all avenues of appeal now eight years after his conviction it seems possible that he might actually die at the hands of the state i know prosecutors who will drive all day with smiles on their faces to see the execution of a man they convicted avidly anticipating the political capital they will reap from the event others will not attend an execution even if asked i always felt a responsibility to witness the punishment i had requested in the name of society also in capital cases i shepherded the victims families through the long ordeal of trial in every case family members asked me to witness the execution on their behalf after the legislature changed the law allowing victims families to witness executions i was asked to accompany them in the viewing room and i was glad to be able to comfort them this time its different my relationship to death has fundamentally changed i witnessed my wifes death from a much closer perspective than from the viewing room at the walls and as painful as it was her passing was a sacred experience i have no desire to taint that memory by watching yet another execution carried out with the institutional efficiency of a veterinarian putting down a rabid dog i drink off the remainder of my scotch savoring the peaty burn in my throat as always remembering sarahs death makes me think of my father hearing his voice on the telephone earlier only intensifies the images as the ascends to cruising altitude the whisky opens a neural switch in my brain and memory begins overpowering thought like a salt tide flooding into an estuary i know from experience that it is useless to resist i close my eyes and let it come sarah lies in the md anderson hospital in houston her bones turned to burning paper by a disease whose name she no longer speaks aloud she is not superstitious but to name the sickness seems to grant it more power than it deserves her doctors are puzzled the end should have come long ago the diagnosis was a late one the prognosis poor sarah weighs only eightyone pounds now but she fights for life with a young mothers tenacity it is a pitched battle fought minute by minute against physical agony and emotional despair sometimes she speaks of suicide it is a comfort on the worst nights like many doctors her oncologists are too wary of lawsuits and the dea to adequately treat pain in desperation i call my father who advises me to check sarah out of the hospital and go home six hours later he arrives at our door trailing the smell of cigars and a black bag containing enough schedule two narcotics to euthanize a grizzly bear for two weeks he lives across the hall from sarah tending her like a nurse shaming into silence any physician who questions his actions he helps sarah to sleep when she needs it frees her from the demon long enough to smile at annie when she feels strong enough for me to bring her in then the drugs begin to fail the fine line between consciousness and agony disappears one evening sarah asks everyone to leave saying she sleeps better alone near midnight she calls me into the bedroom where we once lay with annie between us dreaming of the future she can barely speak i take her hand for a moment the clouds in her eyes part revealing a startling clarity you made me happy she whispers i believe i have no tears left but they come now take care of my baby she says i vow with absolute conviction to do so but i am not sure she hears me then she surprises me by asking for my father i cross the hall and wake him then sit down on the warm covers from which he rose when i wake sarah is gone she died in her sleep peacefully my father says he volunteers no more and i do not ask when sarahs parents wake he tells them she is dead each in turn goes to him and hugs him their eyes wet with tears of gratitude and absolution she was a trooper my father says in a cracked voice this is the highest tribute my wife will ever receive excuse me are you penn cage the writer i blink and rub my eyes against the light then turn to my right the young woman across the aisle is looking at me a slight blush coloring her cheeks i didnt want to bother you but i saw you take a drink and realized you must be awake i was reading this book and well you look just like the picture on the back she is speaking softly so as not to wake annie part of my mind is still with sarah and my father chasing a strand of meaning down a dark spiral but i force myself to concentrate as the woman introduces herself as kate she is quite striking with fine black hair pulled up from her neck fair skin and sea green eyes an unusual combination her navy suit looks tailored and the pulledback hair gives the impression that kate is several years older than she probably is a common affectation among young female attorneys i smile awkwardly and confirm that i am indeed myself then ask if she is a lawyer she smiles am i that obvious to other members of the breed another smile this one different as though at some private joke im a first amendment specialist she offers her accent is an alloy of ivy league boston and something softer a brahmin who graduated radcliffe but spent her summers far away that sounds interesting i tell her sometimes not as interesting as what you do im sure youre wrong about that i doubt it i just saw you on cnn in the airport they were talking about the hanratty execution about you killing his brother so the circus has started thats not exactly my daily routine not anymore at least it sounded like there were some unanswered questions about the shooting kate blushes again im sure youre sick of people asking about it right yes i am maybe the execution will finally put it to rest im sorry i didnt mean to pry sure you did on any other day i would brush her off but she is reading one of my novels and even thinking about texas v hanratty is better than what i was thinking about when she disturbed me its okay we all want to know the inside of things they said on burden of proof that the hanratty case is often cited as an example of jurisdictional disputes between federal and state authorities i nod but say nothing disputes is a rather mild word arthur lee hanratty was a white supremacist who testified against several former cronies in exchange for immunity and a plum spot in the federal witness protection program three months after he entered the program he shot a black man in compton over a traffic dispute he fled los angeles joined his two psychotic brothers and wound up in houston where they murdered an entire black family as they were being apprehended arthur lee shot and killed a female cop giving his brothers time to escape none of this looked good on the resume of john portman the us attorney who had granted hanratty immunity and portman vowed to convict his former star witness in federal court in los angeles my boss and i with the help of then president and erstwhile texas native george bush kept hanratty in texas where he stood a real chance of dying for his crimes our jurisdictional victory deprived portman of his revenge but his career skyrocketed nevertheless first into a federal judgeship and finally into the directorship of the fbi where he now presides i remember when it happened kate says the compton shooting i mean i was working in los angeles for the summer and it got a lot of play there half the media made you out to be a hero the other half a monster they said youwell you know what i ask testing her nerve she hesitates then takes the plunge they said you shot him and then used your baby to justify killing him ive come to understand the combat veterans frustration with this kind of curiosity and i usually meet it with a stony stare if not outright hostility but today is different today i am in transition the impending execution has resurrected old ghosts and i find myself willing to talk not to satisfy this womans curiosity but to remind myself that i got through it that i did the right thing the only thing i assure myself looking down at annie sleeping beside me i drink the last of my scotch and let myself remember it this thing that always seems to have happened to someone else a celebrity among lawyers hailed by the right wing and excoriated by the left arthur lee hanratty vowed to kill me after his arrest he said it a dozen times on television i took his threats the way i took them all cum grano salis but hanratty meant it four years later the night the supreme court affirmed his death sentence my wife and i were lying in bed watching the late news she was dozing i was going over my opening statement for another murder trial my boss had put a deputy outside because of the supreme court ruling but i didnt think there was any danger when i heard the first noise i thought it was nothing the house settling then i heard something else i asked sarah if shed heard it she hadnt she told me to turn out the light and go to sleep and i almost did thats how close it was thats where my nightmares come from what made you get up as the flight attendant passes i signal for another scotch i dont know something had registered wrong deep down i took my thirtyeight down from the closet shelf and switched off my reading light then i opened the bedroom door and moved up the hall toward our daughters room annie was only six months old but she always slept through the night when i pushed open her door i didnt hear breathing but that didnt worry me sometimes you have to get right down over them you know i walked to the crib and leaned over to listen kate is spellbound leaning across the aisle i take my scotch from the flight attendants hand and gulp a swallow the crib was empty sweet jesus the deputy was out front so i ran to the french doors at the back of the house when i got there i saw nothing but the empty patio i felt like i was falling off a cliff then something made me turn to my left there was a man standing by the french doors in the dining room twenty feet away he had a tiny bundle in his arms like a loaf of bread in a blanket he looked at me as he reached for the door handle i saw his teeth in the dark and i knew he was smiling i pointed my pistol at his head he started backing through the door using annie as a shield holding her at center mass in the dark with shaking hands every rational thought told me not to fire but i had to i take another gulp of scotch the whites of kates eyes are completely visible around the green irises giving her a hyperthyroid look i reach down and lay a hand on annies shoulder parts of this story i still cannot voice when i saw those teeth i sensed the giddy superiority the kidnapper felt over me the triumph of the predator nothing in my life ever hit me the way that fear did he was halfway through the door when i pulled the trigger the bullet knocked him onto the patio when i got outside annie was lying on the cement covered in blood i snatched her up even before i looked at the guy held her up in the moonlight and ripped off her pajamas looking for a bullet wound she didnt make a sound then she screamed like a banshee an anger scream you know not pain i knew then that she was probably okay hanratty the bullet had hit him in the eye he was dying and i didnt do a goddamn thing to help him kate finally blinks a series of rapidfire clicks like someone coming out of a trance she points down at annie shes that baby shes annie yes god she taps the book in her lap i see why you quit theres still one out there what do you mean we never caught the third brother i get postcards from him now and then he says hes looking forward to spending some time with our family she shakes her head how do you live with that i shrug and return to my drink your wife isnt traveling with you kate asks they always have to ask no she passed away recently kates face begins the subtle sequence of expressions ive seen a thousand times in the last seven months shock embarrassment sympathy and just the slightest satisfaction that a seemingly perfect life is not so perfect after all im sorry she says the wedding ring i just assumed its okay you couldnt know she looks down and takes a sip of her soft drink when she looks up her face is composed again she asks what my next book is about and i give her the usual fluff but she isnt listening i know this reaction too the response of most women to a young widower particularly one who is clearly solvent and not appallingly ugly is as natural and predictable as the rising of the sun the subtle glow of flirtation emanates from kate like a medieval spell but it is a spell to which i am presently immune annie awakens as we talk and kate immediately brings her into the conversation developing a surprising rapport time passes quickly and before long we are shaking hands at the gate in baton rouge annie and i bump into her again at the baggage carousel and as kate squeaks outside in her sensible reeboks to hail a taxi i notice annies eyes solemnly tracking her my daughters attraction to young adult women is painful to see i scoop her up with forced merriment and trot to the hertz counter where i have to hassle with a clerk about why the car i reserved isnt available although for ten dollars extra per day i can upgrade to a model that is and how long ill have to wait for a childsafety seat im escalating from irritation to anger when a tall man with white hair and a neatly trimmed white beard walks through the glass doors through which kate just departed papa annie squeals daddy papas here dad what what are you doing here he laughs and veers toward us you think your mothers going to have her son renting a car to drive eighty miles to get home god forbid he catches annie under the arms lifts her high and hugs her to his chest hello tadpole whats shakin down in disney world i saw ariel and snow white hugged me of course she did who wouldnt want to hug an angel like you he looks over her shoulder at me for a few uncomfortable moments i endure the penetrating gaze of a man who for forty years has searched for illness in reticent people his perception is like the heat from a lamp i nod slowly hoping to communicate im okay dad at the same time searching his face for clues to the anxiety i heard in my mothers voice on the phone this morning but hes too good at concealing his emotions another habit of the medical profession is mom with you i ask no shes home cooking a supper youll have to see to believe he reaches out and squeezes my hand its good to see you son for an instant i catch a glimpse of something unsettling behind his eyes but it vanishes as he grins mischievously at annie lets move out tadpole were burning daylight chapter my father served as an army doctor in west germany in the s and it was there he acquired a taste for dark beer and highperformance automobiles he has been driving bmws ever since he could afford them and he drives fast in four minutes we are away from the airport and roaring north on highway annie sits in the middle of the backseat lashed into a safety seat marveling at the tvsized computer display built into the dashboard while dad runs through its functions again and again delighting in every giggle that bursts from her lips coronary problems severely reduced my fathers income a few years ago so last yearon his sixtysixth birthdayi bought him a black bmw i with the royalties from my third novel i felt a little like elvis presley when i wrote that check and it was a good feeling my parents started life with nothing and in a single generation through hard work and sacrifice lived what was once unapologetically called the american dream they deserve some perks the flat brown fields of louisiana quickly give way to green wooded hills and somewhere to our left beyond the lush forest rolls the great brown river i cannot smell it yet but i feel it a subtle disturbance in the earths magnetic field a fluid force that shapes the surrounding land and souls i roll down the window and suck in the life smell of hardwood forest creek water kudzu bushhogged wildflowers and baking earth the competing aromas blend into a heady gestalt you couldnt find in houston if you gridsearched every inch of it on your hands and knees were losing the air conditioning dad complains sorry i roll up the window its been a long time since i smelled this place too damn long papa said a bad word annie cries bursting into giggles dad laughs then reaches back between the seats and slaps her on the knee the old landmarks hurtle by like location shots from a film st francisville where john james audubon painted his birds now home to a nuclear station the turnoff to angola penitentiary and finally the state line marked by a big blue billboard welcome to mississippi the magnolia state whats happening in natchez these days dad whips into the left lane and zooms past a log truck loaded from bumper to red flag with pulpwood a lot for a change looks like weve got a new factory coming in which is good because the battery plant is about dead what kind of factory chemical plant they want to put it in the new industrial park by the river south of the paper mill is it a done deal ill say its done when i see smoke coming from the stacks till then its all talk its like the casino boats every other month a new company talks about bringing another boat in but theres still just the one what else is happening big election coming up what kind mayoral for the first time in history theres a black candidate with a real chance to win youre kidding who is it shad johnson hes about your age his parents are patients of mine you never heard of him because they sent him north to prep school when he was a kid after that he went to howard university another damn lawyer just like you and he wants to be mayor of natchez badly he moved down here just to run and he may win whats the blackwhite split now registered voters fiftyone to forty nine in favor of whites the blacks usually have a low turnout but this election may be different in any case the key for johnson is white votes and he might actually get some hes been invited to join the rotary club the natchez rotary club times are changing and shad johnsons smart enough to exploit that im sure youll meet him soon the elections only five weeks away hell hell probably want an endorsement from you seeing how youre a celebrity now papa said another bad word annie chimes in but not too bad what did i say hell youre supposed to say heck dad laughs and slaps her on the knee again i want to stay lowprofile i say quietly this trip is strictly randr not much chance of that somebody already called the house asking for you right before i left was it cilia my assistant no a man he asked if youd got in yet when i asked who was calling he hung up the callerid box said out of area probably a reporter theyre going to turn the south upside down trying to find me because of the hanratty execution well do what we can to keep you incognito but the new newspaper publisher has called four times asking about getting an interview with you now that youre here you wont be able to avoid things like that not without people saying youve gone hollywood on us i sit back and assimilate this finding sanctuary in my old hometown might not be as easy as i thought but it will still be better than houston natchez is unlike any place in america existing almost outside time which is exactly what annie and i need in some ways it isnt part of mississippi at all theres no town square with a lone confederate soldier presiding over it no flat limitless delta horizon or provincial blue laws the oldest city on the mississippi river natchez stands white and pristine atop a twohundredfoot loess bluff the jewel in the crown of nineteenthcentury steamboat ports for as long as i can remember the population has been twentyfive thousand but after being ruled in turn by indians french british spanish confederates and americans her character is more cosmopolitan than cities ten times her size parts of new orleans remind me of natchez but only parts modern life long ago came to the crescent city and changed it forever two hundred miles upriver natchez exists in a ripple of time that somehow eludes the homogenizing influences of the present in natchez boasted more millionaires than any city in the united states save new york and philadelphia their fortunes were made on the cotton that poured like white gold out of the district and into the mills of england the plantations stretched for miles on both sides of the mississippi river and the planters who administered them built mansions that made margaret mitchells tara look like modest accommodations while their slaves toiled in the fields the princes of this new aristocracy sent their sons to harvard and their daughters to the royal courts of europe atop the bluff they held cotillions opened libraries and developed new strains of cotton two hundred feet below in the notorious under the hill district they raced horses traded slaves drank whored and gambled firmly establishing a tradition of libertinism that survives to the present and cementing the citys blacksheep status in a state known for its dry counties by an accident of topography the civil war left natchez untouched her bluff commanded a straightaway of the river rather than a bend so vicksburg became the critical naval choke point dooming that city to siege and destruction while undefended natchez made the best of union occupation in this way she joined in a charmed historical trinity with savannah and charleston the quintessentially southern cities that survived the war with their beauty intact it took the boll weevil to accomplish what war could not sending the city into depression after the turn of the century she sat preserved like a city in amber her mansions slowly deteriorating until the s when her society ladies began opening their once great houses to the public in an annual ritual called the pilgrimage the money that poured in allowed them to restore the mansions to their antebellum splendor and soon yankees and europeans traveled by thousands to this living museum of the old south in oil was discovered practically beneath the city and a second boom was on black gold replaced white and overnight millionaires again walked the azalealined streets as delirious with prosperity as if they had stepped from the pages of scott fitzgerald i grew up in the midst of this boom and benefited from the affluence it generated but by the time i graduated law school the oil industry was collapsing leaving natchez to survive on the revenues of tourism and federal welfare money it was a hard adjustment for proud people who had never had to chase northern factories or kowtow to the state of which they were nominally a part whats that i ask pointing at an upscale residential development far south of where i remember any homes white flight dad replies everythings moving south subdivisions the country club look theres another one another grouping of homes materializes behind a thin screen of oak and pine looking more like suburban houston than the romantic town i remember then i catch sight of mammys cupboard and i feel a reassuring wave of familiarity in my chest mammys is a restaurant built in the shape of a negro mammy in a red hoop skirt and bandanna painted to match hattie mcdaniel from gone with the wind she stands atop her hill like a giant sculptured doll beckoning travelers to dine in the cozy space beneath her domed skirts anyone who has never seen the place inevitably slows to gape it makes the brown derby in la look prosaic the car crests a high ridge and seems to teeter upon it as an ocean of treetops spreads out before us stretching west to infinity beyond the river the great alluvial plain of louisiana lies so far below the high ground of natchez that only the smoke plume from the paper mill betrays the presence of man in that direction the car tips over on the long descent into town passing st stephens the allwhite prep school i attended and a dozen businesses that look just as they did twenty years ago at the junction of highways and stands the jefferson davis memorial hospital now officially known by a more politically correct name but for all time the jeff to the doctors of my fathers generation and to the hundreds of other people both black and white who worked or were born there it all looks the same i murmur it is and it isnt dad replies what do you mean youll see my parents still live in the same house in which they raised me while other young professionals moved on to newer subdivisions restored victorian gingerbreads or even antebellum palaces downtown my father clung stubbornly to the ashpaneled library hed appended to the suburban tract house he bought in whenever my mother got the urge to move to more stately mansions he added to the existing structure giving her the space she claimed we needed and a decorating project on which to expend her fitful energies as the bmw pulls up to the house i imagine my mother waiting inside she always wanted me to succeed in the larger world but it broke her heart when sarah and i settled in houston seven hours is too far to drive on a regular basis and mom dislikes flying still the tie between us is such that distance means little when i was a boy people always told me i was like my father that id got my fathers brain but it is my mother who has the rare combination of quantitative aptitude and intuitive imagination that i was lucky enough to inherit dad shuts off the engine and unstraps annie from her safety seat as i unload our luggage from the trunk i see a shadow standing motionless against the closed curtain of the dining room my mother then another shadow moves behind the curtain who else would be here it cant be my sister jenny is a visiting professor at trinity college in dublin ireland who else is here wait and see dad says cryptically i carry two suitcases to the porch then go back for annies bag the second time i reach the porch my mother is standing in the open door all i can see before she rises on tiptoe and pulls me into her arms is that she has stopped coloring her hair and the gray is a bit of a shock welcome home she whispers in my ear she pulls back her hands gripping my upper arms and looks hard at me youre still not eating are you all right i dont know annie cant seem to get past what happened and i dont know how to help her she squeezes my arms with a strength i have never seen fail thats what grandmothers are for everythings going to be all right starting right this minute at sixtythree my mother is still beautiful but not with the delicate comeliness that fills so many musketandmagnolia romances beneath the tanned skin and donna karan dress are the bone and sinew and humor of a girl who made the social journey from the h club to the garden club without forgetting her roots she could take tea with royalty and commit no faux pas yet just as easily twist the head off a banty hen boil the bristles off a hog or kill an angry copperhead with a hoe blade its that toughness that worries me now mom whats wrong on the phone shh well talk later she blinks back tears then pushes me into the house and takes annie from dads arms heres my angel lets get some supper and no yucky broccoli annie squeals with excitement theres somebody waiting to see you penn mom says i pull the suitcases inside a wide doorway in the foyer leads to the dining room and i stop dead when i see who is there standing beside the long table is a black woman as tall as i and fifty years older her mouth is set in a tight smile and her eyes twinkle with joy ruby i cry setting the bags on the floor and walking toward her what in the world todays her day off mom explains from behind me i called to check on her and when she heard you were coming she demanded that tom come get her so she could see you and that grandbaby ruby says pointing at annie in peggys arms i hug the old woman gently its like hugging a bundle of sticks ruby flowers came to work for us in and except for one lifethreatening illness never missed a single workday until arthritis forced her to slow down thirty years later even then she begged my father to give her steroid injections to allow her to keep doing her heavy workthe ironing and scrubbingbut he refused instead he kept her on at full pay but limited her to sorting socks washing the odd load of clothes and watching the soaps on television im sorry about your wife ruby says cept for losing a child that the hardest thing i give her an extra squeeze now let me see that baby come here child i wonder if annie will remember ruby or be frightened by the old woman even if she does i should have known better ruby flowers radiates nothing to frighten a small child she is like a benevolent witch from an african folk tale and annie goes to her without the slightest hesitation i cooked your daddy his favorite dinner ruby says hugging annie tight and after tonight its gonna be your favorite too at the center of the table sits a plate heaped with chicken shallowfried to a peppered gold ive watched ruby make that chicken a thousand times and never once use more than salt pepper flour and crisco with those four ingredients she creates a flavor and texture that harland sanders couldnt touch with his best pressure cooker i snatch up a wing and take a bite of white meat crispy outside and moist within it bursts in my mouth with intoxicating familiarity go slap your daddys hand ruby cries and annie quickly obeys yall sit down and eat proper ill get the iced tea ill get the tea mom says heading for the kitchen before ruby can start make your plate ruby tonight youre a guest our family says grace only at thanksgiving and christmas and then almost as a formality but with ruby present no one dares reach for a fork would you like to return thanks ruby dad asks the old woman shakes her head her eyes shining with mischief i wish youd do it dr cage you give a fine blessing thirtyeight years of practicing medicine has stripped my father of the stern religious carapace grafted onto him in the baptist churches of his youth but when pressed he can deliver a blessing that vies with the longestwinded of deacons for flowery language and detail he seems about to deliver one of these with tongueincheek overtones added for my benefit but my mother halts him with a touch of her hand she bows her head and everyone at the table follows suit father she says its been far too long since weve given thanks to you in this house tonight we thank you for the return of our son who has been away too long we give thanks for anna louise cage our beautiful grandchild and pray that we may bring her as much happiness as she brings to us each day she pauses a brief caesura that focuses everyones concentration we also commend the soul of sarah louise cage to your care and pray that she abides in thy grace forever i take annies hand under the table and squeeze it we dont pretend to understand death here mom continues softly we ask only that you let this young family heal and be reconciled to their loss this is a house of love and we humbly ask grace in thy names sake amen as we echo the amen dad and i look at each other across the table moved by my mothers passion but not its object in matters religious i am my fathers son having no faith in a just god or any god at all if you shake me awake at four am and put the question to me there have been times i would have given anything for such faith for the belief that divine justice exists somewhere in the universe facing sarahs death without it was an existential baptism of fire the comfort that belief in an afterlife can provide was obvious in the hospital waiting rooms and chemo wards where patients or family members often asked outright if i was saved i always smiled and nodded so as to avoid a philosophical argument that would benefit no one and wondered if the question was an eccentricity of southern hospitals in the pacific northwest they probably offer you crystals or lists of alternative healers i have no regrets about letting sarah raise annie in a church though sometimes the image of her mother in heaven is all that keeps my daughter from despair as dad passes around the mustard greens and cheese grits and beer biscuits another memory rises unbidden one cold hour before dawn sitting beside sarahs hospital bed i fell to my knees and begged god to save her the words formed in my mind without volition strung together with strangely baroque formality who have not believed since i was a child who have not crossed a church threshold to worship since i was thirteen who since the age of reason have admitted nothing greater than man or nature ask in all humility that you spare the life of this woman i ask not for myself but for the child i am not qualified to raise alone as soon as i realized what i was thinking i stopped and got to my feet who was i talking to faith is something you have or you dont and to pretend you do in the hope of gaining some lastminute dispensation from a being whose existence you have denied all your life goes against everything i am i have never placed myself above god i simply cannot find within myself the capacity for belief yet when sarah finally died a dark seed took root in my mind as irrational as it is a profoundly disturbing idea haunts me that on the night that prayer blinked to life in my tortured mind a chance beyond the realm of the temporal was granted me and i did not take it that i was tested and found wanting my rational mind tells me i held true to myself and endured the pain as all pain must be enduredalone but my heart says otherwise since that day i have been troubled by a primitive suspicion that in some cosmic account book in some dusty ledger of karmic debits and credits sarahs life has been charged against my account whats the matter daddy annie asks nothing punkin youre crying penn my mother says half rising from her chair im all right i assure her wiping my eyes im just glad to be here thats all ruby reaches out and closes an arthritic hand over mine you should have come back months ago you know where home is i nod and busy myself with my knife and fork you think too much to be left alone ruby adds you always did amen dad agrees now lets eat before my beeper goes off that beeper aint gonna ring during this meal ruby says with quiet certainty dont worry bout that none did you take out the batteries dad asks checking the pager i just know ruby replies i just know i believe her my mother and i sit facing each other across the kitchen counter drinking wine and listening for my fathers car in the driveway he left after dinner to take ruby home to the black section north of town but putting annie to bed took up most of the time i expected him to be away mom i sensed something on the phone youve got to tell me whats wrong she looks at me over the rim of her glass im worried about your father a sliver of ice works its way into my heart not more blockage in his coronary vessels no i think tom is being blackmailed i am dumbfounded nothing she could have said would have surprised me more my father is a man of such integrity that the idea seems utterly ridiculous tom cage is a modernday atticus finch or as close as a man can get to that southern ideal in the dog days of the twentieth century what has he done i mean that someone could blackmail him over he hasnt told me then how do you know thats what it is she disposes of my question with a glance peggy cage knows more about her husband and children than we know ourselves well whos blackmailing him i think it might be ray presley do you remember him the skin on my forearms tingles ray presley was a patient of my father for years and a more disturbing character i have never met not even in the criminal courts of houston born in sullivans hollow one of the toughest areas of mississippi presley migrated to south louisiana where he reputedly worked as hired muscle for new orleans crime boss carlos marcello he later hired on as a police officer in natchez and quickly put his old skills to use brutal and clever his specialty was vigorous interrogation offduty he haunted the fringes of natchezs business community doing favors of dubious legality for wealthy men around town helping them deal with business or family troubles when conventional measures proved inadequate when i was in grade school presley was busted for corruption and served time in parchman prison which to everyones surprise he survived upon his release he focused exclusively on private security work and it was generally known that he had murdered at least three men for money all outoftown jobs what could ray presley have on dad mom looks away im not sure you must have some idea my suspicions have more to do with me than with your father i think thats why tom wont just tell presley to go to hell i think it involves my family my mothers parents both died years ago and her sisterafter two tempestuous marriagesrecently married a wealthy surgeon in florida what could presley possibly know about your family im not sure even if i knew tom would have to be the one to tell you if he wont how can i help if i dont know whats happening your father has a lot of pride you know that how much is pride worth over a hundred thousand dollars apparently my stomach rolls like im falling through the dark tell me youre kidding i wish i were clearly tom would rather go broke than let us know whats going on mom this is crazy why do you think its presley tom talks in his sleep now about five months ago he started eating less losing weight then i got a call from bill hiatt at the bank he hemmed and hawed but he finally told me tom had been making large withdrawals cashing in cds and absorbing penalties well its going to stop i dont care what he did ill get him out of it and ill get presley thrown under a jail for extortion she laughs her voice riding an undercurrent of hysteria what is it ray presley doesnt care about jail hes dying of cancer the word is like a cockroach crawling over my bare foot which is almost convenient mom goes on but not quite hes taking his sweet time about it ive seen him on the street and he doesnt even look sick except for the hair hes bald now but he still looks like he could ride a bull ragged i jump at the sound of the garage door mom gives me a little wave then crosses the kitchen as silently as if she were floating on a magic carpet and disappears down the hall moments later my father walks through the kitchen door his face drawn and tired i figured youd be waiting for me dad weve got to talk dread seems to seep from the pores in his face let me get a drink ill meet you in the library chapter all my life whenever problems of great import required discussionhealth family money marriagethe library was the place it was done yet my positive feelings about the room far outweigh my anxieties the ashpaneled library is so much a part of my fathers identity that he carries its scent wherever he goesan aroma of fine wood cigar smoke aging leather and whiskey born to workingclass parents he spent the first real money he made to build this room and fill it with books aristotle to zoroaster and everything in between with a special emphasis on the military campaigns of the civil war i feel more at home here than anywhere in the world in this room i educated myself discovered my gift for language learned that the larger world lay not across oceans but within the human mind and heart years spent in this room made law school relatively simple and becoming a writer possible even necessary dad enters through a different door carrying a bourbonandwater brown enough to worry me we each take one of the leather recliners which are arranged in the classic bourgeois style side by side facing the television he clips the end of a partagas licks the end so that it wont peel and lights it with a wooden match a cloud of blue smoke wafts toward the beamed ceiling dad i let me start he says staring across the room at his biographies most of them first editions son there comes a time in every mans life when he realizes that the people who raised him from infancy now require the favor to be returned whether they know it or not he stops to puff on the partagas this is something you do not yet have to worry about dad i am kindly telling you to mind your own business you and annie are welcome here for the next fifty years if you want to stay but youre not invited to pry into my private affairs i lean back in the recliner and consider whether i can honor my fathers request given what my mother told me i dont think so whats ray presley holding over you dad your mother talks too much you know thats not true she thinks youre in trouble and i can help you tell me what presley has on you he picks up his drink and takes a long pull closing his eyes against the anesthetic fire of the bourbon i wont have this he says quietly i dont want to ask the next questionid hoped never to raise this subject againbut i must is it something like what you did for sarah helping somebody at the end my father sighs like a man who has lived a thousand years thats a rare situation and when things reach that point the familys so desperate to have the horror and pain removed from the patients last hours that they look at you like an instrument of god he drinks and stares at his books lost in contemplation of something i cannot guess at he has aged a lot in the eighteen years since i left home his beard is no longer saltandpepper but silver white his skin is pale and dotted by dermatitis his joints eroded and swollen by psoriatic arthritis he is sixteen years past his triple bypass and counting and he recently survived the implantation of two stents to keep his cardiac vessels open all thisphysical maladies more severe than those of most of his patientshe bears with the resignation of job the wound that aged him most the one that has never quite healed was a wound to the soul and it came at the hands of another man when i was a freshman at ole miss my father was sued for malpractice the plaintiff had no case his father had died unexpectedly while under the care of my father and five specialists it was one of those inexplicable deaths that proved for the billionth time that medicine is an inexact science dad was as stunned as the rest of the medical community when judge leo marston the most prominent lawyer in town and a former state attorney general took the mans case and pressed it to the limit but no one was more shocked than i leo marston was the father of a girl i had loved in high school and whom i still think about more than is good for me why he should viciously attack my father was beyond my understanding but attack he did in a marathon of legal maneuvering that dragged on for fourteen months marston hounded my father through the legal system with a vengeance that appalled the town in the end dad was unanimously exonerated by a jury but by then the damage had been done for a physician of the old school medical practice is not a profession or even an art but the abiding passion of existence a brilliant boy is born to poor parents during the depression from childhood he works to put food on the table he witnesses privation and sickness not at a remove but face to face he earns a scholarship to college but must work additional jobs to cover his expenses he contracts with the army to pay for his medical education in exchange for years of military service after completing medical school with an exemplary record he does not ask himself the question every medical student today asks himself what do i wish to specialize in he is ready to go to work to begin treating patients to begin living for twenty years he practices medicine as though his patients are members of his family he makes small mistakes he is human but in twenty years of practice not one complaint is made to the state medical board or any legal claim made against him he is loved by his community and that love is his lifes bread to be accused of criminal negligence in the death of a patient stuns him like a war hero being charged with cowardice rumor runs through the community like a plague and truth is the first casualty his confidence in the tightness of his actions is absolute but after months of endlessly repeated allegations doubt begins to assail him a lifetime of good works seems to weigh as nothing compared to one unsubstantiated charge smiles on the street appear forced to him the greetings of neighbors cool stress works steadily and ruthlessly upon him finally culminating in a myocardial infarction which he barely survives six weeks later the trial begins and its like stepping into the eye of a hurricane control rests in the hands of lawyers men with murky motives and despicable tactics expert witnesses secondguess every medical decision he sits alone in the witness box condemned before family friends and community crossexamined as though he were a child murderer when the jury finds in his favor he feels no joy he feels like a man who has just lost both legs being told he is lucky to be alive could the presentday blackmail somehow be tied to that calamitous case i have never understood the reason for leo marstons attack and ive always felt that my fatheragainst his naturemust have been keeping the truth from me my mother believes ray presley is behind the blackmail and i recall that judge marston often hired presley to do security work when i was in high school this translated into acting as unofficial babysitter for marstons teenage daughter olivia who was also my lover i remember nights when presleys truck would swing by whatever hangout the kids happened to be frequenting its hatchetfaced driver glaring from the window making sure livy didnt get into any serious trouble one night presley actually pulled up behind my car in the woods and rapped on the fogged windows terrifying livy and me i still remember his face peering into the clear circle i rubbed on the window to look out his eyes bright and ferretlike searching the backseat for a sight of livy unclothed the hunger in those eyes does this have anything to do with leo marston i ask softly dad flinches from his reverie even now the judges name has the power to harm marston he echoes still staring at his books what makes you say that its one of the only things ive never understood about your life why marston went after you he shakes his head ive never known why he did it id done nothing wrong any physician could see that the jury saw it too thank god youve never heard anything since about why he took the case or pressed it so hard to tell you the truth son i always had the feeling it had something to do with you you and olivia he turns to me his eyes not accusatory but plainly questioning i am too shocked to speak for a moment that thats impossible i stammer i mean nothing really bad ever happened between livy and me it was the trial that drove the last nail into our relationship maybe that was marstons goal all along to drive you two apart this thought occurred to me nineteen years ago but i discounted it livy abandoned me long before her father took on that malpractice case dad shrugs as if it were all meaningless now who knows why people do anything im going to go see presley i tell him if thats what i have to do to you stay away from that son of a bitch any problems i have ill deal with my own way he downs the remainder of his bourbon one way or another what does that mean his eyes are blurry with fatigue and alcohol yet somehow sly beneath all that dont worry about it i am suddenly afraid that my father is contemplating suicide his death would nullify any leverage presley has over him and also provide my mother with a generous life insurance settlement to a desperate man this might well seem like an elegant solution dad go to bed son take care of your little girl thats what being a fathers all about sparing your kids what hell you can for as long as you can and annies already endured her share we turn to the door at the same moment each sensing a new presence in the room a tiny shadow stands there annie she seems conjured into existence by the mention of her name i woke up by myself she says her voice tiny and fearful why did you leave daddy i go to the door and sweep her into my arms she feels so light sometimes that it frightens me hollowboned like a bird i needed to talk to papa punkin everythings fine hello sweet pea dad says from his chair you make daddy take you to bed i linger in the doorway hoping somehow to draw out a confidence but he gives me nothing i leave the library with annie in my arms knowing i will not sleep but knowing also that until my father opens up to me there is little i can do to help him chapter my fathers prediction about media attention proves prescient within fortyeight hours of my arrival calls about interviews join the ceaseless ringing of patients calling my father my mother has taken messages from the local newspaper publisher radio talkshow hosts even the tv station in jackson the state capital two hours away i decide to grant an interview to caitlin masters the publisher of the natchez examiner on two conditions that she not ask questions about arthur lee hanrattys execution and that she print that i will be vacationing in new orleans until after the execution has taken place leaving annie with my motherwhich delights them bothi drive moms nissan downtown in search of biscuits and blues a new restaurant owned by a friend of mine but which i have never seen it was once said of american cities that you could judge their character by their tallest buildings were they offices or churches at a mere seven stories the eola hotel is the tallest commercial structure in natchez its verdigrisencrusted roof peaks well below the graceful copperclad spire of st mary minor basilica natchezs skyline barely rises out of a green canopy of oak leaves the silver dome of the synagogue the steeple of the presbyterian church the roofs of antebellum mansions and stately public buildings below the canopy a soft and filtered sunlight gives the sense of an enormous glassedin garden biscuits and blues is a threestory building on main with a large secondfloor balcony overlooking the street a young woman stands talking on a cell phone just inside the doorwhere caitlin masters promised to meet mebut i dont think shes the newspaper publisher she looks more like a french tourist shes wearing a tailored black suit cream silk blouse and black sandals and she is clearly on the sunny side of thirty but as i check my watch she turns face on to me and i spot a hardcover copy of false witness cradled in her left arm i also see that shes wearing nothing under the blouse which is distractingly sheer she smiles and signals that shell be off the phone in a second her eyes flashing with quick intelligence i acknowledge her wave and wait beside the door im accustomed to young executives in book publishing but i expected something more conventional in the newspaper business especially in the south caitlin masters stands with her head cocked slightly her eyes focused in the middle distance the edge of her lower lip pinned by a pointed canine her skin is as white as bone china and without blemish shockingly white against her hair which is black as her silk suit and lies against her neck like a gleaming veil her face is a study in planes and angles high cheekbones strong jawline arched brows and a straight nose all uniting with almost architectural precision yet somehow escaping hardness she wears no makeup that i can see but her green eyes provide all the accent she needs they seem incongruous in a face that almost cries out for blue ones making her striking and memorable rather than merely beautiful as she ends her call she speaks three or four consecutive sentences and a strange chill runs through me ivy league boston alloyed with something softer a brahmin who spent her summers far away on the telephone this morning i didnt catch it but coupled with her face that voice transforms my suspicion to certainty caitlin masters is the woman i spoke to on the flight to baton rouge kate caitlin she holds out her hand to shake mine and i step back youre the woman from the plane kate her smile disappears replaced by embarrassment im surprised you recognize me dressed like i was that day you lied to me you told me you were a lawyer was that some kind of setup or what i didnt tell you i was a lawyer you assumed i was i told you i was a first amendment specialist and i am you knew what i thought and you let me think it you lied ms masters this interview is over as i turn to go she takes hold of my arm our meeting on that plane was a complete accident i want an interview with you but it wouldnt be worth that kind of trouble i was flying from atlanta to baton rouge and i happened to be sitting across the aisle from you end of story and you happened to be reading one of my novels no ive been trying to get your number from your parents for a couple of months a lot of people in mississippi are interested in you when the hanratty story broke i picked up one of your books in the airport its that simple i step away from the door to let a pair of middleaged women through then why not tell me who you were because when i was waiting to board i was sitting by the pay phones i heard you tell someone you didnt want to talk to reporters for any reason i knew if i told you i was a newspaper publisher you wouldnt talk to me well i guess you got your inside scoop on how i killed hanrattys brother she draws herself erect offended now i havent printed a word of what you told me and i dont plan to despite appearances to the contrary my journalistic ethics are beyond reproach why were you dressed so differently on the plane she actually laughs at this id just given a seminar to a group of editors in atlanta my father was there and i try to be a bit more conventional when hes around i can see her point not many fathers would approve of the blouse shes wearing today look she says i could have had that story on the wire an hour after you told it to me i didnt tell a soul what better proof of trustworthiness could anyone give you maybe youre saving it for one big article you dont have to tell me anything you dont want to in fact we could just eat lunch and you can decide if you want to do the interview another time or not her candid manner strikes a chord in me perhaps shes manipulating me but i dont think so we came to do an interview lets do it the airplane thing threw me thats all me too she says with a smile i liked annie by the way thanks she liked you too as we step into the main dining space of the restaurant a smattering of applause starts then fills the room i look around to see whose birthday it is then realize that the applause is for me a little celebrity goes a long way in mississippi i recognize familiar faces in the crowd some belong to guys i went to school with now carrying twenty or thirty extra poundsas i did until sarahs illnessothers to friends of my parents or simply wellwishers i smile awkwardly and give a little wave to cover the room i told you says caitlin theres a lot of interest itll wear off as soon as they realize im the same guy who left theyll be yawning in my face when we arrive at our table she stands stiffly behind her chair her eyes twinkling with humor youre not going to pull my chair out for me you didnt look the type she laughs and takes her seat i wasnt before i got here pampering corrupts you fast while we study the menus a collection of classic cajun dishes i try to fathom how caitlin masters wound up in the job she has the examiner has always been a conservative paper owned when i was a boy by a family that printed nothing that reflected negatively upon city worthies later it was sold to a familyowned newspaper chain which continued the tradition of offending as few citizens as possible especially those who bought advertising space in natchez the gossip mills have always been a lot more accurate than anything you could find in the examiner caitlin seems an improbable match to say the least she closes her menu and smiles engagingly im younger than you thought id be arent i a little i reply trying not to look at her chest in mississippi wearing a blouse that sheer without a bra is practically a request to be arrested my father owns the chain im doing a tour of duty down here to learn the ropes ah one mystery cleared up okay if we go on the record now you have a tape recorder i never use them i take out a sony microcassette recorder borrowed from my father the bitter fruit of experience our waitress appears and takes our orders crawfish beignets and iced tea for us both then stands awkwardly beside the table as though waiting for something she looks about twenty and though not quite in caitlin masterss league is quite lovely where masters is angles and light the waitress is round and brown and sultry with the guarded look of the cajun in her eyes yes caitlin says looking up at her um i was wondering if mr cage would sign a book for me sure i tell her do you have one with you welli live over the restaurant her voice is hesitant and terribly selfconscious just temporarily you know i have all your books up there really id be glad to sign them for you thanks a lot um ill get your iced tea now as she walks away caitlin gives me a wry smile what does a few years of that do for your ego water off a ducks back lets start she gives me a look that says yeah right then picks up her notebook so are you here for a visit or is this something more permanent i honestly have no idea call it a visit youve obviously been living a life of emotional extremes this past year your last book riding high on the bestseller list your wife dying how that subjects off limits i say curtly feeling a door slam somewhere in my soul im sorry her eyes narrow like those of a surgeon judging the pain of a probe i didnt mean to upset you wait a minute you asked on the plane if my wife was traveling with me did you know then that she was dead caitlin looks at the table i knew your wife had died i didnt know how recently i saw the ring she folds her hands on the table then looks up her eyes vulnerable i didnt ask that question as a reporter i asked it as a woman if that makes me a terrible person i apologize i find myself more intrigued than angered by this confession this woman asked about my wife to try to read how badly i miss her by my reaction and i believe she asked out of her own curiosity not for a story im not sure what that makes you are you going to focus on that sort of thing in your article absolutely not lets go on then what made you stop practicing law and take up writing novels the hanratty case i navigate this part of the interview on autopilot probably learning more about caitlin masters than she learns about me i guessed right about her education radcliffe as an undergrad columbia school of journalism for her masters top of the line all the way she is well read and articulate but her questions reveal that she knows next to nothing about the modern south like most transplants to natchez she is an outsider and always will be its a shame she holds a job that needs an insiders perspective the lunch crowd thins as we talk and our waitress gives such excellent service that our concentration never wavers by the time we finish our crawfish the restaurant is nearly empty and a busboy is setting the tables for dinner where did you get your ideas about the south i ask gently at last caitlin adjusts the lapels of her black silk jacket covering the shadowy edge of aureole that has been visible throughout lunch i was born in virginia she says with a hint of defensiveness my parents divorced when i was five though mother got custody and spirited me back to massachusetts for the next twelve years all i heard about the south was her trashing it so the first chance you got you headed south to see for yourself whether we were the clovenhoofed misogynistic degenerates your mother warned you about something like that and im reserving my judgment thats kind of you do you like natchez i do its not sterilized or disneyfied like williamsburg its still funky gossip sex whisky and eccentricity all behind a gossamer veil of southern gentility i chuckle a woman i grew up with decided to move back here after working ten years as a film producer in los angeles when i asked why she told me she was worried that she was losing her mind and knew that if she did it in natchez no one would notice caitlin laughs thats exactly it what about you do you like it thats like asking someone if they like their mother ive been away for years but no one who grows up here ever really leaves this town behind she makes a note on her pad i was surprised its such a haven for gays but the contrasts are disturbing youve got a real race problem here so does los angeles but this is a purely whiteblack race problem and your paper contributes to it she reddens would you care to elaborate on that sure the examiner has never dug beneath the surface never urged people toward their better natures it was always too afraid to upset the white elite you think i dont know that you talk like you dont trust me i do let me ask you something ive been following local politics pretty closely and theres something funny going on like youd think shad johnson the black candidate would be making race a major issue trying to mobilize every black vote hows he playing it hes not even mentioning race hes in the former money capital of the slaveholding south thirty percent of the black population receives some form of public assistance and he acts like hes running for mayor of utopia everything is new south brotherhood of man hes running as a republican for christs sake sounds like a shrewd guy will african americans vote for him if he sucks up to the white vote like that i cant help but laugh if johnson is the only black man in the race local blacks will vote for him if he buggers a mule at high noon on the courthouse lawn two pink moons appear high on caitlins cheeks i cant believe you said that and i cant believe johnson would stand for the way things are the things i hear around here sitting in restaurants riding in cars with people ive heard the nword a thousand times since ive been here youd hear it in manhattan if you rode in the right cars look id really rather not get into this i spent eight years in the houston courts listening to more bullshit about race than i ever want to hear she shakes her head with apparent disgust thats such a copout racism is the most important problem in america today caitlin you are a very rich very white girl preaching about black problems youre not the first sometimes you have to let people save themselves and youre a very white guy putting black men on death row for statesanctioned murder only when they kill people only when they kill white people you mean a surge of anger runs through me but i force myself to stay silent theres nothing to be gained by pointing out that arthur lee hanratty is a white supremacist or that i once freed a black man who had been mistakenly put on death row by a colleague of mine you cant win an argument like this we stare at each other like two fighters after a flurry of punches deciding whether to wade in again or rest on the ropes hanrattys an exception caitlin says as though reading my mind this lady is dangerous it may be a cliche but her anger has brought color to her cheeks and fire into her eyes and i am suddenly sure that a string of broken hearts lie in the wake of this selfassured young woman i want to understand this penn she says with utter sincerity i need to ive read a hundred books by southern writers southern journalists everything and i still dont get it thats because its not a southern problem dont you think the answer must be wrapped up in the south somehow no not the way you think anyway its been thirty years since the last vestiges of segregation were remedied under the law and theres a growing feeling that blacks have done damn little to take advantage of that that theyve been given special breaks and blown it every time that they dont want an even playing field but their turn on top white america looks at the vietnamese the irish the jews and they say whats the problem with the blacks the resentment you hear around this town is based on that not on old ideas of superiority do you feel that way i used to i dont anymore why not the indians indians you mean native americans think about it indians are the only minority thats had as much trouble as blacks why both races had their cultures shattered by the white man all the other groupsirish italians vietnamese whatevermay have come here destitute but they brought one thing with them their national identities their sense of self they congregated together in the cities and on the plains like with like they maintained their cultural identitiesreligions customs namesuntil they were secure enough to assimilate blacks had no chance to do that they were stolen from their country brought here in chains sold as property their families were split their religion beaten out of them their names changed nothing was left no identity and theyve never recovered and you parallel that with native americans its the same experience only in reverse the indians werent stolen from their land their land was stolen from them and their culture was systematically destroyed theyve never recovered either despite a host of government programs to help them caitlin stops writing thats an interesting analogy if you dont know who you are you cant find your way there are exceptions of course bright spots but my point is that whites dont look at blacks with the right perspective we look at them like an immigrant group that cant get its shit together she takes a sip of tea as she processes this perspective does shad johnson have the right idea then should natchez simply sweep its past under the rug and push ahead for johnson its the smart line to take for the town i dont know please try to answer i think its important if i do we go off the record she doesnt look happy but she wants her answer okay faulkner thought the land itself had been cursed by slavery i dont agree i pause feeling the writers special frustration at trying to embody moral complexities in words have you ever read karl jung a little in college synchronicity all that jung didnt try to separate good and evil he knew that both exist in every human heart he called the propensity to evil the shadow and he believed that trying to deny or repress the shadow is dangerous because it cant be done he believed you have to recognize your shadow come to grips with it accept it and integrate it make friends with the evil in yourself basically and the south has never done that weve never truly acknowledged the crime of slaverynot in our collective soul its a bit like germany and the holocaust only slavery is much further in the past modern generations feel no guilt over it and its easy to see why theres no tangible connection slave owners were a tiny minority and most southerners see no larger complicity how does the white south acknowledge the crime itll never happen thats whats scary about what shad johnson is doing because the day of reckoning always comes when everything youve tried to repress rears up in the road to meet you whatever you bury deepest is always waiting for the moment of greatest stress to explode to the surface youre the only white person in this town whos said anything like this to me how did you turn out so different thats a story for another day but i want you to be clear that i think the north is as guilty as the south when it comes to blacks you dont really believe that youre damn right i do i may criticize the south when im in it but when im in the north i defend mississippi to the point of blows prejudice in the north isnt as open but its just as destructive most yankees have no concept of living in a towni mean in a townthat is fifty percent black no idea of the warmth that can exist between black and white on a daily basis and has here for years oh come on what happened in boston when they tried busing thats a different issue watts detroit skokie rodney king oj she sighs are we going to refight the civil war here how long have you lived here caitlin sixteen months you could live here sixteen years and youd still be on the outside and you cant understand this place until you see it from the inside youre talking about the social cliques not exactly society is different here its not just tiers of wealth old money may run out but the power lingers blood still means something down here not to me but to a lot of people sounds like boston i imagine it is the structure is concentric circles and as you move toward the center the levels of knowledge increase were your parents born here no but my fathers a doctor and doctors get a backstage pass probably because their profession puts them in a position to learn secrets anyway and there are a thousand secrets in this town name one well what about the del payton case whos del payton delano payton was a black factory worker who got blown up in his car outside the triton battery plant in it was a race murder like a dozen others in mississippi only it was never solved im not sure anybody really tried to solve it payton was a decorated combat veteran of the korean war and ill bet you a thousand dollars were sitting within five miles of his murderers right now excitement and awe fill her eyes are you serious did the examiner cover the murder i dont know i was eight years old then i do know dan rather came down with a half dozen network correspondents the fbi was up in arms and two of their agents were shot at on the road between here and jackson why was payton murdered he was about to be hired for a job that until then had been held exclusively by whites the police must have had some idea who did it everybody knew who did it racist cowards motivated by the tacit encouragement of white leaders who knew better a year before they bombed another black guy at the same plant but he survived my father treated him this guy was on the hospital phone with bobby kennedy every day had guards all around his room the works this is great stuff my aunt went to school with bobby her selfcentered dilettantism finally puts me over the edge caitlin youre so transparent you want to hear the same thing every other northern journalist wants to hear that the klan is alive and well that the south is as gothic and demonic as it ever was terrible things did happen here in the sixties and people who knew better turned a blind eye as a boy i watched the klan march robed on horseback right out there on main street city police directed traffic for them but that has nothing to do with natchez as it is today how can you say that you want to assign guilt the examiner printed the time of that klan march but refused to print the time or location of a single civil rights meeting is the examiner the same newspaper it was then she ignores the question why havent i heard people talking about the payton case before even the african americans dont talk about it because if you live here you want to make the best life you can stirring up the past doesnt help anybody but cases like this are being reopened every day right here in mississippi the byron de la beckwith case the retrial of sam bowers the klan wizard from laurel you must know that the state recently opened the secret files of the mississippi sovereignty commission so the sovereignty commission was like a racist kgb they kept files not only on african americans but on hundreds of whites suspected of liberal sympathies so caitlin looks at me in bewilderment so newsweek just ran a big piece on it and peter jenningss people have been calling around the state trolling for stories the payton case could be reopened at any time glad to hear it justice should be better served than it was in natchez in but this isnt some old trial with an allwhite hung jury this is an unsolved murder a capital murder no defendant no suspects as far as i know no crime scene old or dead witnesses nobody said winning a pulitzer is easy a light clicks on in my head ah thats the plan winning a pulitzer before youre thirty she gives me a sly smile before im twentynine thats the plan god help this town her laugh is full and throaty one id expect from an older woman did you know that some of the sovereignty commission files are going to remain sealed no fortytwo of them some of them on major politicians i heard trent lotts was one of them but that turned out to be wrong thats no surprise a lot of the most sensitive files were destroyed years ago why havent you explored any of this in your novels a sense of loyalty to the place that bore me i suppose a lot of people would have to die before i could write a book like that so until then you write fluff and take the easy money i dont write fluff she holds up her hands in contrition i know i did a nexis search on you publishers weekly named false witness the fourthbest legal thriller ever written after what anatomy of a murder the caine mutiny and presumed innocent thats pretty good company i murmur painfully aware that false witness was four books ago yes but it just seems so obvious that you should be writing about all this write what you know you know caitlin picks up the check and walks over to the cash register her movements fluid and graceful despite the phenomenal energy that animates her the restaurant is empty now but for the cashier and our waitress who chooses this moment to come forward with her copy of false witness i take the book open it to the flyleaf and accept the pen she offers would you like me to personalize it wow that would be great um to jenny thats me no last name just jenny would be cool i write jenny i enjoyed meeting you penn cage she blushes as she takes back the book then glances at caitlin who stands waiting for me id love to talk to you sometime she says in a quavering voice ask you some questions maybe i recognize the nervous tones of an aspiring writer ill be in again a friend of mine owns the place wow okay thanks i join caitlin as she walks out onto the brightly lit street did you get enough for your piece more than enough she tucks her copy of false witness under one arm and buttons her jacket ap will probably pick it up and itll be reprinted all over the south they like fluff as much as anybody i sigh wearily im joking penn god take it easy would you i guess im a little tense a little she takes false witness in both hands then bends at the waist and touches the book flat against the sidewalk displaying a limberness that makes my back hurt and draws looks from several passersby mmm i needed that if i tried that theyd hear tendons popping across the river she smiles not if you practiced we should do this again you can be deep background on southern crime and psychology i start to decline then surprise myself by saying i might be able to help you with that her eyes sparkle with pleasure ill call you and im sorry again about the airplane tell annie i said hello she holds out her hand and i take it not thinking anything of it and so being all the more surprised by the shock i feel when our eyes meet we recognize something in each other that neither expects and both quickly look away from the story will probably run wednesday in the southern life section she says in a flustered voice and awkwardly releases my hand ill mail some copies to your parents im sure your mom still clips everything about you absolutely caitlin masters looks at me once more then turns and walks quickly to a green miata parked across the street with its top down i am acutely aware of her physical presence even across the street and inexplicably glad that she suggested another lunch with that gladness comes a rush of guilt so strong that it nauseates me seven months ago i was standing at my wifes deathbed then her coffin seven seconds ago i felt something for another woman this small and natural response causes me more guilt than sleeping with a woman out of physical necessitywhich i have not yet done because what i felt was more than physical a glacier consumes whole forests by inches as small as it is that glimmer of feeling is absolute proof that someone else will one day occupy the place sarah held in my life i feel like a traitor chapter my father wakes me by slapping a newspaper against my forehead after i rub the sleep from my eyes i see my own face staring up from the front page of the natchez examiner above the fold theyve scanned my most recent author photo and blown it up to this man assassinated the president size the headline reads prodigal son returns home the goddamn phone hasnt stopped ringing dad growls everybody wants to know why my son is disparaging his hometown beneath the author photo is a montage of smaller shots like a family album me as a lanky kid with dads arm around my shoulders printed in a fathers day issue in as a high school baseball player as the flag runner in the annual confederate pageant my ole miss graduation photo i quickly scan the columns recognizing most of what i said yesterday laid out in surprisingly faithful prose i dont get it i say whats wrong with this have you been in houston so long youve forgotten how things are here bill humphreys said you set back thirty years of good race relations i didnt say anything you havent said a hundred times in our kitchen the newspaper isnt our kitchen come on dad this is nothing he shakes his head in amazement turn the page hotshot youll see something when i turn the page my breath catches in my throat the banner headline reads years later racist cowards still walk streets my stomach flips over underneath the headline is a photo of a scorched ford fairlane with a blackened corpse seated behind the wheel that picture never ran in the natchez examiner in caitlin masters must have dug up an old crimescene photo somewhere jesus i whisper harvey byrd at the chamber of commerce thinks you may have singlehandedly sabotaged the chemicalplant deal let me read the thing okay dad plants himself in the corner his arms folded the story opens like a truecrime novel on may frank jones a scheduling clerk at the triton battery plant walked out to his car in the middle of the third shift to run an errand before he could start his engine he heard a boom like an artillery piece and a blackwall tire slammed into his windshield thirty yards away a black man named delano payton sat burning to death jones was the sole eyewitness to the worst race crime in the history of this city in which a combat veteran of the korean war was murdered to prevent his being promoted to a whiteonly job no one was ever arrested for the crime and many in the black community believe that law enforcement officials of the period gave less than their full efforts to the case bestselling author and natchez native penn cage characterized the killers of delano payton as racist cowards and stated that justice should be better served than it was in natchez in former police chief hiram wilkes contended that leads were nonexistent at the time and said that despite exhaustive efforts by law enforcement and a reward offered by paytons national labor union no suspects were turned up the fbi was called in to work the case but had no more success than local police former natchez police officer ray presley who assisted on the case in the spring of stated it was a tough murder case and the fbi got in the way more than they helped which was par for them in those days i reread the last sentence my heartbeat accelerating i had no idea ray presley was involved in the payton case i want to ask my father about him but with the blackmail issueand my mothers suspicions about presley hanging like a cloud between us i dont youve been dealing with the media for twelve years dad grumbles that publisher must have shown you a little leg and pureed your brain ive seen her around town face like a model tits like two puppies in a sack i know what happened it took her about five seconds to get penn cage at his most sanctimonious he grabs the newspaper out of my hands and wads it into a ball did you have to dredge up the goddamn payton case i just mentioned it for gods sake i thought we were off the record she obviously didnt i try to remember the point at which i asked to go off the record i can check my tape of course but i already know what caitlin masters will say she thought i wanted the jungian analysis and the comparison between germany and the south off the record but not the del payton remarks which were an extension of our earlier conversation on racism at least she honored my request not to mention the hanratty execution what about that klan rally stuff dad mutters you took me to that rally i know i know damn it i just wanted you to see that wasnt any way to be but you didnt have to drag it all back up now did you i made it clear that stuff was all in the past and she printed my qualifications ill give her that god almighty what a mess do you think the front doorbell rings cutting him off who the hell could that be he asks its only eightthirty he walks out of the bedroom taking the waddedup newspaper with him my thoughts return to caitlin masters despite her assurances i was foolish to say anything to her that i didnt want printed maybe she did show me a little leg and lull my usually vigilant defenses am i that easy to manipulate get some clothes on my father says from the door his face grave youve got visitors who you look almost scared he nods slowly i think i am uncertain what to expect i hover in the hall outside my mothers living room the hushed sibilance of gracious women making polite conversation drifts from the wide doorway i walk through the door and stop in my tracks two black women sit primly on the sofa delicate wedgwood cups steaming before them on the coffee table one is in her eighties if not older and dressed in an ensemble the like of which i have not seen since the sundays i drove past black churches as a teenager the skirt is purple the blouse green the shoes a gleaming patent black her hat is a flowered concoction of black straw and varicolored silk beneath the hat is a shining black wig beneath the wig a raisin of a face with watery eyes that glisten amid the wrinkles the woman beside her looks thirty years younger and wears a much more subdued outfit a pleated navy skirt with a periwinkle blouse she looks up and her gaze disconcerts me most black people i grew up with rarely made direct eye contact locking their feelings behind a veneer of humility but this womans gaze is unveiled direct and selfconfident you keep a fine house mrs cage the older woman says in a cracked voice a fine house youre so kind to say so my mother replies from a wing chair on the other side of the coffee table she wears a housecoat and no makeup yet even in this state radiates a quiet stately beauty she turns to me and smiles son this is mrs payton she gestures toward the elderly woman then nods at her younger companion and this is mrs payton also theyve come to thank you for what you said in this mornings paper i flush from my neck to the crown of my head i can only be looking at the widow and mother of delano payton the man bombed and burned to death in barefoot and unshaven i make a vain attempt to straighten my hair then advance into the living room without rising the elder mrs payton enfolds my right hand in both of hers like a dowager empress her palms feel like fine sandpaper the younger mrs payton stands and shakes my hand with exaggerated formality her hand is moist and warm up close she looks older than i first guessed perhaps sixtyfive because she has not gone to fat she projects an aura of youth that her eyes cannot match althea works in the nursery at st catherines hospital dad informs me from the door i see her all the time and ive treated miss georgia for thirtyfive years now yo daddy a good doctor the elder mrs payton says from the sofa pointing a bony finger at me a good doctor my father has heard this ten thousand times but he smiles graciously thank you miss georgia i remember you makin house calls late at night georgia payton goes on her voice reedy and difficult to follow as it jumps up and down the scale givin shots and deliverin babies had you a spotlight back then to see the house numbers and a pistol in my black bag dad adds chuckling sho did i seen it once you ever have to use it no maam thank god might have to one of these days with all this crack in the streets i told the pastor last sunday you want to find satan just pull up to one of them crack houses sheriff ought to burn ever one to the ground we all nod with enthusiasm doing our best to foster a casual atmosphere blacks visiting socially in white homesand vice versais still as rare as snowfall in natchez but this is not the reason for the general discomfort mr cage althea says focusing her liquid brown eyes on me we really appreciate you speaking out like you did in the paper please call me penn i implore her embarrassed by thanks for a few lines tossed off without any real feeling for the victims of the crime mr penn says georgia payton aint no white man in thirty years said what you said in the paper today my boy was kilt outside his job in nineteen hundred and sixtyeight and all the polices did was sweep it under the rug her statement hangs suspended in crystalline silence i sense my fathers reflexive desire to answer her charge to try to mitigate the behavior of the law enforcement figures of the period but the murder remains unsolved and he has no idea what efforts were made to solve it if any or how sincere they might have been althea payton looks momentarily disconcerted by her motherinlaws frankness but then her eyes fill with calm resolution are you still a lawyer mr cage she asks i mean i know youre a writer now can you still practice law i incline my head im still a member of the bar what that mean asks georgia i can still practice law maam then we wants to hire you for what i think i know dad says to find out who murdered my baby the old woman says the police dont want to do it fbi dont want to the county lawyer neither the district attorney althea corrects her youve spoken to the district attorney about this althea nods several times he has no interest in the case dad emits a sigh easily interpreted as big surprise we hired us a detective too georgia says i even wrote to that man on unsolved mysteries that goodlooking white man from that old gangster tv show robert stack asks my mother yes althea confirms we got back one letter from the shows producer expressing interest but after that nothing what about this detective i ask what happened with him we hired a man from jackson first he poked around downtown for an afternoon then told us there was nothing to find white man georgia barks a nogood then we hired a detective from chicago althea says in a tense voice he flew down and spent a week in the eola hotel colored man the old woman cuts in a nocount nogood he stole all our money and went back to chicago he was very expensive althea concedes and he said the same thing the first detective told us the pertinent records had been destroyed and there was nothing to find naacp say the same thing georgia adds with venom they dont care about my baby none he wasnt a big enough name they cry about martin and medgar every year got white folks makin movies about medgar but my baby del in the ground and nobody care nobody except you althea says quietly when i walked out in my driveway this morning and picked up that paperwhen i read what you saidi cried i cried like i havent cried in thirty years dad raises his eyebrows and sends me one of his telepathic messages you opened your damn mouth see what its got you i still gots some money mr penn georgia says clutching at a black vinyl handbag the size of a small suitcase i envision a tidal wave of onedollar bills spilling out of the purse like money at a crack bust but mrs payton has clutched the bag only to emphasize her statement i cannot let this go any further ladies i appreciate your thanks but i dont deserve them as i said in the paper im here for a vacation im no longer involved in any criminal matters what happened to your husband and son was a terrible tragedy but i suspect that what the detectives told you is true this crime happened thirty years ago nowadays if the police dont solve a homicide in the first fortyeight hours they know they probably never will but sometimes they do althea says doggedly ive read about murder cases that were solved years after the fact thats true but its rare in all my years with the houston das office we only had a couple of cases like that but you had them yes but what we had more ofa hundred times more ofwas distraught relatives pleading with us to reopen old cases murder is a terrible thing and no one knows that better than you the repercussions reverberate through generations but theres no statue of limitations on murder is there statue of limitations i see no point in correcting her grammar ive heard attorneys make the same mistake like congressmen referring to nucular war everything hinges on evidence i explain has any new evidence come to light her desolate look is answer enough thats what we were hoping you could do althea says look back over what the police did maybe they missed something maybe they buried something i read in a book that sixty percent of the natchez police force was klan back then god knows what they did or didnt do you might even get a book out of it theres a lot nobody knows about those times about what del was doing for his people i fight the urge to glance at my parents for assistance im actually in the middle of a book now and im behind i ive read your books althea breaks in all of them in paperback of course i read them on the late shift when the babies are resting well i never know what to say in these moments if you say did you like them youre putting the person on the spot but what else can you say i liked the first one the best althea offers i liked the others too but i couldnt help feeling be honest i urge her dreading what will follow i always felt that your gift was bigger than the stories you were telling i dont mean to be critical but that first book was so real i just think if you really understood what happened to del youd have a story that would take all the gift you have to tell it her words are like salt on my soul i truly wish i could help you but i cant if some new evidence were to come to light the district attorney would be the proper man to see i look at my father is austin mackey still the da here he nods warily i went to school with mr mackey hes a good man i could he nothing but a politician scoffs georgia payton the old woman gets slowly to her feet using her huge handbag as a counterweight he dont care none we come here cause we thought you did but maybe you dont maybe you was talking free in the paper cause you been gone so long you aint worried bout what people thinks around here i told althea you must be like your daddy a hardworking man with a good heart but maybe i told her wrong i flush again suddenly certain that the men of the payton family are intimately familiar with the guilt trip as a motivational tool althea stands more slowly than her motherinlaw as though lifting the weight of thirty years of grief this time when she speaks she looks only at the floor i loved my husband she says softly after he was killed i never remarried i never even went with another man i raised my boy the best i could and tried to go on i dont say it was hard because everybody got it hard some way you know that dr cage the worlds full of misery but my del got took before his time her lower lip is quivering she bites it to keep her composure he wanted us to wait to have children so wed be able to give them the things they needed del said our people hurt themselves by having too many children too quick we just had one before he died del was a good boy who grew into a good man and he never got to see his own baby grow up the mournful undertone in her voice pierces my heart all i can see is sarah lying in her casket at age thirtyseven her future ripped away like a cruel mirage althea payton breaks the image by reaching into her purse and taking out a folded piece of paper which she hands to me i have little choice but to unfold it its a death certificate when the ambulance men got to del he was already burned up but they couldnt get him out of the seat the springs from the seat had blown up through his thighs and pinned him there thats why he couldnt get out even though he was still alive after that bomb went off i stare at the brittle yellowed paper a simple form dated look in the middle althea says under cause of death i push down a hot wave of nausea thirty years ago on the line beside the printed words cause of death some callous or easily cowed bureaucrat had scrawled the word accidental as long as i live and breathe althea whispers ill do what i can to find out the truth i want to speak to try to communicate the empathy i feel but i dont sarahs death taught me this in the face of grief words have no power i watch the payton women follow my mother into the hall i hear georgia repeat her compliment about the fine house my mother keeps then the soft shutting of the front door i sit on the sofa where althea sat the cushion is still warm my mothers slippers hiss across the slate floor of the foyer the sound like a nun moving through a convent the neighbors are standing out in their yards she says wondering at the sight of black people who arent yard men or maids i reflect and tomorrow the maids and the yard men will return while the two mrs paytons sit or work in silent grief mourning a man whose murder caused no more ripples than a stone dropped into a pond i know that was hard my father says laying a hand on my shoulder but you did the right thing i shake my head i dont know that boys long dead and gone nothing anybody can do will help him now but it could hurt a lot of people those two poor women the town your mother you and annie most of all you did the right thing son i look up at my father searching for the man georgia payton said he is you did my mother insists dont dwell on it go wake annie up im going to make french toast chapter the couch in my fathers medical office has heard many terrible truths revelations by the doctor youre sick youre dying they couldnt get it all confessions by the patient my husband beats me my father raped me i want to die but alwaysalwaystruths about the patient today the truth about the doctor will be told i can imagine no other reason for the sudden summons to his office it requires a conscious effort to control my anxiety as i sit on that worn leather couch waiting for him to finish with his last patient of the day after the payton women left our house this morning dad took his old pickup truck to work so that annie and i would have the bmw having no desire to endure the glares of the local citizenry i spent the morning in the pool with annie marveling at how well she moved in the water and fighting a losing battle to keep her skin covered with sun block mom and i had tuna sandwiches for lunch annie a bowl of spaghettios when the two of them drove downtown to buy annie new shoes i retired to the library and read t harry williamss huey long on the sofa until i fell asleep the telephone woke me at fourthirty pm i hated to chance answering it myself but i thought it might be my mother penn said my father can you drop by my office about five alone sure whats up i think its time we had a talk okay i said trying to sound casual ill see you at five i went to the bathroom and showered off the chlorine from the pool then dressed in chinos and a polo shirt dads office is only a couple of miles from the house so i read another twenty minutes in huey long when i fell asleep the grand imperial wizard of the ku klux klan speaking from the imperial klonvocation in atlanta had just announced that he was going to louisiana to campaign against huey because of his pronegro policies the kingfish stormed into the press gallery of the state senate while the legislature was in session and announced that if that imperial bastard crossed the louisiana state line he would shortly depart with his toes turned up the klan leader wisely elected not to test the kingfishs sincerity as humorous as it seemed in retrospect long could all too easily have backed up his threat i could see how dictatorial power might be an asset in solving sticky problems like racism of course that road also leads to the crematorium ovens when i got to my fathers office building i used his private door id known anna his chief nursean attractive black womanfor most of my life but i was too curious to spend even ten minutes reminiscing about old times i sat on the couch opposite his desk and waited in the lingering haze of cigar smoke during his first fifteen years in natchez dad practiced in a sprawling downtown house this was the era of separate waiting rooms for colored and white but his only nod to this convention was a flimsy wooden partition set up in the middle of the room on any day you could find whole families white and blackcamped out in that great room kids playing on the floor parents eating from bag lunches and waiting to see the doctor on a firstcome firstserved basis his new office convenient to both hospitals and sterile as a hypodermic needle runs like any other doctorsalmost he has rigidly scheduled appointments a gleaming laboratory and modern xray facilities but he still routinely brings everything to a standstill by spending whatever time he feels a patient needs for examination commiseration or just plain conversation at last his strong baritone filters around the door the volume tells me he is bidding farewell to a geriatric patient old people comprise the bulk of his practice now as his patient base has aged with him anna leans in and gives me a smile then closes the door behind dad he squeezes my shoulder as he walks past and sits in the big chair behind his desk this is how i picture him in memory white lab coat stethoscope hanging loosely around his neck ensconced behind mountains of incomplete medical records drug samples and junk mail he reaches into a small refrigerator behind his desk and takes out a dr pepper which he offers to me when i decline he pops the top and takes a long pull from it his eyes watering from the sudden shot of carbonation im in a bad spot penn he says in a frank voice i apologize for being an ass the other night its not easy for a father to admit weakness to his son i nod awkwardly imagining a future when i am certain to fall short of annies idealized image of me dad theres nothing you can tell me that will change my opinion of you just tell me whats going on so we can deal with it he clearly doubts my statement but hes made up his mind to talk twentyfive years ago he says your aunt ellen got into some trouble my mind is spinning when he said twentyfive years ago i thought he was going to start talking about del payton but payton was killed thirty years ago the shift to my mothers younger sister ellen throws me completely she was divorced and living in mobile alabama ellen was about your age now i guess dating a guy there he was a year or two younger than she was name was hillman don hillman your mother and i didnt know it at the timeat least i didntbut hillman was abusing ellen beating her controlling every word and action your mother finally convinced her that the relationship was going to end badly no matter what she did and ellen tried to break it off hillman didnt take it well i advised ellen to go to the police then i found out hillman was the brother of a cop over in mobile a detective this was nobodyd heard of stalking laws i hope you brought her here of course she stayed with us for a summer you remember dont you i do for most of one summer our hall bathroom became an exotic world of hanging stockings lacy underwear cutglass perfume bottles and blue noxema jars hillman called the house a few times after the breakup late drunk out of his mind and railing or else hanging up one night when he didnt hang up i told him if he came to natchez making trouble hed be a long time getting back to mobile the calls stopped after a while ellen wanted her own place so i rented her an apartment at the windsor arms and got her a job at the jeff davis he takes another slug of dr pepper as soon as she got her own place strange things started happening slashed tires eggs on her door more juvenile crap one morning she found her cat at her door with its throat cut i called the natchez police but they couldnt find hillman anywhere in town he closes his eyes and sighs then he raped her a shudder of horror accompanies my amazement families are mazes of secrets and none of us ever knows them all hillman was waiting inside her apartment when she got home from a date he beat the hell out of her raped her sodomized her then he disappeared ellen was too shaken up to swear out charges i had to sedate her i got the natchez da to call the mobile da and make a lot of noise but ellen would have been a shaky witness at best even if i could have gotten her to press charges and hillmans brother was a cop remember the mobile da didnt sound excited about making trouble for him i nod in sympathy the oldtimers in houston told me a thousand times how tough it was to get rape convictions before feminists changed public perception of the crime and the cop angle was a serious complication nothing is more incestuous than southern law enforcement everything is personal relationships needless to say things were pretty bad at home dad goes on we tried to keep it from you and your sister but your mother and ellen were at the end of their rope peggy was driving her to jackson every three days to see a psychiatrist i remember this too mom taking aunt ellen to the doctor all the time we thought it was her ovaries or something thats what we told you anyway two weeks after the rape hillman started calling again dad is clenching and unclenching his right fist on the desk i never felt so goddamn impotent in my life i dont know whats coming but the hair on my forearms is standing up about this time ray presley happened to come see me about his blood pressure you know how i get to talking to patients and presley always had a good story he saw that i wasnt myself he asked what was bothering me and i told him hed been a cop after all i thought he might have a suggestion hed also done a hitch in parchman prison i think but now does not seem the best time to bring that up ray heard me out and he didnt say much grunted a couple of times in the right places you never know what hes thinking so were both just sitting there saying nothing after a while he says so whats this shitbirds name doc i didnt say anything for a minute then i told him we shot the bull for a few more minutes and ray left three weeks later the natchez da called and told me hillman was dead somebodyd shot him in the head and taken his wallet outside a topless bar in mobile jesus christ at first i was relieved but somewhere in the back of my mind i was worried about ray hed always appreciated me taking care of his mother and some part of me wondered if he hadnt taken it into his head to get rid of my problem for me oh man a month later he came back in to get his pressure checked i told the girls i was too busy to talk but he slipped into my office and waited for me when i went in i asked him point blank if he knew anything about hillmans death and he told me right out hed killed the guy shit dad shakes his head just like saying i fixed that flat for you doc he gave me this funny smile and told me not to give it another thought said i didnt owe him anything just get back to doctoring and living those were his exact words tell me you reported this to the police i didnt having watched my father make moral choices that cost him money and friendships for years i am stunned by this answer thats accessory after the fact dad five years in the pen i realize that but the situation was more complicated than you know you hadnt committed any crime until you kept presleys confession from the police listen damn it ray must have seen how he upset me because twenty minutes after he walked out he came back and handed me a zipper pouch inside it was a pistol id lent him about six months before a fortyfive my heart slaps against my chest wall he killed hillman with that pistol no but he was always borrowing things from me back then guns books my nikon for a stakeout that kind of thing you know i cant say no to anybody anyhow id lent him another pistol about a year before a little featherweight thirtyeight so when he handed me the fortyfive i asked about the thirtyeight dad takes a deep breath and exhales slowly he told me it had been stolen i close my eyes as though to shield myself from what is coming he told me not to worry about it that hed get me another thirtyeight but he was really telling me that reporting the murder wasnt an option hed killed hillman with my thirtyeight and he still had the gun if i tried to report him he could tell the police that id asked him to commit the crime and had given him the gun to do it how soon did he start blackmailing you he didnt mention it again for twentyfive years what he had no intention of blackmailing me penn ray presley idolized me back then still does i think but last year he got prostate cancer and he doesnt have health insurance he needed money so he started getting it wherever he could for all i know hes blackmailing ten other people besides me the point is he had me over a barrel i couldnt see any option but to pay him why didnt you call me when he first came to you do you really have to ask i was ashamed because of me a man was murdered you had nothing to do with that you didnt solicit the thing for gods sake you couldnt know presley would kill the guy dad dismisses this rationalization with a wave of his hand do you remember becket the movie or the historical archbishop the movie after becket makes his moral stand against king henry the king is alone in the palace with his nobles these socalled nobles are a nasty bunch greedy violent and drunk and though king henry loves becket he says out loud will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest and of course they do they go to canterbury and murder him with swords sometimes i wish my father had less rigorous moral standards henry knew what he was saying penn he knew the company he was in and that made him guilty of murder thats why he submitted to the lashing by beckets monks youre not a king you couldnt know what presley would do dad is too wracked by guilt for me to get through to him ive spent years thinking about this i didnt know presley would kill the man but when he asked for the name i knew he might do something id treated his parents for free and he felt indebted to me hed just gotten out of prison from the moment i told presley that name hillman was bound to get hurt maybe killed theres no getting around that i know what it has cost my father to admit this he may even be right but thats not my primary concern at this point thats not how the law would see it technically your only crime was accessory after the fact and the statute of limitations ran out on that in what about the gun thats another story if presley will lie to the da and say you asked him to kill hillman and that you gave him the gunand if he still has the gunthat adds up to capital murder it puts you in line for what ive got to witness in two days lethal injection thats what i thought why did you decide to tell me this today you want to find out who killed del payton i know you do and youre right maybe you even have an obligation to do it but the road to paytons killers runs right through ray presley because he worked on the case i knew youd eventually go see him and if you did youd probably find out about this he might even hit you up for money i wanted you to hear the truth from me the hell with del payton theres only one thing to do what go to the da before presley can tomorrow morning were going to walk in there tell the whole story and demand that presley be arrested for murder and extortion dad raises both hands like a supplicant ive thought of doing that a hundred times but why should the da believe me i think of austin mackey district attorney and former schoolmate of mine not my first choice for a sympathetic confessor but we go back a lot of years the da has a lot of discretion in a case like this and its possible we could sting presley wire you before meeting with him videotape a blackmail payment youre underestimating ray since he started this hes talked and acted as though we were partners from the beginning damn mackey would probably insist that you drop the payton business penn i dropped it the second you told me about this we dont have any options weve got to come clean and mackeys the man we have to see dad seems to sag behind his desk if thats what you think im prepared to do it itll be a relief no matter what happens but even if mackey decided not to prosecute wouldnt i still be subject to prosecution in alabama he has a point yes anywhere that an element of the crime took place but i can get mackey to talk to the mobile da for us hillmans brother still lives in mobile the cop i checked two months agowonderful even if mackey does his best to convince the mobile da to lay off my fathers life will be in the hands of the alabama authorities and that comes pretty close to unacceptable risk thats why dad has not come forward before now presley has cancer i say thinking aloud how long does he have to live dad shrugs his oncologist thought hed be dead before now but hes still ambulatory ray is one tough son of a bitch one of those i always say is too damn stubborn to die he could live another year a year isnt so long we could keep paying him till he dies pay his medical bills thats what ive been doing so far its getting damned expensive how much have you paid him a hundred and sixteen thousand dollars to date i shake my head still unable to believe the situation over how long seven or eight months but he wants more hes talking about needing to provide for his kids now thats the way it is with blackmail it never stops theres no guarantee it would stop with his death he could give the gun to one of his kids he could leave documentary evidence a videotape for example a dying declaration you know ive got cancer and ive got something to get off my chest before i stand before my maker that kind of thing is taken very seriously by the courts my father has turned pale good god that leaves us only one option something in my voice must have sounded more sinister than i intended because dads eyes are wide with shock you dont mean kill him god no i just told you his death wasnt necessarily a solution relief washes over his face everything depends on that gun what are you suggesting that we steal it no we buy it dad shakes his head ray will never sell it everybody has a price and we know presley needs money you just said it could be a meal ticket for his kids for years presley knows me by reputation at least im a nationally known prosecutor a famous author if i stand for anything its integrity same as you ill show presley a carrot and a stick he can sell me the gun or he can watch me go to the da and stake my reputation on convincing the authorities that youre innocent i have contacts from houston to washington you and i are pillars of our communities ray presleys a convicted felon at various times hes probably been suspected of several murders hell sell me the gun a spark of hope has entered dads eyes but fear still masks it dull and gray and alien to my image of him buying evidence with intent to to destroy it he says what kind of crime is that its a felony majorleague you cant do it penn his hands are shaking this thing has been eating at him every day for twentyfive years long before presleys blackmail began god how he must have sweated during the malpractice trial worrying that leo marston would learn about hillmans murder from presley his paid lackey i saw this situation a hundred times as a prosecutor a man lives morally all his life then in one weak moment commits an act that damns him in his own eyes and threatens his liberty even his life seeing my father in this trap unnerves me and yet to get him out of it i am contemplating committing a felony myself youre right i tell him weve got to take the high road talk to mackey yes but i want to feel him out first ill call him tonight maybe stop by his house he wont be home theres a party tonight a fundraiser for wiley warren riley warrennickname wileyis the incumbent mayor your mother and i were invited but we werent going to go mackey will be there hes a big supporter of warrens youre invited by the way by you no by don perry the surgeon hosting the party he stopped me at the hospital after lunch and asked me to bring you along why would he do that especially after the story in the paper why do you think its a fundraising party and he thinks youre loaded thats it then ill talk to mackey there if he sounds amenable ill set up a formal meeting and well figure a way to sting presley dad lays his hands on his desk to steady them i cant believe it after all this time to finally do something about it weve got to do something about it lifes too short to live like this he closes his eyes then opens them and stands up i feel bad about the paytons i feel like were buying me out of trouble by burying the truth about del this is true enough but weighed against my fathers freedom del payton means nothing to me blood is a hell of a lot thicker than sympathy you cant carry that around on your shoulders back during the sixties he says hanging his stethoscope on a coat rack i was tempted to ask some of those northern college kids over to the house give them some decent food a little encouragement but i never did i knew what the risks were and i was afraid to take them you had a wife and two kids dont beat yourself up over it i dont but del payton had a wife and child too mom told me you patched up two civil rights workers from homewood after the doctor over there refused to do it they were beaten half to death she said he looks disgusted i did take the hippocratic oath goddamn it i guess that homewood doctor forgot it anger and shame fill his eyes it wasnt enough what i did was not enough i stand and take my keys out of my pocket nobody white did enough paytons killers will pay sooner or later it just wont be me who makes them do it dad takes off his lab coat and hangs it on the rack if you dont penn i dont think anybody else will so be it chapter dad and i are dressing for the perry partyme in a sport jacket borrowed from his closetwhen the phone rings beside his bed he reaches for it without looking the movement as automatic as scratching an itch dr cage he says waiting for a description of symptoms or a plea for narcotics his face goes slack and he presses the phone against his undershirt its shad johnson whos that the black candidate for mayor what does he want you want me to say youre not here i reach for the receiver this is penn cage well well says a precise male voice in the middle register a voice more white than black the prodigal son himself i dont know how to respond then a fragment of dads thumbnail sketch of local politics comes to me shad johnson moved home to natchez from chicago specifically to run for mayor i hear the same could be said of you mr johnson he laughs call me shad how can i help you shad id like you to come see me for a few minutes id come to you but you might not want the neighbors thinking were any closer than we are news travels fast in this town like those payton women coming to see you this morning a wave of heat rolls up the back of my neck i have no intention of getting involved in local politics mr johnson you got involved the second you talked to the newspaper about del payton consider me uninvolved id like nothing better but we still need to talk were talking now face to face im over at my campaign headquarters youre not afraid to come to the north side of town are you no my father is straining hard to hear both sides of the conversation but ive got to be somewhere in an hour not that fundraiser for wiley warren i hope shad johnson obviously has the town wired im about to beg off when he says you and your family are in danger i fight the impulse to overreact what are you talking about ill tell you when you get here give me your address martin luther king drive its a storefront setup in a little strip mall wheres martin luther king drive pine street dad says looking concerned that old shopping center by the brick house i ask recalling a shadowy cinderblock bar i went to once with two black guys i spent a summer laying sewer pipe with thats right but its not the brick house anymore just like its not pine street anymore times change counselor you on your way give me fifteen minutes what the hell did he want dad asks taking the phone from me and hanging it up he said our familys in danger what i tie my tie and walk to the bedroom door dont worry ill be back in fortyfive minutes well make the party in plenty of time he gives me his trademark sternfather look youd better take a pistol with you the north side looks nicer than it did when i was a boy back then it was a warren of shotgun shacks and dilapidated houses separated by vacant lots and condemned buildings their walls patched with tin or even cardboard juke clubs operated out of private houses surrounded by men drinking from paper bags and paintandbody shops sagged amid herds of junk cars looking like sets for the road warrior now there are rows of wellkept houses a sparkling video store a stateoftheart texaco station good streetlights smooth roads i swing into the parking lot of the strip mall and scan the storefronts a styling salon a fish market an naacp voterregistration center a snocone stand thronged by black kids and one newly painted front hung with a bright banner that reads shad johnsonthe future is now an openair barbecue pit built from a sawninhalf fiftyfivegallon drum smokes like a barn fire outside the naacp center sending the aroma of chicken and pork ribs into the air a knot of middleaged black men stands around the pit drinking colt from quart bottles they fall silent and watch with sullen suspicion as i get out of the bmw and approach johnsons building i nod to them and go inside a skinny young man wearing a threepiece suit that must be smothering him sits behind a metal desk talking on a telephone behind the desk stands a walltowall partition of whitewashed plywood with a closed door set in it the young man looks up and motions me toward a battered church pew i nod but remain standing studying the partition which is plastered with posters exhorting the public to vote for shad johnson half show him wearing a dark suit and sitting behind a large desk a model of conservatism and rectitude the other half show a much youngerlooking johnson sporting a malcolm xstyle goatee and handing out pamphlets to teenagers on an urban playground it isnt hard to guess which posters hang in which parts of town a voice rises over the partition it has anger in it but anger communicated with the perfect diction of a bbc news reader as i try to get a fix on the words the young assistant hangs up and disappears through the door he returns almost instantly and signals me to follow him my first impression of shad johnson is of a man in motion before i can adequately focus on the figure sitting behind the desk he is rising and coming around it right hand extended a few inches shorter than i johnson carries himself with the brash assurance of a personalinjury lawyer he is lightskinned not to a degree that would hurt him with the majority of black voters but light enough that certain whites can reassure themselves about his achievements and aspirations by noting the presence of caucasian blood he shakes my hand with a natural politicians grip firm and confident and augmented by a megawatt of eye contact im glad you came he says in a measured tenor take a seat he leads me to a folding chair across from his spartan metal desk then sits atop the desk like a college professor and smiles this is a long way from my office at goldstein henry in chicago up or down he laughs up if i win and if you lose back to whiteshoe law in chicago his smile slips for a nanosecond you said my family is in danger mr johnson shad please short for shadrach all right shad why is my family in danger because of your sudden interest in a thirtyyearold murder i have no interest in the murder of del payton and i intend to make a public statement to that effect as soon as possible im relieved to hear you say that i must have taken fifty calls today asking what im doing to help you get to the bottom of it what did you tell them that im in the process of putting together the facts you didnt know the facts already johnson examines his fingernails which look professionally manicured i was born here mr cage but i was sent north to prep school when i was eleven lets focus on the present shall we the payton case is a sleeping dog best to let it lie the situation is quickly clarifying itself what if new evidence was to come to light that pointed to paytons killer or killers that would be unfortunate his candor surprises me for local politicians maybe what about justice that kind of justice doesnt help my people and the payton family theyre not your people johnson sighs like a man trying to hold an intelligent conversation with a twoyearold if this case was dragged through the newspapers it would whip white resentment in this town to a fever pitch black people cant afford that race relations isnt about laws and courts anymore its about attitudes perceptions a lot of whites in mississippi want to do the right thing they felt the same way in the sixties but every group has the instinct to protect its own liberals keep silent and protect rednecks for the same reason good doctors protect bad ones its a tribal reaction youve got to let those whites find their way to the good place suddenly del payton is the biggest obstacle i can see to that i suppose whites get to that good place by voting for shad johnson you think wiley warrens helping anybody but himself im not warrens biggest fan but ive heard some good things about his tenure you hear hes a drunk that he cant keep his dick in his pants that hes in the pocket of the casino companies you have evidence its tough to get evidence when he controls the police there are plenty of black cops on the force johnsons phone buzzes he frowns then hits a button and picks up the receiver shad johnson he says in his clipped northern accent five seconds later he cries my brother and begins chattering in the frenetic musical patois of a pine street juke half words and grunts and wild bursts of laughter noticing my stare he winks as if to say look how smoothly i handle these fools as he hangs up his assistant sticks his head in the door line two no more calls henry its julian bond johnson sniffs and shoots his cuffs ive got to take this now hes the urbane attorney again sanguine and selfeffacing he and bond discuss the coordination of black celebrity appearances during the final weeks of johnsons mayoral campaign stratospheric names are shuffled like charms on a bracelet jesse denzel whitney general powell kweisi mfume when the candidate hangs up i shake my head youre obviously a man of many talents and faces im a chameleon johnson admits ive got to be you know you have to play to your jury counselor and ive got a pretty damn diverse one here i guess running for office in this town is like fighting a twofront war twofront war man this town has more factions than the knesset redneck baptists rich liberals yellow dog democrats middleclass blacks young fire eaters uncle toms and bonedumb bluegums working the bottomland north of town its like conducting a symphony with musicians who hate each other im a little surprised by your language you sound like winning is a lot more important to you than helping your people who can i help if i lose how long do you figure on sticking around city hall if you win a bemused smile touches johnsons lips off the record just long enough to build a statewide base for the gubernatorial race you want to be governor i want to be president but governor is a start when a nigger sits in the governors mansion in jackson mississippi the civil war will truly have been won the sacrifices of the movement will have been validated those bubbas in the legislature wont know whether to shit or go blind this whole country will shake on its foundations johnsons opportunistic style puts me off but i see the logic in it i suppose the black man who could turn mississippi around would be a natural presidential candidate you can thank bill clinton for pointing the way arkansas shit mississippi is fiftieth in education fiftieth in economic output highest in illegitimate births second highest in welfare payments the list is endless hell were fiftyfirst in some thingsbehind puerto rico i turn that aroundjust a littlei could whip colin powell hands down how can you turn this town around much less the state factories industry a fouryear college fourlane highways linking us to jackson and baton rouge everybody wants that what makes you think you can get it johnson laughs like im the original sucker you think the white elite that runs this town wants industry the money here likes things just the way they are theyve got their private golf course segregated neighborhoods private schools no traffic problem black maids and yard men working minimum wage and just one smokestack dirtying up their sunset this place is on its way to being a retirement community the boca raton of mississippi boca raton is a rich city well this is a mostly poor one one factory closed down and two working half capacity oil business all but dead and every well in the county drilled by a white man tourism doesnt help my people rich whites or segregated garden clubs own the antebellum mansions that tableau they have every year where the little white kids dance around in hoop skirts for the yankees you got a couple of old mammies selling pralines outside and black cops directing traffic you see any people of color at the balls they have afterward the biggest social events in town and not a single black face except the bartenders most whites arent invited to those balls either dont think im not pointing that out in the appropriate quarters mayor warren doesnt pursue industry wiley warren thinks riverboat gambling is our salvation the city takes in just over a million dollars from that steamboat under the hill while the boat drains away thirty million to las vegas with that kind of prosperity this town will be dead in five years i glance at my watch i thought you brought me here to warn me im trying to for the first time in fifty years weve got a major corporation ready to locate a worldclass factory here and youre trying to flush that deal right down the toilet what i said in the paper wont stop any company serious about locating here youre wrong basf is a german company they may be racists themselves but theyre very sensitive to racial issues in foreign countries and they have concerns about the school system here the school system the public school is eighty percent black the populations only fifty percent black basfs management wont put their employees into a situation where they have to send their kids to expensive and segregated private schools for a decent education they have to be convinced that the public schools are safe and of excellent quality and is that the case theyre safe enough but the qualitys not the best weve established a fragile consensus and convinced basf that the public school is viable weve developed all sorts of pilot programs those germans are damn near committed to build here but if the payton case explodes in the media basf will crawfish so fast well finally hear that giant sucking sound ross perot always whined about i hold up my hands i have no interest in the case i made a couple of comments and attracted the attention of paytons family end of story as johnson smiles with satisfaction my defensive tone suddenly disgusts me but ill tell you this the harder people try to push me away from something the more i feel like maybe i ought to take a look at it he leans back and eyes me with cold detachment id think long and hard before i did that your little girl has already lost one parent the words hit me like a slap why do i get the feeling you might be the danger you warned me about he gives me a taut smile im just trying to do you a favor brother this town looks placid but its a powder keg drop by mcdonalds or the walmart deli and watch the black workers serve blacks before whites who got there first blacks are angry here but they dont know how to channel their frustration what youve got here are blacks descended from those who were too dumb to head north after the civil war or the world wars no selfawareness they take things out on whitey however they can a while back some black kids started shooting at white peoples cars killed a young father theres a white backlash coming and when it comes theres enough resentment among black teenagers to start a war thats what youre playing with not to mention whoever killed del payton you know those cracker bastards are still out there somewhere sounds to me like del payton died in vain payton was a paving stone in the road to freedom no more no less and right now hes best honored by leaving him lie i stand my face hot ive got to be somewhere when you get to your party tell wiley warren im going to whip his lilywhite ass i pause at the door and look back johnson already has the phone in his hand i think youre underestimating blacks in this town i tell him theyre smarter than you give them credit for they see more than you think such as they can see youre not one of them dont kid yourself cage im moses cast onto the waters as a child and raised by the enemy i prospered among the mighty and now return to show my people the way in an instant the candidates voice has taken on the old testament cadence and power of a young martin luther king as i gape he adds in his mincing lawyers voice next time come over to campaign headquarters south its on main street the atmospheres more your style genteel and republican the way the old white ladies like it over there im a house nigger made good johnson is still laughing when i leave the building the sky is deep purple the warm night falling to a soundtrack of kicked cans honking horns shouting children and squealing tires the smell of chicken sizzling on the open pit pulls my head in that direction two black teenagers on banana bikes whiz toward me as i stand beside the bmw im about to wave when one spits on the hood of my car and zips past disappearing into a cloud of dark laughter i start to yell after them then think better of it i did not bring the pistol my father advised me to and i dont need to start the riot shad johnson just warned me about i get into the bmw start it and head south toward the white section of town ive hardly begun to reflect on johnsons words when i notice the silhouette of a police car behind me blinding headlights obscure its driver but the light bar on the roof leaves no doubt that its a cop as he pulls to within fifteen yards of my rear bumper and hangs there it hits me im driving a seventyfivethousanddollar car in the black section of town some eager white cop is probably running my fathers plate right now checking to see whether the bmw has been reported stolen as we pass in tandem under a street lamp i notice that the vehicle is not a police car but a sheriffs cruiser a sickening wave of adrenaline pulses through me as i wait for the flare of red lights the scream of a siren somewhere along here this road becomes linda lee mead drive named for natchezs miss america as i top the hill leading down to the junction with highway the cruiser pulls out and roars past me i glance to my left hoping to get a look at the driver the man behind the wheel is black he is fifty yards past me when both front windows of the bmw explode out of their frames shattering into a thousand pieces i whip my head to the right trying to shield my eyes my eardrums throb from sudden depressurization and i instinctively slam on the brakes as the back end of the car skids around something hammers my door sending a shock wave up my left thigh the car comes to rest facing the right shoulder blocking both lanes of the road in the silence of the dead engine the reality of my situation hits me someone is shooting at me frantically cranking the car i notice the brake lights of the sheriffs cruiser glowing red at the bottom of the hill a hundred yards away its just sitting there as my engine catches two bullets smash through the rear windshield turning it to starred chaos i throw the bmw into gear stomp the accelerator whip around and start down the hill before ive gone thirty yards the sheriffs cruiser pulls onto the highway and races off toward town stop i shout honking my horn stop goddamn it but he doesnt stop the rifle must have made a tremendous noise though i dont remember hearing it maybe the exploding glass distracted me but the black deputy in the cruiser must have heard it unless the weapon was silenced this thought is too chilling to dwell on for long since silenced weapons are much rarer in life than in movies and indicate a high level of determination on the part of the shooter but if the deputy didnt hear the shots why did he stop so long there was no traffic at the intersection for a moment i wonder if he could have fired the shots himself but physics rules that out the first bullet came through the drivers window while the deputy was fifty yards in front of me the last two smashed the back windshield after the skid exposed it to the same side of the road my heart still tripping like an air hammer i turn onto highway grab the cell phone and dial before the first ring fades i click end anything i say on a cell phone could be all over town within hours the odds of catching the shooter are zero by now and my fathers blackmail situation makes me more than a little reluctant to bring the police into our lives at this point shad johnsons words echo in my head like a prophecy a while back some black kids started shooting at white peoples cars killed a father of three but this shooting was not random this mornings newspaper article upset a lot of peoplewhite people exclusively i would have thought until shad johnson disabused me of that notion what the hell is going on johnson warns me that my family is in danger but gives no specifics and ten minutes later im shot at on the highway after being followed by a black deputy who doesnt stop to check out the shooting whoever was behind that rifle meant to kill me but i can do nothing about it now im less than a mile from my parents house and my priority is clear within an hour i will be talking to the district attorney about my fathers involvement in a murder case and deciding how best to sting ray presley a known killer chapter tom cage you dog i cant believe you came in small towns the most beautiful women are married and lucy perry proves the rule ten years younger than her husbandthe surgeon hosting the partylucy has large brown eyes and a highmaintenance muscularity shown to perfection in a black silk dress that drapes just below her shapely knees she also has suspiciously high cleavage for a fortyyearold mother of three which i know she is having been given a social update by my father on the way over to the party lucy uses the sorority squeal mode of greeting which is always a danger in mississippi she flashes one of the brightest smiles ive seen off a magazine cover and throws her arm around my father im here for the free liquor dad says not for wiley warren to pick my pocket lucy has a contagious laugh and dad has drawn it out hes one of the few people honest enough to use the mayors nickname within earshot of the man himself now lucy looks at me as though shes just set eyes on me so this is the famous author i offer my hand pleased to meet you mrs perry mrs perry for gods sake lucy she steps inside my proffered hand and draws me to her in a onearmed hug that lasts long enough for me to learn that shes been drinking gin without much tonic and that her breasts are not original architecture ive forbidden anyone to mention that awful newspaper story no one believes anything they read in the examiner anyway the house is full of people and its some house though not one of natchezs premier mansions it would easily fetch nine or ten million dollars in los angeles a brass plaque announces that it is on the national register of historic places the interior has been meticulously restored at a cost of countless gall bladders and appendices a wide hallway bisects the ground floor with arched doorways leading to capacious rooms on both sides of the fifty or so faces in the hallway i recognize about a quarter people i went to school with friends of my parents a half dozen doctors i know i give a broad wave to cover the group many nod or smile in acknowledgment but no one approaches caitlin masterss article has done its work i stick close to dad as we work our way toward the bar table at the end of the hall as shad johnson predicted the only black faces in the house belong to whitejacketed bartenders and maids who circulate with heaping platters of hors doeuvres bourbon and water roosevelt dad tells the bartender easy on the water penn gin and tonic the bartender grins good to see you dr cage dad and i jump as a boom rattles the windowpanes behind the bar table terror grips me until a trombone trumpet and double bass join the thundering drum kit and reorient me to normalcy a black dixieland jazz band is performing on the patio there are no dancers its too damned hot to dance on a patio its too damned hot to be playing music out there too but lucy and her hubby arent worried about the musicians dad squeezes my arm and leans toward me think they were gunning for you again i try to laugh it off but both of us are nervous as cats he agreed with my decision not to report the shooting to the police but he insisted on bringing a pistol to the party hes wearing it in an ankle holster i turn and pan the hall again at the far end beyond the talking heads lucy perry opens the front door and pulls a young woman inside i feel a little jolt when i recognize caitlin masters shes wearing a strapless jade dress with sandals and her black hair is swept up from her neck as she steps aside for lucy to close the door i spy the rebellious flash of a gold anklet above one sandal how do i feel about her angry that she printed something i considered off the record but i cant help admiring her for shaking up our complacent town a little a blustering male voice pulls my attention to the staircase where wiley warren stands dispensing political wisdom to seven or eight smiling listeners warren is a natural bullshitter an exjock with enough brains to indulge his prodigious appetites within a younger group that admires his excesses and keeps his secrets like jfks press corps dad says hes done a fairly good job as mayor but nothing hes accomplished thus far would compare to getting the basf plant a deal which would secure his political future the reason shad johnson isnt making race an issue warren crows is that hes damn near white as i am this is vintage wiley the crowd chuckles encouragement shadrach went off to prep school with the yankees when he was eleven and didnt come back till he was forty and ready to run for mayor hes no more a representative of his people than bryant gumbel who does he represent someone calls himself of course so hes just like you says a gastroenterologist whose name i cant recall warren laughs louder than anyone tacitly admitting the selfinterest that drives all politicians and which southern voters prefer to see in the open rather than cloaked in hypocrisy brutal honesty in such matters is part of the mayors charm i am about to go in search of austin mackey the district attorney when i spot him at the edge of the group listening to the mayor he motions for me to follow him to some chairs in an empty corner mackey was a year ahead of me in school from kindergarten through college a perennial middleoftheclass kid he managed to make most athletic teams but never the first string his grades were unremarkable and im pretty sure he chose ole miss law school so he wouldnt have to pass the bar exam in order to practice in mississippi a rule they changed the year after he went into practice any particular reason you came home and shat in our little sandbox he asks as we sit this is not a fortuitous beginning good to see you again austin skip the sentiment cage he keeps his eyes on the mayor watching austin mackey play the tough throws me a little but natchez is his legal fiefdom now and if he chooses to behave like george raft in a bad film noir he can look austin about that article caitlin masters didnt exactly earth to cage give me a fucking break by now every jig in this town is bitching about how austin mackey never lifted a finger to help mrs payton find out who killed her poor baby i dont know how to segue from this to warm reminiscences of our shared history mackey seems to have forgotten we have one i just mentioned the payton case as an example of a local mystery because it was an unsolved murder mackeys eyes glint with superiority dont be so sure about that what do you mean the fbi worked the payton case you think they tanked it just because no one went to jail for that particular crime doesnt mean the perp didnt go down for something if thats the case why not tell the family give them some peace i cant tell them what i dont know for sure listen when i ran for da i knew the blacks might ask me about past civil rights cases so i asked the bureau for their files on the payton murder i was assistant da then and i requisitioned them in the name of the office and they said that unless wed developed a suspect and had new evidence they wouldnt be showing our office any files why would they say that can i read the mind of j edgar hoover hoover hes been dead twentyfive years well his spirits alive and well hoover made the final decisions on the disposition of those civil rights cases and he worked them hard especially the murders up in neshoba county but its no secret that his personal agenda had nothing to do with advancing civil rights he hated martin luther king and the kennedys cases like paytons were nothing to him but chips in a political game what about your office file there isnt one no one was ever charged with the crime have you looked i dont need to he finally meets my eyes lets get this straight right now unless youre the attorney of record for a member of the payton family youll receive zero assistance from my office and since youre not licensed in this state that pretty much settles things actually i am licensed to practice in mississippi but i see no reason to point this out now and though my combative instincts urge me to tell mackey that a single phone call could secure my position as attorney for the payton family concern for my father stops me you really get to me cage mackey goes on before i can change the subject mr st stephens law review at texas bigtime author youve got nothing better to do than come back here and make your old schoolmates look like assholes bitterness and envy literally crackle off the man i am so surprised that i can do little but apologize that wasnt my intention austin id hate to see what would happen if you really meant some harm what would you say if i told you i was shot at by a sniper less than an hour ago his head snaps up were you yes did you report it not yet his eyes are like signs reading thank god for small favors where did this happen the black section linda lee drive what the hell were you doing over there shad johnson wanted to talk to me jesus the muscles in mackeys jaw tighten what did he say he warned me off the payton case an ironic smile shads no fool the elections five weeks off and the polls have him and warren neck and neck thats all you have to say about an attempt on my life youre back in mississippi bubba you piss people off theyre going to hit back anyway its pretty obvious which side youre on i sip my drink melting ice has drowned the gin im not on any side then youve forgotten the primary political reality of your home state which is theres no middle ground whatevers there gets crushed to powder by the sides id pick one quick if i were you mackey stands abruptly and drifts back into watchful orbit around his candidate the conversation couldnt have gone any worse if id set out to make him hate my guts this is the man upon whose mercy i advised my father to throw himself i stand and walk into the hallway half looking for dad and half aiming for the bar im almost to the alcohol when a powerful hand closes on my shoulder and a voice whispers in my ear dont move you outside agitatin son of a bitch i whirl ready for anything only to find the laughing bearded face of sam jacobs whom ive known since we were five years old a little nervous are we sam wiggles his black eyebrows up and down wishing wed been a little less candid with the fourth estate i punch him in the chest then hug him hard when sam and i were tenthgraders at st stephens an assistant football coach invited the varsity football team to establish a chapter of the brotherhood of christian athletes at the school while the rest of the team lined up to get the necessary applications two boys remained in the otherwise empty bleachers penn cage and sam jacobs as a jew sam was barred from membership and iever since walking out of episcopal communion at age thirteenwas a devout agnostic under the suspicious gaze of teammates and coaches sam and i left that meeting joined in a way that had more to do with manhood than football ever would now a petroleum geologist jacobs is one of only three nonfamily members who flew to houston for sarahs funeral its great to see you sam what are you doing at this tightass function he grins ive sold don perry enough wilcox production to qualify him as a certified oil maggot so thats how he paid for this palace you must be doing well i aint complaining when the bottom dropped out of the drilling business i slid over into production bought up old wells worked them over got them running full bore and sold out at an obscene profit its getting harder to find wells though everybodys into it now im sure whatever happens youll be the guy sitting on top of the pile the last guy clinging to the limb more like sam sips his drink how does it feel what having everybody in the place stare at you im pretty used to the fishbowl lifestyle now natchez is a lot smaller bowl than houston even small waves seem big here come off it a week from now wholl give a damn about that article everybody ace how much do you know about the basf deal i shrug a little that chemical plant means salvation to a lot of people not just bluecollar either these doctors need patients with private insurance to keep the gravy train running everybodys on their best behavior trying to sell natchez as a southern utopia were pushing our opera festival the literary celebration the hotair balloon race and this morning you tossed a toad right into the punch bowl i glance around the room and instantly find what im looking for caitlin masters deep in conversation with two older men you see that girl sam cranes his neck caitlin masters you know her i know shes fine as wine and worth a few million bucks she printed a little more than i intended her to fess up man you were just being you at your pompous best thats what dad said speaking of your old man im surprised he came before i can ask what sam means someone taps me on the shoulder sam hides a smile behind his drink i turn and look into the luminous green eyes of caitlin masters are you going to slug me she asks if you were male i might consider it i know i angled that story in a way you didnt expect angled it try sensationalized it remember the words offtherecord her lips part slightly in surprise i honored that request about the hanratty execution but as for del payton i force myself to shut up not wanting to argue the point in front of a crowd why dont we have lunch tomorrow she suggests id like to help you understand why i did what i did i want to say no but just as yesterday something about caitlin masters makes me want to see her again the jade dress is linen and it lies against her skin like powder she is a study in elegance and selfpossession is that a no she asks once burned twice shy sam chimes in i like wildes quote better caitlin rejoins whats that i ask the burnt child loves the fire she winks at me then turns on her heel and walks away ignoring the gazes of half the people in the room who have watched our exchange with intense interest you sure know how to liven up a town sam says his eyes glued to her retreating form and she knows how to fill out a dress a shiksa from dreamland that one i step hard on his toe you already married one of those remember what were you saying about my dad im surprised he came is all why because im pretty sure judge marston is on the guest list i feel a sliding sensation in my stomach a quick survey of the room yields no sign of either marston or my father squeezing sams shoulder i push off through the crowd natchez is a funny town people involved in running feuds frequently socialize together men whove gutted each other in business disputes leave their rancor at the doors of certain seasonal soirees and its not unheard of to see a woman who has caught her husband in bed with someone else pouring punch for that womanor manat a party leo marston and tom cage are different the judge once made it his mission to try to ruin my fathers medical career and dad hates him with a fury that will brook no false bonhomie he behaves in fact as though the judge were dead since dad rarely goes anywhere other than his office or the hospitals he rarely crosses paths with marston making that illusion easy to maintain but if sam jacobs is correct that might change tonight dad has already drunk one bourbon probably two by now if marston provokes him dad is capable of swinging on him with that thought my blood pressure plummets because with it comes the memory that my father is carrying a gun tonight catching sight of a silver head a few inches taller than the others near the bar i move quickly forward take dads arm and pull him into the kitchen its empty save for a black maid who smiles and nods when she sees us whats going on he takes a sip of his bourbon and water sans water judge marstons on the guest list he may already be here dad blinks then his cheeks turn red where is he dad this isnt the time or the place why not ive avoided that sob too many years already his breathing is shallow and his motions have a jerky quality that might be the result of anger or alcohol thats the whisky talking youre a hundred percent right about marston but if you talk to him now youre going to hit him or shoot him and ill have to spend all my time at home defending you on a battery charge thats after i bail you out what do you want me to do leave considering what we have to do in the next few days i think you should that brutal reminder of the blackmail situation gets his attention what about talking to mackey he asks i already did and this isnt the place to discuss it his eyes flit back and forth then he dashes his plastic cup against the stainless steel sink goddamn it lets go stay close to me i take his forearm lead him into the hallway and freeze twenty yards away in the open front door stand judge marston and his wife maude the odds of getting through that door without anyone making a smart remark are zero i drag dad back toward the kitchen where the hell are we going now the back doors closer to where i parked you saw marston didnt you he tries to pull free i tighten my grip and hustle him toward the back door knowing that if he really tries to resist me i wont be able to stop him goddamn it im not running thats right youre not youre taking the advice of your lawyer youre not licensed in this state actually i took the mississippi bar exam when i graduated and ive paid the licensing fee every year he is so distracted by this information that he allows himself to be pulled through a side garden to the street heres the car i unlock my mothers maximathe damaged bmw having been consigned to the garageand practically push him into the drivers seat he looks up at me eyes anxious you felt mackey out yes it was like feeling out a porcupine were going to have to go the other way what other way were going to have to buy the gun he blinks in disbelief christ are you sure its the only way i want you to call ray presley at ten in the morning tell him ill be at his place at tenthirty that doesnt give him enough time to get the police involved dad looks down at the steering wheel goddamn it if anyone has to do this it should be me youve been under presleys thumb too long hed never buy your bluff do you have a hundred thousand dollars liquid he looks up helpless with rage itll cost a fortune in penalties but i can get it and i wont have a damn cent to pay the irs in january dont worry ill pay you back but theres no point in creating a paper trail to me yet have the money at your office as early as you can ill pick it up i may not offer presley the whole hundred grand but i need to be able to go up to that he looks too dazed to keep track of this well get in well get it all figured out im not coming dad what i want to talk to sam jacobs about presley sam knows everything that goes on in this town have you got everything straight he takes a deep breath and nods slowly ill have the money waiting ray too good now go home and get some sleep and dont speed the last thing you need tonight is a dwi he gives me a somber salute then shuts the door starts the engine and pulls slowly away i stand at the curb and watch the taillights wink out as he hooks around the block to get headed home on the downtown streets which are all oneway after years of putting men into prisoneven into their gravesfor committing crimes i am about to cross the legal line myself tomorrow morning i am going to risk prison forced separation from my child to try to spare my father the same fate that knowledge simmers in my stomach like a bad meal acid and portentous is it the right thing to do is it stupid ultimately it does not matter its the only thing i can do chapter as i pass through the wroughtiron gate of the perry garden i see a figure standing at the foot of the steps leading to the side door of the mansion and the orange eye of a cigarette burning in the dark the shrubs and trees in the garden are lighted with white christmas lights like little stars nearing the steps i realize that the figure is caitlin masters shes rocking slightly to the rhythm of dont get around much anymore wafting from the back of the house i stop a few feet from her i didnt know you smoked she blows a stream of smoke away from me i dont youre hallucinating is your father okay he had an emergency call so you only smoke at parties only when im bored she doesnt look bored she looks like shes been waiting for me are there many people in town your age she cuts her eyes at me you mean men i guess i did nada its a desert she stubs out the cigarette with her sandal and takes a sip of her drink it looks like white wine but its not in a wineglass and in the dim light has a tinge of green is that mountain dew god no its a gimlet gin and roses lime juice raymond chandler turned me on to them the chandler reference surprises me im starting to suspect that caitlin masters is full of surprises you know the book she asks the long goodbye very good for that ill tell you a little secret i learned today interested sure remember i told you about the sovereignty commission files how fortytwo of them are sealed for security reasons yes one of my reporters requested a sovereignty commission file today and i was more than a little surprised to learn that it was one of the fortytwo i think for a minute not del payton she nods i thought youd be interested surprised anyway i saw you talking to the da inside anything i should know about hes just an old school friend he didnt look too friendly caitlin masters doesnt miss anything i wonder what she would do if she knew her story had got me shot at tonight probably tear into the story like a bulldog youre dangerous arent you she laughs softly and pulls a loose thread of linen from the front of her strapless dress her shoulders are lean and ghostly white in the shadows accenting the long graceful lines of her neck i try to be youre sure you wont reconsider lunch tomorrow i promise to show a little remorse about the articles her tone is casual enough but there is more in it than hunger for a story her steady gaze has nothing to do with the words she spoke whatever i felt when we touched after the interview yesterday she felt too between us floats a curious longing to feel that shock again that aliveness without preamble she reaches out with her free hand and takes my right her eyes unwavering her hand is cool but a rush of warmth runs up my arm she smiles feels good doesnt it its only her hand but the intimacy of her touch is undeniable its been so long since ive had any physical contact with a woman that it almost paralyzes me sarahs illness made it impossible at the end and in the months since her death ive felt no response at all to the flirtations of the women ive met its as though the sexual component of my personality once dominant has been wrapped in so many layers of guilt and grief that the prospect of having to work through them with someone new discourages me from even trying but with one simple gesture caitlin masters has cut through all of that i suppose im being forward she says by southern standards anyway the urge to kiss her is a living thing inside my chest and with it returns the guilt i felt yesterday magnified a hundredfold i close my eyes and squeeze her hand fighting and savoring the pleasure at the same time as though bidden by my thoughts her lips brush mine when i open my eyes hers are only inches away green and wide full of curiosity she closes them rises on tiptoe and presses her lips to mine sending another thrill of heat through me from the first moment it is a knowing kiss not the timid tasting of strangers but the selfassured encounter of lovers who recognize each other her tongue is warm against mine her lips cool my senses read every curve and valley beneath the linen and my arousal is immediate immediate and obvious i slip my hand into the small of her back and for a moment kiss her as i truly want to and the passion of her response explodes the boundaries i had perceived around us as she kisses me i feel something shift deep in my soul a heavy door and whatever stirs behind that door is too powerful to set free here in this place i break the kiss well she says with a laugh i guess that answers that question which question did we really feel something yesterday her cheeks are flushed and part of her hair has fallen around her neck she points at the edge of the flower bed beside us where her gimlet glass lies in the monkey grass i dropped my drink im sorry caitlin i can get another one i meant for getting so you know she shakes her head i liked it hey you didnt break any laws here you look like you saw a ghost her smile vanishes you did see a ghost god im such an ass sometimes its all right she takes my hand again this just happened okay nobodys fault well just be friends if you want this is unfamiliar territory for me were the only ones out here penn everythings fine she reaches behind her neck to pin her hair back up do you need a ride home no i need to talk to sam jacobs hell give me a ride thanks though she releases my hand and gives me the kind of encouraging smile you give a sick friend then walks up the steps ahead of me as she turns the doorknob i reach out and touch her elbow i do think that lunch would be nice though she turns and smiles same place works for me twelve ill meet you there she opens the veneered door and goes inside and i follow watching her wend her way through the crowd in the hall drawing looks from most of the women and all of the men a woman that beautiful and perceptive hasnt been seen in these precincts for quite some time not since livy marston came back from the university of virginia to serve as queen of the confederate pageant as caitlin disappears into one of the great rooms i detour out of the hallway to search for sam the first room i enter is relatively empty but the arched proscenium leading to the next is completely blocked by a semicircle of men and women i move closer to the line of backs then freeze the focus of their attention is judge leo marston the mere sight of him raises my temperature a couple of degrees from anger mostly but alsothough i hate to admit itfrom a residue of fear most of the men i knew as a boy i outgrew during high school and they seem small to me now leo marston still has three inches on me and age has not diminished his physical presence he must be nearly seventy by now but he looks as though he could outfight any man here with bulk in proportion to his height he dwarfs the men standing in his audience he masks his rawboned body in bespoke suits shipped to him once a year from london but his outsized hands betray the power beneath like my father marston has kept his hair through the years and he wears it in a steelgray brush cut reminiscent of the leading men of the s when i was younger i thought of him as an oversized lee marvin with a patina of southern refinement but no amount of refinement can conceal the animal alertness of his eyes the irises are ice blue with gray rims giving him a wolfish aspect and they never settle anywhere for long in moments they will pick me from the crowd i step behind a tall man to my right removing myself from leos line of sight still his mellifluous basso carries to me without losing any volume to distance its one of his most formidable weapons as an attorney second only to his intellect the timbre of that voice is graven forever in the circuits of my brain twenty years ago i listened to it accuse my father of negligence bordering on murder first indirectly as marston tried to draw out testimony from reluctant nurses and technicians then directly like an inquisitor as he crossexamined dad on the stand i took two weeks off from college to attend the trial and by the second friday i was ready to confront marston on his way home from court and put a bullet through his heart my point marston is saying is that the germans are either at your feet or at your throat we have to let basf know that while we want them to locate here we wont grovel but we will someone says and they know it everyone laughs then stops abruptly when they see that marston does not share their humor it all comes down to dollars he says in a cold voice thats when you find out who needs whom and that remains to be settled he continues in this line tantalizing the men with his inside knowledge and the women with his references to money when people speak of old natchez families they mean the marstons leos greatgreat grandfather albert marston owned a massive cotton plantation in louisiana which he administered from an italianate mansion in natchez called tuscany during the civil war albert paid lip service to the confederate cause while lavishly entertaining the union officers occupying the city he was the first natchez planter to sign the loyalty oath to the union which enabled him to maintain his assets and continue to do business while prouder men lost everything many called marston a traitor but he laughed all the way to the bank people say leo is the reincarnation of albert and theyre right i often saw the grim ancestral portrait in the hall at tuscany when i picked up olivia in high school a canvas enshrining a virtual twin of the man who warned me without subtlety to have his angel home by eleven or else by the time leo graduated law school nearly a century after alberts death the family appetites for power and profit had expressed themselves as forcefully as the genes for those chilling blue eyes leo marston knew the secret and immutable laws of mississippi politics the way a farmer knows his fields the states eightytwo counties function more or less as feudal domains each with its closed circle of power and leo was born into one of the richest yet despite the relative wealth of adams county its elected officials cannot help but be swayed by admiration envy or outright fear of men like leo marston add to these the appointees whose hirings marston has assured and the result is a local political network that allows the judge to grant or quash things like building permits and zoning variances with a single phone call and marstons power is not limited to the city during his judicial career first as a circuit judge then a justice of the state supreme courthe did so many favors for so many people that his capital reserves of influence are impossible to estimate nor did he idly spend his time as state attorney general or chairman of the agriculture board he has likeminded friends in every corner of mississippi and owns financial stakes in businesses all over the state including the two biggest banks he can sway the trials of friends and enemies from tupelo to biloxi and put fear into newspaper editors as far away as memphis and new orleans he is a vindictive son of a bitch and everybody knows it on the other hand he is easy to like a man doesnt attain that kind of power without being able to play the social game with flair marston can discuss the finer points of obscure wines with vintners vacationing in natchez and an hour later put a crew of roughnecks on the floor of an oil rig with jokes that would make a sailor blush in the company of women he becomes whatever the mood and situation require with a priggish society wife he fancies he tells offcolor stories in a quiet bourbonlaced voice flustering her with the idea that a man in the judges exalted position could be so downtoearth with a buxom barmaid he plays the cultured southern aristocrat for all he is worth ive seen leo marston play so many roles that im not sure anything lies at the center of the man other than a burning compulsion to increase his dominion over people land and money as i contemplate him his words begin to lose their rhythm then falter altogether he has spotted me the bluegray eyes hold mine unblinking searching revealing nothing a few heads in the audience turn to me wondering who could possibly have upset the equilibrium of the judge noticing this leo resumes speaking though without the ease he earlier displayed he focuses on the women in his audience lingering upon the prettiest that his weakness was women i discovered in high school when his sexual escapades almost destroyed his family leos wife found a way to live with his flagrant infidelities but his youngest daughter could not when olivia marston learned at sixteen that her father had left a wake of brokenhearted and pregnant women behind him which clarified the mystery of her mothers chronic alcoholism she turned the strength shed inherited from leo against him shaming and threatening him into changing his ways it worked for a while but appetites on that scale cant be suppressed long what i found fascinatingand livy disgustingwas that she was the only woman who ever challenged him not one of leos castoff paramours ever tried to bring him down the single ones he paid off with abortion money and more frequently enough to send them back to college or get them started in a new town the married ones nursed their broken hearts in silence or if they confessed to their husbands were surprised by the nonviolence of the reaction such male passivity was unheard of in the south but by virtue of his power leo marston enjoyed a sort of modernday droit du signeur and he used it as far as i know hes paid only one price for his sexual adventures though his name has been floated more than once as a potential candidate for governor each time party officials quietly let the suggestion die no one feels confident about exposing leo marstons past to the scrutiny of a modern election youre not carrying a gun are you startled from my reverie i find sam jacobs standing beside me he looks as though hes only half joking am i that obvious you look like youre ready to tear leo a new one i can dream cant i look i need to talk to you can you give me a ride home im ready now lets hit the bar before we go dons got a bottle of laphroig over there sam leads the way i shake hands with several people as we move through the crowd accepting compliments on my books and answering polite questions about annie the alcohol has loosened everybody up though thankfully not too much as lucy perry promised no one mentions the newspaper article when i catch up to sam at the bar hes chatting with two other men waiting for drinks hells bells cries a gravelly female voice behind me if it aint the houston representative of the ndoubleaseep dread fills me as i turn certain that im about to endure a public dressingdown for my comments in the paper the speaker is maude marston leos wife is obviously drunk as she has been for as long as i can remember in response to the judges amorous adventures maude developed a sort of battleship manner charging through her daily social round with prow thrust forward and guns primed for combat anyone who whispers malicious comments within her hearing risks a withering broadside salvo or worse depth charges dropped with stealth and unerring aim that detonate days or weeks later leaving the offender shattered and forever outside the inner social circle i hate to guess what she has in store for me whassa matter hotshot she drawls cat got your tongue i force myself to smile good evening maude its nice to see you she stares with blank rage as though the synapses behind her eyes have stopped firing maude was once a great beauty but her two daughters are the only remaining testament to that fact her hair should be gray but it has been bleached and hennaed and sprayed so often that it has acquired a sort of lacqueredarmor look the cumulative effect of that hair the ginglazed eyes combative stance and scowling avian face stretched taut by various plastic surgeries is enough to send any but the most stalwart running for the exits she pokes a grossly bejeweled finger into my chest im talking to you youre drunk i say quietly she blanches then pokes me again harder thats assault you gonna have me arrested hotshot over maudes shoulder i see caitlin watching from the hall her eyes flickering with curiosity no im going to ask your husband to take you home a harsh cackle bursts from maudes lips and she wobbles on her feet you appointed yourself special protector of the nigras in this town or what sam jacobs reaches between us and takes hold of my forearm got the drinks lets roll great to see you maude as sam pulls me away maude speaks softly but with a venom that makes me pause you ruined my daughters life you bastard then she throws her drink in my face a collective gasp goes up from the nearby guests the drink is mostly ice its maudes words that have stunned me i have no idea what shes talking about it has to be livy but that makes no sense at all before i can gather my thoughts for a question lucy perry appears and gentles maude away from the bar the way a trainer gentles a wild mare lets blow this joint before somebody gets killed sam whispers as we depart caitlin leans toward me i cant wait to hear the story behind that perfect chapter sam jacobs drives a royal blue hummer the civilian version of the military humvee he claims its the only way to travel in the oil fields i cling to the window frame as the huge vehicle rumbles like a tank down state street talk about a babe magnet he says trying to hold his drink steady with his left hand more women come on to me in this thing than when i had my mercedes i nod absently maude marston has popped the cork on a dark vintage of memory did you give caitlin masters a tour of the garden sam asks giving me a bemused smile you two had that couple look when you came in did you hear what maude said before she threw the drink in my face about ruining her daughters life yes she had to be talking about olivia right had to be when did livys life get ruined isnt she still married to that sports lawyer in atlanta definitely fartin through silk on the money side i laugh wondering whether the jewish crowd in manhattan would believe the southern accent coming from sam jacobss mouth however sam adds cutting his eyes at me my wifes sister was in atlanta last month for some kind of tridelt alumni ball and livy showed up without her husband so the gossip of the party was trouble in paradise not exactly a reliable source do they have any kids dont think so he glances at me again it would be pretty strange the two of you being available at the same time its like fate maybe historys reversing itself not wanting to continue in this line i stick my head out of the window as the hummer roars up the bypass toward my parents neighborhood the wind is warm and wet in my hair the downtown bars and riverboat casino will still be going great guns but this part of town looks like mayberry rfd have you seen anybody sam asks you know since sarah died i pull my head back inside and look him in the eye lunch with caitlin masters tomorrow is my first date since the funeral if you call that a date shit i know its tough penn i joke about fooling around but if i ever lost jenny i wouldnt know what to do i take his cup from his hand and gulp a sweatinducing shot of laphroig thats the ticket he says slapping me on the knee the hummer jerks as sam hits the brakes then lets off slowly would you fucking look at this what a cop looks like a sheriffs deputy i turn slowly a sheriffs department cruiser just like the one that tailed me from shad johnsons headquarters has settled in twenty yards behind the hummer the sight throws me back to the shooting glass exploding inches from my face sam what do you know about ray presley ray presley hes sick i heard bad sick whats he been up to the last few years same thing he was always up to being a sleazy coonass wholl do anything for money presleys no coonass hes from jones county who did he work for old natchez people mostly sams eyes keep flicking to the rearview mirror he did some things for a driller i know strongarm stuff i think marston kept him on his payroll as a security consultant if you believe that sam accelerates as if daring the deputy to pull him over you know what ill bet the basf deal is what set maude off on you what does maude marston care about a chemical plant she has more money than god but does she have enough that chemical plant means more to the marstons than anybody short term anyway why the industrial park isnt big enough for the projected facility you want to guess who owns the land contiguous to the park site leo yep hell squeeze blood out of basf for every square foot of land or kill them on usage and access fees but thats got nothing to do with livy sam nods then turns and looks hard at me caitlin masterss article said ray presley worked the payton murder when he was a cop is that what this is about its nothing to do with that sam slams his hand against the hummers steering wheel look at this asshole i hate it when they follow you like that he cranes his neck around and looks through the back windscreen you gonna stop me or what i dont think he is i think its the same guy who followed me from shad johnsons headquarters earlier tonight shad johnsons headquarters sam shakes his head im riding with a crazy man ten seconds after he passed me somebody shot up my car with a rifle what im just saying that if this guy passes us watch him close sam reaches under the seat pulls out a holstered colt and sets it in my lap hes fucking with the wrong vehicle if thats his plan this hummer will drive right over that crown vic hes in take it easy hes just tailing us why the sudden interest in ray presley ill tell you in a couple of days do you think we could find anybody who could testify that presley has committed murder for money a lot of people could would is another question sam turns into my parents neighborhood watching his rearview mirror through the turn there goes our shadow bye bye a minute later he pulls the hummer into our driveway and leaves it idling i feel bad about mentioning sarah i guess time is the only thing that can get you past something like that i swallow the last of the scotch ill never get past it sam im a different person now part of me is lying in that grave in houston yeah well most of you is sitting right here and your daughter needs that part i know i keep thinking about del paytons widow race doesnt even come into it for me for thirty years part of her has been buried wherever her husband is were both wounded the same way you know sam shuts off the engine listen to me penn whoever blew up del payton was in their twenties then thirties max kluckers full of piss and vinegar those guys have got wives and grown kids now and if you think theyre gonna let some hotshit niggerlovin writer take all that away youre nuts thats who shot at you tonight and if you keep pushing theyll kill you sam has the jews special fear of fanatics during the civil rights era this anxiety caused many mississippi jews to keep as low a profile as possible some gave heroic support to the movement others primarily in the delta actually joined the white citizens councils for fear of the consequences if they didnt sams parents chose the difficult middle ground dont worry sam caitlin masters has given everybody the idea im a crusading liberal ready to drag the town through the mud nothing could be further from the truth bullshit i know you when you sound like this youll pull down the temple to find the truth i remember you sounding like this once that time in junior high when your dad hired us to clean out his attic sam gives no sign that hes heard but i know he has going through all those boxes i remind him we found that list two hundred names all handwritten he reaches out and toys with the hummers ignition key the papers we found had listed most members of natchezs ku klux klan and white citizens council the jewish community had maintained the list as a security measure and more than a few names on it belonged to fathers of kids we went to school with you remember how you felt when you saw those names he picks up the drink cup and nervously shakes the ice scared me too but it pissed me off more i wanted to expose those assholes for what they were so did you have you ever done business with anybody on that list he looks up his eyes hard as agates not a fucking one and i spiked them where i could a side spill of headlights washes across my parents house would you look at this sam mutters looking over his shoulder its the same car the sheriffs cruiser sits idling in the street fifteen yards behind us bolstered by the confidence of being on my fathers property i set the in sams lap climb out of the hummer and walk toward the car the passenger window whirs down into the door frame its the black deputy who followed me before i put my hands on the door and lean into the window can i help you the deputy says nothing he has a bald bulletshaped head dominated by black eyes set in yellow sclera shot with blood hes at least fifty but he fills out his brown uniform like an nfl cornerback even at rest he radiates coiled energy you were following me earlier tonight right the black eyes burn into mine with unsettling intensity could have been he says in a gravelly voice ten seconds after you passed me somebody shot up my car you stopped why didnt you help me i didnt hear no shots i saw you stop i waited to make sure you started again why didnt you report it if you was shot at what the hell is this about deputy why are you following me he purses his lips and taps the steering wheel get rid of your friend tell him i warned you off the payton case then go inside after he leaves meet me back out here look if this is about del payton this is about you penn cage he spears me with a chilling stare and unfinished business unfinished business a needle of fear pushes through my gut could he be talking about ray presley could he know something about what happened in mobile in do you know a man named ray presley deputy his jaw muscles flex into knots i know that motherfucker does this have anything to do with him it might you just be out here when i get back he presses the accelerator spinning me away from the car after regaining my balance i watch the cruiser disappear then walk back to the drivers window of the hummer what the hell was that about sam asks how many black sheriffs deputies are there nine or ten i think that was one of them yeah fiftyish but tough baldheaded had to be ike ransom you know him i do ike the spike remember i do remember ike the spike ransom was a legendary football star at thompson the black high school in the midsixties he was so good that his exploits were trumpeted in the pages of the examiner despite his skin color and the records he set had held until sam and i played ball ten years later what the hell did ike ransom want here sam asks same as everybody else warned me off the payton case i cant believe ike the spike is a deputy i figured he played pro football or something sam shrugs he was a cop first after he put in his twenty there he went to the sheriffs department hes a bad son of a bitch penn even the blacks dont like him what do you mean he was a hero ransom was one of the first black cops i heard those guys had to prove theyd be tough on their own people to keep their jobs some people say ransom was worse than white cops great sam cranks the hummer forget del payton take care of your own and if somebody fucks with you give me a call i can still pull your slack if you need me i squeeze his shoulder sounds like a plan thanks he backs out of the driveway and roars away the echoes reverberating off the houses on the silent street i walk into the garage and lean against the trunk of my mothers maxima the high whistling cheeep of crickets rises to a manic drone overpowering the buzz of the streetlight overhead and giving me a strange sense of peace our street looks almost exactly as it did thirtyfive years ago when we moved in a few houses have changed color some trees have disappeared others have grown but for the most part its the same in the corner of our yard stands a huge oak when i was a boy a wisteria vine grew around its trunk spiraling around and around until it reached the high branches my friends and i used to splay our bare feet on that vine spread our arms wide around the trunk and see how high we could work our way up and around the tree before we fell i never won those contests i had too much imagination to successfully block out my fear back then the vine was the thickness of a boys wrist now its thicker than my thigh and looks as though it will soon strangle the old oak like a boa constrictor the drone of an engine cuts through the hot night air as promised ike the spikes cruiser turns the corner and rolls to a stop at the end of our driveway i push off the maxima and walk toward the street chapter the inside of the cruiser smells like a black man sweating i know the odor from summer jobs digging ditches and riding in trucks with men who gave off a different scent than i didno worse but harder somehow distinctive enough for me to know it forever i pull the door shut closing myself into an oppressive square completed by the dashboard a wire mesh screen and deputy ike ransom lets take a ride he says how about you tell me what im doing here you want the neighbors asking everybody what the sheriffs department was doing at your folks house i look up the street there are still lights in a few windows how do i know youre not in with whoever shot at me tonight if i wanted you dead your mama would be at the funeral home right now this is easy enough to believe okay ride ike ransom drives up to the bypass and heads south most of the traffic is eighteenwheelers bound north for the interstate junction sixty miles away or west for the bridge over the mississippi whats this about ike he glances at me you know me my friend did whats the big secret its about del payton i told you i didnt want to hear about that its about you and del both me and del i was only eight years old when the guy died he looks at me again the yellow sclera of his eyes washed white by oncoming headlights he didnt die college boy he was murdered theres a difference you and him tied together though aint no doubt about that how do you figure that first tell me why you said what you said in the paper i was talking through my hat i wasnt thinking that newspaper bitch didnt pick dels name out of the blue i mentioned him there you go i sigh in frustration im lost ike thats for damn sure cant you see del died thirty years ago and nobody paid for it his soul aint never been at rest its been wandering round here all this time looking for peace but it cant get no peace not while his killers walk free maybe ike the spike is some kind of religious nut now here you come thirty years later and in one day you got more people talking about dels killing than they was the day he died that wasnt my intent that dont matter dont you see what goes around comes around you just an instrument an instrument of a higher power im a guy with a big mouth im not an instrument of anything ransom shakes his head and laughs with eerie certainty you just sit tight you gonna understand everything in a minute you gonna thank old ike for this one he turns right at the ford dealership and crosses lower woodville road near the paper mill which glows fluorescent in the dark like a small city churning white smoke into the night sky where are we going the river battery plant the battery plant what for privacy they closed right now asian markets down they crank back up in thirtysix hours there are few lights on this road beneath the sulfurous odor of the paper mill drifts the thick ripe smell of kudzu sweetened by a breath of honeysuckle the river is only six hundred yards away and just a few feet below our present elevation the dark skeleton of the triton battery plant materializes to our right as ike turns onto gate street then right again into a parking lot lighted by the pink glow of mercury vapor the triton battery company came to natchez in to build batteries for pullman rail cars in they retooled the line to manufacture batteries for diesel submarines after the war it was truck batteries marine batteries whatever fit the changing market the last i heard triton was using its ancient equipment to produce motorcycle batteries for european manufacturers ike stops the cruiser on the far side of the parking lot were sitting on an acre of gravel packed into dirt by years of hard use bordered on three sides by trees and unkempt grass the west side faces the main gate of the battery plant with gate street running between i used to bring girls out here in high school is this where del payton died this it ransom says come on where he laughs harshly you a nervous son of a bitch aint you come on i get out of the cruiser and follow him across the gravel a massive old pecan tree grows out of a clump of grass at the center of the lot the spaces in its shade are probably coveted by everyone who uses the lot ransom stops ten yards short of the tree his back to me thirty years he says thirty years ago del payton parked his fairlane right in this spot when he came out of the plant the bomb was in his car he half turns to me and spits on the gravel i seen car bombs go off man its a motherfucker that fire burned forty minutes before they got it out del was sitting behind the wheel all that time i stand silent in the buzzing of the lights wondering where ike ransom has seen car bombs go off he squats on his haunches and picks up a piece of gravel a mans soul left this earth right here i walk a few steps closer look ike i know what happened that night and im damn sorry it did but i dont see any connection to me he stands and points at me his black eyes smoldering im gonna say two words college boy after that you gonna be in this thing up to your neck okay leo marston he watches me as though waiting for me to guess a riddle leo marston i dont get it what judge leo marston my palms tingle are you saying marston was somehow involved in the payton murder involved ike the spike laughs quietly in the dark oh yeah thats impossible what could leo marston possibly have had to do with del payton he was da back then wasnt he my head is swimming leo marston was district attorney in you didnt know that it was in the article this morning i see my father jerking the paper from my hands and wadding it up i didnt read the whole thing that wasnt too smart was it youre saying marston covered something up buried evidence while he was da ike fires his rock across the street like a major league outfielder it flies over the cyclone fence bordering the plant and strikes something metal silencing the crickets for a few seconds im saying all these years that motherfucker been handing out jail time and making millions he should have been rotting at parchman farm a dark thrill ripples through my chest youre saying marston was involved in the actual crime i done said all i got to say you cant drop a bomb like that and then shut up how do you know any of this you a cop in this town for twenty years even a black cop you get to know some things the hair on my arms is standing erect i cannot interpret my emotions fear excitement i walk the ten yards to the pecan tree unzip my pants and urinate on its trunk as i try to get my mind around what ransom has told me shook you up huh he says laughing i zip up and turn back to him youve known for thirty years that leo marston was guilty of a felony and youve done nothing about it what says i knew for thirty years i wasnt on the job thirty years ago what im gonna do anyway man a nigger cop on the bottle gonna go up against the judge thats why you here man takes somebody like you to do it like me youre white famous and you make your money someplace else they cant hurt you much here whos they thats what you got to find out christ just tell me what you know ill take it and run with it ike gives me a knowing smile you want marstons ass bad dont you tell me goddamn it that dont play college boy you gotta work your way to it then youll understand why tell me this ike why me ike he mocks in a womans voice dont play that shit with me everybody knows the judge went after your old man damn near got him too this stings me to the quick thats bullshit my father was unanimously exonerated by a jury i aint talking bout that im talking about damage doc cage had a heart attack while he was waiting for that trial didnt he i nod slowly hey i love your daddy man he took care of me when i was a kid took care of my mama till she died thats why im telling you this its what the hippies used to call karma what goes around comes around thats what brought you back here you the chicken coming home to roost right on marstons ass so give me what i need to nail him ike shakes his head gimme gimme gimme i told you it dont play that way i can point you in the right direction but thats it i dont like playing games ransom snickers thats what they do here college boy you aint been gone so long you forgot that yet right now they playing their favorite game of all whats that the quiet game the quiet game memories of sarah flood into my brain of her trying to trick annie into being silent long enough for us to eat dinner in peace by seeing who could go the longest without talking whos playing the quiet game ike everybody man white and black both everybody keeping quiet making like things is sweet and easy trying to fish that new plant in here nobody wants nobody digging into dels killing nobody cept you you got a reason what about you whats your reason his grin vanishes as though it never existed hatred comes off him like steam he extends his forefinger and taps his powerful chest with it thats between me and me dels killers is playing the quiet game too they been playing it thirty years not even sweatin you got to make people nervous to win the quiet game and i got a feeling you pretty good at that something is coiling within my chest something i have not felt for years its the hunters tension wrapped like the armature of an electric motor tight and coppercored charged with current and aching for resolution for the frantic discharge of retribution a lot of people think poking into this case would be damned dangerous i tell him ike the spike closes the distance between us and squeezes my right shoulder his grip like the claw of a wild animal like he could close his hand a little tighter and snap the bone thats where i come in boy you lookin at dangerous ask anybody we do not speak as ransom drives back to my parents house i watch the dark streets drift by lost in memory i think mostly of the malpractice trial of marstons savage crossexamination of my father just five weeks after his triple coronary bypass surgery it required a supreme concentration of will on my part not to jump up in the courtroom and attack the man in all my years as a prosecutor i never stooped to the tactics marston used that day you got any fbi contacts ike asks a few why you might not want to use them on this why not free advice take it or leave it you know ray presley worked the payton case dont you ike glances away from the road long enough to give me a warning look presley was dirty from the day he was born that motherfucker crazy as a walleyed bull and mean as a snake you dont talk to him unless im somewhere close this does not bode well for my meeting tomorrow morning the radio chatters over a low background of static theres a domesticviolence call in the southern part of the county followed by a disturbance at the gangplank of the riverboat casino as we roll into my parents neighborhood i glance over at ransom the man is too old to be doing the job he has can i ask you a question ike he takes a kool menthol from his shirt pocket lights up and blows a stream of smoke at the windshield howd you wind up a cop thats what college boys ask whores howd a girl like you end up here i remember the stories about you playing ball ike the spike you were a hero around here he sniffs and takes another drag like the man said that was my fifteen minutes you must have played college ball oh yeah i was the bnoc whats that the big nigger on campus his voice is laced with bitterness i got a full scholarship to ohio state but i went to jackson state instead first quarter of the first game a guy took out my shoulder back then doctors couldnt do shit for that you lost your scholarship they gave me my walking papers before i even caught my breath i was good enough for the army though id been drafted in early sixtysix but i had a college deferment when i lost my scholarship i couldnt afford to stay in school next thing i knew i was landing at tan son nhut air base in danang i am starting to perceive the twisted road that led ike ransom to this job id like to hear about it sometime another drag on the kool you one of them war junkies no you get off on other peoples pain though thats what writers do aint it sell other peoples pain some do i guess well this is your big chance theres a heap of fucking pain at the bottom of this story i try to gauge ransoms temper but its impossible sam says youve got a bad rep even with black people he stubs out his cigarette and flips it out the window i was the third black cop on the natchez pd back then a lot of the force was klan i didnt take that job to make no civil rights statement id been an mp in saigon and that was the only thing i knew how to do the first time i got called to a black juke i had to go alone when i walked in the door everybody thought it was a big joke patting me on the back and laughing handing me beer but this big field nigger named moon had a machete in there hed already cut the guy who was dicking his old lady plus the first nigger who said something about it he was sitting by hisself at a corner table id seen lots of guys lose it overseas and this guy was like that gone i told him he had to give up the blade he wouldnt do it when i held out my hand he jumped up and charged me i shot him through the throat jesus i didnt want to waste that brother but i didnt have no backup and that pretty much set the tone for the next twenty years i had the white department on one side watching me like a hawk making sure i was tough enough and my people on the other always fucking up always begging for a break i cut slack where i could but goddamn it seemed like they never learned it got to where i hated to pull a nigger over knowing hed be drunk or high hated to answer a domestic call couple years of that i was an outsider it fucked with me man thats what got me on the bottle why didnt you resign ransom rolls down his window hawks and spits i didnt come here to give you no jerry springer show he pulls something out of his shirt and hands it to me its a card on it are printed ransoms name and rank and the phone numbers of the sheriffs department my cell phones on the back when you call dont use names ill know you and ill pick a place for a meet youre the only person not named payton who seems to want the truth told the radio crackles again this time about a theft of guns from a hunting camp in annas bottom ike picks up the transmitter and says hell respond to the call you gonna do this thing he asks putting the transmitter back in its cradle i think of my father and his trouble of ray presley and the gun i hope to have in my possession by tomorrow i dont know yet his eyes flash with dark knowledge you know you lying get out of my fucking car before i can close the door the cruiser screeches off into the night my father is waiting in the kitchen with a bowl of melted ice cream in front of him smoking the last of a cigar in his boxer shorts and a tank tshirt beside the ice cream lies the pistol he wore to the party a mm beretta everything okay i ask are you sure you want to try to buy that gun from ray id rather throw myself on the mercy of the court than get you involved in this i shake my head its the only way you just call presley in the morning and set up the meeting youll have to go to his trailer he lives out toward church hill past the indian mound it wont be pretty hes a bitter son of a bitch you say he gets around okay yeah the homehealth people see him a good bit and i hear hes got a private nurse now ive made a couple of house calls to give him shots for pain trailer calls i should say fifteenmile house calls for ray presley ive treated the man for thirty years penn he doesnt call unless hes hurting bad and if ray says its bad its bad this is vintage tom cage making house calls on a man who is blackmailing him not out of fear but because he feels he should prostate cancer was about the worst thing for ray to get he reflects hes got the biggest dick i ever saw on a white man and he likes to brag about it i think the surgery probably made him impotent he says no but hes twice as surly as he ever was more dangerous if anything worrying wont help come on we both need some sleep he stubs out his cigar then stands looking at me his eyes unreadable i long to tell him what ike ransom said about leo marston but this isnt the time get the gun first without quite meaning to i step forward and put my arms around him the embrace surprises him and he stiffens age has changed the shape of him this body that once lifted me as though i weighed nothing dad tomorrow youre going to find out what being born again really means he pulls back and looks me in the eye ill let you go see ray but by god youre going armed he picks up the beretta and if he gets squirrelly you shoot first and ask questions after okay okay my mother is curled up in bed beside the smaller lump of annie in my old room my old baseball trophies gleam in the dark on the shelves above them like little watchmen i creep in and touch mom on the shoulder and she stirs in the shadows tom its penn mom go on to bed ill sleep with her she rubs her eyes all right honey i reach out and stroke annies hair mom is already asleep again i gently push her leg with my knee mom she opens her eyes again and smiles blankly then gets up and sleepwalks toward the hall i quickly brush my teeth strip to my shorts and climb into bed beside annie who is already stirring in seconds her hand finds my shoulder reestablishing her earlywarning system as i lie in the dark her shallow breathing troubles rather than soothes my heart sleeping with annie always brings memories of sarah after the funeral i had to move annies bed into my room because she couldnt fall asleep alone and still she wound up in my bed most nights the pulse of her life so near always stirs my dreams i dream of sarah before the diagnosis before fear entered our lives and took away the most precious gift which is not hope but youth immortality the sense of unlimited possibility its an illusion of course the most precious illusion of life sometimes my dreams are linear like movies other times disconnected like fragments of film snatched at random from an editing room floor as annie breathes steadily beside me fatigue deadens the signals flashing through my brain the anxiety about meeting presley the delicious prospect of revenge on leo marston consciousness tries to hold me with the terrifying jerk of a perceived fall but i catch myself soon the darkness above me tunnels into light and i see the silver surface of a pool surrounded by lush ferns and massive cypress trees the windrippled surface slowly stills to glass opening the water to my gaze there are plants below the surface green fronds reaching up from unknown depths gently waving in an invisible current among the fronds something moves pale against the green a person a woman she turns lazily gracefully among the water plants like a swimmer synchronized to unheard music her hair floats around her head in a bright corona obscuring what must be extraordinary beauty ceasing her languid motion she lifts her arms and pulls toward the surface i recall the lady of the lake who gave excalibur to arthur this woman is like that she has something to give me but even as she fights her way to the surface she somehow recedes like reality rewinding i reach down to help her but i am far too high slowly the storm of hair parts and reveals her face and she opens her mouth to speak i cannot hear her words but her face nearly stops my heart something pure and cold courses through me as the translucent eyes seek mine in mute desperation that face once haunted me like an inner shadow a secret sharer watching judging holding me in thrall until at last the light of sarah and annie shone into the hidden chambers of my heart and it receded into memory receded but did not die once long ago that face taught me what it was to be alive that face olivia marston chapter driving through rural mississippi with a hundred thousand dollars cash in your trunk can make you nervous ray presleys trailer is fourteen miles north of town situated between emerald mound and the tiny rural community of church hill the secondhighest ceremonial mound in north america emerald mound rises from the forest like a mayan temple of earth when i was a boy we sledded down its great slope on pizza pans on those biannual occasions when natchez got its inch of snow as teenagers we gathered there to watch the sun rise while we drank beer and cheap wine and howled over the treetops in the ecstatic tongues of adolescence the wooded road between emerald mound and church hill is dotted with trailers and small houses but as i near the twohundredyearold episcopal church that marks the settlement the woods recede and the landscaped grounds of splendid plantations stretch away from both sides of the road beyond mosshung cedar trees and white fences swans glide majestically across ponds that might be in england but the only cathedrals near these estates are cathedrals of kudzu arsenical green spires and buttresses which construct themselves at a terrifying rate using oaks and pecans and elms as scaffolding encroaching upon the old cotton fields with the stealth of new jungle the history here is not all antebellum andrew jackson married rachel robards at the end of this road in but of late the neighborhood has entertained more eccentric visitors when i was in high school the actor george hamilton purchased one of these homes and lived there for a while in opulent planter style the fall of the marcos regime in the philippines brought to light the strange revelation that the hamilton house was actually owned by imelda marcos it then passed for a time into the hands of hare krishnas a separatist faction which morphed into the southern vedic life association stirring up the country with fears of brainwashing even in rural mississippi nothing is what it seems ray presleys trailer is set a little way back from the highway beneath a stand of pine trees and beside an algaecovered pond that might be an oil sump the trailer has seen better years but theres a gleaming new satellite dish hammered onto the southwest eave like a ribbon on a pigs ear a shining ford pickup and a rusted chevy vega sit out front i pull my mothers maxima beside the vega set the burglar alarm and walk up to the door leaving the walmart briefcase holding the extortion money in the trunk before i can press the bell the door is opened by a thin young woman i assume is presleys nurse though she is wearing a denim work shirt not a uniform blonde and lankhaired she could be twentyfive or thirtyfive she has the indeterminate look of hill people everywhere sallow skin and hard angles though she is pretty in the way waitresses at the waffle house can be pretty at four am she doesnt speak but leads me into the den of the trailer which is a time capsule of blue shag carpet and dark seventiesera paneling presley himself sits on a sofa opposite a large color television tuned to a soap opera a tv tray before him and a stainless steel intravenous drug caddy standing beside he looks surprisingly fit for a fiftysixyearold man with metastatic carcinoma he has the stringy toughness of a laborer the long ropy muscles you see on men working shirtless on highways shrimp boats and oil rigs he wears blue cotton pajama pants and a white tank tshirt a greasestained john deere cap covers his head which has been burned bald by chemotherapy the green bill shading browless eyes that smolder in their sockets i glance around the room so that he wont feel im staring the walls are decorated with plaques and photos commemorating a career in law enforcement certificates from various police societies a couple of trophies sporting a man aiming a pistol theres also the usual complement of stuffed deer heads and mounted largemouth bass along with a fearsome compound bow hanging from a hook sliding glass doors open onto a small deck behind the sofa where a gas grill and a smoker stand rusting in the sun so youre doc cages boy presley says his voice is deep and rough as a wood rasp i recognize you from the paper excuse me if i dont get up please dont its odd how we revert to the basic courtesies even when talking to killers especially if they are ill my seating choices are a cracked naugahyde recliner and a pillowy velour monstrosity that looks like a kmart special take the lazboy presley advises i sit on the edge of the chair so that i can keep my forward attitude with men like ray presley the critical subtext of any conversation is animal even in the silences everything is territory and dominance a battle for advantage so youre the one shot his mouth off about del payton in the paper he says a halfhumorous light in his eyes thats right you looking to make a name for yourself i already have that he leans back and regards me with disdain i guess you do but youd have to go a long way to outdo your daddy he reaches down and eats a crust of toast from the eggstained plate on the tv tray how come you didnt go to medical school grades not good enough this is the ultimate baiting question for any doctors son who didnt follow his father into the profession they were too good the medical school thought id be bored there i let presley chew on this a minute and it takes him about that to finally decide i am joking his primitive instincts are finely honed but his grasp of the larger world is limited i remember you in high school he says you was porking livy marston i keep my face impassive that was one fine bitch he goes on watching my reaction had too much of everything that was her trouble the skin of my face seems to stretch and burn but i say nothing unwilling to be drawn into this game after an interminable wait he says you here to ask me about del payton im here because i heard you had a gun for sale he picks up a remote control and flips through several channels finally settling on a fishing program you heard wrong i dont think so what kind of gun did you hear it was his eyes remain on the screen this gun youre talking about i mean a featherweight thirtyeight smith and wesson thats a damn good piece good for close work how much would you be looking to spend on a gun like that i take a piece of paper from my wallet write on it then lean forward and pass it to him he studies it for a few seconds thats a piece of money cash he hands the paper back to me too bad i dont have what youre looking for i could use a piece of money like that i think you need some air why dont we step outside i dont get around so good anymore i didnt realize youd lost so much strength his pride thus goaded presley puts down the remote and stands almost as easily as he must have at age twenty he walks to the double glass doors slides one open and steps onto the little square redwood deck i follow presley stops at the rail surveying the modest lot left him in life a few weedchoked rows of exposed earth where a garden once grew a small barn stripped of its walls rotted and collapsed inward leaving a modernist sculpture of rafters and tin the wall boards were probably bought by some itinerant new england artist beyond the barn the land falls abruptly into the woods take your shirt off presley says in a peremptory tone he probably used with prisoners in the days before he was one himself had he not demanded this ritual i would have but it irks me that he beat me to it ill show you mine if you show me yours i reply he actually grins at this we pull off our shirts and turn in a circle my body is lean but smooth as a lambs the legacy of my generation which was never shipped overseas to do battle and has done less manual labor than any generation before it presleys torso is marked by multiple knife scars at least two bullet wounds and what might be the scar of a central venous line for chemotherapy pants too i tell him we both strip our pants halfway down our thighs like me presley still wears jockey briefs and my fathers comment about his anatomy is readily borne out satisfied that neither of us is wired we button and zip back up i dont like bullshit i tell him so ill get right to it you killed a man named don hillman in in mobile alabama you did that on your own hook no matter what you thought im prepared to offer you a substantial price for the pistol used in that crime but its a onetime offer an outright purchase you can take what im offering or we can go to plan b you fixing to threaten me sonny presley sounds more amused than angry if we dont come to terms over this im going to go straight to the district attorneywhom i went to school withand use every bit of influence at my disposal to have you indicted for capital murder and extortion thats a risk for my father but its one hes prepared to take hes been more than generous with you and hes tired of living in fear presley looks off into the trees he deserves better and you know it i cant help the way things turned out presley says bitterly fact is doc has money and i dont and i need some my father treated your family free for years just like he did a lot of others what hes got now is patients who think hes a saint and not much else hes in bad health himself he deserves to retire in peace presley scratches his ratty pajamas the way i figure that guns worth a lot more than fifty thousand or nothing it could simply be evidence sitting in the das office a hundred grand cash money relief trickles through my veins like cool water youve committed other murders in the past i suspect youre blackmailing other people as we speak right now havent the slightest bit of interest in those crimes but that could change you could spend what little time you have left in jail and you know what thats like ray i spit off the deck sixtyfive thousand he doesnt like me using his first name and though he hasnt moved something changed in him at the mention of prison eighty he says in a taut voice is the gun here could be if you get it now ill go seventyfive thats all i brought with me presleys facial muscles flex hes grinding his teeth he wants that money but as badly as he does he hates to give up the gun hes like a miser sitting on his last nickel his eyes burn beneath the bill of the cap hating me for who i am for the life ive had he rolls his tongue around his inner cheek wanting to tell me to fuck myself but at last he breaks eye contact and walks toward the glass doors of the trailer his growl floats back to me on the humid air get your money boy i hurry down the dryrotted stairs of the deck and around the trailer to the maxima i parked so that i could open the briefcase in the trunk without being seen from the trailer popping the trunk i move the sack of quicksetting cement behind which i concealed the case and count out twentyfive thousand dollars which i stuff into the spare tire well then i snap the case and shut the trunk before going back to the trailer i get in the car inside the glove box is dads mm beretta i slip the automatic into my waistband at the small of my back tuck my shirt over it and head up the front steps presley is waiting for me on the sofa the sallow blonde is attaching a plastic saline bag to the iv stand and her back is to me her motions are quick and efficient presley points at the tv set lying atop it in a ziploc bag is a smallcaliber revolver smith amp wesson i take a card from my wallet on it is written the serial number of the pistol my father has not seen for twentyfive years i remove the from the ziploc and compare its serial number to the one on the card they match resealing the pistol in the bag i slide it into my trouser pocket and toss the case containing the money onto the sofa presley tugs it onto his lap unsnaps it and counts the packets with methodical care as the blonde waits she glances over her shoulder at me her eyes vaguely accusatory presley finally snaps the case shut drops it on the floor leans back on the sofa and extends his right wrist toward the blonde woman dorsal side up time for my poison he says the corners of his mouth turned up with black humor the girl removes a heparinlock catheter from its packaging swabs presleys wrist with betadine and pops it through the skin in the time it would take most lab techs to locate a vein as she tears off some white tape and fixes the catheter in place presley leans up and slaps her on the rump with the familiarity of a lover the blonde does not complain or make any move to stop him she doesnt even look embarrassed youd best get going sonny he says crystals gonna take the edge off the nausea for me the girl half turns to me a resentful gleam in her eye the top three buttons of her work shirt are unbuttoned revealing the clasp of a black bra beneath it shes at least twenty years presleys juniorprobably thirtyand for some reason this offends me my puritan morals i suppose im not one to deny a dying man what pleasure he can get but something about this arrangement seems wrong the woman doesnt strike me as a hooker but presley is paying her in some way probably not much either when youre poor a little money looks like a lot or maybe hes not paying her maybe shes here because she wants to be hereor needs to be that bothers me even more i didnt know nurses could administer chemotherapy at home presley laughs darkly this is my mexican cocktail they ups it up here from tijuana my new orleans cancer doc says itll kill me but ive outlived that bastards prediction by a year already bootleg chemotherapy is that whats keeping him alive or is it just brute redneck stubbornness they cut out my damn prostate he mutters but i made em leave the nerves in i can still go like a brahma bull the blonde sits on the floor at his feet waiting for me to leave just remember something ray youve got all youre going to get from this particular well nice doing business with you son let me give you a piece of advice before you go whats that leave del payton in the ground you start messing with business that oldespecially niggerbusiness it makes a lot of people nervous i figured that out already youre a smart boy aint you the blonde checks presleys iv line for bubbles then leans back against his legs i walk to the door but something makes me turn let me ask you something ray how did judge marston get involved in paytons murder presley goes as still as a snake poised to strike his eyes locked on mine maybe you aint so smart after all theres a lot of guys on death row who think different i shut the door leaving him to his bootleg chemo and his blonde my stomach is fluttering like the wings of a hummingbird but the smith amp wesson is a hard bulge in my left front pocket i have the gun have the gun seventyfive thousand dollars is a small price to pay to have a spike removed from your heart chapter as soon as i hit the highway i dial my fathers office and wait for him to come to the phone dr cage he says finally its me what happened i have the package a long exhalation an expression of relief i can only guess at hes been waiting with the same anxiety his patients suffer through when awaiting a call from him about test results jesus he breathes son you dont know forget it dad its all over well talk tonight okay i cant believe it believe it its a new world ill see you tonight i punch off and zoom south toward natchez profoundly aware of the gun in my pocket i feel like a character from poe the symbol of guilt attached to my body and screaming for atonement but theres no danger ray presley is happy with his seventyfive grand he isnt calling anybody about that gun not today anyway with every mile i put between myself and his trailer the burden of my fathers anxiety falls away and my mind returns to its own selfish concerns ike ransom awakened a sleeping giant within me the giant is anger anger so profound complex and deeply buried that i have never fully plumbed it i have in fact spent years not thinking about it which required that a constant portion of my life energy be devoted to denial yet the anger was always there pulsing quietly beneath my surface life affecting my judgment my decisions my very concept of justice and morality for years i thought it was based on leo marstons attack on my father but this was selfdelusion my anguish was not for my fathers pain but for my own the most devastating result of marstons merciless legal persecution of my father was the end of any possibility that olivia marston and i would have a future together and that altered my life in ways beyond measuring ultimately it weakened my character like a crack in the steel of a bridge because always at the periphery of my existence the unwalked road of my life with livy stretched tangentially to infinity to be reflected upon only in sadness frustration and regret last night ike ransom offered me a chance i never thought i would get a chance to settle up with leo marston for all he did to me and my family to put paid to two decades of resentment and confusion the sheer power of my desire to destroy the man disturbs me as a prosecutor i tried to divorce myself from the concept of revenge justice not punishment was my ideal i didnt always succeed but i tried this is different i have no idea how leo marston could be involved in paytons murder but he is a complex man of vast appetites and he has rarely been thwarted in his desires i can easily envision a situation in which he let his temper get the best of him great wealth does not confer immunity to violent impulses i lift the cell phone and punch in the number of my houston office which occupies nine hundred square feet of our house at least it did until i instructed my assistant to store my furniture and sell the place penn cages office says cilia daniels relief floods through me im glad to know i still have one she laughs i let the movers take everything but the office furniture and equipment good instinct leave it all set up for now i swing the maxima into the left lane and goose it around a pulpwood truck what about the hanratty execution cilia asks mrs givens called this morning shes decided to witness the execution without her husband and she wants you there any lastminute filings likely stays the usual desperation tactics but they wont stop it this time and george w bush isnt about to grant a pardon midnight tomorrow night hanratty gets the needle damn tell mrs givens tell her i dont know yet whether i can make it please try penn that woman needs you you walked her family through the whole trial message received listen do you remember peter lutjens sure the fbi analyst who helped on presumption of guilt i need his phone number at the bureau hang on i think the fbi switchboard is the best i can do on lutjens thatll do i scrawl the number on my wrist thanks cil ive got to go not so fast what are you up to have you resurrected the manuscript just some research thats what you always say when youre on to something bye cil i hang up dial the hoover building and ask for peter lutjens giving my name as special agent jim gates during my time with the das office i became friends with several houstonbased field agents one of whom was jim gates most of those friends are now stationed around the country and globe and occasionally prove excellent sources for my books despite a standing order from fbi director portman to give me no assistance peter lutjens is better at research and analysis than chasing bank robbers and because the fbi knows this as well as i do they keep him buried in the massive archive of past bureau case files gates asks a surprised voice what are you doing in mississippi lutjens is obviously looking at some sort of callerid readout this isnt jim gates peter its penn cage penn cage jesus youve got some nerve what kind of trouble do you want to get me into now did i get you into trouble before well the acknowledgment in your book made me semifamous up here and the new director is no fan of yours as you well know the new directors an asshole peter as you well know no comment whats going on i need a favor its right up your alley historical stuff save the vaseline what is it im looking into a thirtyyearold murder case in my old hometown a civil rights murder i know the bureau worked the case somebody took a shot at a couple of your agents on highway during the same time frame youve sure got pisspoor timing why since the opening of the mississippi sovereignty commission files weve been deluged with requests for records from that period im talking about requests by law enforcement ie legitimate requests i really need this peter its personal lutjens doesnt reply theres no reason for him to bend any rules on my accountother than the goodwill resulting from a few enjoyable lunches the easy rapport of kindred spiritsand all the reason in the world for him not to i know a guy whos processing those requests he says in a cautious voice we worked together on the internal history of the bureau peter give me the victims name delano payton killed natchez mississippi fourteen may was anyone convicted of the crime no one even arrested lutjens clucks his tongue in admonishment youll never get a file on a case thats technically open not under the freedom of information act i just want names the agents who originally worked the case these guys worked for j edgar hoover penn theyre not the talkative type somebody always wants to talk nobodyll ever know how i found them portman would boil my balls for this he hesitates a moment longer stay by your phone ill know all im ever going to know within five minutes im at ive got the number i hang up and hit the accelerator feeling a burst of adrenaline as i eat up the miles between emerald mound and the city limits lutjenss willingness to help me says a lot about the successor lack of itthat john portman has had since taking over the bureau when he was appointed to the directorship seven months ago great things were expected from the former field agent both within the bureau and without but according to the reports ive heard portman has displayed the same traits in the hoover building that brought him into conflict with me when he was a us attorney he masks coldness as competence manipulation as management and megalomania as superachievement the simple fact that he still carries a grudge against an exassistant district attorney from houston tells me that he is a pygmy in his soul lutjens calls back as i pull into the drivethrough line at hardees hamburgers for some breakfast call me back from a land line he says two pay phones stand at the edge of the gas station lot next to hardees give me thirty seconds i pull out of the line of cars and use my credit card to call lutjens back he answers his line in a near whisper this is the only conversation were going to have on this matter dont use names okay youre not the only interested party a request for the same file came in fortyfive minutes before you called from your local das office an am made the request you know him austin mackey yes this case is political dynamite down here hes probably got the mayor pushing him trying to cover their asses is there any way you can no copy of the file no way no how anyway its fortyfour volumes fortyfour volumes how many pages in each two to three hundred jesus i wish i could get a look at that youre not alone in your disappointment am wont be seeing the file either why not its sealed sealed how there are several exceptions to the freedom of information act reasons we can refuse to release documents the most common ones exist to safeguard the lives of informants or to protect the privacy of citizens involved in investigations i know all that but am is a law enforcement official we can also refuse to release documents that pose a risk to national security under this exception we can refuse to release documents to anyone even other law enforcement agencies this is a thirtyyearold mississippi murder its got nothing to do with national security nevertheless the file was sealed on grounds of national security in may the order was signed personally by the director a faint buzzing has started in my head j edgar hoover the man himself the file cant be opened for nine more years not without a vote by congress theres no telling what youve stepped into hoover used the rubric of vietnam to conceal a multitude of sins during the sixties im so lost that i dont even know what questions to ask what about the names the agents im going to send a fax to your office a list of agents working out of the jackson mississippi field office in the summer of sixtyeight i dont know how complete it is but its the best i can do personal memoirs from the period might help you narrow it down i owe you bigtime for this yes you do listen the bureau has been very supportive of mississippi prosecutors this year providing files on these old civil rights cases even if the files embarrassed us a bit this file is obviously different id think long and hard about pursuing it i will watch your back buddy and with that he is gone i pull back onto the highway heading toward my parents house i suddenly have a lot to do today but i cant do it with a murder weapon in my car accelerating through the bypass traffic i punch in my office number and get cilia who tells me lutjenss fax is already coming through no cover page it looks like a list of some kind sixty or seventy names social security numbers too i say a silent thankyou to peter lutjens theres a handwritten note at the bottom it says if you telephone anyone on this list youve announced your interest to washington penn whats going on you dont want to know those names belong to fbi agents probably all retired find phone numbers for every one you can then start calling them give them the usual line youre working for me researching a novel i need to know which agents worked in natchez mississippi in the summer of particularly on the delano payton case okay delano payton no problem fax a copy of the list to my fathers medical office right and cil yes use a fake name on these calls i will ill my god a khou truck just pulled into the driveway got to be about the hanratty execution you can handle them you got that right ill call you she rings off as i punch end on the cell phone i see my hand shaking i am crossing a line i have crossed only a few times previously and always with a sense of euphoria mingled with dread in the great train of cases that crossed my desk as a prosecutor a few engaged not merely my mind or my talents or even my heart a few penetrated the deepest springs of my being my fears my prejudices and my desires when that happened i became more than a lawyer i became a personification of justice and not justice as the law defined it but as did that is how i feel now last night when ike ransom told me leo marston was involved in a thirtyyearold capital murder i wanted to believe it but some part of me refused i could see no possible connection between marston and his supposed victim but when peter lutjens said the words j edgar hoover and national security a circuit closed somewhere in my brain sparking the faintest glimmer of understanding leo marston is a political man from a political family and if the delano payton murder had a political angle sensitive enough for the file to be hidden from public view then a connection to leo marston no longer seems impossible twenty years ago that ruthless bastard wronged my father hurt my mother and stole my future he did not suffer one moment for doing that he lived as men of his kind always have exempt from justice untouchable but now far in the distance he has come into sight like a buck on a high ridge line and this time i have a weapon in my hands that weapon is a dead man del payton chapter the district attorneys office is in a threestory building near the courthouse and there are open parking spaces out front i take one then trot up the stairs beside the brass plaque with mackeys name on it there is no receptionist only a long hall with offices on both sides and a black custodian working in a broom closet at the far end i walk past partly open doors until i see mackey sitting behind a desk wearing one of those striped oxford shirts with a white collar that i always found a little too precious pushing open the door i see a heavyset woman sitting across from mackeys desk im sorry ill wait as i close the door i hear mackey say excuse me just a moment maam he steps into the hall looking put upon by the unannounced visit what do you want cage i came to see if you have any files on the del payton murder his fairskinned face goes red making him look like a pissedoff fraternity boy do you have wax in your ears i told you last night there was no file i also said id give you no assistance unless youre the attorney of record for a member of the payton family lets say i am he swallows brought up short are you or arent you i checked with the bar association this morning they told me youre licensed to practice in mississippi put it this way austin if you insist on being a pain in the ass im a lot more likely to be his lips disappear into a tight seam what about the file there is no file after the party last night i stopped by here and checked just to be sure all the records from through were destroyed in a fire when you and i were still in grade school this throws me my first instinct is to ask whether leo marston was still district attorney during that fire but i dont mackey isnt clarence darrow but if i appear too interested in marston hell zero in on my real motive quickly enough and marston will instantly hear about it what about the police department the chief wont show you files on an unsolved murder case is he actually investigating the case what do you think i think he may be investigating it before the week is out whether he wants to or not what about the sheriff mackey reaches backward and pulls his door completely shut why do you have a bug up your ass about this i dont remember you as a flaming liberal im not im a flaming humanist i happen to care that some poor son of a bitch was blown to pieces and his family never saw justice done a strange light comes into mackeys eyes ive got it now you dont give two shits about del payton or his family you want a bestseller out of this maybe get yourself on oprahs book club penn cage whitebread crusader for justice yeah thats it mackey draws himself to his full height positive that hes divined my true motive greed is something he can understand you may be willing to drag this town through the mud for a dollar ive got more loyalty than that dont come back here unless youve got new evidence in your hands he goes back into his office and softly closes the door as i turn toward the stairs i hear footsteps closing quickly on me from behind i whirl and find myself staring at the black custodian who was standing at the broom closet before hes over sixty with bluish skin and pink blemishes like freckles below his eyes and he reeks of cigarettes keep walking he says i move toward the staircase the custodian on my heels i heard you ask about del payton mackey tell you all them files burned up in a fire yes some did some didnt everything thats left is down in the basement five six boxes i stop on the landing is the basement locked yep he looks up and down the empty stairwell the doors out back if you was to check there in about five minutes you might find a key when you done leave it where you found it he shuffles down the stairs without another word i wait a few moments then walk out onto the street and stare across at the oakshaded courthouse sifting through old legal files could take some time i need to move my fathers car in case mackey comes out before im done when i stopped at my parents house to take care of the smith amp wesson i found that the glass in the bmw had been repaired i gave the maxima back to mom so that if anyone targeted the bmw again it would be me and not my mother and daughter who took the risk i also transferred the remaining into the trunk of the bmw meaning to get it back to my father before the end of the day climbing inside the car i pull around the corner call directory assistance for the number of the examiner and have them connect me caitlin masters please ms masters is in a meeting would you like me to transfer you to her voice mail tell her penn cage is on the phone sir please just do it thirty seconds later caitlin says youd better not be standing me up for lunch i do need to postpone somethings come up what could be more important than me actually i was going to suggest dinner tonight who says change is bad does eight oclock work for you yes thanks caitlin you can repay me with information i hang up laughing then lock the car and hurry into the inner square of the block it harbors parked cars dumpsters and fire escapes but thankfully no people at the rear of mackeys building eight concrete steps and a green handrail descend to a steel door theres no key in the lock i go down the steps and feel beneath the crack of the door nothing in the lee of the bottom step lies a broken rustcolored brick i bend and lift it the key is there the basement is lighted by bare hanging bulbs and it stinks of mildew i feel like im breathing fungus what i first perceived as walls are stacks of boxes hundreds of them old bellied cardboard things that look like they were stolen from a grocery store trash pile thankfully there are dates scrawled on them in black magic marker there seems to be no organizing concept files from the s have been stacked next to files from the s i scan the wall of dates as though searching for my size in a display of blue jeans no luck but after twenty minutes of digging through rat droppings and dust i find a short stack of boxes labeled fire dragging the stack into the nearest pool of light i open the top box and riffle through its contents the files inside are charred stained and mildewed and all date from i set that box aside and open the next one my pulse quickens the files inside are dated starting at the front of the box i examine the first page inside each folder marstons name is all over the files but none deals with delano payton when i get to the end of the box i go back to the beginning and flip through every sheet in every folder but again i find nothing one by one i go through each folder in the boxes dating from the fire with painstaking care but i find nothing related to del payton it looks like mackey was telling the truth after restacking the boxes i lock the door put the key back under the brick and climb back into the sunlight the custodian is standing thirty yards away smoking a cigarette in the shadow of a nearby building i walk straight up to him like a tourist asking for directions mackey was right he spits on the concrete shit you dont happen to clean the police station do you he shakes his head i guess thats it then i appreciate your help i start to leave but he reaches out and touches my elbow you know we had a couple of black police chiefs the first one was back in eightyone i knew him pretty good he didnt mind stepping on toes to get the job done so they fired him after a few months he might know something what was his name willie pinder does he still live in town he stay over to gaylor street blue house drives a old dodge pickup would he be home during the day i believe he tired you could see ill call him hey i never got your name thats right you watch your ass penn cage and tell your daddy zoot say hello he grinds his cigarette beneath the heel of a cheap work boot and walks back toward the das office as soon as i reach the car i dial directory assistance again theres a listing for a willie pinder on gaylor street this time i dial the number myself yeah says a coarse voice is willie there this willie i hang up gaylor street is in a black neighborhood off the road that leads up to the city cemetery it takes several trips through blocks of small brightly colored houses but i finally find the exchiefs dodge pickup parked on the street a cracked pad of cement leads to the rear of the house i drive around and park near pinders back porch its fully screened with rust eating the black wire in big orange patches who the hell are you shouts a hostile voice you just call me on the telephone i wave broadly at the dark screen for all i know im looking into the barrel of a shotgun im penn cage im looking for the former chief of police willie pinder who you work for chump the screen door opens with a screech of protesting springs and a big black head appears in the opening the sleepyeyed face says late fifties with some rough years on the back end car like that you aint no process server must be a lawyer you work for my exold lady no my names penn cage if youre willie pinder i want to ask you about the del payton murder at the words del payton the sleepy eyes wake up im willie he says looking closely at me you got my name right trouble thats your name will you talk to me sure pinder laughs i might be hearing your last words come on up he holds the door open for me three steps lead up to the porch the kind of weedgrown slat steps that snakes like to lie under in the heat in one bound i am up and through the door which slaps shut behind me with a bang like a pistol shot porch is far enough says pinder hotter inside anyway acs busted you want a beer sure i try not to glance at my watch it cant be eleven am yet pinder goes inside and returns with two sweating cans of schaeffer he hands me one then sits beside me in a green iron lawn chair pops the top off his can and drinks so youre retired now i say opening my beer he laughs again that dont quite seem to say it im fucked now how about that im not sure how to proceed i dont want the mans life story but neither do i want to offend him thankfully pinder spares me you the crazy man who popped off about del payton in the paper i mentioned the case case aint no case on del payton what about a file then there must have been a police file he takes another long swig of schaeffer i was pretty busy back then it was all i could do to hold the goddamn place together im sure still id think you might have wanted to check some things the white chiefs had let slide for too long pinder sniffs and looks through the rusted screen i worked in that department eleven years and i never saw no payton file didnt think there was one but when the old chief gave me the combination to the station safe and i opened it up there it was sitting on the bottom of a stack of insurance policies just like that first day on the job did the police seriously investigate the case in sixtyeight he smiles in the city slogan was natchez where the old south still lives it looked like they investigated there was lots of confidentialinformant reports rumors tracked down stuff like that any suspects a couple who he smiles enigmatically you know i might ought to check the file my memory aint what it used to be something quivers in my chest how can you check the file easy i got it inside jesus you made a copy nope i got the original took it when they screwed me out of my job i feel like hugging him may i see it i aint no loan library boy i think were talking about a rental situation here how much pinders face goes blank as he computes a price five hundred he says finally a note of challenge in his voice and you read it right here in front of me when i think of what i just paid ray presley for my fathers i feel like laughing a thousand i counter but i take the file with me ill photocopy it and get the original back to you within twentyfour hours pinder has lost a little of his studied calm how bout two thousand whats in the file how long is it about twentyfive pages plenty of names in there if thats what youre after any mention of judge marston in it he was da back then something ticks in the exchiefs face that motherfucker in there two thousand it is his head slides back on his neck his eyes full of suspicion i dont want no check now you get the file ill get the cash you got it here oh yeah get the file while pinder goes inside i go to the car and open the spare tire well count two thousand dollars from the remaining twentyfive and return to the porch shuffling and sliding sounds come from inside the house as though pinder is moving furniture then the door bangs open and he reappears with a worn manila folder in his hand i hand him the cash and he takes it but he doesnt pass me the file he sits down again and drinks from his beer can you aint asked me if i solved the case or not did you no he looks at me out of the corner of his eye but not because it aint solvable i kept that file close to my vest man didnt tell no white officers nothin bout it told a couple of black ones i trusted i was gonna be working the case real quiet one week later somebody sent me a message what kind of message they sent a man to talk to me a man i hated but wasnt about to ignore who was he ray presley i try to keep my composure but pinder cannot fail to notice the thunderous effect the name has on me i know presley i say carefully he was somehow involved in the original case thats right and that son of a bitchll kill a man like picking off a scab hes killed for less than what you just give me did he threaten you over the payton case not the way i expected if he had id have thrown him in a cell hed been to parchman by then and i was still riding my high horse he didnt say stay out of this or you might wind up dead no he said i hear youre thinking about looking into the del payton murder willie i worked that case myself in sixtyeight worked it hard and just about the time i thought we was getting somewhere somebody told me to leave it alone and i did i left it alone i was white and i wanted to solve that bombing but i let it go you ought to think about that what do you think he meant who was he talking about dont know pinders voice softens becomes vulnerable but anybody who could put fear into ray presley scared me plenty my kids was still living with me then and i wasnt about to watch them die for my pride or black pride or whatever you want to call it i couldnt even trust the brothers in my own department how far was i gonna get del payton was gonna be just as dead either way was it the klan you think the klan shit klan wouldnt scare ray presley those kluckers scared of him he did shit them crackers only talked about could it have been the fbi i ask recalling lutjenss story of the sealed file a funny gleam comes into pinders eyes why you ask that is it possible anythings possible the feds and the local cops didnt get on too good then not much better now really but why theyd warn presley off dont make no sense hoover hated martin luther king but del didnt have nothing to do with no bigtime peoples like that pinder stands suddenly and drops the file in my lap we finished here despite this strong hint to leave i open the file the first page is headed supplementary investigation report and dated beneath this is typed delano payton murder bombing then come four handwritten paragraphs that appear to detail an anonymous phone call the signature beneath them reads patrolman ray presley you can do your reading at home pinder says im goin fishin gonna spend the afternoon forgettin i ever saw you i stand and shake his hand i appreciate the help chief dont spend it all in one place he chuckles hey i got an old bulletproof vest i can sell you wanna take a look i dont plan to need it i push open the screen door and walk quickly down the steps ill drop the original back tomorrow keep it i dont want no part of that no more i never saw you i put one leg into the bmw hey if you really gave up on the case whyd you steal the file when you left pinder stands motionless in the open doorway get a little of my own back i guess i knew id be the last black chief for a long time he smiles oddly as though he has just seen something in a new light maybe that files been waiting here for you all this time mysterious ways right maybe the bastards wont get you after all i give pinder a salute hope theyre biting today chief he winks at me they biting every day if you know where to look chapter the payton house is a typical rural home built with cheap materials on concrete blocks but better maintained than most lovingly tended flower beds border the front concealing the dark crawl space beneath the structure the cars in the driveway are probably worth more than the house but at least the nearest neighbor is fifty yards up the road georgia payton sits beneath a large pin oak rocking slowly in a white cotton dress she lifts a hand as i pull into the driveway but she does not get up i walk over to say hello before going to the front door hot one isnt it she cackles at me i lived threequarters of my life without no air conditioning the lords breeze be good enough for me mr cage althea payton is beckoning to me from the door she wears navy shorts and a red blouse tied at the waist she looks like shes been gardening come in out of that heat she calls georgias fine out there i smile at the old woman then cross the drive and follow althea into the house georgias like an old loggerhead turtle sunning itself on a rock she says i asked her to stay outside while we talk she can be a little hard to handle have a seat i sit on a flameprint love seat and althea takes a clothcovered easy chair to my right the living room holds old but clean furniture all of it arranged around a new television set dozens of framed family photos hang on the wall behind the tv i look away when i realize im staring at a wedding photo of del and althea they look young and happy destined for anything but what happened to them in the spring of on the phone she says hesitantly you said it was about my husband yes maam my next words are an irrevocable step ive decided to look into dels death after all ive already taken some steps in that direction she seems not to have understood then her eyes well up and her voice spills out in a reverent tone sweet lord jesus i cant believe it i dont want us to get ahead of ourselves there may not be anything to find out she nods her hands clasped over her chest i realize that i just its been so many years do you have any idea what you need to charge me yes im going to need a retainer of one dollar and ill bill you for my time at the rate of one dollar per day she shakes her head in confusion you cant be serious im deadly serious althea dont give it another thought she wipes tears from her eyes and i look away the wall to her left holds the sacred trinity of photographs ive seen in the homes of many black families martin luther king jfk and abraham lincoln sometimes you see bobby or fdr but the paytons have only the big three a plastic clock hangs above the photographs its face painted with a rather bloated likeness of dr king the words i have a dream appear in quotes beneath him georgia bought that clock from some traveling salesman in may of althea says it stopped running before that christmas but she never let me get rid of it maybe its a collectors item i dont care those clocks probably put a million dollars in some sharpies pocket she grips her knees with her palms and fixes her eyes on me could i ask you one thing why did i change my mind yes i have a personal stake in the case now i want to be honest with you about that are you going to write a book about del is that it no but if anybody asks you what i was doing here thats what you tell them and i mean anybody police included okay whatever you say but what is your personal interest if not a book id prefer to keep that to myself althea she looks puzzled then relieved im glad youve got a stake in it you having a child like you do it would be too hard if i thought you were taking this risk only for me im not rest assured of that thank you she leans back in her chair and looks at me with apprehension what can you tell me have you learned anything yet we wont be getting any help from the district attorney the police either if my guess is right ive managed to obtain some documentary information dating back to that could be helpful but thats between us and god can you tell me what it is no i wont expose you to potential criminal charges she nods soberly just tell me this do you think theres any hope of finding out the truth i mean i fight the urge to be optimistic a lawyer has to make that mistake only once to learn what it costs you give people hope then the pendulum swings the wrong way and theyre left shattered as much by false hope as by misfortune i wouldnt take the case if there wasnt hope but i want to proceed cautiously i promise to contact you if and when i learn anything of value i understand that youve waited a long time for justice altheas hands are clenched in her lap the knuckles white if you feel up to it id like you to tell me what you can about what del was doing at the battery plant before he died for civil rights i mean she takes a deep breath and closes her eyes as though striving to remember with perfect accuracy del wasnt any big civil rights worker he was a workingman he just saw things he thought were wrong and did what he could to change them when he was a young man he was carefree you never saw a smile so full and happy when he went to korea something changed in him he still had that smile but it didnt fill up his eyes the way it used to he was different inside he got shot over there and i think he saw some pretty bad things when he got back he told me life was too short to spend it standing at the back of the line when did he go to work at triton battery a couple of years after the war he put in his time and saved his money back then said he didnt want to marry me till he could afford to take care of me like i deserved altheas voice cracks a little but she smiles i sure got tired of waiting del bought this house in for cash money not many black men could do that back then you got married in fiftynine she nods it was right around then that del met medgar medgar evers yes medgar heard how good del was doing at the plant and wanted to meet him medgar was building up the naacp back then pushing voter registration del loved medgar loved his quiet way said hed known men like medgar in the army quiet men who worked hard and wouldnt back down for anything medgar took to del too he saw that del didnt hate the white man del believed if we could help white people see inside us see past the color their hearts would change so medgar got del into civil rights work lord yes medgar ate right in this house whenever he came through town althea shakes her head sadly when beckwith killed medgar in june of sixtythree del changed again he said the war had come home to america then president kennedy was shot that november del had joined the naacp by then of course and by he was in charge of voter registration for this area del was the highestranking black man at the battery plant even the white men liked him they knew he knew his job who do you think planted that bomb althea well the klan i guess there were a lot of beatings out at the paper mill around then klan workers beating black workers you know scaring them off there was some klan at the tire plant and at the battery plant too a car bomb is quite an escalation from a beating did del have any personal enemies you know of del didnt have an enemy in this world he had at least one i say silently but its certainly possible that payton was chosen at random to send a warning to someone did he seem any more worried than usual about going to work near the time of his death she shakes her head we had some death threats but we got those with every promotion del had he just kept on keeping on hed say thea we cant let em get us down i remember the nightmarish weeks of the hanratty trial when death threats arrived almost daily what courage it must have taken for del payton to get up every morning of his life and go to work with men he knew wanted him dead he was depressed althea adds over dr kings death martin was assassinated just five weeks before del was killed and del was so saddened by that because already he saw the movement being taken over by advocates of violence men with bitterness in their hearts stokely carmichael and the rest black racists he called them the more i learn about del payton the more i feel that his murder was a terrible loss to the community in which i grew up does anything else stand out no the fbi asked me all this back when it happened and i told them the same thing one day del went to work and just didnt come home i looked helplessly around the room del payton has been dead for thirty years but he is as alive here as a dead man can be when annie is a grown woman will this large a piece of my heart still be reserved for sarah do you remember the names of any of the fbi agents who talked to you i remember one very well agent stone he was about dels age and hed served in korea too agent stone really tried to help me but he was the only one he had a younger man with him who never said much he didnt care nothing about us like all the rest do you remember his name no just a stuckup yankee agent stone came by the house before he left town the last time he apologized for not having gotten justice for del he was a good man and i got the feeling he knew there was some dirty work at the crossroads on dels case did he say anything specific no he just seemed like he wanted to say more than he could do you know a deputy named ike ransom some people used to call him ike the spike a strange stillness comes over althea they still call him that ike was a good boy who turned out bad he got on that dope over in vietnam and drank all the years after that he hurt a lot of black people to impress his bosses why you asking about ike ransom its not important i stand i think thats enough questions for now althea studies me for a few moments then stands and presses her shorts flat against her thighs come out to the garden and let me get you some tomatoes oh no but thank you nonsense your daddy loves my tomatoes i been paying him in tomatoes for years i follow her to the kitchen where she picks up a piggly wiggly sack and goes out the back door the backyard is bordered by woods and most of the yard is taken up by a vegetable garden laid out with architectural precision the vines along the ground are bursting with squash and rattlesnake watermelons and the tomato plants stand four feet tall toward the back rows i see butter beans corn collards and pole beans the only eyesore is a rusted weedgrown husk of a car sitting up on blocks on the near side of the garden althea pulls a red bandanna from her back pocket ties it around her head and walks between two rows of tomato plants i check the junker for obvious wasp nests then climb onto its trunk and watch althea pick prize specimens for her sack this is some garden i call after her daddy always had a garden drove mama crazy we had mason jars stacked to the ceiling at canning time the low rumble of a truck passing on the road breaks the stillness then fades i wish annie were here to see the garden i dont know why i keep that old wreck althea says from among the plants it makes me sad more than anything but sometimes it reminds me of the times me and del went riding out by the river when we were young wed roll down the windows and cruise up the levee road listening to nat cole del would have his arm around me and it was like nobody could touch us we could do anything we wanted you know go anywhere it was just a dream but it was a good one i feel a strange heat at the back of my neck for the first time i really look at the car i am sitting on its a ford fairlane a white sedan maybe a i slide off it slowly is this i thought you recognized it when you first saw it althea says stepping out of the rows from the newspaper picture i guess its the rust i say distractedly the fairlanes hood is lying crossways over the engine compartment i put my hands under the hot metal and flip the hood off the car several dessicated wasp nests cling to the fender wells but its not the wasp nests that send a chill through me the fords engine is a mass of mangled metal the bomb that killed del payton was set between the engine block and the firewall the explosion blew the motor forward breaking the mounts tore the transmission away from the bell housing and cut a fissure through the lower part of the firewall i cant believe payton survived two seconds after that blast even the engine block shows signs of shearing and the whole compartment is littered with tiny metal fragments the exhaust manifold was sliced in two like a length of salami this image tickles something at the back of my mind it sat rusting behind the jail for a year althea says i thought they were keeping it in case they got a clue about the bombing but theyd just forgot about it so i had my father tow it out here nothing but a home for birds and wasps now as i bend over the wrecked engine something else strikes me this car burned i knew that of course from caitlins article and also from the picture but it never really registered rust has eaten away the charring on the exterior of the car but the passenger compartment is a nightmare of blackened metal and melted plastic this too has hidden significance what do you see althea asks im not sure alarms are ringing now i dont know the significance of what i am seeing but i know with utter certainty that it is significant and i know a man who can tell me why while researching my third novel i spent two days with a batf explosives expert named huey moak huey showed me a lot of photographs and even more pieces of stretched and twisted metal what im seeing now i saw in some of those photos do you mind if i borrow a piece of this engine take the whole car if it will help reaching down into the mass of metal debris i pull out a flat piece about two inches square sheared off as cleanly as if it had been cut by a blowtorch i slip this into my pocket then rake a handful of tiny shrapnel off the top of a smashed and corroded triton battery like his coworkers del payton got his batteries at a sixty percent discount from the company may i borrow your bandanna althea unties the red cloth from her head and hands it to me i lay it on the roof of the fairlane set the shrapnel in it and tie the cloth into a tight sack thanks id better get going youve seen something she says youre excited i can tell yes but i dont know what it means ill let you know as soon as i do she looks into my eyes then nods all right ill walk you to your car as we round the house a battered pickup pulls into the drive three black kids stand in back looking over the roof of the cab two girls and a boy the truck wheezes to a stop and a black man a few years younger than i gets out wearing a greasestained jumpsuit as he approaches i see a white patch on his breast pocket the word del is stenciled on it in red over his shoulder georgia payton continues her purposeful rocking penn says althea this is my son del junior del this is mr penn cage i offer my hand but the man makes no move to shake it you shake this mans hand althea snaps in a voice crackling with maternal authority this the man whos going to find out who killed your daddy del jr grudgingly holds out his hand and i shake it youd have to cut a quarter inch into his palm to draw blood take the kids inside althea tells him del jr jerks his head toward the house and the children walk backward to the front door staring at me as they go del looks at my fathers bmw and its painfully easy to read his face the money that car cost would keep his family fed and sheltered for five years he turns and follows his kids into the house hes got a lot of bitterness in his heart althea says hes got reason to i sure thank you for the tomatoes any time penn i get into the car and lay the bandanna on top of the police file then wave at georgia payton as i drive away she doesnt respond as i clear the first turn the significance of what i saw in del paytons charred fairlane bursts into my conscious mind with the brilliance of a flare i pull onto the shoulder park and with shaking hands pick up the file i bought from willie pinder caitlins article said dels car was destroyed by dynamite that fit with the story id heard all my life but if i remember huey moaks drawled lectures correctly much of what i saw five minutes ago contradicts that version of events for one thing dynamited cars almost never burn paytons did but its the shearing thats important whatever exploded in that fairlane attacked both engine and firewall with tremendous cutting force like an acetylene torch completing its job in a fraction of a second it left shrapnel no bigger than thumbtacks and it created a flash hot enough to set fire to a car constructed with only a fraction of the plastic used in modern vehicles i can still hear hueys voice in my mind those are characteristics of a uniquely stable versatile and powerful explosive that the army calls c the russians call it semtex the french plastique civilians call it good old plastic explosive fifteen pages into the payton file i find the crimescene report near the middle of the page a handwritten sentence reads bomb constructed of unknown material in black ink but a blue line has been drawn through the words unknown material and the words commercialgrade dynamite written above them at the bottom of the page a note in blue reads one day following the initial scene investigation patrolman ray presley discovered fragments of civilian blasting caps and wire fragments in the wooded area one hundred feet from the vehicle subsequent lab analysis showed traces of nitroglycerine nitroglycerine is one of the main ingredients in dynamite beneath that final note are two signatures detective first grade henry creel and detective ronnie temple one day after a bomb destroyed del paytons fairlane ray presley discovered proof that the bomb was made of dynamite thirty years later i glance into the same car and find evidence that seems to indicate something quite different i could be wrong of course i know of no reason why presley should lie about the type of bomb that destroyed del paytons car and speculation is pointless until i know that he did but thats the beauty of physical evidence ill get my answer all i have to do is get that sheared fragment and sack of shrapnel to huey moak then convince the batf agent that its in his interest to help me and the surest way to do that is to let him know that a quick analysis could put a great deal of egg on the face of the fbi though i cant see how i am strangely certain that ive taken one step closer to leo marston chapter daddy look at the crawdads theyve got humongous claws annie races across the patio and leaps into my arms like a thirtypound bullet though petite for her age she is wiry and strong like her mother youd better not let one get your nose i warn her itll thunder seven times before he turns loose your daddys lying to you girl ruby calls from beside the pool thats a snapping turtle he talking bout crawfish cant hurt you none one already pinched my finger annie cries it didnt even hurt dad is tending a fivegallon boiler near the house and the roar of burning propane makes my stomach rumble a pavlovian response that remains automatic even after twenty years away a cooler full of live crawfish sits beside the boiling water sam jacobs brought these by he explains he went over to catahoula parish to look at a stripper well and brought them back theyre goodsized pretty too did you ask him to stay he said he had to get home but that you should call him one night and go get a beer i could use one now theres a sixpack of corona in the fridge limes too bring me a heineken while youre at it on the way i walk over and hug ruby then go inside my mothers in the kitchen washing corn and potatoes for the crawfish pot she asks how my day went and i say something inane about how little the town has changed during the past hour i photocopied the del payton police file rented a safe deposit box and stored the original inside bought packaging material at freds dollar store and delivered the fragments of dels engine to the ups office five minutes before they closed i also spoke to huey moak whom cilia tracked down in lexington kentucky where he is investigating an explosion at the university huey could not conceal his pleasure at the prospect of solving a bombing case the fbi had bungled even if it was thirty years old the engine fragments will arrive before noon tomorrow at the holiday inn where he and his batf team are staying all that activity left me only one task to complete the felony i started this morning i carry a heineken out to my father and sit in a lawn chair at the edge of the pool annie has taken two crawfish from the cooler and is trying to make them race across the patio she quickly learns that the only direction crawfish will move under duress is backward i sip the corona and watch the crustacean derby while dad purges the mudbugs in the cooler by dumping salt water over them mom brings out a huge bowl of new potatoes corn and onions which she dumps into the steaming pot along with three bags of zatarains crab boil the sharp aroma of spices fills the air making my mouth water and annie stares with saucer eyes as dad loads the wiremesh inner boiler with brown crawfish and submerges them in the boiling water when he hauls them out twenty minutes later they are a flaming redorange wow annie marvels time to eat em dad says mom covers the wroughtiron patio table with newspaper and dad dumps the steaming crawfish onto the center making a small mountain i spear some potatoes and corn with a fork and make a plate for annie assuming she likes the look of crawfish better than shell like the taste but im wrong she isnt strong enough to crack the tails efficiently but with dad peeling for her she goes through a half pound of a pound of tails before shes done as i watch her joyful eyes the payton case recedes in my mind i should have brought annie here right after the funeral my mothers matteroffact attitude toward the mysteries of life has already brought her out of her melancholia when annie announces that her tummy is full mom leads her over to the faucet to wash the hot spices from her hands annie wants ice cream mom calls from the faucet anybody else yall go ahead dad shouts back well clean up this mess and be inside in a minute he slides a cigar from his pocket and puts it in his mouth but doesnt begin the ritual of lighting it you want another beer id better skip it we need to take a ride he raises an eyebrow we do i raise my hand and make a mock pistol with my thumb and forefinger then drop my thumb like a hammer i see lets clean this mess up for your mother first as he begins wrapping the crawfish shells in newspaper i carry the heavy boiler to the edge of the yard to dump the water the gun is only twenty feet away from me in the pool house preparing for its final journey i am standing in the stern of a rusty green johnboat poling it across a cypress swamp south of town the sky is aflame with orange and purple light the dying sun turning the hanging moss into long black beards on the cypress limbs the johnboat belongs to a pumper who monitors an oil well that stays underwater for much of the year the well has been pumping for over twenty years and the johnboat has been sitting in a thicket nearby for most of that time sam jacobs pointed it out to me one summer during college dad sits forward facing me smoking his cigar and keeping watch on the receding shoreline between us stands a fivegallon plastic paint bucket filled with rockhard cement embedded somewhere inside it is the smith amp wesson i bought from ray presley this morning dad flips some ash into the water and speaks in a casual voice a patient told me she saw my car over at willie pinders house today she asked if the exchief was having heart trouble again god can take a rest from watching sparrows fall in natchez i reply nothing gets by anybody here he laughs mirthlessly and a rather strange fax arrived at my office this morning a list of names with a note at the bottom saying something about washington i forgot all about the fax im sorry about that where is it now he takes a folded piece of fax paper from his pocket whats it about this list those are fbi agents who worked out of the jackson field office in did you see the name stone on it he unfolds the paper and scans it then shakes his head no stone whered you get that name althea payton remembered a sympathetic fbi man and the visit to willie pinder pinder had the original police file on the payton murder he stole it when he lost his job as chief i bought it from him my father looks out over the dark water already the ranks of cypress trunks screen us from anyone on shore i know what i said yesterday about how justice needs to be done god knows black people have had a shitty deal for a long time i saw things growing up in louisiana that id never want to say out loud i understand why your blood is up you and althea payton have experienced one of the worst tragedies there is losing a spouse i mean but i dont think you fully appreciate the danger of what youre doing i think i do everybody i talk to tells me to watch my back thats not what im talking about im going to be candid son youre not my main concern here if a man wants to risk his life for something noble thats his lookout but annies life is something else the undercurrent of fear in his voice gives me pause do you really think whoever killed payton would hurt annie or mom anybody wholl hide in the shadows and bomb a man is capable of anything theyre scum dogs and they have the dogs pack mentality he gives me the cold eye youve already been shot at you put these people at risk for the death house at parchman theyll come for you the way theyre surest to get you and thats through your family who is this they youre talking about do you have any idea my father sighs and looks at the bottom of the boat then picks up a red and white plastic fishing bob and starts working the line mechanism with his thumb natchez is a good town ive practiced here thirtyfive years and i know but towns are like people even the best of us has dark places in his soul fears prejudices appetites the capacity for sin i suppose whoevers behind this payton business is an expression of that it could be some whitetrash asshole or our nextdoor neighbor the point is youll never see them coming dad if youll listen to me for one minute i think youll understand why i have to do this nothing to do out here but listen do you know a deputy named ike ransom sure ike the spike i treated his mother for years he followed me home last night after the party he wants paytons killer punished and he knows who it is why doesnt he do something about it then he was a cop for twenty years hes scared dad shakes his head wearily over the years at least three men i know of have claimed they killed delano payton drunk rednecks like to take credit for that kind of thing ransom probably overheard something like that and believed it who does he say did it leo marston dads mouth drops open leo marston thats crazy marstons a lot of things but hes no racist thats what i thought too but how do you know hes not well ive seen pictures of him with bobby kennedy for one thing with charles and medgar evers too i think i even saw a shot of him with martin luther king how do you know that wasnt just public relations in the sixties a white man posing with the evers boys and king dad shakes his head again is livy marston a racist no but that doesnt prove anything sure it does apples dont fall far from the tree he draws thoughtfully on his cigar ike ransoms a bad alcoholic son has been for years i think hes playing you he knows marston hurt our family so that makes marston the best way to suck you into the payton case he figures once youre into it youll go for the throat of whoever turns out to be guilty thats what the blacks in this town want and i dont blame them i dont think blacks want that at all shad johnson sure doesnt they want that new chemical plant in here as much as anybody i cant believe youre defending marston he slaps himself like a madman as a horsefly the size of a small fighter plane attacks him refusing to give quarter fearing that this battle will overturn the boat i scramble forward and smash the insect against his shoulder thanks he mutters im not defending that bastard but leo marston destroys people he doesnt murder them youre thinking in a business context what if it was personal maybe payton and marston had business dealings of some kind or maybe payton was in a position to know something about marstons personal affairs he dismisses this with a flip of his hand no way no how different universes ikes anger felt personal to me he hates marston thats a big club look for all we know marston sent ike ransoms brother to jail he could have any kind of grudge against marston and we wouldnt know it but if marstons not involved in the payton case how would putting me on it hurt marston you see you cant have it both ways he groans in exasperation youre looking for logic i continue but marston went after you for malpractice in and we never learned why motives arent always obvious now hes listening leo marston was da when payton was killed i think thats how hes tied into it when willie pinder became police chief he started looking into paytons murder very quietly using only black officers but before he got far somebody warned him off the case who ray presley dad tosses his cigar into the water where it hisses and sputters out why am i not surprised ray told willie that hed tried to solve the case in sixtyeight but that hed been warned off too he wouldnt say by whom but it was enough to scare him off that would take some doing thats what willie said he dropped it didnt presley do a lot of work for marston in the seventies i believe he did think about it weve got ray presley a blatant racist investigating a politically sensitive race murder while leo marston is da i dont think its outside the realm of possibility that marston could have committed criminal acts under those circumstances but why thats what i cant see i dont know wouldnt the statute of limitations have run out on anything short of murder thats right anything short of murder he looks like a sculpture in the bow of the boat frozen in contemplation were two hundred yards from shore now far enough that even a severe drought would be unlikely to uncover the swamp bottom even if it did there would only be the cementfilled pail lying in the baking mud among the dead fish and loggerhead turtles a lost anchor nothing else i lift the long pole out of the water and lay it along the gunwale of the boat dad starts to get up but i motion for him to stay seated the last thing we need is to capsize in water teeming with water moccasins and perhaps even alligators i drag the heavy bucket toward the stern and lift it onto my seat then sit beside it flex my arms and roll it over between my legs after a deep breath i slip my hands under it and stand up using my legs for power in seconds my arms are quivering from the weight throw it dad cries i heave the bucket to my left and into the black water heeling the boat hard to starboard and almost losing my balance the splash sounds like a cannonball and showers both of us with slimy water god almighty dad exults i thought we were going over that gun is history i say quietly lets go to the house i pick up the pole plunge it to the muddy bottom and work the bow back around until it points to the dirt road where we parked dads pickup high above us a hawk circles over unseen prey as it sails through the falling dusk dad says could it have been the feds who warned ray off the payton case despite the heat i feel a shiver deep in my chest willie pinders remarks are playing in my head what makes you ask that i remember a picture from somewhere it showed marston and j edgar hoover together both of them glaring into the camera like junior gmen marston always claimed to be a personal friend of hoovers thats not fashionable now of course but thirty years ago it was quite a coup i had thought i might be able to keep my father on the periphery of this case but thats simply not practical the fact is i need his help dad the guy who sent me that list of fbi agents is bureau himself he told me a couple of disturbing things like this morning austin mackey requested the fbi file on del payton and he was turned down the payton file was sealed by j edgar hoover in on grounds of national security his eyes narrow in disbelief what now you tell me marston was a personal friend of hoovers ive already determined that presley probably lied about the bomb that blew up paytons car the fbi had to know that i dont know how it all adds up but as district attorney marston had to be right in the middle of all this he looks toward the shore as though trying to spot his truck against the darkness of the trees when he answers his voice is so soft it seems to drift out of the lap of water against the bow leo marston put our family through hell for a year and a half the stress damn near killed me and it changed your mother forever i say nothing wondering if hes talking to me or himself the things hes done to other people compromised them bullied them you dont know half of what hes done im not a vindictive man but to make that bastard pay for some of that god that would be justice he is taking himself where i wanted to take him all along wed have to find a way to protect annie and peggy he says around the clock we can do that he looks back at me youre not in houston anymore you have no authority here you cant investigate secretly half the town already knows what youre doing the more people who know the safer well be marston can apply pressure from angles you never dreamed of but physical safety is the first priority i know a couple of good men cops patients of mine do you really think you can trust them cops i mean ray presley was a cop dad chuckles softly in the shadows theyre both black what do you think chapter caitlin masters has the corner booth in biscuits amp blues she smiles and waves when she sees me walking through the tables i speak to a couple of people i know but theres no applause tonight the restaurant is packed with diners absorbed in their own affairs im sorry caitlin says pointing at a shrimp cocktail before her i was starved i couldnt wait have one no thanks i reply sitting down opposite her shes wearing a white buttondown oxford shirt and emerald drop earrings that bring out the color in her eyes each time i see her im shocked by the way those green eyes are almost wrong for her face the fine black hair and porcelain skin seem to call for something else yet the final result is a remarkable beauty the young waitress who asked me to sign false witness the other day hurries over and asks if she can get me something to drink jenny right she blushes and nods what happened to my waiter caitlin asks i switched tables with him ill take much better care of you guys caitlin gives her a sidelong glance ill bet you will jenny id love a corona with a lime on the way she disappears like a darkcomplected elf jenny has the hots for you a little starstruck maybe shes probably got a novel in progress upstairs i dont think thats it she watches you in a strange way caitlin drinks from a sweating martini glass trust me i have lethal instincts youre not drinking gimlets tonight theyre out of roses lime so howd you spend this lovely day ill tell you later first you owe me an explanation she gives me a wry look why did i make such a big thing of del payton yes its simple really my father the one you grew up without thats him when he took over the chain from his father it was five dailies all in virginia in twelve years he built that into thirtyfour papers across the southeast im impressed she raises a cynical eyebrow do you know how he did that he went into small cities that had only one or two newspapers if there were two hed buy the dominant one then institute john masterss commandments the cardinal one being dont piss off the advertisers he printed every detail of little league games weddings society parties high school graduationseverything but controversy it didnt make for very informative newspapers but it kicked profits into the stratosphere is it a public company now caitlin makes a fist and thrusts it toward the ceiling with mock fervor never familyowned down the line starting to get the picture you want to shake up daddys world yes but not for some freudian reason hard news is going unreported in every town where we have a newspaper im instituting a new policy at one paper anyway she takes another swallow of her martini and her eyes flash with conviction from now on hard news leads the payton murder wasnt news until you made it news so sue me my gut tells me its a big story and im going with it good for you it is a big story she freezes with a shrimp in midair i take my corona from jenny the waitress before she can set it down how would you like an exclusive on the solution is that a trick question theres one condition you print absolutely nothing until i give you the okay you know who killed him maybe but even if i do proving it could be difficult she pops the shrimp into her mouth and chews for a few moments i dont get it if you dont want me to print anything why bring me in at all because i need your help for what research that i dont have the time or resources to do what do you need to know you havent agreed to my condition yet she mulls it over some more why should i muzzle my paper to help you how do i know youll solve the case any faster than i could do you have a copy of the original police file no but im working on a request for his fbi file under the freedom of information act dont bother you wont get it j edgar hoover sealed the payton file in for reasons of national security she shakes her head in disbelief i smelled a pulitzer the minute you told me about this case okay deal tell me what you want ill get it fast but i want in on everything fair enough i say wondering if i mean it a half hour ago cilia called from houston after spending hours tracing the names on peter lutjenss list and finding most retired or dead she lucked into a fan of mine he hadnt worked the payton murder but he remembered it more important he numbered special agent dwight stone the field agent althea payton recalled so fondly among his old friends stone is retired and living outside crested butte colorado cilia called him and found him friendly enough until she mentioned del payton at which time stone bluntly stated that he would not discuss the payton case with me or anyone i intend to test his resolution very soon so what do you want to know caitlin asks i need everything you can get on leo marston you know who he is sure a bigtime attorney everybody calls judge because he served on the state supreme court i tried to get a comment from him for my payton story but i couldnt get through his secretarys a castiron bitch you should meet his wife the woman who baptized you at the cocktail party thats her no thanks why marston you dont need to know that yet she doesnt like this response who else id like a detailed bio of ray presley but caitlin cant access the kind of information i need on him just start with marston companies he owns whole or in part personal and political connections his tax returns if you can get them jenny reappears at our table her dark eyes watching me with a disconcerting intensity have you decided im not really hungry i confess handing her my unopened menu i had to eat before i came my daughter helped cook how old is she four thats a fun age are they working on my ribs back there caitlin asks theyll be out in a minute jenny gives her a curt smile and heads back to her station you owe me an answer too remember says caitlin youre the most liberal person ive met here as far as race goes youre a fascist on the death penalty of course but well skip that for now how did you wind up so different from other people here its simple really my father she puts her last shrimp in her mouth and chews slowly her green eyes luminescent in the soft light lets hear it this never sees print its no big deal but its personal thats something we need to get straight right now if were going to work together some things never see print no problem its in the vault i remember three defining moments with my father when i was growing up the first had to do with race most kids i grew up around used the word nigger the same way they used apple or chevrolet so did their parents and grandparents before them one night at home i used it the same way my father got out of his chair turned off the television and came and sat beside me he said son i grew up working in a creosote plant right alongside colored people and theyre just like you and me no better no worse we dont say that word in this house then he turned the tv back on and i stopped saying nigger a couple of years later the thing to be was a hippie and i tried my best grew my hair down my back smoked grass the whole bit i heard hippies on tv saying the pigs this the pigs that the cops you know so one day riding in the car i said something about the pigs my father pulled onto the shoulder turned around and said son if we had to go three days in this country without police it wouldnt be a place youd want to live we dont use that word and i never used it again caitlins eyes shine with fascination and the third moment i was fifteen and id been sleeping with this older girl from the public school who went off to junior college i stole the family car a couple of times to go see her in the kitchen one night my mother told me i couldnt do that anymore in my hormoneintoxicated state i said mom why are you being such a bitch about this oh my god my dad clocked me this man of reason who had never lifted a finger to me slapped me an openhanded blow that damn near blacked me out i was spiritually stunned but it was the right blow at the right moment the only one i ever needed it drew the line for me caitlin nods slowly a smile on her lips thank you for telling me that youre lucky to have a father like that i wonder what shed say if she knew that an hour ago my wonderful father and i sank a murder weapon in a swamp her barbecued ribs finally arrive and we run through a half dozen other subjects while she eats journalism my law career publishing she grew up with money but worked hard to make her own mark she did internships with the new york times and the washington post traveled extensively overseas and worked a year for the los angeles times when she asks obliquely about the hanratty execution i change the subject where do you live i dont picture you in an apartment she smiles and wipes her mouth with a napkin knowing im evading her question i pretty much live at the paper but i did buy a house on washington street roughing it huh washington street is old natchez most of the town houses there sell for over three hundred thousand dollars i need my space she says frankly you should come see it it was completely restored just before i bought it a wave of warmth passes over my face is she hinting that i should go to her house after dinner ive been out of circulation for years and shes only twentyeight in the realm of dating she is the expert not me do you need to get home she asks ill bet annies waiting up for you that is what shes suggesting i look at my watch to conceal the fact that im blushing annies falling asleep about now im okay for a bit well would you like to see it we could have some tea and talk or we could just take a ride you could show me the real natchez in the dark but the automatic rejections ive practiced since sarahs death dont come to me a ride might be fun my answer surprises her more than that it makes her happy with a smile of anticipation she signals jenny over asks for two gocups and passes her a company credit card jenny meets us at the front door with the ticket and while caitlin signs it i say hello to a couple of people at the bar its strange to be back in a place where i know someone every place i go stepping from the airconditioned restaurant to the street is like putting on a mildewed coat in the jungle october in mississippi in crested butte theyre skiing right now we could take my miata caitlin says but i dont advise it i thought a convertible would be perfect for the south but its too damn hot down here to use it my cars right down there i lead her across the street then turn right on the sidewalk heading toward the small parking lot where i left dads bmw a country dance bar is going strong on this side and knots of people line the sidewalk for the length of the block the club draws mainly from the louisiana farmland across the river hardshell baptist country that birthed jimmy swaggart and jerry lee lewis caitlin and i weave carefully through boots and hats and clouds of cigarette smoke as we near the parking lot i see four men who look a little rougher than the rest passing around a bottle of jack daniels theyre wearing oilstained denim and caps instead of hats roughnecks who drove straight from the oil field to the bar most likely lean hardmuscled burned brick red by the sun they wear thin mustaches and suck dips of snuff while they drink as caitlin and i approach one points at me you oughta keep your goddamn mouth shut about the niggers in this town cage the use of my name surprises me but i have no intention of stopping to discuss the issue feeling caitlin slow down i squeeze her arm and keep walking youre fucking up the chemical plant deal says another now that were closer i recognize the man who spoke first his name is spurling a year older than i he attended the white citizens council school on the north side of town spurling has the sullen expression of a man for whom life holds few happy surprises he will fight me on the slightest provocation and probably on none these guys have never gotten past the emotional age of fifteen they brawl over disputed calls at little league games beat up homosexuals for fun and shoot each other over marital infidelities keep walking i whisper to caitlin and we pass them with only a brush on the shoulder im talking to you cocksucker spurling calls after me that was the newspaper chick says a slurred voice that stuckup yankee bitch caitlin stops and turns why dont you dickless neanderthals find a gun to play with maybe youll do the world a favor and shoot each other they hoot and run after us this is exactly what they wanted i admire caitlins courage but she is writing verbal checks that i might have to cash with blood in seconds the four of them have formed a line between us and the parking lot shes a bitch says the one with the slurry voice but shes a fine bitch he jabs a finger toward caitlins crotch id sure like to get in those pants i already have one asshole in my pants she retorts in a voice like a sabers edge why would i want another the roughneck blinks thrown off balance by the ricochet comeback but spurling has his academy awardwinning line ready how about sitting on my face when you say that if i thought youd know what to do once i sat down i might spurling sticks out his tongue and flicks it up and down like a snake hes trying to force me to throw a punch which i do not especially want to do considering the odds chivalry is a wonderful concept but just now it doesnt seem the most prudent of options spurling is still wiggling his tongue when caitlin pops him across the mouth with a closed fist hes more surprised than hurt but he must have bitten his tongue because hes spitting blood on the concrete you thucking cunt he gurgles lets all take it easy i say holding up my hands we were minding our business walking along a public street nobody wants you on this fucking street yells the one with the jack daniels bottle go back to beverly hills or wherever the fuck you live we gotta make a living here unlike you a few club patrons have noticed our exchange and are moving toward us but they dont look like ready sources of aid i take caitlins arm spin her around and walk her toward the bmw she hisses something indignant but im not listening to her im listening for the scuff of boots on gravel soon enough i hear it i shove her to my right and dart left feeling a breeze as the whiskey bottle arcs through the space my head occupied a split second ago and smashes on the gravel of the parking lot guessing that someone will follow the bottle forward i whirl and throw a blind punch luck is always better than skill i hear bone crack or maybe nasal cartilage then a strangled scream of agony as someone hits the gravel throwing the car keys at caitlin i yell the black bmw then whirl to face the other three who jump me simultaneously were wrestling more than fighting but once they get me on the ground theyll remove my teeth two at a time she bit me someone screams she bit my fucking ear off i would probably laugh had not serious blows begun landing on my skull my thoughts instantly evaporate into survival instinct as i cover my head and try to keep my feet a wallop to my right temple obliterates my sense of balance and i drop to my knees glimpsing the silver toe cap of a boot just before it savages my ribs another head blow puts me on my back and the fists come down in a steady hail i see white flashes of light and my ears are roaring you hope you black out at a time like this but im not that lucky every fist feels like i walked into a steel pole suddenly a new sound breaks through the fog in my jiggling brain a brief percussive pock again pockpock at first i think its the sound of something hitting my skull but no one is hitting me anymore yet the sound goes on pock pockpock rolling onto my side i see three men cowering against a brick wall a large uniformed man stands over them hammering them mercilessly with a stick deputy ike ransom ike the spike is beating spurling and his redneck posse like willful dogs his baton cracking shins shoulders elbows and skulls with surgical precision the flashing lights i saw must have been the arrival of his squad car penn penn can you hear me its caitlin soft hands try to pull me to my feet but they havent the strength to lift my frame count to five she orders her voice electrified by fear is that what they teach you at radcliffe i croak wobbling to my feet im surprised youre not over there screaming about police brutality screw them they need to learn some respect for women two roughnecks have fallen facedown but ike shows no inclination to stop what hes doing spurling makes the mistake of lunging at the deputy and screaming nigger which earns him a sweeping baseballstyle lick that lays him out flat on the ground ike i yell stop it man caitlin and i run toward him but im not about to try to grab his baton in his present state he might not be able to distinguish between white faces quickly enough to spare me a concussion caitlin isnt so timid she steps between ike and his targets and holds up both hands creating a sight arresting enough to paralyze the deputy ike lowers his baton and turns to me his eyes filled with sweat youd best get out of here quick police wont be long now isnt the time for extended thankyous i take caitlins arm and hobble toward the drivers door of the bmw youre not driving she says give me the keys im fine you took at least ten blows to the head your nose is bleeding im driving you to the hospital my father can check me out when i get home get in the car she scrambles over the drivers seat to the other side i crank the car and pull slowly out of the lot ikes cruiser is already gone one circuit of the block takes me to caitlins green miata and i park in the street beside it doubleparking is an old natchez tradition i cant believe you bit that guy i tell her rubbing the back of my skull you fight more like a bar girl from breaux bridge than a blueblood from boston when in rome right she slaps her thighs and yells whoooooo what a rush thats the most fun ive had with my clothes on in a long time yeah loads of fun i mutter but her excitement is contagious her face is flushed like a sprinters and her breath comes in short gasps i assume that deputy was a friend of yours id say hes a friend of ours i give her a hard look we still have a deal right no story about that little altercation in tomorrows paper absolutely no story she pokes me in the shoulder i told you i could hold my own im afraid that was just the first round itll get a lot worse her smile doesnt waver we can handle it she gets out of the car and closes the door then leans into the open passenger window would you be furious if i asked a personal question go ahead have you thought much about our kiss since last night im glad for the dark the black veil of her hair gleams in the window framing her porcelain face setting off her lips and eyes please tell me to drop dead if im out of line she says quickly its just ive been thinking about it it literally curled my toes and i wanted you to know that a pulse of pure pleasure spreads outward from my heart how do i answer yes ive thought about it a hundred times in a way thats not even thought but a constant awareness of how your mouth opened to mine the coolness and knowingness of it would you like to go to colorado with me tomorrow she opens her mouth but makes no sound im flying up to talk to the lead fbi agent on the del payton case in but part of your job will be babysitting annie shes coming along caitlin is shaking her head in confusion is this trip business or pleasure or a babysitting job im sorryi didnt put that very well its business but im taking annie along for her safety and we have a stop to make on the way a place i cant take her where huntsville texas the hanratty execution her eyes go wide are you serious yes you can be there when i interview the agent but i need you to stay at the hotel with annie during the execution the hottest ticket in journalism this week and im going to be babysitting they wouldnt let you in the witness room anyway its your call she purses her lips in thought im still not sure how to think of this do you want me to come very much then i will but what if annie wont stay in the hotel without you there then ill skip the execution i dont really want to see it anyway shell be fine with me we got along great on the plane hey whats this fbi agents name caitlins mention of that flight makes me remember her deception about her identity and this makes me hesitant to confide stones name i wipe my bloody nose on my shirtsleeve and look through the windshield penn i could have the guys life story before we ever talk to him she has a point dwight stone crested butte colorado that wasnt so hard was it her eyes are almost mocking but they hold more understanding than i have seen in a long time the answer to your earlier question is yes ive thought about it since last night a serene smile lights caitlins face and id like to kiss you again her smile broadens may i she leans through the window and across the passenger seat her eyes not closed like last night but open inviting me into them our lips touch and a perfect echo of the warmth i felt last night rolls through me this kiss is passionate but more intimate the crossing of another boundary together she pulls back and peers into my eyes then closes hers and kisses me once more when she pulls away this time she has a charlie chaplin mustache youve got blood on your lip my first war wound she laughs itll wash off what time do we leave seventhirty for the drive to baton rouge airport she touches her forefinger to my nose then pulls back through the window pick me up at the paper ill be ready chapter the trip to baton rouge airport takes eighty minutes just enough time for annie to adopt caitlin as a big sister caitlin seems to know every tv character annie does outlandish names i can never keep up with but which caitlin rattles off like the names of old friends when i asked my mother if she thought annie was ready for a trip to colorado with caitlin and me she said annies ready just make sure you are when i asked what this meant she gave me one of her looks and said am i wrong or is this the first extended time youve spent with a woman since sarah died i told her she wasnt wrong just dont rush it she advised even chitlins smell good to a starving man caitlin masters is a long way from chitterlings but theres no point in trying to explain this to my mother the shortterm parking lot is easy walking distance from the baton rouge terminal i carry the suitcases caitlin the carryons and annie her pink backpack we check our bags at the door and go straight to our gate only to find that our plane which is parked at the gate is running twenty minutes behind schedule as irate passengers begin to deplane annie announces that she has to teetee and caitlin escorts her off to the ladies room im absently watching the gate when olivia marston walks through it i know its livy because of the sudden tightness in my chest also because the plane just flew in from atlanta her home for the past thirteen years as soon as she clears the gate she steps out of line and starts past the other passengers not rushing but somehow overtaking businessmen who have five inches on her southern belles are notorious for traveling heavy livy travels light yet the single overheadsized suitcase rolling behind her will contain a colorcoordinated ensemble versatile enough to get her through every social event from a luau to a formal ball a belle by birth livy matured into something altogether different the beauty of belles is a soft beauty pliant curves and shapely baby fat livy is leaner with enough sculpted cheekbone to separate her utterly from the peachskinned debutantes who fill the ranks of the junior league below the masondixon line her eyes are a deep and brilliant blue and the tailored jacket and skirt shes wearing bring out their color just as she intended her name is actually livy sutter now but i live in such denial about her marriage that the name sutter never really registered i remember it only on those rare occasions when i pass through atlanta on business and in the tipsy midnight of a lonely hotel room pick up the phone book and flirt with the idea of calling of course i never have oh john that was penn cage the writer hes an old friend from natchez id rather die than be another old friend of livy marstons have good old john think of me with pity knowing that every heterosexual man who ever met his wife fell in love with her to some degree as far afield as montreal and los angeles ive had lawyersupon learning that im originally from natchezcome alive with questions about the fantastic livy sutter do i know her isnt she remarkable unique different somehow that was certainly the opinion of the pulitzer prizewinning writerinresidence who made a fool of himself in his sixties no less and ruined his marriage over livy when she was a junior at uva twenty yards away from me livy slows and pans the concourse she has her fathers survival instincts her eyes pass over me then return penn cage she says without the slightest doubt that its me hello livy she walks toward me with a smile that cuts right through resentment and regret her hair is the color of winter wheat in summer and just touches her shoulders looking much as it did during high school the last time i saw her at sarahs funeral she had a short severe ladylawyer cut she must have been growing it out ever since i like it much better this way probably because it fits the images that haunt my dreams my god what happened to you she asks for a moment im confused but its the bruises shes noticed last nights altercation left me looking quite a bit worse for wear i ran into the welcome wagon she shakes her head as though this is about what she would expect from me then leans forward livy is a big hugger but i have never submitted to this her hugs somehow put you at a remove even as they seem to pull you in remembering my aversion she drops one hand and squeezes my wrist with an intimate pressure her eyes already working their subversive spell upon me blurring my critical faculties creating a juvenile desire in me to please her to make those blue eyes shine what are you doing here i ask im on my way home to natchez i mean my mothers having health problems dads been after me to come visit so when he called this time i decided to spend a few days with them her health was good enough to toss a drink in my face two nights ago i think maybe health is a euphemism for alcoholism if they intend to try an intervention with maude i dont want to be within a hundred miles of it in fact id recommend kevlar body armor to the participants what about you livy asks im on my way to huntsville prison oh god the hanratty thing its all over the news midnight tonight right are you required to be there no the victims family wants me there she shakes her head you always were one for duty in a lighter voice she says i still see your books in all the airports and it still makes me jealous come on i mean it i make great money but im compromising every day for it youre living the life you always talked about you talked about that kind of life too she blushes but before she can reply annie is tugging my trouser leg i reach down and scoop her into my arms hey punkin you remember miss livy annie solemnly moves her head from side to side i was stupid to think shed remember anyone from the funeral my hair was shorter then livy tells her like caitlin she makes no attempt to talk baby talk i sure remember you anna louise i cant believe she remembers annies full name the female memory defies explanation suddenly something brushes my shoulder its caitlin holding out her hand to livy caitlin masters she says cutting her eyes at me as she gives livy a professional smile im sorry i apologize far too late liv sutter livy says giving caitlins hand a firm shake liv sutter another thing id forgotten livys name metamorphosed as she progressed through life she wasnt like a matt who suddenly insisted on being called matthew to be taken more seriously her name actually got shorter with each incarnation olivia in grade school livy in high school and just plain liv in college and law school and there was never any question of people not taking her seriouslylivy marston sutter is as serious as a garrote you two obviously know each other says caitlin oh we go way back livy explains laughing too far back to think about we only go back a couple of days caitlin replies but were looking forward to colorado theres nothing quite like the meeting of two beautiful women of the same class i would never have guessed that caitlin had a catty side livy is ten years older but gives up nothing in any department the friction is automatic hows john i ask as livy studies me with new interest her husband i add for caitlins benefit were separated six weeks now so sam jacobss gossip was accurate im sorry dont be i should have gotten out of it five years ago this bombshell leaves me tingling with a sense of unreality we all stand around feeling awkward until caitlin takes annie from my arms points at the broad picture window and says lets go look at those big airplanes theyre quickly swallowed by the crowd but not before caitlin gives me a reproving look over her shoulder who was that livy asks the new publisher of the examiner youre kidding her father owns the chain ah livy feels comfortably superior again nepotism run amok she doesnt seem your type and whats my type dead saints and ghosts from my youth i think my type is changing rich heiresses seem like a good place to start livy gives me a look intended to make me feel guilty but we share too much history for me to be taken in by that how long will you be in colorado a couple of days call me when you get back we should get together and talk we should why dont you call me then i can skip speaking to your father she lets this pass i will wait and see id better find annie well be boarding soon she reaches out and takes my hand its strange isnt it what twenty years after high school and suddenly were both free i cant believe she said it gave voice to something i would not even allow myself to think theres a difference livy i didnt want to be free she pales but quickly recovers and squeezes my hand i know you didnt im sorry i didnt mean to put it that way i take back my hand i know im sorry too ive got to run i turn to go in search of annie and caitlin but after ten steps i stop and look back i dont want to i have to livy hasnt moved shes looking right at me with a provocative expression of both regret and hope she holds up her right hand in farewell then turns and disappears into the crowd daddy was that lady a movie star annie and caitlin have reappeared at my side no punkin just someone i went to school with she looks like somebody on tv she probably does livy is a living archetype of american good looks not a mary tyler moore but a warmer more accessible grace kelly a southern grace kelly i didnt think she looked like a movie star caitlin announces what do you think she looks like i ask not sure i want to hear the answer a selfimportant bitch hey annie complains whats that spell witch says caitlin tickling her under the arms which triggers explosive giggles the masters intuition never fails she adds looking up at me youve got it bad for her dont you what hell no daddy said a bad word annie cries daddy told a fib says caitlin and thats worse i think i need a drink the ticket agent announces that first class will begin boarding immediately first love caitlin asks in a casual voice as we move through the mass of passengers funneling toward the gate its a long story she nods her eyes knowing if short stuff here goes to sleep on the plane thats a story i wouldnt mind hearing perfect airplanes work like a sedative on annie after drinking a sprite and eating a bag of honeyroasted peanuts she curls up next to caitlin and zonks out at caitlins suggestion i move her across the aisle to my seat and when she begins to snore again move back across the aisle beside caitlin youre going to make me drag it out of you she says i say nothing for a moment certain relationships do not lend themselves to conversational description emotions are by nature amorphous when confined to words our longings and passions our rebellions and humiliations often seem melodramatic trivial or even pathetic but if caitlin is going to help me destroy leo marston she needs to know the history every high school class has a livy marston i begin but livy was special everyone who ever met her knew that marston she said her name was sutter her maiden name was marston marston marston the guy you asked me to check out the da when payton was killed judge marston hes livys father god its so incestuous down here like boston worse caitlin calls the flight attendant and orders a gimlet but this is beyond the resources of the galley there seems to be a nationwide shortage of roses lime juice she orders a martini instead so she says what made her so special how many people were in your graduating class about three hundred mine had thirtytwo and most of those had been together since nursery school it was like an extended family we watched each other grow up for fourteen years and those thirtytwo people did some extraordinary things such as well theres high school and then theres life out of thirtytwo people we had six doctors ten lawyers a photographer who won the pulitzer last year and you she finishes bestselling novelist and legal eagle every class thinks its special of course but in a town as small as natchez and a school as small as st stephens you have to have something like a genetic accident to get a class like ours our football team had eighteen people on it everyone played both ways and we were ranked in the top ten in the state in the rankings of public schools thats ranked against schools like yours with seventy players on the squad our baseball team was the first singlea team in the history of mississippi to win the overall state title she rolls her eyes so you were bigtime in mississippi sports lets call cnn sports means a lot in high school what about academics secondhighest sats in the state when do we get to miss perfect livy was the center of all that the star everyone revolved around homecoming queen head cheerleader valedictorian you name it she was it caitlin groans gag me with a soup ladle if you plop most high school queens down at a major university theyll disappear like daisies at a flower show not livy she was head cheerleader at virginia president of the tridelts and made law review at the uva law school she sounds schizophrenic she probably is she was born to a man who wanted sons in a decade when the cultural dynamic of the fifties was still alive and kicking in the south she was a brilliant and beautiful girl with a mother who thought in terms of her marrying well and a father who wanted her to be president she killed a tenpoint buck when she was eleven years old just to prove she could do anything a boy could spare me the body count i suppose she graduated won the nobel prize and raised twopointfive perfect kids i cant help but laugh at the animosity livy has inspired in caitlin it can only be based on the degree to which livy has intimidated her actually she sold out caitlin cringes in mock horror not the head cheerleader of the law review she took the biggest offer right out of law school and never looked back chased money and power all the way who did she marry this is the part i like she had this howard roark fixation you know the architect from ayn rands the fountainhead she wanted the absolute alpha male an artistlogician who wouldnt take any shit off her or compromise once in his life did she find him she married an entertainment lawyer in atlanta he represents athletes and rap singers there is justice caitlin says laughing though i guess he made a lot more money than a houston prosecutor twenty times more at least why did you stay in the das office so long i thought most lawyers only did that for a couple of years to prep themselves for private defense work thats true most people who stay are very different from me zealots moralists jesuits i call them military types who like to punish criminals my boss was a lot like that so why did you stay i was accomplishing something i felt i was a moral counterweight to those people some liberals even said i had an overdeveloped sense of justice and that may be true i convicted a lot of killers and i dont apologize for it i believe evil should be held accountable whoa that was evil with a capital e its out there take my word for it an overdeveloped sense of justice is that why youre investigating the payton case no im doing that because of livy marston caitlin looks like i hit her in the head with a hammer what the hell are you talking about i lean into the aisle and signal the flight attendant its time for a scotch twenty years ago livys father used very bit of his power to try to destroy my father he didnt succeed but he separated livy and me forever and i never knew why and you think marston is involved in the payton murder yes god im trapped in a southern gothic novel you asked for it she finishes off her martini in a gulp i hope nobodys going to ask me to squeal like a pig i laugh as she orders another martini amazed by how quickly the age difference between us has become irrelevant i wonder how far apart we really are does she know that john lennon and paul mccartney were the greatest songwriters who ever lived that the pseudonihilism of generation x was merely frustrated narcissism that i at thirtyeight years old am as trapped in my own era as a septuagenarian humming dont sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me and dreaming of the agony of anzio is trapped in his back up caitlin says you and livy were high school sweethearts no for most of high school we were competitors she only dated older guys and no one steadily she was her own person she never wore a boys letter jacket or class ring she needed nothing external to define her or make her feel accepted but at some point we both realized we were destined for bigger futures than most people we knew we were going to leave that town far behind that awareness inevitably pulled us together we both loved literature and music both excelled in all our classes we dated for four months at the end of our senior year we were both going to ole miss in the fall but she was going to radcliffe for the summer oh my god caitlin exclaims that magnolia blossom actually darkened the door of radcliffe aced every class im sure she wouldnt let yankees feel superior to her for a second caitlin makes a wry face then sips her martini and looks out her window was she good in bed a gentleman never tells she turns and punches my shoulder jerk what would you guess probably she has the intensity for it yes how did her father split you up he took a malpractice case against my father and pressed it to the wall my dad was exonerated but the trial was so brutal it nearly broke him there was no way livy and i could work through that caitlin is watching me intently youre leaving a lot out arent you of course i am how do we explain the abiding mysteries of our lives livy never showed up at ole miss i say softly she disappeared fell off the face of the planet her parents told people shed gone to paris to study at the sorbonne but i called to check and they had no record of her a year later word filtered out that shed just entered the university of virginia as a freshman i have no idea where she spent the previous year and neither does anyone else maybe she got pregnant went off and had the baby somewhere i thought about that but this was the late seventies not the fifties her older sister had gotten pregnant a few years before and she had an abortion even though they were catholic livy would have done the same thing she wouldnt have let anything slow down her career theres another reason im sure pregnancy is not the answer but theres no point in getting clinical about it why did she go to the university of virginia i think because it was far from mississippi but still the south she got an unlisted number cut herself off from her old friends by the time my fathers trial got going i didnt care anymore you didnt ask her why her father was going after yours this memory is one of my worst i flew up to charlottesville a week before the trial to try to get her to make leo drop the case my dad had already had a heart attack from the stress she said she thought it was just a normal case and that her father wouldnt listen to her opinion anyway she was back in her high school queen mode winning hearts and minds at uva it was like talking to a stranger i take a burning sip of scotch i wanted to kill her yes but you loved her youre still in love with her no caitlin smiles not without empathy you are you always will be thats a depressing thought no just recognize it and move on livys not the person you think she is nobody could be and youd better be careful she just separated from her husband and youre still grieving over your wife she could really mess you up im no babe in the woods caitlin her smile is timeless all men are babes in the woods it says youre trying to destroy her father now how do you think shell react to that i dont know she has a lovehate relationship with him its like something out of aeschylus she knows hes done terrible things but in some ways shes just like him you should try very hard to keep that in mind why she takes a pair of headphones from her lap plugs them into the seat jack and starts flipping through her channel guide how long has it been since youve seen her she came to my wifes funeral we only spoke for a moment though before that a long time maybe seventeen years you pull the lid off something that might get her father charged with capital murder and suddenly she shows up like magic what are you saying that her father called her to natchez to to influence me somehow because of your newspaper story caitlin shrugs i dont want to upset you but thats what im saying she gives me a sad smile and puts on the headphones chapter i thought i was the last person to arrive in the witness room at huntsville prison until fbi director john portman walked in flanked by two field agents who shadowed him like centurions guarding an emperor up to that point the preparations for the execution had proceeded with the tense banality that characterizes them all i had arrived to find the room nearly full my old boss joe cantor motioned me to the empty chair beside mrs givens the closest relative of the victims the curtain was drawn over the window of the extermination chamber but i knew arthur lee hanratty was already strapped to the gurney behind it while a technician searched for veins good enough to take largebore iv lines i hadnt seen mrs givens for eight years but the smell of cigarettes on her clothes brought back everything a nervous woman who chainsmoked through every pretrial meeting and rushed for the courthouse door at every recess she had a bible in her lap tonight open to job when i touched her hand she clenched my wrist and asked if id seen many executions before and if they were difficult to watch in a quiet voice i explained the procedure sodium thiopental to shut down hanrattys brain pavulon to paralyze him and stop his breathing potassium chloride to stop his heart you mean they put him to sleep before they give the bad chemicals yes maam will he be able to say anything im afraid so hell be allowed to make a final statement for the record she patted the leatherbound book in her lap im not going to listen im going to read the good book then that sounds like a good idea killers often asked forgiveness at the end but that wasnt hanrattys style that was the moment that the door at the back of the room opened some reporters in front of me turned around and recognition and amazement lit their faces i turned and froze confronted by the most unlikely vision i thought i would see at midnight in texas john portman looks like a walking advertisement for brooks brothers thin and strong but a bit stiff handsome with a longish face framed by hair gone gracefully gray he was fiftyfive when he and i crossed swords over arthur lee hanratty but he looked forty he scarcely looks older now ive always sensed a dorian gray aura about him as though he were committing secret sins that never registered on his countenance i cant imagine what hes doing here theres no upside for him none that i can see anyway maybe its as simple as revenge his experience with hanratty almost derailed his juggernaut career and portman definitely knows how to carry a grudge watching hanratty die might give him a great deal of satisfaction while his guards take up positions against the wall he walks straight to the front row and sits in the empty chair next to joe cantor who looks as surprised as the rest of us i half expect portman to turn and give me a grim smile but he stares straight ahead at the curtain beyond which arthur lee hanratty will soon take his last breath as we wait in silence i realize im listening for the ring of a telephone conditioned by moviesand by a couple of reallife experiencesi run through the dramatic possibilities the lastminute pardon the hardwon stay courtesy of some crusading young lawyer from the aclu but that wont happen tonight even the mob of placardbearing demonstrators outside the walls looked smaller and more subdued than usual as i passed through it a few hundred people chanting dispiritedly in the texas rain arthur lee hanratty is a poster boy for capital punishment suddenly the curtain is drawn back revealing a man in an orange jumpsuit on an execution gurney which looks like a medical exam table that has been welded to the floor strapped to the gurney with iv lines running saline into his arms hanratty doesnt look much like the madman i remembera killer with the bunched and corded muscles of the convict weightlifterbut like every other man ive seen on that table helpless doomed he reminds me of ray presley though hanratty has the lamplike eyes of the fanatic not the cold rattlesnake beads of presley the warden retained a good venipuncturist tonightor else hanratty has good veinsbecause the execution is proceeding on schedule the warden stands with two guards against the wall behind the gurney at he steps forward and asks hanratty if he has any final words i once watched a man sing jesus loves me with tears in his eyes at this point and die with the song on his lips but i dont think thats whats coming now hanratty cranks his neck around and searches our eyes one witness at a time like a brimstone preacher trying to put the fear of hell into his congregation ive always felt that the window here should be oneway glass to prevent the killer from making eye contact with the spectators but the families of murder victims dont want it that way many of them want their faces to be the last thing the condemned sees before he dies when hanratty finds my eyes i give him nothing well well well he croons from the gurney everybodys here tonight we got mr penn cage who got famous killing my brother and convicting my ass we got joe cantor who got reelected off mr cage convicting my ass and we got former us attorney portman head of the fbi im flattered you came to see me off port ironic aint it if you could have covered up me killing that compton nigger like you wanted to none of us would have to be here tonight the reporters devour this unexpected windfall like starving jackals surely portman must have known something like this could happen the warden takes a step closer to the gurney the word nigger has got him thinking about gagging hanratty though legally the condemned man is allowed to speak freely after tonight hanratty goes on therell only be one of us hanrattys left but thats all right my brother knows what to do some of you folks are gonna get a visit real soon some warm night when you least expect it a deer slugs gonna plow right through your brain or maybe through your kids brain the warden motions to his guards i got a right to speak hanratty shouts neck muscles straining the warden raises his hand stopping the guards hed like to avoid being branded a fascist by the media if he can avoid it evening mrs givens hanratty says in a syrupy voice ill be thinking bout your sister and your niece when they send me off to jesus ive thought about them many a night when im falling asleep yes maam mrs givenss shivering hand clenches my wrist like a claw the black man is a mongrel creature hanratty says with a tone of regret but the good lord knows a nigger wench is heaven between the sheets gag the prisoner orders the warden all you motherfuckers gonna die worse than me hanratty shouts this aint nothing nothing two guards seize hanrattys head and fasten a black leather restraining device over his mouth and chin the warden checks his watch and motions for the guards to follow him out of the room mrs givens isnt reading her bible anymore shes gripping my left wrist like it is the handrail on a cliff her eyes riveted to the gurney are the chemicals going in she asks yes maam hes got about five minutes to live mrs givens says something under her breath i beg your pardon i said he ought to be awake while it happens my people was mrs givens doesnt notice when i lift the bible from her lap with my free hand and take up reading where her bookmark lies now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said to satan whence comest thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil then satan answered the lord and said doth job fear god for nought hast thou not made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face as god takes satans suggestion and puts forth his hand i recall with soulsearing clarity the feeling of being singled out for suffering of sitting in a plastic chair in the oncologists office and hearing the whitecoated doctor say to my wife that most terrible of words malignant later i would learn more arcane terms like daughter cells and highly refractory suddenly everyone in the witness room is standing around me shuffling speaking in hushed tones the prison doctor stands beside the gurney listening to hanrattys chest through a stethoscope doublechecking the leads that run to the ekg monitor the reporters are wiredthey always are at this pointunsure of their reactions even as they try to record them no firsttimer is ever ready for the banality of execution only we functionaries of the justice system know how depressing it really is the doctor nods to the warden and the warden motions for the curtain to be closed mrs givens thanks me for coming then moves purposefully toward the door you switched to prizefighting for a living joe cantor is standing beside me a glint of humor in his eyes my hand instinctively goes to my bruised eye i fell we still miss you at the office he says shaking my hand with a grip reminiscent of shad johnsons nobody works a jury the way you did penn i wasnt working them joe i was speaking from the heart thats what im talking about they dont teach that in school you were also the only assistant with the balls to argue with me i kind of miss that too believe it or not he leans closer watch out for portman that pricks had a hardon for you ever since hanrattys trial and call me if you ever get tired of writing books then he is past me shaking hands with someone else working the crowd even here as i pass into the hall beyond the door i find myself face to face with john portman his guards stand two feet behind him their jackets unbuttoned to provide easy access to their weapons portman studies me with gray eyes set in his windburned face a badge of privilege he has cultivated since youth i decide to fire the first shot in this skirmish i cant figure out what youre doing here portman you must have known you were exposing yourself to something like what just happened i can absorb what just happened he replies his voice edgier than i remember it was worth it to see that genetic debris put down a couple of reporters stop to question the fbi director but the guards hustle them through the door youre friends with special agent peter lutjens arent you portman says a cold wind blows through my soul just tell me hes being transferred to fargo north dakota lovely winters i hear the guy is blameless john internal security is one of the hallmarks of the new bureau he replies in a pr voice agent lutjens didnt understand that as i wonder how portman learned of my contact with lutjens he says stick your nose into bureau business you get rhinoplasty its that simple i usually try to avoid confrontations like this they profit no one but john portman has a special place in my pantheon of dark spirits and my guilt for what happened to lutjens already weighs on me like a heavy stone i go where the cases take me i tell him and youd do well to remember what happened the last time you went up against me after years of near omnipotence as a federal judge a man becomes unused to resistance fbi directors must enjoy similar insulation from unpleasantness because portmans thin lips narrow to a white line and his eyes blaze before he can threaten me further i simply walk past him and down the hall a rush of footsteps comes after me and a hand jerks me around its portman his face livid you fucking dilettante youre not a judge anymore portman youre a civil servant serving at the pleasure of the president and presidents are pretty sensitive to negative publicity his grimace morphs into a twisted smile you dont know what power is cage but if you keep pushing youre going to find out all this over a little mississippi murder i murmur i push in natchez you feel it in washington i find that very interesting i think a lot of people will this time when i walk away portman doesnt follow as i descend the staircase and cross the dark pavement outside the death house i feel my pulse pounding in my temples theres nothing quite like threatening the director of the fbi to get the blood circulating i quicken my steps toward the parking lot wanting to get out of the prison as swiftly as i can life is back at the hotel with annie and caitlin not here at the walls but portman wont leave my thoughts i cant shake the feeling that he came to huntsville specifically to see me and not arthur lee hanratty he knew he could speak to me here without appearing to have sought me out his ruthless punishment of peter lutjens proves that my interest in the payton murder has touched a bureaucratic nerve at the very least and at worst i cant even guess anything is possible as i near my rental car a couple of reporters from the witness room start shouting questions at me do i really believe the death penalty is a deterrent am i absolutely convinced of hanrattys guilt what were john portman and i talking about what was the fbi director doing here at all i climb into the car resisting the temptation to pour gasoline onto the fire of the payton case i need to think i need to see annie and caitlin as i drive through the gate of the walls passing the now silent crowd standing their candlelight vigil in the rainswept darkness one thing comes clear to me this is the last trip i will make to this prison the yellow glow of the candles grows smaller in my rearview mirror three more men pass their days on death row because i put them here they will die without me present chapter when i reach the hotel caitlin is waiting for me with a cold can of dr pepper and a chicken sandwich im starving it took two hours to get back to houston through the rain and traffic but knowing that annie might not go to sleep without me close kept me from stopping for food i shouldnt have worried she is sound asleep in one of the double beds while the television plays cnn in muted tones caitlin is wearing silk pajamas that somehow look demure and sexy at the same time i collapse at the table by the window and devour the sandwich then drink the dr pepper in a few gulps her instincts are as accurate as always she says nothing while i eat thank you i tell her tossing the sandwich wrapper into the wastepaper can really i saw a clip of you coming out of the prison was it bad bad enough thats the last one i go to lets change the subject then annie only woke up once and i rubbed her back till she fell asleep again i really appreciate you staying with her no problem shes great caitlin reaches out and touches my knee you really look tired you want me to go to my room so you can crash our flight to gunnison leaves at eightthirty were renting a cherokee in gunnison for the drive up to crested butte i dont think i can get to sleep yet okay she scoots back in her chair and folds her legs beneath her lets talk business then your assistant called your atf friend called her and confirmed that paytons car was destroyed by c plastic explosive they found traces of something called rdx in the shrapnel he said there should be plenty more embedded in the metal of paytons car no problem to prove in court half my fatigue disappears in the shot of adrenaline this produces so ray presley planted the blasting caps and dynamite and someone falsified the lab report she nods ive been studying your copy of the police report its mostly gossip really wild theories the interesting thing is that there were rumored suspects the detectives never talked to local guys who had done other race crimes almost as if creel and temple knew those suspects werent guilty presley may well have planted that c himself hes killed before but for money usually if he killed payton it wasnt on his own hook you think he killed payton for leo marston yes where did you first get the idea marston was involved from the deputy who saved us the other night ike ransom well i hope you can trust him because ive got to tell you everything my people have found on marston indicates that hes a liberal as far as race goes anyway i know i think the murder might not have been about race at all her mouth opens slightly what else could it have been about i dont know yet have your people learned anything about dwight stone yes one of our reporters in alexandria virginia says stone was dismissed from the fbi in for alcoholrelated problems anything else he was secondgeneration law enforcement his father was a state trooper in colorado stone himself served with the marines in korea and won a handful of medals i dont know the significance of he went to law school after he got out of the service and joined the bureau in he spent sixteen years in and received several commendations before being dismissed althea payton told me stone was sympathetic to her that he really wanted to solve the case i wonder if the fact that they both served in korea was the root of that i guess it could be something strange happened at the prison tonight caitlin what the director of the fbi showed up john portman why would he show up at the hanratty execution to warn me to stay out of the del payton case what portman and i have a history when you asked about the hanratty case on the plane i left out some details when hanratty committed that first murder in compton he was seen by a dozen witnesses before he fled the scene and they idd him from photographs under his real name an lapd detective remembered that hanratty had been the star witness in a federal hatecrime trial a while back his testimony put a half dozen white supremacists in jail and made a star out of the us attorney of los angeles portman caitlin says softly exactly the lapd went to portman who told them hanratty was under witness protection and couldnt have committed the crime political pressure started building the next day hanratty escaped from the program and wound up in houston with his brothers the rumor was portman tried to cover up the murder to keep his reputation clean im pretty sure now that its true hanratty referred to it tonight in his deathbed statement anyway portman wanted to neutralize the rumor by throwing the book at hanratty in the la courts and you stopped him exactly the guy hates my guts but what does that have to do with the del payton case im not sure but portman just killed the career of an fbi agent who gave me a little help on the phone hes transferring him to fargo north dakota i dont think theres even a field office there just a resident agency whatevers in the del payton file must be embarrassing as hell to the bureau i want you to get your people working on portman immediately i want to know everything there is to know about him ill call our alexandria guy before we fly out in the morning im going to call that fbi agent right now i owe him an apology its the middle of the night and its later in washington i doubt hes sleeping i pull the phone over from between the beds dial directory assistance then use my credit card to call peter lutjens at his home in washington his phone rings five times before he answers but his voice is wide awake peter this is penn cage silence i had no idea this thing would boomerang on you like this i am so sorry shit i dont blame you i gave you the list didnt i peter if theres anything i can do can you get portman fired i dont suddenly an idea hits me maybe i can what peter have you wondered why portman would punish you so severely for what you did he hates you thats why its the payton file portman flew to huntsville texas tonight to warn me off the payton case and asking about the payton file is what got you into trouble right yes i think portman is concealing some illegality about that case if he is and you can find out what it is stop right there are you suggesting that i go back and try to look at that file myself have they barred you from the building no but when do you leave for fargo dont even say that word goddamn it and im not losing my pension for you cowboy time is over peter if that file is damaging enough it might get portman thrown out of the directorship it might buy your old job back ive got a wife and kids and im not out to trash the bureau ill shut up then i really called to apologize anyway that makes me feel so much better the phone goes dead in my hand caitlin puts the phone back between the beds for me he wouldnt try it no lets just forget it all for tonight then she picks up the remote control and flips through the channels finally settling on a showing of to catch a thief grace kelly and cary grant zoom across the screen in a vintage sports car okay with you staring at grace kelly the coolly luminous princess grace i recall my earlier thought that she and livy marston look more than a little alike the similarities go deeper than looks too for despite her cool exterior grace kelly had a dark and promiscuous sexual history its fine i say absently caitlin turns up the sound and we watch from our chairs while annie snores away on the bed my mind is so full i cannot think clearly but one image is predominant livy marston in the baton rouge airport seemingly as beautiful and untouched as she looked at seventeen but when is anything ever what it seems as beautiful as livy was she was not untouched no girl that radiant survives adolescence without attracting the attention of every male in the three grades above her and nature being what it is and the seventies what they were sex usually follows i didnt understand this so clearly then of course at sixteen though i was as perpetually and mindlessly horny as the rest of my compatriots i was also ready to place some lucky or unlucky girl on a pedestal of mythic proportions when after a showing of looking for mr goodbar livy tearfully confessed to me how shed lost her virginitya date rape by a senior with whom i played footballshe installed herself on that pedestal with the permanence of a pieta once she occupied this place of reverence in my psyche it became impossible for me to see her clearly her public image was flawless queen of the elite private school in a city with five high schools she was wanted by every male student in the citynot merely lusted after but actually worshiped and thus floated above the usual tortured angst of high school life what i didnt understand then was that to a girl like that the most exciting company would be guys who didnt care what she said or thought and who treated her accordingly everyone knew livy marston occasionally went out with boys from the public schoolsrough handsome guys who straddled the line between hoods and outright criminalssome of whom were so dumb as to boggle the mind it was hard to imagine what livy could find to talk about with these guys what i didnt understand thenor was too afraid to admitwas that she was not interested in talking to them it was something of a tradition for st stephens boys to sleep with girls from the public schools who we thought to be looser than the ones we saw in class every day whether this was true or not im still not sure some public school girls defended their virtue like roman vestals while many st stephens girls led active romantic lives to say the least in any case it was understood according to a timehonored double standard that boys slept around as a rite of passage into adulthood when girls did it they entered that unjustified but unforgiving territory known as sluthood when livy marston did it she confused everybody to the point that no one really believed she was doing it everyone thought she was putting on a show acting wild driving her uptight father crazy now of course i understand it perfectly in the timehonored tradition of southern women of a certain class livy was taking her pleasures downward when she opened to me like a flower in the spring of our senior year i accepted her attentions like a divine gift for girls that age having sex is usually so tied up in the desire to be accepted by peers that true motives are impossible to fathom but for livy marston acceptance was not an issue when she gave herself it was because she wanted to and that knowledge immeasurably dilated the experience that her skills did not seem virginal i wrote off to her being as gifted sexually as she was in so many other ways i submerged my self into hers basked in the glow of being seen with her of being known to be loved by her i cared as little for what lay ahead of me as for what lay behind and so set myself up for the fall of my life penn are you awake i blink and look over at caitlin shes watching me from her chair her face flickering in the television light what are you thinking about nothing everything an enigmatic smile livy marston god no i lie thinking that caitlin was absolutely right when she told me she had lethal instincts im going to bed she says rising from her chair tomorrows a big day i get up to walk her to her room amazed by how tired i feel witnessing death up close saps you like a day under the sun it also stokes the sexual fires urging toward procreation as we stand outside her door caitlin looks up at me her face tilted perfectly for a kiss and i realize again how beautiful she is but i no longer see her as i did last night in the restaurant im looking through the distorting memory of livy marston caitlin lowers her chin and the moment passes what do you think dwight stone knows she asks more than we do maybe he knows everything she opens the door and slips through without looking back leaving me alone with my ghosts chapter crested butte colorado is a tiny village nestled nine thousand feet in the rocky mountains twentyfive miles from aspen as the crow flies three hours by car the easiest way to get there is to fly into gunnison and drive north up the valley for half an hour but to get to former special agent dwight stones cabin you must leave the pastel storefronts of crested buttes old town behind and drive northwest into the mountains on a forest service road past the summer homes of the rich until the road turns into a jeep trail that follows the slate river upstream between anthracite mesa and schuylkill mountain a few hundred yards north of an eightfoot vertical drop in the river situated in the thick fir and spruce between the jeep track and the narrow blueblack span of the slate stands a small but wellbuilt cabin facing southwest to catch the sun dwight stone likes his solitude when i called stone from the gunnison airport and asked if i could speak to him about the payton case he politely declined i did not tell him where i was calling from that was an hour ago now caitlin and annie and i approach his front porch like a lost family asking for directions im glad we brought coats when we left natchez it was ninety degrees here its less than fifty and there are dark clouds glowering over the summit of gothic mountain to the east before i can knock a tall fitlooking man in his late sixties clumps around the side of the cabin wearing hip waders a black watch flannel shirt and carrying a fly rod you folks lost he asks in a deep resonant voice that depends on where we are ive already recognized the voice but i say are you former special agent dwight stone stone has the eyes of a combat veteran and they narrow instantly assessing threat a man with a woman and a little girl cant seem like much danger but i dont know what his anxieties are youre on my property he points out quite reasonably why dont you introduce yourself first fair enough im penn cage his eyes relax but he sighs wearily youve wasted your time son flying up here to get told no to your face instead of over the phone i hoped you might soften up a little when you saw us he shakes his head climbs onto the porch and leans the fly rod against the cabin wall im not a journalist i have no interest in sensationalizing this story youre a writer arent you yes but thats not why im looking into this case why are you my gut feeling about dwight stone is that if you want to get anywhere with him honesty is the best policy i could say it was to help the victims family althea payton and her motherinlaw and i do want to help them but i also have a selfish reason im trying to nail a man who hurt my father a long time ago stone studies me for several seconds who would that be leo marston judge leo marston he was the district attorney back i know who he was stone eyes caitlin this your wife no a friend caitlin masters but this is my daughter say hello annie annie waves her right hand while clinging to caitlins leg with her left you bring her along for the sympathy factor i brought her to keep her out of harms way ive already been shot at not many people want the payton case reopened a flicker of something in stones eyes you convicted arthur lee hanratty didnt you thats right i saw you on cnn last night at the walls i nod but say nothing thatll buy you a half hour of my time mr penn cage how about some coffee coffee would be wonderful caitlin says lifting annie into her arms stone takes a trout bag from his shoulder then wipes his hands on his shirt and reaches for the cabin door i dont get much company up here but i think maybe we could rustle up some hot chocolate too annie breaks into a wide grin stone settles caitlin and me on a sandcolored leather sofa with annie between us before us is a huge fieldstone fireplace and stone quickly builds a roaring blaze in it the cabin is full of hunting and fishing gear snowshoes hanging on the walls rifles over the mantel a flytying bench littered with bright feathers a large doublepaned window faces the slate which runs flat and smooth thirty yards from the cabins back door only a large white propane tank mars the illusion of virgin wilderness and when theres snow its probably invisible after putting the trout in his sink stone brings us mugs of coffee and chocolate heated on an old woodstove then sits opposite us in a rough handmade chair his waders hang on a hook by the door dripping into a brass bucket with the sound of men making use of a spittoon youve got a nice place i tell him no neighbors at all howd you manage that he smiles everything you see around this place is government land but this cabin sits on a mining claim thats been in my family for three generations grandfathered down to the present the federal government cant do a thing about me i love it caitlin says thank you now i heard the story mr cage told me on the telephone tell me what you really know about the payton case and why you care weve read the original police file i begin informant reports interviews interrogations theories what did you learn from that the report was wrong about the bomb that blew up paytons fairlane if this rings a bell stone has one hell of a poker face wrong how it said the bomb was made of dynamite based on a patrolman discovering fragments of blasting caps plus lab analysis so i located paytons car its still in decent shape believe it or not the damage looked more characteristic of c to me a lot of metal shearing small shrapnel i sent a fragment of the engine to an expert for analysis last night he confirmed it c stone nods thoughtfully c was damn hard to come by in and your klan boys didnt know shit about using it he has not directly refuted my assertion youre saying the expert is wrong its happened before but thats not what im saying then youre saying the klan wasnt behind the murder i didnt say that either what kind of theories were in the report mostly rumors i thought one story was plausible someone thought paytons death was a mistake that the real target was the president of the local naacp he apparently rode to and from work with payton a good bit stone nods with familiarity what about the one where a black button man was hired from new orleans to come up and pop payton strictly a money hit this scenario had been reported to the police by a louisiana woman her story was given credence because she turned down the full fifteenthousanddollar reward rather than give more details she claimed shed never live to spend the money no further information was recorded in the file is that what you think happened i ask stone smiles it could have happened how old are you mr cage thirtyfive thirtyeight do you have any idea what things were like in in mississippi in america well the country was turning against vietnam lbj was being ground down by the war civil rights hit its highwater mark with martin luther king at his peak before he im glad you passed your civics course he interrupts im talking about reality son behind the scenes in a few powerful and paranoid men were trying to hold their vision of this country together in the face of social revolution it was a tide they had no prayer of stopping but they didnt understand that and they used every method at their disposal to try as stone speaks i glimpse a furnace of anger seething behind his eyes he has tight control over it but hes been holding in that anger for years the constitution meant nothing to these men richard nixon was one of them but he was bush league compared to them youre talking about j edgar hoover hoover was one of the more visible how does this tie in with del payton stone looks from my face to caitlins as though deciding whether we have earned the right to any of his hardwon knowledge now that i think of it hes probably seventy years old but his tanned weathered face and soldiers eyes convey the strength of a much younger man a lot of blacks were killed in mississippi in the nineteensixties he says in a deliberate voice del payton was one but he was killed later than most have you thought about that a lot of the race murders happened around sixtyfour payton came later whats the significance of that just something for you to think about everythings riddles with this guy martin luther king was assassinated in i point out he shakes his head im talking about grassroots murders caitlin looks ready to pop she obviously has a hundred questions but i hope she wont ask them the harder we push stone the more hell resist us from lawyerly instinct i move away from del payton and ask a question to which i already know the answer did you serve your full term of service with the bureau that is to say did you retire at full pension he takes a deep breath and a little more anger spills through his eyes im going to answer that because youre going to find it out anyway if you dont already know and because im not ashamed to answer i was asked to resign in officially for alcoholism caitlin nods with empathy did your drinking have anything to do with the del payton case that i wont answer but ill tell you this if every alcoholic in the bureau in had been asked to resign hoover couldnt have mounted a raid on a cathouse you had to drink just to stomach what was going on back then what kind of things are you talking about i ask you ever read american tabloid by james ellroy no give it a look things werent quite that crazy but they were damn close how did you earn a living after leaving the bureau a sour look wrinkles his face worked as a private dick for a while big firm that was sleazier than hoovers bureau so i quit worked as an insurance investigator i drank professionally for a few years i was close to dying when my daughter pulled me back up to the light i finally hung out my shingle here and started helping the locals fight the government and the mining companies that suited my temperament were you in charge of the payton investigation i was how did you like natchez it wasnt much like the rest of mississippi better in a lot of ways more liberal the people more educated but in a way that made the things that happened there worse you know because there were people there who knew better stone goes to the stove and returns with the coffeepot talking as he refills our cups when i was assigned to that case i was only a couple of years younger than payton was when he died i had a wife and two kids and i still had a few illusions that case knocked them right out of me he sets the empty pot on the stone hearth of his fireplace and takes his chair do you have any illusions left mr cage not many he studies me as if judging the truth of my statement caitlin takes this chance to jump in how do you feel personally about j edgar hoover stone examines his fingernails a seemingly casual gesture calculated to hide inner turmoil i dont care if the man wore fredericks of hollywood to bed every night i dont care if he wanted to marry clyde tolson that pompous ground squirrel but the man presented himself to this nation as a paragon of law and order a champion of right and the son of a stone winces like humphrey bogartthe man didnt know the meaning of the words he stole from the government misused agents for personal gain colluded with mobsters broke the securities laws human beings just werent meant to have that much power jesus i need a drink go right ahead its barely two pm but i feel like i could use one too stone shakes his head four months sober its a daily battle watching him get control of his craving is like watching a man fight a malarial fever as a younger man dwight stone did what most americans never dopeered behind the curtain at the men running the machineand he is a different man because of it america isnt the same country now of course its better in a lot of ways but i can see how this wouldnt matter to stone we are all of us men of our own eras you want to destroy leo marston he asks his eyes hard the name flows easily from his lips he has thought about marston since do you think thats possible put it this way i think its a noble goal caitlin presses her knee hard against mine i can feel her excitement but i dont look at her its suddenly as clear to me as the mountain air outside stones cabin the man sitting across from us knows who killed del payton and why and probably why that knowledge was never made public but it wont be easy he adds thats what someone else told me who stone is playing it so close to the vest that i decide to keep ike ransoms name to myself you wouldnt know him he came along after your time but hes interested in the case and he hates leo marston what can you tell us about marstons involvement nothing more than i have already will you help us with this case a deep conflict is playing itself out behind the old agents eyes one only hinted at by the tension in his muscles and the tightness of his lips i cant he says finally why not because despite what you see here im not alone in the world there are people i care about im thinking of getting married believe it or not and i wont put innocent lives at risk for something that cant make any difference now do you really think theres that much danger asks caitlin stone rakes a hand along his jaw make no mistake about it you are already swimming with sharks his baleful eyes linger on mine trying to impress his seriousness upon me he reminds me of an old homicide cop i knew in houston a guy whod been shot twice in the line of duty when he told you to start worrying it was time to put on the kevlar what about the mississippi sovereignty commission files caitlin asks paytons is sealed do you think we could learn anything significant from it those were state files i never saw them the fbi file is sealed as well does that surprise you he barks a laugh id be surprised if the damn thing exists at all it exists all right i tell him fortyfour volumes the question is whats in it fortythree volumes of nothing and my final report what was in your final report he sighs and looks past us to the front windows of his cabin i cant tell you that caitlin glances at me her lower lip pinned by her teeth her gesture of concentration the file was ostensibly sealed for reasons of national security she says can you give us any hint as to what the payton case could have to do with national security stone taps his fingers nervously on the arm of his chair del payton was killed five weeks after martin luther king was assassinated and three weeks before robert kennedy have you considered that caitlin and i share a look are you saying paytons death was somehow connected to those assassinations i ask kings climb to eminence over mens graves mr cage who said that a very wise man who is the king youre referring to im just quoting an old poet son last night i was threatened by the present director of the fbi why should john portman be concerned with a thirtyyearold civil rights murder why do you assume paytons death was a civil rights murder at this echo of ike ransom my heart twitches in my chest youre saying it wasnt im just thinking aloud have you ever met portman i ask my pulse racing i met him stones distaste is plain he joined the bureau a few years before i got out what did you think of him as an fbi agent he was a brownnosing manipulative ivy league rich boy with the moral sense of a cat a good little german with obsessive ambition after seven years in the field they promoted him to the puzzle palace the puzzle palace caitlin asks the hoover building fbi headquarters the guys who work there call it sog for seat of government its the perfect environment for devious backstabbing sons of bitches i apologize for the profanity i forgot about your little girl annie didnt hear him shes busy examining a rock collection displayed in a glassbox end table if she had heard him she would have yelled mr stone said a bad word did you keep any personal notes from the payton investigation i ask recalling the habits of that cop stone brought to mind a moment ago something you didnt turn in to your superiors maybe his gaze wanders to the rear window where the stream rushes along the rocks you want to learn what i learned back in he looks back at me his eyes burning into mine as though striving to communicate something he cannot say aloud do what i did talk to the eyewitnesses have you done that have you talked to the eyewitnesses i admit that i havent you didnt convict arthur lee hanratty by sitting in your office did you pound the bricks talk to everybody wholl talk and pressure those who wont thats what we did back then and we learned the truth this statement hangs in the air like a volatile gas then why didnt anyone go to jail caitlin asks softly stones jaw muscles clench in an effort to control his rage for the same reason this country is going to hell in a handbasket and dont ask me that again what was your partners name we didnt have partners he says his eyes still on me not like municipal police i worked a lot with henry bookbinder he died of cirrhosis back in seventyfour i know youre fond of quotes have you heard this one you yourself are guilty of a crime when you do not punish crime stones right hand squeezes into a fist i think your half hours up pardner may i ask you one more question he stands and stretches his back muscles what is it do you remember a cop named ray presley just before stones eyes glass over i glimpse an anger even more personal than that which i have seen to this point i remember him he says in a flat voice do you think the police made an honest attempt to investigate the case thats two questions stone turns to annie whos now touching a clay pot that looks like pueblo work howd you like that hot chocolate little darling mmmm it was great he walks to the door leaving us little choice but to follow i take annies hand and lead her after him sorry you folks had to come all this way for nothing he says opening the door to the dark vista of gothic mountain rising above the mesa rain coming thats october for you were on the porch now the sibilant sound of the slate beckons from the edges of the cabin i dont think it was for nothing caitlin says turning to stone with a look of absolute frankness i think something evil happened in natchez in i think you know what it was i realize we sort of ambushed you here and i apologize for that but we want justice for del payton i think you do too she takes a card from her pocket and passes it to stone youre going to do a lot of thinking after we leave you can reach us at this number his jaw tightens as he examines the card youre a goddamn reporter a publisher an honest one he looks at me his eyes brimming with outrage she wont print a word you said i assure him she wont even print your name she prints nothing at all until this whole mess is resolved stone shifts his gaze to caitlin i want the truth she says the truth and justice nothing else thank you for your time agent stone as we walk to the cherokee he stands in his doorway lookingfor the first time since weve seen hima little unsure of himself it strikes me that he liked caitlin using his old rank despite all his deeprooted anger stone is still proud to have been an fbi agent unlocking the door i hear the scuff of boots behind me stone has come down off the porch he puts his right arm on my shoulder in a fatherly way and looks into my eyes youve got too much to lose to dig into this mess son the world has already changed too much for it to make any difference i dont agree a strange recognition lights his eyes and i am suddenly sure that in me he sees a shadow of the man he was years ago id like to give you one more quote he says if you dont mind whatever the hour of justice does not strike on the dials of this world i look away from his sad eyes wondering what could possibly have driven a man of his strength and experience into such a miasma of defeatism no offense agent stone but i think youve been doing too much reading and not enough soulsearching to my surprise this does not anger him he squeezes my shoulder you have more illusions than you think i wish you luck i wouldnt need it if youd tell me what you know he shakes his head and takes a step back whatever you do you send that little girl someplace safe before you take another step you hear that ill do as he retreats to his porch i buckle annie into her safety seat and join caitlin in the front she looks at me with fire in her eyes did you catch what he said inside about paytons murder not being about civil rights no when you asked him if he had any personal notes he kept from his superiors stone is still watching us from the porch he said if we wanted to learn what he did we should do what he did she nods excitedly talk to the eyewitnesses right that was the first thing he said he looked at you real hard remember yes like he was trying to communicate something nonverbally do you know what it was she gives me an almost taunting smile talk to the eyewitnesses what is it for gods sake penn he used the plural according to all accounts there was only one eyewitness to the payton bombing shes right frank jones the scheduling clerk had dwight stone tried to tell mewithout telling methat there was more than one witness in the triton parking lot on the day del payton died i told you i was good at this she says smiling with triumph lets get out of here i start the cherokee and wheel it around until were pointed back toward the jeep track what did you think of stone i think hes scared me too we spent the night in gunnison we might have rushed and made our flight but none of us really wanted to race back to the heat of mississippi we took a suite at the best western and ate a long meal in a local steak house caitlin and i tried to list every possible reason del payton could have been murdered besides civil rights work but annie didnt cooperate with this effort which made it virtually impossible back in the suite we rented the parent trap on the inhouse movie channel and watched it from the big bed annie lay between caitlin and me facing the tv while we leaned back against the headboard the pillows from both beds padding our backs when annie allowed it which wasnt often we speculated about stone and his cryptic statements but watching tv with a fouryearold means watching it lying in bed with annie and caitlin catapulted me back to a time so innocent and wonderful that i could hardly bear to think about it before sarah got sick before the hospitals just us and our baby laid up on sunday mornings watching barney with no fear of the future when our biggest problem was deciding where we wanted to go for dinner when the parent trap ended annie said she wanted another movie as i punched in the code for beauty and the beast and caitlin called room service for ice cream i wondered if annie was experiencing the same memories i was or at least the safe warm feeling she once knew with her mother and me i thought perhaps she was because two minutes after she finished her ice cream she began snoring at the foot of the bed with this background of disney music and snores caitlin asked me about sarah i sat silent for a while but caitlin didnt apologize or ask if i was all right when she interviewed me i had told her this subject was off limits but that interview seemed a long time ago as i sat there watching belle confront her beast i felt caitlins hand close around mine tentative at first then firm and warm after a few moments i looked over at her she gave me a smile that asked nothing assumed nothing a sense of pure goodness flowed from her sarah would like this woman i thought for the first time since the previous day the ghost of livy marston receded in my mind i began to speak and i did not stop until i had told caitlin all of it the pleasure and the pain the joy and the grief the beginning and the end she asked to see a picture of sarah and i showed her the snapshot i carry in my wallet it could have been an awkward moment but it wasnt caitlin made it natural after i put the picture away i tried to be as natural as she but found it impossible the sadness that had been accreting in my soul for the past seven months began to break loose and i found myself doing what i never allowed myself to do in front of annie i remember caitlin holding my head against her breast speaking soft words that escape me now i must have fallen asleep that way for i awakened to find light streaming through the curtains and annie lying beside me with no idea how we got beneath the covers caitlin was not in the bed but she had taken good care of us before she left it chapter when we reached natchez the next afternoon i found a fax waiting for me on my parents kitchen table it had been sent to my fathers office just before lunch there was no originating number at the head of the page but the fax itself was a copy of a newspaper story clipped from the leesville daily leader leesville louisiana is a community located next to fort polk a huge army training base and a hundred and fifty miles from natchez above the article was a copy of the papers masthead and it showed the date as may five days after del payton died the article recounted the capture of two mena supply sergeant and a civilianwho one month previous had stolen armaments from a military arsenal at fort polk while the troops were on maneuvers and the marching band was parading around the base in full dress uniforms these two enterprising souls had filled a twoton truck with ms claymore mines hand grenades and c plastic explosive then had driven off the base and sold most of the ordnance piecemeal throughout the southeast the civilian half of this duo was named lester hinson i noticed because his name had been circled probably by whoever sent the fax there was also a note for me to call althea payton at st catherines hospital i tried but someone in the nursery told me she couldnt come to the phone i called caitlin at the newspaper explained the mystery fax and gave her lester hinsons name so she could begin tracing him she asked if i thought dwight stone had sent the fax my guess was peter lutjens but i didnt say his name on the telephone i did make a mental note to call him again and make a pitch for him to take a run at paytons fbi file before he woke up in north dakota caitlin asked if id gotten started doing what stone had told me to do talk to the eyewitnesses of the payton bombing she recalled from her research that frank jonesthe sole witness to the bombingworked as a salesman at the local pontiac dealership jones didnt know it yet but he was about to take me for a test drive the pontiac dealership is festooned with balloons and strips of colored foil but the only customers are clustered around the service bay the salesmen hover in a loose knot inside the airconditioned showroom watching for customers through the huge glass window like predators scanning a droughtburned plain the sight of my fathers bmw i brings them all to their feet albeit with feigned aloofness they probably know the car on sight but hope that old doc cage has temporarily taken leave of his senses and decided to buy american for once after parking at the end of the main display line i make a show of looking at price stickers as i walk toward the showroom door i search the salesmens faces through the glass gambling that the oldest will be frank jones it stands to reason although in a tough economy retirees might be working jobs like this to supplement their social security when i open the door everyone is suddenly busy as though ive blundered into a labor day blowout sale i nod to the nearest salesman then walk over to a transam sitting on the display floor and study the price sticker twenty seconds of silence is all it takes shes a beaut aint she a head has suddenly materialized from behind a wooden partition near the back wall you want two or just the one the face on the head is over seventy and it splits into the forced grin of a man who always supplies the laughs for his own jokes he comes out from behind the partition right hand extended in greeting revealing a baby blue polyester sports coat over a blue plaid shirt and brown tie frank jones sales manager he barks pumping my hand what can we do you for today i want to take a test drive thats why were here which car i drop the flat of my hand on the roof of the transam how about this one you bet he looks vaguely to his left open the big door jimmy mac sure says a young salesman by the window can i talk to you a second first i got a customer here son jones has the gleam of money in his eye he hasnt yet spotted the bmw and he seems to have sized me up as an allcash type i sit in the passenger seat as he guides the transam out of the showroom and stops so we can trade seats once behind the wheel i adjust the seat for my longer frame then pull out to the edge of the highway that looks like doc cages car he says finally noticing the bmw it is i merge into traffic make a uturn and head for the mississippi river bridge im driving it he looks at me and starts to speak but doesnt im penn cage shit youre the book writer he stares straight through the windshield for half a minute then turns to me did you say all that crap they printed in the paper some of it they didnt exactly stick to what i said jones snorts dont i know it you cant trust a damn thing you read in that rag they did the same to me back in sixtyeight about your account of the bombing not so much that it was the little things hell they misspelled my name how the hell can you misspell jones by god that takes some doing when we top the hill that runs down to the cut in the bluff i remember that there are two bridges spanning the mississippi now throughout my childhood there was only one and i cant seem to keep the new one in my mind as the transam ramps onto the main span of the westbound bridge the milewide tide of brown river opens seventy feet below us the vistas to the north and south look much as they did to sam clemens a hundred years ago muddy water swollen into the forest and sandbars on both banks pale blue sky blanked out at the center by a relentless sun ahead of us vidalia louisiana is laid out like a toy town behind its levee some buildings no higher than the river itself the personification of provisional existence you want to ask me about that killing dont you hell ive told the story a thousand times a dozen times a day since that article ran did the police question you a lot about what you saw jones squints his rather dull version of a cagey look everybody questioned me a lot i was the only person who saw that fairlane blow this isnt the time to contradict him did you get the feeling the police really wanted to solve the case what do you mean i let the silence speak for me he licks his lips and looks out his window you writing a book about this no well if you was it seems like my story might be pretty valuable to you im not i just want to know about the police do you remember who investigated the case henry creel and ronnie temple and youre goddamn right they tried to solve it those guys had a hundredpercent clearance rate back then they must be the only detectives in the world with that record these days maybe back then they didnt have the goddamn aclu breathing down their necks but they didnt solve the case jones rolls down the window and spits into the wind somebody killed a nigger case closed what do you know about ray presley enough not to say a word about him i turn onto deer park road which follows the river south on the louisiana side soon were driving past cotton and soybean fields the levee on our left the monotony broken only by shotgun churches house trailers and tarpaper shacks you seem to know a lot about creel and temple creel was my wifes cousin was lou gehrigs disease over to shreveport temples dead too heart attack i swing the car up onto the road that runs atop the levee between the levee and the river lie the perpetually flooded borrow pits created by the dredging that built the levee the blackwater pits teem with catfish crawfish gar water moccasins alligators abandoned cars and the occasional corpse good fishing down there this month jones offers do you think payton was killed for doing civil rights work he shrugs i dont know nothing from civil rights work he was stirring up a pile of shit i know that he used the national union to get himself promoted to qualitycontrol inspector which was a white job up till then that pissed off a lot of people then he started bucking for injectionmold foreman what the hell did he expect wasnt nobody out there gonna tolerate a nigger foreman in sixtyeight next thing theyd be wanting the front office too far too fast its that simple did the klan kill him joness cheeks redden i dont know nothing about no klan payton just pissed off too many people anybody coulda killed him he snaps his fingers nervously turn this damn thing around i gotta get back to work i noticed you guys were pretty busy kiss my sanctified ass he turns on the radio selects a country station and adjusts the volume so that further conversation will be impossible i make a uturn and head back toward the twin bridges a couple of minutes later he surprises me by yelling over the roar of the stereo i cant stand this shit what i ask turning down the volume all this happyass fakerock slickyboy country shit they dont play nothing good no more whats good hank williams hanks all right sure but jim reeves boy thats the prime stuff i almost laugh im no jim reeves fan but whatever differences separate me from this redneck he and i are bound together by manner rites and traditions imprinted deep beneath the skin thats why caitlins newspaper story didnt stop him from talking to me i am white and mississippiborn and at bottom jones perceives me as a member of his tribe i wonder how wrong he is if push comes to shove and im forced to choose between white and black will i realize there is no choice at all did the fbi question you shit federal bureau of integration we called em back then now that were headed back jones has regained some of his old swagger had em an office up in the city bank building a dozen yankees with blue suits and ramrods up their butts agents came down from jackson special just to question me i think bobby kennedy sent em hoover wouldna sent assholes like these were they were tough on you a pack of pussies more like they didnt do no better with the case than creel and temple did and kennedy got what he deserved a couple weeks later robert kennedy deserved a bullet in the head what about an agent named stone special agent dwight stone joness face goes as dead as though someone zipped it shut never heard of him he was lead agent on the payton murder the extriton man sets his jaw and stares straight ahead like an obstinate mule he remembers agent stone all right and not fondly were approaching the arched midpoint of the eastbound bridge above us natchez stretches across the horizon like a cecil b de mille movie set sweeping up from the cottonrich bottomland to the spires and mansions on the great bluff then back down again to the triton plant and the sandbars where the river rolls on toward new orleans and the gulf its the first time in years that ive seen the city from this aspect and its breathtaking below us two steamboats are docked at underthehill grand anachronisms that now carry tourists rather than cotton merchants and gamblers as we roll off the bridge and top the first long incline the pontiac sign appears in the distance joness posture instantly relaxes this will be my last chance to speak to the man with any hope of a candid answer what were you doing out there in the parking lot by yourself at eight oclock that night something in his reaction telegraphs that he is about to lie he does not squirm in his seat or make a sharp exclamation rather a new stillness settles over him one that sits heavily on a man unaccustomed to it my wife called me he says she wanted me to get some bread and eggs and such i was on night shift and the pik quick was about to close this is the story recorded in the police report but hearing jones repeat it aloud i sense the wrongness of it you were coming back from getting groceries when you saw the explosion i never got to leave he shifts in his seat finally giving release to his nervous energy had a problem with my battery or i thought it was my battery turned out to be my solenoid a strange elation takes hold of me eight years of questioning hostile witnesses honed my intuition to a pretty fine point frank jones is lying hes been lying for thirty years and any cop worth a damn would have seen it as easily in as i saw it today dwight stone would have seen it a damn sight quicker i pull onto the edge of the pontiac lot and stop then catch joness left wrist and hold it tight who else was in that parking lot that night his eyes go wide with surprise what nobody i squeeze harder he tries to pull away but he hasnt the strength nobody i tell you you saw the killer thats a goddamn lie then who was it who else was there that night jones jerks his arm free and rubs his wrist you dont know shit im going to blow this case wide open my friend and the longer you lie the harder its going to go on you he glances nervously at the showroom window he actually looks like he wants to talk but he has stuck with a lie for thirty years and he wont abandon it easily now he grabs the key from the ignition killing the engine get out of this goddamn car i start to get out then stop you dont mind if i call your wife to confirm that story do you about her calling you to go get groceries do what you want i divorced that bitch thirty years ago just get the hell out of this ride i climb out and walk to my fathers car the other salesmen are lined up against the showroom window staring openly now as jones switches seats and pulls the transam toward the building i start the bmw and drive quickly off the lot one cell phone call to my mother tells me all i need to know frank joness exwife still lives in natchez after a messy divorce she married the president of a local oil company quite a trade up from frank jones the messiness involved affairs jones had trailed with several secretaries at the battery plant i dial the oilmans home and ask for the exwife by her new name little this is mrs little says a rather prim voice mrs little this is penn cage dr cages boy thats right i i remember when you used to take the blood and x rays at your daddys office at least she didnt hang up yes maam i wanted to ask you a couple of questions if you dont mind what about the day del payton died a hesitation what about it i just talked to your exhusband and sweet jesus what did that nocount say about me her anger sounds fresh even after thirty years he used you for an alibi mrs little he said he went out to the triton parking lot on the night del payton died because you asked him to pick up some groceries thats a damn lie pardon my french he was in that parking lot because he was diddling one of his floozies this remarkable statement stops me for a moment are you youre saying you think someone was in the lot with him that night are you hard of hearing that nogood tomcat came home that night and asked me to tell the police same story he told you and i did numbskull that i was im not sure im breathing the next morning i took the car to the grocery storefor real that time and as i was loading the bags into the backseat i found a pair of stockings they werent mine and they were not in pristine conditionif you know what i mean when i got home i kicked that sorry sack right out of the house for good have you ever told this to anyone before today sure the police i called them back and told them i hadnt been straight with them that my husband made me lie a car horn honks behind me i pull into the right lane and accelerate to the speed of the cars around me what did the police say not to worry that i wouldnt get into any trouble everything was under control under control do you remember which officer you told yes he came out to the house it was that cop they sent to parchman later on ray presley no account of this meeting made it into the case report was presley alone when he came to see you yes he gave me the creeps that presley always did did anyone from the fbi question you about this mrs little says nothing but not because she has nothing to tell mrs little do you remember an fbi agent named dwight stone well actually i do yes but thats all i have to say good please wait do you have any idea who your husband was with on that day which floozie i mean i know this is painful but its terribly important the faster i get to the bottom of this the less chance anyone is going to get hurt i dont like talking about this her breaths are shallow anxious if you get to the bottom of it my exhusband is going to come out of it smelling like a cowpie isnt he probably betty lou jackson maam thats the sluts name shes married to some electrical contractor now beckham her name is acts like shes as good as anybody but shes a tramp through and through thank you mrs little dont thank me because i never told you anything the phone goes dead the nice thing about small towns is that its easy to find people directory assistance has only one beckham listed im starting to feel like i might solve the payton case without ever leaving the car hello a womans voice is this betty lou beckham yes i dont use the lou anymore though its just betty betty beckham who is this this is penn cage mrs beckham deafening silence mrs beckham im real busy right now mr i just wanted to ask you a couple of quick questions i cant help you im sorry you dont know what im going to ask you or do you i saw the paper the other day her voice is so tight that her vocal cords must be near to snapping its about that isnt it mrs beckham i realize this might be a delicate matter id be glad to speak to you in person if youd feel more comfortable dont you come around here somebody might see you who are you worried would see me anybody are you crazy mrs beckham i really only have one question were you in that parking lot when del paytons car exploded oh my god oh dear jesus i have absolutely no interest in what you might have been doing there mrs beckham i just want to know about the bombing how stupid did that sound if betty lou was doing what mrs little suspected she was doing in that parking lot it might end up on the network news dont call back she pleads youll get me in bad trouble yourself too you dont know you just dont know shes hung up but the fear in her voice was real enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck she is afraid of more than memories shes been living in dread ever since caitlins story ran in the paper as i turn into my parents neighborhood the cell phone rings its althea payton i tried to call you earlier althea at the hospital but you were busy i know i got this number from your father she sounds out of breath i think ive remembered something important take it easy im not going anywhere what is it i was visiting an adult patient this morning and his tv was tuned to cnn i really wasnt paying attention but then i heard your name they were talking about that execution in texas how you were the lawyer who convicted that man right they showed you walking into the prison and then right after that they showed another man they said he was the head of the fbi i didnt hear his name but i watched again an hour later to see if theyd run the same thing and they did i dont understand althea what did you remember i knew that man mr portman john portman you knew him from where from here right here in natchez youve seen john portman in natchez thats what im trying to tell you remember i told you about agent stone how he was nice and really wanted to help us yes and i told you some of them didnt how mr stone had another man with him a young yankee man who was cold and never said anything my chest feels hollow yes that was him that john portman on the tv was him althea you must be mistaken john portman would have been very young in its him i tell you his hairs a little grayer but thats the only difference the second time they ran the story i watched close aint no doubt about it it was him a young yankee man cold as february chilled me right to the bone somewhere in my mind dwight stone is saying knew portman he came into the bureau a few years before i got out dont say anything else althea im on a cell phone im going to check on this and get back to you what do you think it means i dont want to speculate dont talk to anyone about this ill get back to you ill be waiting i hit end then turn into my parents driveway and park leaving the engine running of all the things i could possibly have learned about this case this is the most astonishing if john portman was in natchez in a lot of things suddenly make sense dwight stones personal hatred of him stones unwillingness to talk about the case maybe even the national security seal on the payton file although this is probably going too far no one could have known in that special agent john portman would wind up director of the fbi thirty years later so that wasnt the reason hoover sealed the file but portman almost certainly knows why the file was sealed as does stone given stones hatred of portmanand stones dismissal from the bureau while portman rose through its ranksthat reason must have been something stone could not stomach but which portman went along with he was a good little german stone had said of portman he followed orders the question is what was he ordered to do as i get out of the car a middleaged black cop in uniform walks around the corner of the house one hand on the gun at his hip are you penn cage yes sir he smiles and nods he has the sad drooping eyes of a beagle im james ervin just keeping an eye on things for you and your daddy im glad to see you officer ervin i reach out and shake his hand that gun loaded he taps the automatic on his hip you bet good man you sure got a pretty little girl in there reminds me of my girls when they was little thank you do you know what all this is about ervin sucks in his upper lip and looks at the ground you trying to get whoever killed del payton aint you thats right did you know del my daddy knew him he raises the beagle eyes to mine and they are full of quiet conviction dont you worry none you aint gonna have no trouble somebody come messin round here they on the wrong side chapter it takes less than ten minutes on my mothers computer to verify what althea payton told me on the cell phone the fbis official web page features a thumbnail biography of its new director the bio boasts of portmans first year as a field agent one which he spent investigating race murders in mississippi and alabama that year was a time magazine writer hailed portmans year in the trenches and stated that his sterling civil rights credentials were one of the major reasons the president had tapped the republican federal judge to lead the fbi in a bipartisan gesture that shocked most democrats the bureau had been wracked by racial problems for the past decade and had been successfully sued by both africanamerican and hispanic agents portmans deep south experience sat well with minority political interests by my calculations portman was twentyfive when he visited althea paytons house with dwight stone fresh out of yale law stone was probably ten years older beyond this my facts are few portman rose swiftly through the bureaus ranks while stone was fired five years later in crested butte i sensed that stone felt his dismissal was related to the payton case but if that was true why would hoover wait five years to terminate him or had whatever happened in haunted stone fueling his alcoholism until hoover was finally left no choice but to fire him unable to answer this question i list the names of main players on the computer and stare at them a while payton presley marston stone portman hinson one of the first things a writer learns is that the best way to solve a problem is to get out of the way of his subconscious and let it work following this dictum i begin playing with the screen fonts and point sizes switching from courier to bookman from flowing gothic to a tortured algerian as the fonts swirl and transform themselves before my eyes it strikes me that men like leo marston and john portman cannot be investigated by normal means especially by a private citizen caitlins status as a reporter lends us some theoretical authority under the first amendment but this means next to nothing in the real world what is required is some creative thinking kings and presidents can be brought down with the right weapons the trick is to find their vulnerabilities men like portman and marston live for power they hunger for it even as they wield more than most men will ever know they act with certainty and dispatch rarely allowing themselves the luxury of doubt and so long as they operate from this fortress of psychological security they are untouchable perhaps the way to bring them down is to breach that fortress to turn their worlds upside down and force them into a reactive mode the way to do that seems obvious enough reintroduce them to art emotion they have not felt in a great while fear my first thought when my father comes through the pantry door is that he looks ten years older than he did two days ago he kisses my mother and annie then motions for me to follow him into the library i shrug at my mother and follow he sits in his leather recliner and switches on the television apparently to mask our conversation somebody just tried to kill ray presley what i exclaim dropping onto the sofa to his left his girlfriend was giving him the first few ccs of that mexican chemotherapy he takes he started complaining of angina and ripped the catheter out of his wrist the girl called and gave him cpr until the paramedics got there he was having a coronary he just checked himself out of the ccu against my orders what makes you think it was attempted murder the girl brought in the iv bag and one of our lab techs ran a few tests he thinks theres some potassium chloride mixed in with the cocktail jesus did you call the police ray told me not to he was so goddamn mad he wouldnt let anybody but me close to him he said hed handle it himself ill bet he will how much damage did his heart sustain i dont have enough enzyme tests back to tell dad drums his hands on the arms of the chair weve got another problem what you talked to betty lou beckham today how do you know that she showed up at my office at four oclock half in the bag said she had to talk to me i should have expected this for years my father has acted as a confessor to countless souls particularly women who have no outlet for their sorrows and anxieties other than their ministers or local psychologists as natchez has attracted only one or two psychiatrists over the past two decades and none has stayed in this vacuum a compassionate md fills the void as no one else can was she in that parking lot when del payton died yes she and frank jones were having sex in his car when the bomb went off if you can believe it she saw payton walk out to his car she actually saw the damned thing explode christ what else did she see when the bomb went off jones panicked he started to take off but betty lou reminded him that he was supposed to be working inside the plant she was off that day so she got into her vw to leave when she was almost out of the lot she looked up and saw somebody watching her from a pickup truck who ray presley a fist closes around my heart presley was there when the bomb went off dad nods once very slowly so he was involved in the actual murder it looks that way did betty lou tell anybody shed seen him there not at first presley came to see her and explained that might not be good for her health this scene is all too easy to imagine then frank joness wife found betty lous stockings in his car and kicked jones out of the house i gather that mrs jones then told the police her husband had lied about why he was in the parking lot because presley came to see betty lou again gave her a harsher warning but she told the fbi didnt she special agent dwight stone not at first when agent stone found out joness wife had kicked him out the morning after the murder he talked to the wife and she led him to betty lou stone offered her money but betty lou wouldnt talk she was too scared of ray then somebody shot at those fbi agents on the highway stone came back and told betty that if she withheld evidence hed make sure she did time in federal prison he convinced her shes basically a good girl she wanted to tell the truth all along she gave up presley to stone yes then what happened nothing betty lou kept waiting for presley to be arrested but he never was then the fbi pulled stone out of town presley showed up again beat the hell out of her forced her to give him oral sex she was a basket case she was about to skip town when presley was arrested on the drugtrafficking charges that sent him to parchman i sit back on the sofa trying to process it all shes still scared to death of ray shes been working herself toward a nervous breakdown since caitlin masterss article came out when you called this afternoon she lost it i gave her a shot of ativan and drove her home ray is the problem you were talking about hes directly involved in the murder but if i push him hell push back he doesnt have your gun anymore but he could still raise a hell of a stink if he wanted to dad sighs and leans back in his chair it doesnt matter i decide presley wasnt solely responsible for paytons death the fact that someone just tried to kill him proves that somebodys afraid hell talk we both look up as my mother slides open the library door i assume she is summoning us to supper but she says youve got a visitor penn who is it caitlin masters i wasnt expecting caitlin so she must have news bring her in shes playing with annie when mom disappears dad says how much does masters know nothing about the blackmail dont tell her what happened to ray not yet caitlin comes to the door carrying annie in her arms then passes her off to my mother and promises to be back in the kitchen in a few minutes shes wearing black jeans sandals and a white pinpoint buttondown with her sable hair spilling around the collar she looks harried but also ready to burst with excitement dad stands as i make the introductions and as soon as mom closes the door caitlin says i just hit the jackpot what are you talking about i traced lester hinson the guy in the article from the leesville daily leader whats his story hes a smalltime crook who spent most of his life in angola prison he lives in new orleans now you talked to him too excited to remain in one place caitlin begins pacing more than that i found out exactly how he ties in to the payton case in april of lester hinson and a supply sergeant named earl wheeler ripped off an arms depot at fort polk and started selling the stuff on the black market a month later they were busted by the army cid thats what the article was about right well hinson was a civilian and he got a visit in jail from special agent dwight stone stone wanted to know if the pair had sold c to anyone from mississippi particularly natchez they had stone had to get the charges pled down to find out who the buyer was but he didnt mind that at all the buyer was ray presley i say in a monotone her mouth drops open youre not guessing are you no we just placed presley at the crime scene when the bomb went off how did you do that you finish first i cant believe hinson just spilled his guts to you he didnt i did what cops do whats that she grins i paid him i told him what i wanted then wired five hundred dollars to a western union office in new orleans i told him id wire him another five hundred if he told me what i wanted to know he would have talked all day for that money dad gives caitlin an admiring look forget that she says how did you put presley at the scene you were right about what stone was trying to tell us there was another witness to the murder one who never made it into the police report who her identity isnt important right now what matters not important caitlin isnt going to like this this witness can only implicate ray presley presley probably killed payton but he almost certainly did it for someone else thats how he worked and i dont want to move on presley until we have the man who ordered the crime caitlin is shaking her head but thats how you get to the top guy isnt it you squeeze the little fish until they talk usually yes but presleys a special case hes never scared easy and now he has terminal cancer he doesnt have a lot of fear of earthly punishment so he bought some plastic explosive in the statute ran out on that long ago the witness who saw him in the triton parking lot is a terrified woman whos now married and respectable but who happened to be committing adultery in a car when the bomb exploded i seriously doubt she would make a statement to the police much less testify in open court penn i cant believe im hearing this we now have means and opportunity for presley to have committed homicide the motive could be racial prejudice hes a lock for it if we dont squeeze presley how can we get any further weve just been discussing that she looks from one to the other of us her green eyes probing you guys know something i dont right something about presley something thats keeping you from going after him yes what is it i cant tell you not at this point the familiar pink moons appear high on her cheeks what kind of bullshit answer is that are we partners or not i trust caitlin implicitly but i cannot trust her with my fathers secret if i could tell you i would but i have to ask you to trust me for now you ask me to trust you but you dont trust me she looks at my father who is staring pointedly at the floor then back at me you think leo marston hired presley dont you theres no evidence of that ike ransom says its marston and dwight stone said the same thing in so many words but neither of them will go public theres been another development as well she sighs and looks at the floor im afraid to ask stone lied to us in colorado he knew john portman a hell of a lot better than he led us to believe how do you know that i quickly explain althea paytons call about seeing portman on cnn and my subsequent verification that he worked in mississippi in caitlin gropes backward for her chair and falls into it holy shit do you realize what this means tell me this story just went national this story is huge remember our deal you print nothing until i say so when i made that promise i didnt know you were going to obstruct the investigation for reasons you dont see fit to tell me there were no conditions on the promise and i expect you to abide by it she purses her lips could i please point out a couple of things one we have no real investigative power two the files we need are under government seal and were unlikely to get that changed without a protracted court battle three the payton case somehow involves the director of the fbi who has practically unlimited power to interfere with us four the case also involves leo marston the single most powerful man in this county possibly in the state five no one directly involved in the case wants to talk to us she holds up her hands in desperation what do you want to do i think the media is the only weapon we have i agree you do i simply want to use it in a different way than you how to scare the shit out of portman and marston and see which way they jump now i have her attention how can you do that by making them think we can prove theyre guilty of paytons murder and how do you propose to do that simple i state publicly that leo marston was responsible for the murder of del payton what my father cries with no evidence asks caitlin just slander him exactly i slander him but why because by doing that i leave marston no option but to sue me dad snorts in amazement what the hell does that accomplish the minute marston sues me ill answer his charge by stating that truth will be my defense i will then be free under the rules of discovery to request marstons business records personal papers tax returnsall kinds of things from the years surrounding the crime a fishing expedition asks caitlin you think youll find some documentary proof that marston ordered paytons murder not really my primary goal is psychological ike ransom says everyone around here is playing the quiet game he says the way you win that game is by making people nervous so thats what im going to do marston wont believe id make a public charge like that without hard evidence hell panic his first thought will probably be ray presley after presley who knows portman maybe we dont know who else was involved but marston does you think he does what if youre wrong what if you have no evidence by the time the slander case comes to trial then ill lose a great deal of money maybe everything i have how long would that be from the time of the slander till the trial hard to say with someone like marston the deck would be stacked against me from the start hed want a quick trial and hed get one everybody in this town owes him favors especially in the judicial system hes got his share of enemies too dad points out you might get some unexpected help ill tell you what would scare the shit out of him i think aloud feeling excitement building inside me a jury trial in this town the jury might be fifty percent black we might even get a black judge dad actually cackles marston would be apoplectic after a lifetime of moderation on race he gets hauled before a black jury on a case like this how would you do it caitlin asks the slander i mean walk into a bar pound on a table and accuse him of murder no id have to make it impossible for him not to sue talk radio maybe but the ideal medium is print it carries the most authority she blanches you mean my newspaper not a chance in hell i smile hey are we partners or what she stands and jabs her forefinger at me marston would sue the paper for libel hed sue my father she shakes her head violently my father will tolerate a lot but a libel suit do you know what kind of damages people have been awarded in libel cases tens of millions of dollars hed jerk my butt out of here so fast my feet wouldnt touch the ground caitlin she shakes her head again and walks quickly to the door im going to forget i ever heard this and i suggest you think long and hard before you put everything you have up for grabs you have a daughter to raise not a word in the paper about any of this i remind her she closes her eyes and sighs angrily unless you want to print my accusations of marstons guilt then you can blow the story wide open you can take it national tomorrow morning the more noise the better she stands in the door with her hands on her hips nostrils flared eyes burning damn you penn cage she glares at my father if i were you id try to talk some sense into my son then she steps through the sliding door and shuts it with a bang dad looks at me with a glint in his eye thats some woman he takes a cigar from his shirt pocket unwraps it and sticks it between his back teeth desperate times call for desperate measures what choice do we have even if betty lou would go public she might never get the chance presley could kill her and even if we somehow turned presley marston could have him killed but as soon as i go public any suspicious accidents make marston look guilty i agree not only that i like it theres only one problem i murmur fighting the fear germinating in my gut whats that leo is one cool customer what if i cant spook him by nine pm ive pretty much decided to go forward without caitlins help finding a newspaper reporter or radio talkshow host who will let me spout off about leo marston and a race crime shouldnt be too difficult in the current media climate where celebrity and controversy are the benchmarks of ratings theyll probably fight over the story but caitlins apprehension still worries me what i need now is positive confirmation that im right to go after marston dwight stone answers his phone after five rings but as soon as i identify myself he hangs up i try once more in case he made a mistake but the result is the same more curious than discouraged i take out my wallet and fish out the card with ike ransoms cell phone number the deputy answers instantly this is your buddy from the triton plant i tell him he asks if im home then says hell call back from a land line a minute later he tells me to meet him at an abandoned warehouse by the river in the industrial park this doesnt strike me as a good way to spend the evening so i suggest that he pick me up in the walmart parking lot he reluctantly agrees fifteen minutes later i climb into his cruiser the claustrophobic little world of anger and guns and cigarettes he looks just as he did the other night only more nervous he looks in fact like he might be wired on speed where the hell have you been he demands colorado i talked to an fbi agent who worked the case in sixtyeight ransom hits the brake then catches himself and continues up the bypass i thought i told you to stay away from the fbi you did and im curious as to why he ignores the comment whats this guys name stone he taps the wheel impatiently couple of people i talked to remembered him they said it seemed like he really tried to solve the case he did more than try he solved it ransom looks over at me his speedpinned eyes distant he tell you that in so many words no details he wont talk about it ike laughs humorlessly what did i tell you the quiet game everybodys playing it what are they so scared of marston judge leo got some serious juice man is that all what you mean did you know john portman was here in john who i hesitate before answering i have a feeling ike knows exactly who im talking about the director of the fbi i say watching him he accelerates and whips around the car ahead of us but i cant tell whether he did it to buy time or not what you mean he was here it was his first year as an fbi agent he was working the payton case with stone ike shrugs thats the first i heard of it but i told you to stay away from the fbi didnt i you cant trust no feds man never mind look ive thought of a way to go after marston but its risky ive got to know more than i know now you understand youve got to give me something more like what how about some evidence shit man if i had evidence id get that motherfucker my own self finding evidence is your job why do you think he was behind dels murder i just know okay its not okay damn it it doesnt make sense why would marston want del payton dead thats what youre supposed to find out my fathers original doubts about ikes motives are coming back to me why do you hate marston so much ike he turns to me his eyes smoldering i done told you once its personal thats not good enough anymore fuck you then i say nothing for the next mile ikes respiration is heavy and erratic as though so much energy is consumed by his anger that he has to remind himself to breathe were you and ray presley cops at the same time he keeps his eyes on the road presley was in parchman when i joined the force but i knew that motherfucker later on we were like two bad dogs on a street we always stayed on different sides still do well somebody just tried to kill him an eerie stillness comes over ike then he turns his head toward me and the intensity in his eyes is frightening tried to kill him how poison take more than poison to kill that bastard i think presley planted the bomb that killed del payton ike rolls his tongue around his cheek his eyes moving on and off me why you think that ive got reasons what do you think i think all the evidence in the world against ray presley aint gonna get you no closer to marston why not cause presley dont know shit about the reason you got to find the why of it take me back to my car you want me to fight your battles for you but you dont give me shit for help he spins the wheel and turns the cruiser back toward walmart his anger making his knuckles pale marston fucked up my family he says through clenched teeth fucked up my whole life thats all im gonna tell you its got nothing to do with del payton but i knew you could bring marston down behind the payton thing thats why i went that way i want that bastard destroyed in public thats whatll hurt him the most if it wasnt for that id have killed his ass a long time ago i settle back on the seat and let my eyes go out of focus which turns the oncoming headlights into slow white meteors ike i want you to swear on the soul of your mother that marston ordered del paytons death he doesnt hesitate on the soul of my mother if it wasnt for leo marston del payton would be alive today i guess thats all the certainty im going to get when i get home caitlins miata is parked in the driveway she is standing in the garage talking to officer ervin whats the matter i ask as she walks out to meet me dwight stone just called me at the newspaper he thinks his phone is tapped he gave me the number of a pay phone and told me to get you to call him back he said you should use a pay phone too one far from your house lets go i drive us up to the bypass then north to highway theres a pay phone at a convenience store but i go a little farther to a grocery store parking lot where there wont be so much noise caitlin stands beside me as i dial the number yes stone says in a gruff voice its penn cage listen to me cage my phone is tapped so are the phones at your fathers house and medical office probably the lines at the newspaper as well you should also assume physical surveillance im being watched right now jesus someone just tried to kill ray presley caitlin tenses beside me but i ignore her how asks stone poisoned his iv bag he had a coronary but hes still ambulatory and mad as hell stone says nothing but i can sense the conflict raging within him i know you worked with portman on the payton case in sixtyeight i tell him why did you lie about that i was trying to protect people who you for one others too well i took your advice i talked to the eyewitnesses and ive placed presley at the crime scene and i want leo marston not presley squeeze presley thats easier said than done stone laughs softly rays not very squeezable is he son of a bitch tried to kill us on the highway to jackson youre the agent who got shot at on highway portman and me if you can believe it the world would be a lot nicer place if presley had hit portman that day why goddamn it whats the big secret what was so terrible that hoover had to bury it under a national security seal whats portman hiding what could still scare you after thirty years do you really expect me to answer that youre damn right i do its time you listened to your conscience stone dont preach to me son you havent earned the right if ray presley shot at you why didnt he go to jail for it he did presley went to parchman for drug trafficking thats a state prison justice doesnt always happen in a straight line you should know that i grip the phone with exasperation ive thought of a way to go after marston without presleys help but its a gamble a big one i cant afford to be wrong what are you asking me counselor am i wrong about leo marston being behind the murder of del payton just as i decide stone is not going to answer he says youre not wrong a wave of triumph surges through me but that doesnt mean theres evidence lying around waiting to be picked up he adds i dont know how much id gamble on being able to prove it did you prove it in sixtyeight yes then why wasnt the son of a bitch prosecuted oldest reason in the world you just be damn sure about every step you take this road doesnt end where you think it does hold on why are you willing to warn me but not to help me i thought i just did good hunting counselor when i hang up caitlin grabs my arm her eyes furious why didnt you tell me someone tried to kill presley no one knew but my father and he asked me not to tell she takes a deep breath and expels it slowly what did stone say i glance around the dark parking lot searching for suspicious vehicles would i even see surveillance if it was there surely the fbi is better than that i pull caitlin to me and put my mouth to her ear she stiffens what are you doing stone says were probably under surveillance act like were lovers after a moment her arms slip around me and her breasts flatten against my chest but her eyes are anything but romantic weve got to go with my slander plan i whisper we dont have time for anything else and the more public this is the safer we are she slides her cheek past mine and answers in my ear i wont do that dont ask me to its the only way she pulls away from me her eyes bright take me back to my car you told me you wanted to shake up your fathers business not like that i have no right to put him in jeopardy that way we get into the car and i cross the highway to south you think marstons going to stand on ethics i ask her hed kill us in a second if he thought he had to she turns to me with a defiant look as far as i know the worst thing leo marston has ever done is sabotage your love life and thats not against the law the danger is real caitlin give me a break nobody killed woodward and bernstein they werent working in mississippi chapter einstein said the arrow of time flies in only one direction faulkner being from mississippi understood the matter differently he said the past is never dead its not even past all of us labor in webs spun long before we were born webs of heredity and environment of desire and consequence of history and eternity haunted by wrong turns and roads not taken we pursue images perceived as new but whose provenance dates to the dim dramas of childhood which are themselves but ripples of consequence echoing down the generations the quotidian demands of life distract from this resonance of images and events but some of us feel it always and who among us offered the chance would not relive the day or hour in which we first knew love or ecstasy or made a choice that forever altered our future negating a life we might have had such chances are rarely granted memory and grief prove faulkner right enough but einstein knew the finality of action if i cannot change what i had for lunch yesterday i certainly cannot unmake a marriage erase the betrayal of a friend or board a ship that left port twenty years ago and yet today i am granted such a chance livy marston does not call as she promised she would she shows up at our front door at nine am wearing faded levis and a white blouse tied at the waist sapphire earrings one shade darker than her eyes a silk scarf in her hair on the street behind her a midnight blue fiat spyder convertible idles like a resting cat im kidnapping you she says if its all right with annie it takes a moment to center myself in the present kidnaping me to where she smiles its a surprise if you thought about it youd know but dont think today is a rightbrain day five minutes after i clear it with mom and annie im clinging to the passenger door of the spyder as livy races up the highway cutting in and out of traffic like a grand prix driver she borrowed the car from a friend of her mothers and we both know why our senior year in high school after she received some honor or other livy was given a fiat convertible much like this one by her father the night they brought it back from the dealership in new orleans she and i drove across half the state with the top down drinking beer and reveling in the promise of futures unbound by visible limits we spent many of our best moments in that car and she has apparently decided to relive some of them ive fantasized about scenes like this more than once but there is something eerie about tearing up the sundrenched highway toward the edge of town twenty years after we did it the first time and in the same car as the spyder crosses the westbound bridge into louisiana maude marstons words echo in my mind you ruined my daughters life you bastard i want to ask livy outright what her mother was referring to but livy always had a way of being elliptical where serious matters were concerned what did you mean today is a rightbrain day i ask she laughs i mean today everything is off limits her voice has deepened slightly over the years everything except experience livy i have some questions you mean like why are my husband and i separated why did you and i really split up in college why did my father try to destroy yours yes little things like that well get to all that i have questions too but first we give ourselves a little of the past a little innocence she grants me a brilliant smile we owe ourselves that at the foot of the bridge she pulls into the parking lot of the liquor store we patronized during high school joking that its finally legal for us to shop here she goes inside and returns with two chilled bottles of pouilly fuisse handing them to me she takes a small ice chest from the trunk and sets it on the backseat inside i see french bread cheese grapes peeled shrimp and chocolate chip cookies she crosses the fourlane and whips the spyder onto deer park road the same route i drove yesterday with frank jones only livy takes the gently curving blacktop at ninety miles per hour she was always an excellent driver aggressive but in control when the road jumps onto the levee she has to slow to seventy but the wind still whips through our hair keeping the sun from frying us i serve her wine in a styrofoam cup and when she drinks the wine clings to the same fine golden down that dusted her upper lip when she was seventeen but she is not seventeen now and the questions hanging between us cannot be ignored she pulls a pair of raybans down from the visor and slips them on snapping me straight back to sarahs funeral i didnt notice livy at the church service but later at the graveside i saw her standing at the edge of the crowd a hauntingly beautiful apparition in a black dress and sunglasses unmistakable even after twenty years it meant a lot that you came to the funeral i say above the whine of the engine im sorry i couldnt do more than say hello she shakes her head and touches my arm i had to come and i didnt expect any more than that at the end of the levee she stops and we switch seats for the return leg somewhere in the middle of the empty cotton fields she intertwines the fingers of her left hand in my right i dont look at her but i feel a sudden tingling as though ive put my hand through a portal in time and felt a charge of energy pour through on some level acceding to this intimacy seems a betrayal of myself but it also presages a deeper connection one that might lead to meaningful conversation so i leave my hand in hers as we climb the eastbound bridge the cecil b de mille panorama of natchez rises above us as it did yesterday when i crossed the bridge with frank jones the whole grand stage seems laid out with such dramatic intent that i ask myself the question caitlin asked at our first meeting why havent i written about this place what are you thinking livy asks i thought questions were prohibited she ignores this remark i was thinking about this place the town the fact that it is a place with a unique identity atlanta is so sterile that i literally cant stand being in it sometimes ive felt the same thing in houston looking up from the bridge i see natchez as the tourist sees it the high bluff where sunworshiping natchez indians massacred the french soldiers of fort rosalie in where aaron burr was arrested as a traitor and set free to the cheers of crowds where an african prince labored twenty years as a slave where jefferson davis wedded varina howell in the halcyon days before the civil war but i see so much more i see the city livy marston captivated with a beauty and poise not seen since p t barnum brought jenny lind down the river in i see the thin edge of a universe of vibrant life and mysterious death of shadowy secrets and bright facades and of races inextricably bound by blood and tears geography and religion and above all time this is a good place to be from i murmur could you ever live here again livy asks in a strange voice i sense a deeper question beneath the one shes asked i dont know could you she doesnt take her eyes from the bluff from this place she left to conquer the world how does it look to her now not while my parents are alive she says so softly that im not sure she knows she spoke aloud before i can ponder what she meant she turns to me her eyes languid and says lets go to the cold hole the tingling in my hand spreads up my arm and across my neck and shoulders the cold hole one mile from the spot where my father and i sank the pistol i bought from ray presleyin the midst of that slimy sulfurous swampa cold spring bubbles up through the green water creating a pool as clear as arctic snowmelt it is the pool from my dream the one i had the night ike ransom first told me about leo marstons involvement in the payton murder the woman in my dream was livy marston and she sits beside me now asking me to take her to that pool only in the dream she had something to tell me today she says the past is off limits her presumption offends me the cold hole was the geographic center of our intimate life the name alone a talisman of spiritual and sexual exploration does she really believe that the passage of twenty years has somehow deactivated the mines that lie between us surely not but perhaps she feels that in that hidden place surrounded by our secret past we can speak of things too painful to broach anywhere else if thats what it takes to get her to solve the riddle of our truncated history im willing as i point the spyder south and let the motor out she lays her head back on the seat and smiles into the sky this is not the first time since my fathers trial that livy has tried to bridge the gulf it opened between us three years after she disappeared from natchez she was asked to be queen of the confederate pageant the apogee of social recognition by old natchez standards she was at uva then and everyone who was anyone waited on pins and needles to see whether she would accept no one had ever declined the invitation to be queen but all her life livy had vowed that if asked she would be the first that she would be asked was never in doubt her grandmother had been queen in the nineteenthirties her mother in the fifties and if livy accepted she would be the first thirdgeneration queen in history yet for years she had denigrated the confederate pageant the nightly highlight of the pilgrimage to natchezs antebellum mansions as a hobby for garden club ladies with nothing better to do a celebration of the old south without a trace of irony or racial awareness a lot of new natchez people thought she was mostly right and she earned points with them for flouting tradition so in the spring of my junior year when it was announced to great fanfare that livy marston had agreed to sacrifice two weeks of college to serve as queen i was stunned for nine nights she would preside over the very pageant she had scorned playing a generic scarlett ohara for those yankees and europeans who journeyed thousands of miles to see the old south reincarnated this was vintage livy marston the girl who liked to have things both ways the pilgrimage season sparkles with evening parties culminating in formal ballsthe queens and kingswhere liquor and champagne flow like water and guests spanning four generations dance deep into the night nowadays the kings and queens balls are often compressed into a single event a telling commentary on the reduced fortunes of the city but twenty years ago they were gatsbylike orgies of conspicuous consumption competitive arenas for the proud parents of young royalty livys ball was the grandest in recent memory and no one expected anything less i was not invited of course but my date was an old natchez girl with a wicked sense of humor and no great love for the marstons i initially declined her invitation but she finally convinced me that it would be a crime to skip such a historic display of excess fifteen hundred invitations were mailed and more than two thousand people chose to attend leo chartered a jet to fly livys sorority sisters down from uva a plane packed with tridelts thathad it crashedwould have sent the virginia marriage market into an irrecoverable tailspin ice sculptures were trucked down from memphis in refrigerated vans wondrous fantasy figures that melted so fast they drew solemn crowds of matrons who looked near tears that such extravagant beauty would be allowed to perish livy herself wore an eighteenthousanddollar gown handsewn by the woman who crafted the dresses for the mardi gras queens in new orleans it was made of candlelight silk white brocade and imported satin gathered tightly at the waist and spreading to a veritable landscape of snowy fabric embellished with alencon lace pearls iridescent paillettes and jewels and trailed by a sevenfoot threepaneled fan train to be carried by toddler pages during the pageant traditionally queens never wore their pageant dresses to the balls but livy marston as ever decided to make her own rules when she appeared in the entrance of the hotel ballroomescorted by the quarterback of the university of virginia football teama thousand women sighed together making a sound like a soft wind all i could think of was audrey hepburn at the head of the staircase in my fair lady a shimmering chrysalis transformed into the most beautiful creature in the world even when the ball began in earnest you could sense where livy was at all times a center of social gravity around which everyone whirled in attentive almost worshipful fascination my date and i danced at the periphery of the crowd she knew that were i to come face to face with leo marston so soon after the trial sparks would fly i occasionally glimpsed livy near me spinning in the arms of her quarterback or her father or passing in a glittering flock of tridelts but our eyes never met in the third hour of the ball she suddenly appeared at my shoulder touched my date on the arm and said may i borrow him for one dance i dont know why i went with her but i did livy led me off without even pretending to dance whisking me through the crowd as though pursued by paparazzi she stopped long enough to hug a sorority sister who giggled and glanced at me during a strange flurry of arms and handbags then livy pulled me on again nodding regally to anyone who tried to stop her floating through the tuxedos and storebought gowns like the daughter of a tsar in the winter palace suddenly we were outside moving along a row of blue doors in a brick alcove she stopped and pressed her lips to mine her eyes flashing in the dark she tasted like champagne when we pulled apart to breathe she said i cant believe you came my parents are livid before i could answer we were off again passing door after numbered door until she stopped and opened one with a key thats what she hugged her sorority sister for i thought as she pulled me inside the room that was the last coherent thought i had for some time livy sat on the edge of the bed and held me before her working at my belt then freed me with an exhalation of satisfaction and enclosed me again in an infinitely warmer place receiving this sort of attention from a woman wearing an eighteenthousanddollar gown is quite an experience enough to obliterate consciousness as i felt myself crossing the point of no return she drew back and said my turn then pulled me down to my knees kissed me lifted the jeweled hem of that dress and lay back on the bed her undergarments were surprisingly simple considering the dress worn over them and i removed them with a surreal sense of wonder she tasted as she always hadclean and copperyand climaxed almost instantly as though shed been poised on a cliff preparing for a long dive with only a slight push needed to send her over the ululations that escaped her throat drove me into a state of primitive arousal i reared up over her but she held me away and said no the dress while i stared in amazement she stood turned around and guided my fingers to an invisible line of eyelets that ran along her spine there must have been two hundred of them and each had to be unhooked before the dress would free her while i worked at the hooks livy reached back and worked at me and after a seeming eternity eighteen thousand dollars of leo marstons money hit the cheap hotel carpet with a haughty rustle she lifted the dress off the floor and laid it carefully across the table by the window then she stood before me with a pride i have seen in no other woman supremely secure elegant even without clothes the bitterness that had tortured our families was nowhere in her eyes there was only us she reached past me and pulled the coverlet off the bed then took both my hands and pulled me onto the sheet kissed me deeply and lay back pulling me across her i supported my weight on my arms and peered into her eyes which were wide open and glowing with desire she caressed my nipples with her fingers the hint of a smile on her lips when my breath went shallow she slid her hands down to my waist pulled me between her legs and whispered make love to me in that moment i became almost preternaturally aware of the ball in the next building missing its queen now the guests like hundreds of planets and moons whirling through space without their sun i could feel the anxiety of the quarterback the puzzlement of livys parents the confusion of her sorority sisters their sun was here in this dark room unclothed aroused wanting me but she didnt really not the way i wanted her to she wanted me yes but she also wanted virginia and her quarterback and her parents admiration and a thousand things besides she wanted me for those few minutes in that context while i filled some discomfiting space in the puzzle of how she saw herself in her sheltered little universe the first glimmer of this knowledge cut me to the bone despite all that had happened between our fathers i loved her i wanted her in the way most women dream of being wanted till death do us part she wanted me for the night the way id wanted girls before utterly and completely until my passion was spent and then not at all she wanted me to fill her with myself and by so doing make myself less she would own me then in a way without ever having to bother with me again she would nullify the past and move on she should have whispered fuck menot make love to mebecause that was what she meant this realization terrified me and it taught me more about what it was to be female than i would learn in all the rest of my life i cant i said looking down at her with secret horror she reached between us and squeezed the rigid evidence to the contrary pressed me against her sex her eyes triumphant for an instantfor the only time in my lifei felt the urge to rape to plunge inside her with all the violence i could muster and pound against her womb until she could stand no more but even that would have been her victory she would i suspect have enthusiastically endured my most violent onslaught reached a slightly more intense orgasm than usual and then subsumed my rage and sadness into her with my seed leaving her serene and content that is the superiority of a woman unencumbered by love i could do only one thing to save myself and i did it i climbed off of her and began to dress from the expression on her face i was the only man who had ever done this at least for any reason other than performance anxiety and i was doing it because i loved her she stared wordlessly at me unable to believe i was doing what her eyes told her i was even when i buttoned my tuxedo trousers and walked to the door what are you doing she asked finally her voice hoarse with confusion i couldnt see her clearly at that distance so i focused instead on the white dress which lay across the table like a fallen battle flag in the darkness an artifact of a secret engagement no one would ever record saving my soul i said what about my dress she asked hysteria creeping into her voice i cant put it on by myself youll think of something and she did she reappeared at the ball a half hour later looking no worse for wear and im certain that the uva quarterback got the lay of his life later that night without ever knowing why i didnt tell my date what had happened but when i took her home she kissed me fervently and pushed my hands into her dress i resisted at first but she pressed me against her until i gave in to the moment we spilled out of the car onto the grass and made love recklessly and fiercely beside her parents house until all i had withheld from livy sluiced from me in an annihilating rush i did not love that girl but that was all right she knew i didnt and she wanted me anyway where are you penn i blink myself to the reality of liberty road startled to find livy beside me her hand in mine she looks scarcely older than she did on the night of that ball nowhere good i reply steering the fiat around a hairpin turn this road was old when mississippi became a territory in and it has settled deep into the earth over the centuries the dirt banks rise higher than the car and in some places the limbs of oaks meet high above our heads what are you really doing in natchez livy asks i thought you said no questions she refills my styrofoam cup and passes it to me you dont have to answer if you dont want to annies having a tough time getting over sarahs death i couldnt help her my mother has already worked wonders with her i sweep around another turn passing a cement truck like its standing still what are you really doing here visiting my mother i told you that livy points to our right theres the turn i swing the spyder off the pavement and into deep gravel that quickly shallows to ruts as thick pine forest closes around us the next turns easy to miss she reminds me twenty years ago a dirt oilfield road led to the cold hole some lucky wildcatter hit a well not fifty yards from the pool and while this damaged the aesthetic of the place the pool itself remained pure and clear surrounded by a jungle of cypress trees dense fern and a carpet of lily pads it remained an essentially secret place where time and society held no sway summer after summer adolescents reenacted the eternal rites there clothed and naked drunk and sober but always defiantly totally alive a plank walkway led across the lily pads to the edge of the clear water and high in a tall cypress a diving platform had been built livy and i spent the most perfect day of our lives on that perch lost in each others eyes talking of god and time and other imponderables poised in that blessed state of awareness that has yet to comprehend its own mortality we were drinking white wine that day too but we also had one bottle of red the sun was so hot that we wanted to keep even the red cold to this end i climbed down the platform and swam to the bottom of the pool into the waving fronds so deep that my eardrums ached in the cold current welling up from the spring below i wedged the bottle tightly among the stems of the water plants then fought my way back to the surface and climbed up to the platform hours later when the sun began to fall we carefully negotiated our way back down to the water and i dove for the bottle of red that id cached at the bottom i could not find it livy joined me but we searched in vain though we stayed until night descended over the swamp and snakes and alligators became a real concern many times since ive thought of that bottle once i even considered donning scuba gear to salvage it so that i could ship it to livy as a gift im pretty sure i conceived this madness on the night i heard she was getting married im not much for symbolism but that unopened bottle of red wine fills the bill if ever anything did inside it is a road unwalked a life unlived and today i suspect livy means to find it an impossible task probably but impossible is a word she never paid much attention to her attitude is simple where livy marston goes the rules do not apply stop she cries i think you passed it i hit the brakes skid a few yards through the gravel then back up until livy says stop an autumnal sadness suffuses me when i see the overgrown track a desolate path through the trees that none would take but a killer looking for a place to dump his victim pull in orders livy i nose the spyder into the trees and she climbs out without opening the door and starts through the waisthigh weeds i put up the top of the convertible as quickly as i can and follow five minutes hard walking brings us to the edge of the swamp the old pumping unit is still here its great black arm frozen in place like a broken limb the oilbearing sands beneath the swamp long since depleted the smell of stale crude permeates the air and the cypress trees have no tops casualties of salt water leaking from the well the swamp itself is a scummy greenishbrown swarming with breeding mosquitoes and obscured by a headhigh wall of swamp grass our enchanted pool is gone well i say philosophically i guess its true what you cant go home again livy stares at the mess as though willing it back to its former beauty i stand mute waiting for her to face reality but she wont why should she reality never stopped her before she strips off her shirt and jeans revealing a white onepiece bathing suit underneath then she hops onto a fallen tree that angles off through the hissing grass and walks like a gymnast down the rotting trunk i call out for her to stop but she pays no attention i have little choice but to follow when i get to the end of the trunk i find myself stranded in a snaky morass with livy nowhere in sight penn she calls from a jungle of foliage to my left come here where are you theres a stump just below the surface of the water that will take you to the next trunk sighting the halfsubmerged stump i leap onto it catching myself just before i tumble headfirst into the slime from here i can jump to the next fallen tree landing on the end of that one i find myself peering down a green tunnel of leaves livy stands at the other end a motionless figure silhouetted by dazzling sunlight her body is still remarkable not in the willowy way of a model or the lush way of a pinup girl but somewhere in between her breasts are small but beautifully shaped her wrists and ankles slim her hands graceful yet the predominant impression she projects is of strength she could be artemis more at home in the forest than among people in this moment i cannot imagine her in a courtroom here she beckons stretching out her hand her voice laced with mystery i teeter out to the end of the trunk like a drunken riveter working high steel then perform the tightly pleasant maneuver of edging around livy she holds my waist from behind and whispers oh ye of little faith the cold hole sparkles like a diamond on brown velvet a pristine world in the midst of decay the swamp must have risen over the years its edge creeping ever nearer the oil well but our springfed pool is where it always was you just have to work a little harder to find it livy points high into the trees and i follow her line of sight even the diving platform has survived though damaged by the growth of the cypress once we spent hours kissing and touching each other up there quivering like dryads in the high branches without warning livy dives off the tree trunk and swims to the foot of the ladder she climbs four planks high then turns and motions for me to follow i strip to my underwear and dive after her the climb requires the negotiation of many rotten and missing steps but before long we are perched forty feet above the water breathing hard and laughing from here the pool looks translucent bottomless like a hole in the floor of the world do you think its still there she asks it cant be the pool is storms the current from the spring that bottle could be a mile away by now she shakes her head its down there in the mud and the plants and im going to find it livy before i can argue she arcs down to the pool like a falling arrow lands dead center with scarcely a splash and surfaces laughing she waves and submerges again i consider going down to help her but i dont think she wants that she wants to prove to me that she can find the bottle alone she searches with systematic diligence diving to the bottom and probing the mud and plants in ever widening circles surfacing for air then diving again her movements supple and efficient its like watching a japanese pearl diver except that livy looks as unlike a japanese woman as one can get she is archetypally westernaryan evenlike a hawk that has plummeted a thousand feet to penetrate the water and seize its prey after fifty minutes by my watch she surfaces and begins treading water her face lifted to mine i cant find it i hold up my hands in commiseration and call down to her it doesnt matter you cant resurrect the past with a bottle of wine she gives me an insouciant smile and dives again so deeply that i lose sight of her when she surfaces she is at the edge of the pool holding something in her hand not the wine her bathing suit she drapes the white lycra over a cypress knee then with a graceful roll pushes away from the stump and floating effortlessly on her back drifts to the center of the pool this vision is more potent than any wine it is my dream made flesh livys hair floating in a corona around her face her arms loose at her sides her breasts little rosetipped islands her abdomen a submerged reef stretching to the rise of her pubis with its twist of burnished gold the sight of her heats the backs of my eyes as i gaze down she raises a hand to block the sun and calls out dont you swim anymore i scoot to the edge of the platform and drop forty feet through space plunging deep into the pool when i float to the surface i find livy treading water beside me she splashes me playfully and says i really thought i could find it even if you had it wouldnt make things like they were before we have to talk about what happened she looks off through the silver cypress trunks i cant not yet she stops treading and lies back half floating gazing into the hazy blue sky ive thought about that bottle sometimes over the years me too during low times four oclock in the morning wondering if i ever made a single right choice in my life she seems amused by this not me i thought about it during good times or times that were supposed to be good i thought about it on my wedding night your wedding night she turns her head slightly watching me as she floats there i was supposed to feel some profound completion as a woman and all i could think was that i was closing off forever an option id always thought i had and you did her eyes narrow you hadnt exactly made me feel wanted the last time wed seen each other i look away unwilling to explain my actions on the night of the ball without reciprocal explanations from her we should have drunk that bottle twenty years ago she says the extra time it would have taken might have changed everything that came after i shake my head unwilling to grant her this easy revision of history then i wouldnt have annie for a moment she looks as though she might make some cruel remark but her face softens i didnt mean it like that were here now im not complaining she brings herself upright in the water flips a wet strand of hair from her eyes then reaches out and touches my nose will you do one thing what kiss me livy has given me nothing that i need not a single answer but i want to kiss her between the fatigue of treading cold water and the proximity of her naked body i feel as though every capillary in my skin has dilated magnifying sensation she swims closer and slips a hand behind my neck i lean forward and press my lips to hers gently at first then harder in response to her passion treading water is impossible now i take a quick breath through my nose as we slide beneath the surface undulating in the slow current of the spring time is the oxygen remaining in our lungs and blood but there is enough to remember her taste the pressure of her breasts against me as we sink like a single creature an incarnation of salt water only slightly denser than the fluid surrounding us as my chest begins to burn i feel the soft roughness between her legs pressing against my thigh seeking more complete union and i swell with unthinking eagerness then my lungs betray me sending me fighting toward the shimmering surface i smash through gasping for air resenting the fact that i need it livy gently breaks the surface beside me her neck and shoulders flushed the color of broken seashells she pulls back her hair then treads easily as her clear blue eyes search mine i want you inside me i shake my head i love you penn i always have i just didnt have the courage to choose you her words are like needles thrust into my heart triggering emotions too intense to withstand much less interpret caitlins warning on the plane sounds in my head she could really mess you up you dont have any right to say that livy i know i wont say it again but i had to let you know i roll away from her and swim back to the fallen tree that leads to the shore as i climb onto it i turn and see her perched on the cypress knee where she left her bathing suit slipping on the white lycra as gracefully as she does everything else where next she calls across the water making no attempt to cover herself i think its time we got back home but the days not half over i need to check on annie she nods somberly i understand i turn and make my way carefully along the slippery log for any other woman i would wait but livy marston can take care of herself as i swing the fiat back onto highway i realize with a dull shock that guilt is not among the torrent of emotions rushing through me a moments thought tells me why my past with livy predates my life with sarah intimacy with livy is not a new experience its like walking through a checkpoint to a country i visited long ago and to which i now return older and hopefullywiser she doesnt speak as the spyder thrums northward in the afternoon sun but i feel her eyes upon me trying to penetrate my thoughts what really brought her back to natchez caitlins belief that livy has returned to persuade me to leave her father alone is not impossible but livy would not declare her love for such a cynical reason that is the one gift shes reserved through the years if indeed she has given love to anyone she certainly must have said the words more than a few times probably while trying to believe them herself but why did she want this reprise of a perfect day twenty years past and why does she think she loves me is it some strange analogue of a man wanting to marry the only girl who wouldnt sleep with him as we pass st stephens preparatory school and join the traffic heading into town livy touches my knee and says after you check on annie lets do something else we still have our picnic her voice is calm enough but i sense anxiety beneath it she is reluctant to let this day end tomorrow things will not be so simple its one thing to pretend for a few hours that we can evade the past as this town somehow evades the future but it will be quite another when i insist on asking the questions she didnt want to hear today and what will happen after i tell the world that her father ordered the murder of delano payton when i commence my campaign of attrition against him how will she feel then i think weve done a lot to think about already i say evenly she bites her lower lip and looks away the whine of a siren overtakes us from behind and i glance at the rearview mirror traffic is parting on the highway behind us were at the turn for my parents neighborhood so i swing right off the bypass clearing the way penn livy says her voice tinged with fear look a column of gray smoke is roiling out of the treetops in the distance penn thats a fire i hit the accelerator hard knowing that a neighbor could be in trouble most of them are older now and it doesnt matter whose house it is ive probably known the family all my life where is it she asks her voice tight close to my parents i press harder on the gas roaring up the street with every yard becoming more afraid of something my brain does not want to consider it couldnt be our house burning it couldnt be fifty yards from the corner i see that it is chapter i drive the fiat right into the yard where my mother stands with annie and a dozen neighbors all pointing helplessly at the burning house all in various stages of shock i jump out of the car run to my mother and take annie from her arms daddy the house is on fire she cries more amazed than frightened the fire engines right behind me i tell mom is everybody okay she grabs my arms her eyes wide with terror rubys in there we heard a boom and then smelled smoke when we saw the flames we ran but ruby fell penn i think she broke her hip i couldnt drag her out i brought annie out and by then it was too bad to get back in but that offduty policemanofficer ervinhe went in anyway he went after ruby but he never came out how long ago was this my mother is close to hyperventilating i put my hands on her shoulders and squeeze hard enough for her to feel pain five minutes maybe more i dont know as i stare at the house a runner of flame races up the roof shingles thats no kitchen fire the whole house is burning the house i grew up in where was ruby when she fell by the back bathroom theres no exterior door anywhere near that bathroom and going through the front door would be suicide i wouldnt even make it to the bedrooms before being overcome by smoke i hug annie and pass her to mom then kiss them both when the firemen get here tell them to look for ervin my mother blanches penn you cant go in there im not leaving ruby in there to die livy grabs my arm from behind penn its too late wait for the fire truck i yank my arm free and sprint toward the garage before either of them can say more in the garage i grab a shovel then race around to the back of the house as i near it i begin smashing windows trying to give the trapped smoke as many outlets as possible i may be feeding oxygen to the blaze but if i dont get some smoke out of there ill never reach ruby alive the back bathroom has no window but the adjacent bedroom does a high horizontal one about five feet wide and eighteen inches tall i smash the glass with the shovel and stand back as thick gray smoke explodes through the opening after thirty seconds the plume thins a little and i put my hand through the window the heat is intense but when i stand on tiptoe and put my face to the opening i see no flames taking off my shirt i soak it in water at the outdoor faucet then tie it around my face i am scraping the window sill clean of glass shards when the scream comes the sound is an alloy of animal terror and human agony a childs wail from the throat of an eightyyearold woman an eightyyearold woman who showed me more love and kindness than anyone but my mother i feel like someone stuck my fingers into a volt socket ruby ruby its penn im coming to get you hooking both hands over the sill i swing my right leg up into the window and pull myself into the frame the smoke that looked thin from outside instantly scorches my eyes throat and lungs breathing is pointless until i get my face down to the floor i roll off the window frame and drop to the carpet theres air here but the smoke is still too thick to see through before i lose my nerve i shut my eyes and crawl around the bed toward the door that leads to the hallway if i hadnt lived in this house for fourteen yearsand stayed here for the past few nightsi wouldnt have a chance of finding ruby thats why officer ervin didnt get out hes probably lying unconscious in the hall if he even made it past the den furniture at the doorway i pause and shout again ruby rubeee all i hear is a living roar the sound of fire devouring wood and carpet curtains and glass photos and china silver and books books my fathers library is burning if ruby was not somewhere in this house i would probably risk my life to save those books the bathroom i remember ruby fell by the bathroom thankfully the heat is more intense to my right toward the central hall i put my nose to the carpet take a breath and crawl to my left toward the bathroom its two rooms really a narrow dressing room and linen closet with the commode and bathtub in a smaller cubicle beyond i go through the door on my belly groping forward like a soldier clearing a minefield the dressing room is empty as i crawl toward the commode my nostrils start to whistle with each breath panic ambushes me like a wild thing tearing around in my chest maybe ruby isnt here at all maybe ervin got her out maybe the scream i heard was the sound she made as he dragged her out i cant search the whole house thats how firemen get killed trying to save people who arent there i grope around the commode and inside the bathtub then scramble back to the bathroom door the roar is closer ruby its penn are you here at first there is only the roar then a whimper floats out of the noise like a leaf from a bonfire it came from the central hall my lungs feel near to bursting but i alligator along the carpet toward the corner my eyes shut tight the heat is nearly unendurable forcing my stinging eyes open i look down the hall dancing tongues of red and orange caper out of the black smoke like laughing demons primal terror seizes my muscles paralyzing me long enough to fully comprehend the danger then my reptile brain shrieks death run but i dont run i cant when i was six years old a german shepherd got out of a neighbors backyard and trapped me in a corner of our carport that dog weighed ninety pounds and when it bared its teeth and lunged at my face all i could do was throw up my arms when its teeth ripped into my flesh i was too panicstricken even to yell for help after a seeming eternity of gnashing teeth and blood i heard a sound like a hatchet hitting a watermelon and saw a black woman as tall as our house swinging a shovel like a broadsword bludgeoning that monstrous animal within an inch of its life ruby flowers was terrified of dogs but when she saw her baby in danger she pressed down her fear and charged out of our house like the wrath of god fixing that image in my mind i shut my eyes and crawl toward the flames the frantic reptile voice whispers that the orange demons are flanking me racing across the roof to close off my escape but i hold rubys face in my mind keep inching forward my hand touches flesh bone an ankle the smell of cooked meat fills my nose and lungs and i vomit up the wine i drank with livy retching in the darkness i take hold of the ankle and pull with all my strength something gives and ruby screams at least shes alive a broken hip can kill an old woman but not as quickly as fire switching ankles i pull with both hands dragging her far enough to get clear of the flames shes moaning now the sound like that of a wounded animal i press my nose to the floor take another breath of smoke then get to my knees and heave her over my shoulder as i struggle to my feet dizziness pitches me against the wall but somehow i right myself and stagger back toward the bedrooms the smoke is dense here too but at the center of it is a dim cool flicker of blue i lean toward that blueness trying to keep ruby on my shoulder as i go forward move your feet i yell silently move its as though my nerve fibers are shorting out one by one attenuating the signals firing from my brain again the stench of scorched meat gags me but im almost to the light with a last heave i lift ruby onto the windowsill and hold her there i dont want to drop her but i can barely stand much less lower her the six feet to the ground suddenly two bright yellow gloves appear and pull her from my grasp male voices are shouting through the window but i cant make out the words the world outside the window seems part of some other universe more yellow hands reach out of the brightness reaching for me but they are too far away i am falling the sun is in my eyes and the skin of my face is burning a teenager wearing a black firemans hat is holding something over my mouth and nose and something like cool ambrosia is laving the burning walls of my lungs i try to suck in more of it but the effort triggers a coughing fit great wracking spasms like blades tearing at my ribs and trachea as smoke pours from my nose and throat penn im here says a womans voice mom livy i see her face beside the firemans now her hair still damp from the cold hole she takes my hand and squeezes gently ruby i ask shes right over there look to your left as i turn i see two paramedics rolling a gurney across the lawn a third is holding an iv bag at shoulder level as it drains fluid into rubys arm i want to see her i croak rolling over and getting to my knees easy sir says the fireman youve been through a little hell in the past few minutes hes not really a teenager hes probably in his midtwenties with a thin blond mustache and a hank of straight hair spilling from under his helmet the cop i ask recalling officer ervins droopy beagle eyes the cop who went in after her we got him out take it easy im okay really livy slides under my right arm as i get to my feet supporting me with surprising strength ive never felt so jittery in my life all my muscles are quivering and jerking as though exhausted by an overexpenditure of adrenaline and my heart is laboring noticeably in my chest the library i remember my dads books livy shakes her head its too late the whole house is going up its a miracle you got out alive thats a fact says the fireman we pulled you out just as the flames came through the bedroom door thank you i know i could have died in there he smiles and gives me a salute you done pretty good yourself buddy with livys help i make my way around to the front yard it looks as though every neighbor for a square mile has come to watch the fire the crowd fills the surrounding yards and much of the street two fire trucks have their hoses trained on the house and a third on the old oak with the creeper vine my mother runs up to me her face ashen penn i cant find annie i jerk erect and shake my head clear where did you see her last after you went in it was taking so longi was looking for you i just put her down for a second how long ago three or four minutes the area is so choked with people that annie could be ten feet away and wed still miss her the only thing in our favor is that we know most of the people in the crowd within five minutes everyone on the street is looking for her as i run shirtless through the throng fighting down panic all i can think is that this fire was no accident the boom my mother heard had to be some kind of fire bomb this whole disaster was staged to draw the attention of the cop watching the house and it did officer ervin bravely charged into the inferno to save rubys life and in the process left my mother and daughter unprotected my similar effort completed the kidnappers work by breaking my mothers concentration after five minutes of searching in vain i realize i have to call the police i prosecuted several kidnaping cases in houston and i learned one thing from the fbi agents who worked them the first hour is the best chance of finding the victim and every lost minute can mean disaster as i run across the street to use our neighbors phone a ripple of noise like the roar at a football stadium rolls through the crowd i turn back to our house expecting to see the roof collapsing the spectacular climax of residential fires but its not the roof the crowd parts like the red sea and my mother comes running through the open space shes carrying annie in her arms relief surges through me with such force that i nearly faint for the second time but i run forward and hug them both as tightly as i dare annies face is white with terror and her chin is quivering someone dropped her off at edna hensleys mom gasps edna answered her door and saw annie standing there crying a heavyset bluehaired woman i faintly recognize has appeared behind my mother wheezing from her exertions edna hensley where do you live i ask her about a half mile away youve been there before penn when you were a little boy who dropped her off edna shakes her head i didnt see anyone not a car not anything her gaze darkens she reaches into her pocket pulls out a folded sheet of construction paper and hands it to me i unfold the paper with shaking hands printed on it in magic marker are the words this is how easy it is lay off asshole livy braces me from the side making sure i keep my feet i am back in houston watching arthur lee hanrattys brother carry annie out of the house a tiny bundle about to disappear forever its as though i missed him that night and he has returned to try again but he cant hes been dead for four years his youngest brother is alive but this isnt his work whoever kidnapped annie today could easily have killed her and the last surviving hanratty would have done so taking his revenge for his two brothers this is something else entirely this is a warning this is the del payton case mom take this piece of paper to the lewises house and put it in a ziploc bag ill take care of annie she is reluctant to go but she does i thank edna hensley then carry annie through the crowd to livys borrowed fiat and sit in the passenger seat hugging her against me rocking slowly murmuring reassurances in her ear she is still shivering and her skin is frighteningly cold i need to find out everything she can remember about her kidnapper before she starts blocking out the trauma but i dont want to upset her any more than she already is annie i whisper lifting her away from me enough to look into her hazel eyes its daddy punkin tears spill down her cheeks everythings all right now i love you punkin she opens her mouth to speak but her quivering chin ruins the words before they emerge honey who took you to the ladys house did you see she nods hesitantly who was it did you know them fuh fire fire man she stammers fire man a fireman with a red hat she shakes her head a black and yellow hat thats good punkin he was just making sure you were all right did you see his face he had a mask like a swimming mask a respirator thats good did he say anything to you he said he had to get me away get me safe thats right thats right he was just getting you away from the fire everythings fine now her face seems to crumple in on itself daddy im scared i crush her to my chest as though to protect her from the threat that has already passed i love you punkin i love you she shudders against me i said i love you punkin i pull her back and look into her eyes waiting i love you more she says softly completing our ritual and my anxiety lessens a little livy climbs into the drivers seat squeezes annies shoulder then takes her silk scarf from the glove compartment and begins wiping soot from my face where do you want to go she asks lets just sit for a minute do you think its safe here your mom told me about the note instead of answering her question i lift the fiats cell phone call information and ask for the number of ray presley livy takes her hand from my knee and watches me with apprehension presleys phone rings twenty times no one answers is he there she asks in a quiet voice no her face is strangely slack penn why did you call ray presley theres no time to go into it now penn where are you son its my father over here dad livy looks back over the trunk of the convertible hes seen us hes coming olivia dad cries rushing up to the car are you all right im fine its penn and annie who need help im so sorry about this dr cage its just unbelievable dad leans over the passenger door and hugs annie and me annie keeps her head buried in my neck is she all right i think so considering what just happened somebody i already heard the storys spreading like he laughs bitterly like wildfire wheres your mother i told her to go across the street and put the note in a ziploc there might be fingerprints i reach up and take his hand i should have listened to you you told me theyd stoop this low he squeezes my hand hard its just a house well build another one i was crazy to get involved in this case he shakes his head his eyes on the great column of smoke rising into the sky gutless sons of bitches laid hands on my granddaughter if i find the man who did this ill flay him alive do you know anything about rubys condition he sighs heavily they carried her to st catherines hospital peter carellis in the er with her now it doesnt look good massive thirddegree burns a broken hip the helicopters on its way from jackson im about to go over there well follow you as soon as mom gets back he nods absently watching the water pour onto the ruin that sheltered our family for thirtyfive years dad the library i know no point thinking about it now right now we worry about the living he looks down at me his eyes flinty and cold this is the crossroads son we back off or we go forward its your call ill back you either way go forward after this lets just find mom and get to the hospital he nods ill see you there the treatment room in the er is crowded but quiet the muted beeps of monitors punctuate the hushed voices like metronomes ruby lies at the center of the room a technological still life surrounded by doctors nurses a respiratory therapist and my father i move closer straightening the scrub shirt a nurse brought me to replace the shirt i lost in the fire two largebore iv lines are pouring fluids into rubys arms and oxygen is being pumped into her lungs through a mask her mostly nude body is exposed to the air the parts ravaged by fireher right arm shoulder trunk and both legsbathed in silvadene ointment she was apparently wearing some sort of synthetic dress that caught fire and melted into her skin the helicopter ambulance summoned from jackson is under orders to whisk her to the burn center in greenville as soon as it arrives but my father doubts shell survive to make the flight let my son in here dad says and the white coats part for me my first reaction is horror rubys dentures have been removed and this makes her face look like a sunken death mask her black wig is also gone leaving a thin snowy frizz atop her head her eyes are closed her respiration labored she looks like a dying woman photographed in some plaguestricken african village is she conscious she was until a minute ago dad replies shes in and out now mostly out in her condition its a blessing one of rubys hands is undamaged and i move around the table and take it squeezing softly did mom talk to her a little ruby had a panic attack and peggy calmed her down the thought of ruby in terror makes it difficult for me to breathe as i look down at her her lips tremble then move with purpose shes trying to speak but what comes from behind the mask is only a ragged passage of air i lean closer and speak into her ear ruby its penn ruby i hear you at last the rasps forms words fine blessing you give a fine blessing dr cage you go on go on now a chill races over my neck and arms dad i think she wants you to say something religious shes obtunded son she doesnt really know what shes saying she knows she wants you to say something over her my father looks around at the ring of expectant faces jesus i dont remember much anything it doesnt matter he takes rubys hand and leans over her ruby this is dr cage tom by god though you refused to call me that for thirtyfive years he chuckles softly youre the only one in the world who could get me reciting from the bible havent done it since i was a boy rubys lips move again but no sound emerges the lord is my shepherd dad says quietly i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me he dad stops and picks up further on yea though i walk through the shadow of through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thy he looks over at me damn it whats the rest of it i lean down beside rubys ear and continue for him thou preparest a table for me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and i shall dwell in the house of the lord forever ruby has stopped trying to speak her face is placid dad lays a hand on my shoulder well between us we managed it shes got two atheists praying over her pretty pathetic i guess it was good enough looking around i notice expressions of shock and awe on the faces of the assembled doctors and nurses whats the matter theyve never seen me do anything like that before shes trying to speak says a nurse rubys jaw is quivering with effort her wrinkled toothless mouth opening and closing behind the mask like that of a landed fish dad and i lean over her and strain to hear at first there is only a lisping sound then three words coalesce from the shapeless sounds thank you tom rubys eyes flutter open revealing big brown irises full of awareness she seems to see not only us but beyond us i suppose this is the look of faith lord jesus she says as clearly as if she were talking to me across the breakfast table ruby going home today home to glory seconds later her eyes close and the monitors that were so muted before begin clanging alarms shes coding dad says crash cart cries one of the other doctors a hurricane of activity erupts around us everyone rushing to his appointed task cardiac arrest dad says in a calm voice tom says dr carelli a lean dark man in his late forties clear tom dad holds up his right hand everyone listen to me this case is dnr the alarms go on ringing with relentless insistence do you know that for a fact asks carelli standing anxiously over the cart with a laryngoscope in his hand tom you know the rules this woman is eighty years old shes got thirddegree burns over sixty percent of her body and a broken hip tom for a dnr we need it on paper she also has carcinoma of the lung dad says softly no one knows that but me theres nothing on paper but shes discussed it with me on several occasions no extraordinary measures do not resuscitate turn off those alarms the whole apparatus of technology stands poised on the edge of action and my father has ordered it to stand down tom are you sure asks carelli i take full responsibility turn off those goddamned alarms one by one the alarms go off dad looks at me his eyes weary go on out penn check on annie and your mother you dont want to see this not until shes gone he nods slowly all right he turns to the assembled staff thanks for the effort everybody wed like to be alone with her i squeeze rubys good hand kiss her forehead and wait for the end looking at this ravaged shell of a woman i find it hard to believe that she was the towering figure who saved me from that german shepherd but she was she is as the last nurse files out the drumbeat of rotor blades descends over the hospital announcing the helicopter that will return to jackson without its scheduled passenger ruby flowers is leaving natchez by another route our family has gathered in the small chapel provided by the hospital for patients and their families its a small dim room with electric candles two pews an altar and some new bibles full of undistinguished prose im not a believer myself but in time of death you can do a lot worse than the king james bible for comfort my mother is praying quietly at the altar dad sits beside me in the front pew with annie on his lap this is the first time we have been together in anything like a church since sarahs funeral my older sister was with us for that but shes been teaching in ireland ever since today was a good day to be there and not here i have never seen my father this angry not even during the malpractice trial he is by nature a gentle and eventempered man and his medical experience has taught him to be calmer as situations deteriorate but right this minute he has blood in his eye and i understand the feeling if i knew with certainty that ray presley set that fire or that leo marston had ordered it i would shoot them both without a second thought mom rises to her feet then walks over and takes annie from dad wed better check into a motel she says and we need to think about getting some clothes im sure everything is ruined the insurance will cover most of it dad replies the police are waiting to talk to me in the er mom looks at him and shakes her head the things i cared about in that house no insurance can replace i know that peggy mom im sorry i say uselessly i know this happened because of me she reaches out with her free hand and squeezes my arm lets just get checked in somewhere we need to take care of this little girl dad follows her to the door then shuts it and comes back to me were going to need some protection son real protection offduty cops arent up to this who do we call i know some people in houston serious people an international security company ill call the ceo right now i want them here tonight i dont care what it costs theyll be here and im paying he sighs and looks at the altar who do you think set that fire first guess ray presley i called his trailer while the house was burning he wasnt home could he have managed it after that poisoning attempt after his heart attack or whatever dad nods physically he could do it hes a lot more able than i am what about marston leo marston knows everything that goes on in this town he wouldnt dirty his hands with the actual deed but hed order someone to do it i hate to think ray would go that far kidnapping annie my god what do you want to do lets get settled somewhere first get the security in place then well talk about it he opens the chapel door and nearly walks over livy whos standing in the hall she backs up so that we can exit and as we do i see my mother and annie waiting at the end of the hall by the wide er doors tell me what i can do livy says your mother said youre going to a motel for now we need to get annie settled she suddenly the er doors swing open and caitlin masters runs up the corridor with a camera swinging around her neck and her black hair flying behind her i just came from your house she says penn im so sorry caitlin i need to talk you and your father right now what is it she looks at livy could you excuse us for a moment mrs sutter livy bristles and looks at me expecting me to tell caitlin she can stay why dont we go in the chapel i suggest well just be a minute livy livy starts to say something to caitlin but doesnt instead she bites her bottom lip and watches us walk into the chapel caitlins energy is like a flame inside the little room she cant remain still and her eyes simmer with anger someone kidnapped annie she asks is that right yes and they brought her back with a warning note yes the same person who set the fire almost certainly okay okay she nods furiously then paces out a tight circle thats all i wanted to know caitlin whats going on why are you so worked up ill print the story the story about the fire she blinks in confusion the fire hell no the slander marston being behind the payton murder you say it ill print it in type big enough to give him a coronary over breakfast i simply stare at her maybe thats the answer dad says last night we thought it was last night you had a house i remind him what changed your mind caitlin stops pacing and looks me dead in the eye annie for one thing this girl is good people dad says squeezing her shoulder for another my instincts have started humming dont ask me why because i dont know maybe because this happened two days after we went to see stone and stone says marston was behind paytons death maybe because john portman threatened you and we know he worked the payton case in sixtyeight and we know marston and j edgar hoover were friends maybe its because i get a funny vibe from marstons daughter all i know is that im not sitting still while these bastards go after people i care about they want to play hardball theyre going to get the game of their goddamn lives my father looks like he wants to kiss her what time is your deadline i ask just call me after you guys get settled somewhere ill come to you i dont know what to say just thank you when we leave the chapel caitlin walks past livy without a word she hugs my mother by the er doors kisses annie then slips through the doors and disappears livy keeps pace with dad and me as we walk down the hall and join my mother and annie where do you think we should go tom mom asks the prentiss motel is right up on the highway lets stay there tonight well worry about the long term tomorrow as dad opens the er doors mom follows him through with annie on her hip leaving livy and me alone on this side the awkwardness between us is palpable two hours ago we were in each others arms now what can i do she asks ill help with annie go out for food whatever you need i think it better just be family tonight i say gently thanks for offering though thanks for today too her eyes cloud with frustration and confusion penn for gods sake whats happening here maybe you should ask your father chapter when the examiner hit the driveways at four this morning it polarized the town caitlins words entered the public consciousness like electrodes dipped into water ionizing opinion to positive or negative with no neutral between the opinions predictable in most cases by the simple indicator of skin color the process took about three hours from the time the insomniacs farmers and shift workers walked outside to read the front page by street lamp until the last washington street matrons toddled downstairs to read what the maid had laid out beside their morning coffee by seven am telephones were ringing all over town and by eight every conversation from the sewer ditches and oil fields to the paper mill and the hospitals was centered on two men leo marston and penn cage my only contributions to caitlins story were the actual accusations against marston slander per se if i ever heard it of course my slanderous charges became libel per semeaning that the libeled party would not have to prove damagesthe moment caitlin printed and distributed them my phrases preserved for the ages ran as follows there is no doubt that delano payton was murdered on may it is just as certain that former state attorney general leo marston known locally as judge marston because of his stint on the state supreme court was the man behind the conspiracy that resulted in paytons murder under mississippi law that makes marston as guilty of murder as the man who planted the bomb murder by explosive device is a capital crime in this state and there is no statute of limitations i urge the local district attorney to reopen the payton case if he does he will quickly find enough proof to send leo marston to death row at parchman asked by the publisher to describe the evidence on which i based my accusations i stated i am in contact with certain members of the justice department who have long known of marstons involvement in the crime conscientious citizens and law enforcement officers have also come forward with previously unknown facts about the payton murder i believe we would already have seen a prosecution of judge marston but for the fact that john portman the present director of the fbi and a former federal judge was involved in the original payton investigation in some former fbi agents believe the bureau itself may have been involved in a coverup of certain facts of paytons death but this will be difficult to prove without the original fbi file on the payton case which is sealed until the year ostensibly for reasons of national security i was purposefully vague about marstons possible motives for the crime but on caitlins advice i hinted that marston heretofore considered a moderate on race might secretly have been working in concert with members of the mississippi sovereignty commission to prevent black workers from rising into white jobs because of my reference to john portman the wire services picked up the story before noon and just before one caitlin received a call from cnn in atlanta there were already two network stringers in town to cover the blackwhite mayoral election and they spent the morning outside my familys motel rooms pleading for comment on the story but the morning paper had far more tragic consequences caitlin had written a separate piece about the fire and kidnaping in it she vividly described the rescues of ruby flowers and officer ervin and also rubys death in the er she quoted several citizens on rubys character in particular the pastor of the mandamus baptist church of which ruby had been a devoted member she also quoted the fire chief who pronounced the fire arson based on the discovery of an incendiary device in the collapsed attic of our house caitlin concluded by saying that the arson and kidnaping were clearly attempts to stop my investigation into the delano payton murder it was yellow journalism at its finest and the consequences were immediate at a little after one a seventyfouryearold white man named billy earl whitestone walked down his sidewalk to get his mail from the box he got both barrels of a twelvegauge shotgun instead fired from a red monte carlo driven by two unidentified black youths the gunmen stopped long enough to drop a copy of the examiner on mr whitestones shattered skull but even if they hadnt the shooting would have been recognized as a reprisal for rubys death in his younger days billy earl whitestone had achieved national notoriety as a grand wizard of the white knights of the imperial ku klux klan he had also enjoyed a brief renaissance of fame during the s when wallacelike he marched at the head of some black civil rights parades but apparently this belated conversion had not sufficiently impressed certain members of the africanamerican community at least not the two young men in the monte carlo a driveby shooting in natchez is the equivalent of a race riot in los angeles within the hour mayor warren went on the local country radio station to appeal for calm and to condemn the reckless and irresponsible charges made against one of the citys finest citizens by former natchezian penn cage he also blasted the yankee editor of the local newspaper shad johnson also took to the airwavesthe black am stationto urge restraint in the face of the deteriorating racial situation unlike wiley warren shad urged the city authorities to look into the charges printed in the morning paper and if they were found to be substantive to reopen the investigation into del paytons murder despite his wish that the payton murder remain a nonissue shad could not in the aftermath of the fire and shooting afford to be seen as anything but a champion of the black community his core of electoral support three hours after whitestones death i was invited to the police station to discuss the statements id made in the newspaper particularly my reference to local law enforcement officers the police chief conducted the interview and he seemed to labor under the misapprehension that i was subject to arrest if i didnt answer his questions i calmly and courteously enumerated my rights under the constitution then explained that i had first contacted the district attorney about my suspicions and found him apathetic i refused to answer any questions and suggested that the chief talk to austin mackey instead as i departed he told me he considered the death of billy earl whitestone my responsibility and i didnt argue he was mostly right i left my bodyguard outside during this interview he and his three associates from argus security had arrived from houston just after midnight flying into baton rouge via arguss gulfstream v and driving up to natchez in four separate rental cars they checked into the prentiss motel and by two am my family was being protected by some of the finest bodyguards in the world the total cost of this protection was staggering but my memory of annies quivering chin was enough to make me ashamed for even thinking of money three of the four guards were former fbi agents and fit exactly the mental image id had before they arrived lean and tightlipped late forties economical movements ninehundreddollar business suits specially tailored to conceal the bulges of various firearms the fact that they were former fbi agents concerned me a little but their boss had assured me that none of his men had worked under john portman the fourth argus man was about thirtyfive and blond with the lean confident look of a professional mountain guide he wore jeans a sweatshirt and hiking boots daniel kelly was a veteran of the armys delta force and like the others was billed at eight hundred dollars per day after hearing the details of our situation the senior member of the detail suggested the following plan one operative should remain with my mother and annie at all times another with my father and one with me the fourth would sleep at the hotel for six hours then relieve one of the other men beginning a continuous rotation i agreed and chose daniel kelly as my guard after my interview at the police station kelly and i stopped by the offices of the examiner where we found caitlin doing her best to handle a barrage of phone calls from other newspapers she stopped working long enough to tell me that her father had called from richmond and demanded to know what the hell she thought she was up to then ordered her aboard the first virginiabound aircraft leaving mississippi caitlin told him he had better get ready to mount a libel defense because she was sticking by her story and if he fired her he should prepare to read further installments of the payton story in the washington post i didnt envy mr masters caitlin had been preparing for this day for a long time thirty minutes before the courthouse closed leo marston filed suit against myself and the natchez examiner for a grand total of five million dollars his complaint drafted in record time by his junior law partner blake sims actually they filed two separate suitsone for slander and one for libelneatly severing my fate from that of the examiner which as part of a media group will have a battery of attorneys on retainer many of them first amendment specialists a deputy served me with the papers just as our family was leaving the motel for dinner at the shoneys restaurant across the street i invited the argus men to eat with us but they took their jobs too seriously for that two stood in the front parking lot near their cars like businessmen shooting the breeze after an early dinner while daniel kelly covered the rear entrance i hadnt felt that safe in a long time the argus men made quite an impression on annie too shed spent most of her waking hours since the fire on my mothers lap but during dinner she began to loosen up using the shoneys crayons to play each of us in games of tictactoe rubys death hung over the adults like a pall but we tried to focus on the good times wed had with her which were countless as they spanned thirtyfive years my father had stopped by rubys house earlier to give her husband mosea retired pulpwood cuttera substantial check and a gallon of wild turkey they talked for half an hour shared some whisky and dad left the house wondering how long the old man would survive without ruby around to take care of him caitlins articles had upset my mother but marstons lawsuit terrified her i tried to reassure her by explaining that my intent had been to force just such a lawsuit but she refused to be mollified like most people who have lived any length of time in natchez my mother believes that leo marston is untouchable and that anyone who tries to hurt him is doomed to failure or worse i kept the good news of the day to myself just after noon special agent peter lutjens had called the motel from a pay phone in mclean virginia and asked me to call him back from a pay phone when i did he told me hed been stewing about the payton case and had decided to try to photocopy the sealed fbi file he still had his security pass to the proper archive the problem was the staff the friend who had reported his initial inquiry to portman worked every day but sunday so sunday was lutjenss only shot and he was due to report in fargo on monday i thanked him profusely and tried to reassure him that what he was doing would ultimately serve the bureau not undermine it he told me hed call me sunday if he wasnt in jail and hung up when we got back to the motel after supper i found two oldfashioned handwritten messages waiting call livy and call ike i had no idea what livy could want other than to curse me for vilifying her father in the newspaper but i called tuscany anyway the number of the marston mansion hadnt changed since we were kids but the fact that it had remained in my memory for twenty years probably said something about my buried feelings for livy butterflies fluttered in my stomach as the phone rang but i resolved to tell leo to kiss my ass if he answered marston residence a maid yes could i speak to liv please whos calling her husband just a moment mr sutter after a few moments livy came on the line and said john its penn oh just a minute her voice was under tight control i heard the clacking of heels on hardwood then her voice again more relaxed im glad you called back hows annie doing better look i know you must be upset about the paper a strange laugh things are pretty crazy around here i dont know what youre trying to do but i know why youre doing it i said nothing penn hurting my father wont make up for the years we lost i know that i hope so because i called to tell you that as bad as all this is i dont want to let him come between us again we both waited in the vacuum of the open line each hoping the other could somehow bridge the chasm my accusations had opened between us i imagined her sitting alone in the italianate palace that had sheltered her throughout her childhood she had often portrayed it to me as a prison but i never bought into this she wouldnt have traded tuscany for anything livy im here you havent asked where i got my information about your father you havent protested his innocence of course i havent its ridiculous my father murdering a black man hes probably the least prejudiced man in this town del paytons death may not have been a race murder tell me something livy what would you do if you found out your father had ordered the burning of my parents house thats insane just pretend it was true what would you do well obviously id be the first one to call the police maybe she didnt even know she was lying i need to go livy can we see each other tonight i couldnt believe she wanted to be within ten miles of me after the newspaper story not tonight tomorrow then images from the day before filled my mind livy floating naked in the pool kissing me passionately as we sank slowly through the green water her thigh pressing against me wed better play it by ear theres a lot going on right now thats all the more reason to stay close just remember what i said about my father i meant it i will i hung up and dialed ikes cell phone before thoughts of livy could overwhelm me i wanted to call her back and say pick me up in twenty minutes but the past had finally caught up with us and ike the spike was growling in my ear meet me where i wanted to last night he said meaning the warehouse in the industrial park by the river one hour what about what about about whatever the fuck it is you think youre doing man this towns going crazy one hour ill be there damn straight you will ive been sweating in the dark warehouse for twenty minutes breathing the stink of fertilizer and wondering what could be keeping ike its fully dark now and the spotlight of a tugboat pushing barges upriver arcs through the night like a hollywood klieg light searching for sandbars and unexpected traffic a slight breeze off the mississippi penetrates the twentyfootwide warehouse door where i stand watching the dark line of the levee waiting for the headlights of ikes cruiser i am unarmed but not unprotected daniel kelly is covering me after asking four times if i really trust ike ransom kelly parked his rental car behind the warehouse and told me to forget he was there i parked the bmw out front so that ike would see it when he drove up what i take for the sound of another tugboat suddenly resolves into a car engine a set of headlights descends the levee pulls into the parking lot of the warehouse and stops beside my car its ikes cruiser he gets out his brown uniform looking black under the single security light and walks toward the warehouse door halfway there he stops turns and watches the levee for nearly a minute maybe he senses kellys presence whatever the reason he resumes walking toward me when hes ten yards away i step into the light holding both hands in plain view ike draws his pistol faster than i would have believed possible recognizing me just as the barrel lines up with my chest he quickens his step and shoves me back into the shadows you ought to know better than that he mutters why are you so jumpy the whites of his eyes flick left and right in the darkness you aint jumpy after somebody burned down your house and took your kid who set that fire ike who took my daughter ray presley could have been he holsters his pistol but i dont know for sure not yet why are we here so you can tell me what the hell you think youre doing in the paper you crazy making statements like that youre the one who told me marston was guilty jesus is that the way you did it in houston shoutin shit in the papers before you got any proof take it easy everythings under control under control shooting your mouth off about local law enforcement coming forward im pursuing this the way i think best as far as the newspaper story goes i wanted marston to sue me and the story accomplished that you what i wanted the right to request everything from personal papers to phone records from marston under the rules of discovery a gleam of recognition that lawsuit means you can ask for marstons personal shit and get if thats right okay maybe you aint crazy you get the judges legal files youre liable to find all kinds of illegal shit marstons legal files are protected under client confidentiality rules but everything else is fair game how long you got to answer his suit at least thirty days right that should give you plenty of time for fishing im going to file my answer tomorrow his mouth drops open why you gonna do that by proceeding aggressively i force marston to conclude that i either have evidence in my possession or that i know people willing to come forward and testify against him but you dont dont be so sure im building a case ikes eyes narrow to slits what you talking about what kind of case you holding back on me what if i am youve been holding back on me from the start he raises a warning finger but says nothing and instead begins a staring contest his bloodshot eyes are so jerky that he cant focus in one direction long and he soon looks away what are you taking ike speed what i take me a drink now and then so what have you talked to stone again yes but hes just like you scared to tell what he knows i told you man i know marston done it but i dont know why how do you know ike how can you know he did it if you dont know why he grunts in the dark i know what i know whyd you slam portman in the paper you go pissing off the head of the fbi youre asking for some serious payback i did it to protect myself and my family that newspaper story threw a lot of light on portman on me too it makes it harder for him to retaliate yeah i heard somebody tried to poison ray presley who the hell you think did that i figured marston ordered it you think it was portman sure as hell wasnt the tooth fairy ike scrapes the tip of a boot along the cement floor of the warehouse stone say anything about surveillance why theres somebody watching me a shiver runs along my forearms how long i picked him up today but he could have been there longer stones under fbi surveillance himself he thinks caitlin and i are too phones the works but why would the fbi be watching you maybe cause of your damn newspaper article i didnt mention your name why did you warn me away from the fbi ike have you tried to talk to them about the payton case before say what he takes out a cigarette and taps it against his palm but does not light it why dont you focus on some shit thatll get you somewhere like marstons papers theres bound to be something in there to prosecute him on hes had his hands in all kinds of shit for years i mean who cares what he goes down for long as he rots in parchman i care to get out from under this slander charge ive got to prove marston guilty of murder not campaign finance fraud or any other bullshit murder do you comprehend that instead of answering ike flips open his lighter ignites it and puts the flame to the tip of his cigarette as the orange glow illuminates his face something incomprehensible happens the flame reaches toward me as though sucked by a wind and ike slams his shoulder into my chest punching the air out of my lungs and knocking me to the cement floor as he lands on top of me gunfire erupts outside the warehouse and echoes through the metal building two shots i think then a third the sound quick and flat get off i grunt unable to draw breath with ike on top of me he rolls off and up into a kneeling position his pistol pointed through the warehouse door what happened i ask theres two guns out there one silenced ive got a man out there ike maybe one of the guns was his he whips his head around what man a private security guy from houston he peers into the darkness the way he must have done in vietnam with absolute concentration i cant see shit he hisses but some lardass excop aint gonna help us one bit i know that hes not what you think after a minute of silence he works his way toward the edge of the door what do you see shut the fuck up a boom like a cannon shot shatters the silence reverberating through the warehouse for at least four seconds ike hits the floor with his pistol still aimed at the door thats a deer gun he says stay down we got serious shit going down out there and it aint all got to do with us how do you know aint but one bullet come into this warehouse as i lie facedown on the floor breathing accumulated dust and oil the seconds drag past there are no more shots but the instinctual voice that warned me during the fire that killed ruby is not comforted by this fact it knows that silence is the cloak of the approaching enemy how long we gonna lie here i whisper till i tell you to get up another five minutes pass penn cage yells a man from beyond the warehouse door its kelly daniel kelly that your guy asks ike its kelly shouts the voice again come out and bring your friend we need some law out here i scramble to my feet and trot to the edge of the door daniel kelly stands forty feet away an mp submachine gun slung over his shoulder what happened i ask walking into the parking lot somebody tried to whack you or the cop i couldnt tell which ike steps into the light his pistol aimed at kelly who shot who out here kelly holds up his hands take it easy deputy im a friendly i was out here covering your meeting when i saw a muzzle flash from over there he points at the levee a dark silhouette fifty yards away it was a silenced rifle and it was firing subsonic rounds because i didnt hear the bullet crack i started running toward the flash whipping out a spotter scope as i ran trying to get within range and see at the same time the shooter was firing from the prone position already setting up for his second shot i yelled just as he pulled the trigger and as he swung around to deal with me i doubletapped him on the run is he dead ike asks definitely i put one through his head to be sure and its a good thing because he was wearing a vest what about that deer gun i heard kelly points into the darkness south of the warehouse the deer gun belonged to the guy over there who is also dead the shooter on the levee took him out that was the first muzzle flash i saw he fired across my line of sight at a right angle to you guys the other guy must have fired off that deer slug as he was dying pure reflex probably i dont get it i say why would they shoot at each other a fallingout among hit men kelly shakes his head i dont think these guys were together theyre dressed different and their equipments different i think the guy with the deer gun was just in the way who knew you were coming to this meeting ike asks my father and kelly thats it what about you kelly asks ike nobody knows where im at how did these guys get so close if you were covering the meeting kelly scratches the side of his nose as though to emphasize his calmness first of all theyre not that close second the curve of the levee blocked my line of sight to the guy with the deer gun but not his line to you third the sniper on the levee followed you in he probably drove with his lights off and parked well back then moved up on foot kelly pauses his cool blue eyes level with ikes and fourth if i was in with those guys youd be bagged and tagged right now ike snorts and turns toward the levee show me the dead guys kelly unslings his mp and starts jogging toward the levee we follow him across the lot trying to stay with him as he pounds up the spongy grass on the side of the levee the odors of cow manure and bushhogged grass weight the humid air at the crest kelly points at a black shape lying at the edge of the gravel road that runs atop the levee no wallet he says no id at all cars clean too a rental thats risky ike remarks he gets stopped at random without id hes gonna get run in unless hes willing to do the cop ike walks to the corpse bends over and takes a long look never seen him take a look cage i walk over and glance at the dead sniper hes dressed from head to toe in black and looks like he stepped off a film set his face is pale and placid in the dark as though he were shot while sleeping a dead face can be difficult to identify so i give it long enough to be sure i dont know him heres his weapon kelly holds out a long boltaction rifle to ike rankpullin starlight scope fourthgeneration passive amplification expensive toy guys definitely out of town ike declares nobody around here uses shit like this caliber looks awful small its a special twentytwo magnum chambers subsonic rounds an assassins gun christ i whisper wheres the other guy kelly points into the darkness south of the warehouse then starts down the slope the second corpse is lying facedown in a thicket of weeds dressed in jeans and a plaid flannel shirt theres a red bandanna knotted around its head ike bends down and pulls a rifle from the dead hand an old remington thirtyaughtsix seen better days too kelly says the shooter on the levee probably saw him moving up to get a shot poor bastard didnt have a chance ike puts both hands under the corpse and rolls it over below the dead mans left eye is a small black hole small but obviously fatal ive seen a hundred shitkickers just like him says ike but i dont know this one as i stare the slack features suddenly coalesce into a coherent whole and a feverish heat shoots through me the dead man is a nightmare made flesh a physical echo of the most terrifying night of my life i know him i say grabbing ikes arm who is he his names hanratty i convicted his brother of capital murder he was just executed ill be damned that aryan brotherhood bastard right i also shot his other brother four years ago no shit says kelly with respect mingled with surprise this one was the last the fever heat has disappeared leaving a chill in its wake the youngest ike kicks the corpses leg no more boomboom for this aryan papasan he kneels and starts going through the dead mans pockets quickly turning up a wallet hanratty clovis dee he says reading the drivers license brother of arthur lee i say absurdly and white people make fun of african names ike mutters getting to his feet least we know what happened now this shitkicker was out for revenge and he picked the wrong night to try it he was crowding that ninja assassin up on the levee and he paid for it the question is who sent the assassin portman i suggest the hardware looked pretty sophisticated john portman would definitely have access to people like that kelly says quietly retired bureau agency former ct operators he looks at ike in any case i hope you appreciate this enough to take care of any problems that might arise dont sweat it ike replies were in the county here me and the sheriff understand each other although three killings in one day is bigtime trouble for this town the district attorney could be a problem i tell them thinking of austin mackey fuck that tightass ike mutters we got three witnesses telling it one way dead guys got nobody mackey got no choice i was thinking of kellys submachine gun its illegal kelly smiles and draws a pistol from his holster what you gonna do with that ike asks dropping his hand to his own gun kelly fires three quick rounds into the night sky then holsters the pistol browning hipower he says with a smile chambers the same ninemillimeter cartridge as the mp very convenient as long as they dont do a ballistics analysis ike nods as if noting this for future use well lets get this over with let me call the sheriff he starts back toward the warehouse but i take his arm and stop him who sent the sniper ike whos trying to kill me he looks back his face indignant how you know he was shooting at you he pulls his arm free and walks on but i stay where i am breathing the cooler air blowing off the river the stars are bright here the water close a few minutes ago a silent bullet passed within inches of my face but i am still alive and the last hanratty brother is finally dead my daughter is a lot safer than she was before daniel kelly did something not many men could have done thanks kelly i say softly he gives me a selfdeprecating smile just doing my job boss right chapter the sheriffs office looks like an armed camp when we arrive its a modern fortresslike building with a stateoftheart jail occupying its upper floors uniformed deputies swagger through the halls like cowboys in a western stoked by the air of incipient violence blowing through the city ike disappears for a few moments leaving kelly and me in the entrance hall five minutes later he returns and escorts us into the sheriffs office i sense immediately that were going to benefit from the jurisdictional rivalry that exists between the police department and the sheriffs office had we reported the levee shootings to the police the chief would have kept kelly and me all night mercilessly grilling me as payback for the constitutional lesson i gave him earlier in the day the sheriff is tan and fitlooking with the watchful eyes of a hunter he seems to view the death of the youngest hanratty as a fortuitous event though the timing could have been better when those black kids shot billy earl whitestone he says leaning back in his chair and folding his hands behind his neck they turned this town into a powder keg the sports center sold out of ammunition at four oclock they sold mostly to whites walmart sold out of everything but paintball rounds they sold mostly to blacks we may have a world of trouble coming down on our heads tonight and all because of that newspaper story he looks at me like a wise poker player you think going after leo marston is worth all this trouble the builtup resentment in this town is none of my doing sheriff whats happening now would have happened eventually whatever the cause maybe he allows i sure hope youve got some evidence though messing with judge leo aint generally good for your health any leads on the whitestone shooters ike asks the pd has an informer working it theyre not telling me squat of course but the word is its some kids from the concord apartments nobodys been arrested yet though and we need an arrest jailing those two might go a long way toward calming people down maybe you ought to take a ride over to those apartments ike see if you can shake something loose ill do it the sheriff smooths his thinning hair think you can give me some overtime tonight glad to get it i want you to stick to the north side try to keep everybody indoors the sheriff is telling ike to keep the black population inside their houses ive given the white deputies the same orders for their parts of town he adds for my benefit its fear that drives all this nonsense if we can get through this first night we might just make it okay the sheriffs phone starts ringing and he leans forward to shake our hands you boys try not to shoot anybody else okay ike leads us out to the front steps of the building where he takes a pack of kool menthols from the pocket of his uniform he offers kelly one but kelly declines as ike holds his lighter flame to the tip of his cigarette his hand trembles and kelly shoots me a quick glance you sleep with this boy if you have to ike tells kelly exhaling a long stream of smoke hes doing some good even if he is doing it the hard way kelly winks at ike no sweat sergeant howd you know i was a sergeant its like a sign around your neck brother ikes laugh is good to hear but as we move down the steps toward our cars kelly leans toward me and says hes speeding like a racehorse with bourbon underneath somethings eating him bad none of my business of course i slap him on the shoulder you say whatever pops into your head kelly will do since my mothers computer was destroyed in the fire i planned to draft my answer to marstons suit at the offices of the examiner they occupy an entire building in an old section of downtown a long onestory structure with inadequate parking even at this late hour the door is open and we find caitlin in the newsroom sitting before a twentyoneinch monitor commanding her staff with a cell phone in one hand and a computer trackball in the other shes dressed in jeans and a teal pinpoint buttondown which gives her the look of a college yearbook editor she waves when she sees me but continues her phone conversation the newsroom is forty feet long and twenty wide with a half dozen computer workstationsall in useand photos of distinguished natchezians decorating the walls whos this caitlin asks sliding her cell phone into a belt holster as we approach daniel kelly part of the security from houston kelly this is caitlin masters fledgling muckraker caitlin sizes kelly up as she leads us down a hall noting his average size and easy demeanor falling back beside me she whispers is he qualified kelly chuckles softly he just saved my life i say in a normal voice im sold have you put tomorrows issue to bed her eyes flash with excitement are you kidding this towns about to pop she pushes us into a glasswalled conference room screened with venetian blinds for privacy were pushing back the deadline as far as we can two in the morning if we have to can you do that with computers we can reformat the whole paper and go to plate in thirty minutes theres a rumor that the police are close to an arrest in the whitestone killing and we must have gotten a dozen calls about people carrying guns in and out of their houses theyre saying its just like it was before the riot in sixtyeight that wasnt much of a riot everybody was scared to death but nobody got killed just a bunch of broken store windows lets hope thats all that happens this time im glad to hear you say that she gives me an icy look you think i want the town to explode so i can sell papers no she doesnt look convinced three hours ago a cnn crew yelled a question at john portman as he was leaving the hoover building he walked over and told them on camera that the del payton case involved matters of national security and that the fbi was looking into the question of whether you or i had violated any laws in our pursuit of the case the best defense is a good offense i guess anything else i should know leo marstons attorney gave me a phone interview he said your charges are ridiculous and theyre going to cost both of us seven figures im running it tomorrow i expected that caitlin smiles like a child hiding a cookie i also have some good news my father called back and told me that if i was sticking by my story there must be something to it hes going to help how by committing the full resources of the media group to investigating marston and portman hes already spoken to senator harris from virginia tomorrow harris is going to the senate intelligence committee to ask for a special resolution authorizing the opening of the payton file failing that hell ask that it be moved from fbi custody to a place where it cant be tampered with at least until director portmans involvement in the case can be clarified if that doesnt work hell stand up on the senate floor and ask the same things on cspan i feel the relief of a man trying to push a car uphill when four strong backs join him in his effort but the feeling vanishes quickly asking that the file be opened is good but if he cant get that its best that the file stay where it is at least until sunday for a moment caitlin looks confused then she grabs my wrist lutjens is going to try for the file sunday ill tell my dad to call the senator back its nice to have powerful friends her eyes twinkle with irony isnt it kelly laughs hes not sure what hes gotten into but hes clearly enjoying it how did mr kelly here save your life caitlin asks he killed two guys who were trying to kill me one was arthur lee hanrattys brother jesus did this happen near the river we heard some kind of call on the scanner but it was coded that was it can i print this story absolutely the more public this thing gets the safer we are we ought to be very safe then im getting nonstop calls from the major papers the networks everybody theres a sharp knock at the door and caitlin walks into the hall for a hurried conference when she returns her face is flushed pink with excitement the police just trapped the whitestone suspects in the concord apartments im going over to cover the arrest the concord apartments are a lowincome housing development and a center of drug and gang activity in natchez the residents over there arent big fans of the police i warn her theyre probably as volatile as old dynamite right now thats why im going you want to come along i cant take the time ive got to file my interrogatories and requests for production along with my answer thatll keep marston off balance make him think im ready to go to court on a moments notice speaking of marston wheres your other friend my other friend she gives me a sidelong glance she means livy oh i have no idea with her father i guess caitlin obviously wants to say more but shes unwilling to do so in front of kelly ive got to get going guys wait go with her kelly kelly looks at caitlin then back at me i think youre the one who needs protection boss ill have a photographer with me she protests ill be fine kellys worth ten photographers ill be here for at least two hours then im going straight back to the motel he can tell you how he saved my life on the way caitlin is wavering kelly bends over lifts a cuff of his jeans and pulls out a small automatic which he passes to me safetys on i slip the gun into my pocket and look at caitlin satisfied okay ill take him but you go straight to the motel from here no side trips i need a computer and coffee lots of coffee weve got plenty of both kelly and caitlin still havent returned when i leave for the motel while typing my discovery requests i overheard enough newsroom conversation to follow the situation unfolding at the concord apartments the two teenagers who allegedly shot billy earl whitestone had holed up in the apartment of their grandmother somehow caitlin managed to get them on the telephone and during that conversation one of the boys admitted to the shooting he claimed hed shot whitestone because ruby flowerss death had so upset his grandmother that he had to do something he chose whitestone as his victim because hed often heard an uncle talk about how whitestone had run the klan during the bad times an hour after this confession the grandmother talked the boys into giving themselves up on the condition that caitlin be allowed to accompany them to the police station to ensure their safety i assume caitlin is still at the station now running the police crazy and keeping kelly jumping kellys pistol is on my lap as i drive toward the motel theres no traffic on the streets or even the highway fear has worked its way into the fabric of the town a police car screams out of the empty darkness siren blaring going in the opposite direction halfway to the motel a jackedup pickup filled with white teenagers roars alongside me pauses as its occupants peer in at me then roars off again night riders looking for a fight or kids trying to figure out what all the excitements about i wont know until i read tomorrows paper the singlestory buildings of the prentiss motel remind me of the motor courts of my childhood vacations but viewed without the kaleidoscopic lens of wonder they are a mean and depressing sight the thought of my parents forced to live here because of my actions is hard to bear yet they have not uttered one word of complaint since the fire not even my mother who urged me to avoid the payton case from the beginning now that events have proved her right what is she doing making the best of things i feel like dragging some realtor out of bed and buying her the biggest goddamn house in the city orienting myself by the greenish glow of the swimming pool i park and start walking toward our rooms with kellys gun held along my leg halfway there i feel a sudden chill theres someone sitting in one of the pool chairs fifty feet away a dark silhouette against the wavering light of the water as i walk down the long row of doors the figure rises from the chair i put my finger on the trigger of the pistol and quicken my steps penn the voice stops me cold its livy i slip kellys gun into my waistband and jog toward the pool fence livy opens the gate and waits just beyond it shes wearing a strapless white evening dress that looks strangely formal beside the deserted swimming pool the moonlight falls lustrous upon her shoulders but is somehow lost in her eyes which look more gray than blue tonight what are you doing here whats the matter i wanted to see you she says thats all i had to see you is everything all right that depends on what you mean by all right things are a bit tense at our house more than a bit really but im sure your house was like that when my father went after yours she has no idea how bad things got at our house during the year leading up to that trial but soon she might before she can say anything else i ask what ive been wanting to ask since i saw her at the airport in baton rouge livy a few nights ago at a party your mother threw a drink in my face she what she told me id ruined your life livys expression does not change she holds her eyes on mine attentive as a spectator at the opera but i sense that shes expending tremendous effort to maintain this illusion of normalcy what was she talking about i ask i have no idea she looks away from me mom probably doesnt either shes a hairbreadth from the dts by five oclock every day daddys talking about sending her to betty ford she was referring to something specific i saw her eyes livy turns and peers into the cloudy water my divorce has upset her quite a bit divorce isnt part of the fairy tale if it were shed have left my father long ago i thought you were only separated pending divorce then its just semantics she looks at me over her bare shoulder an injured look in her eyes you think id ask you to make love to me if there was a chance my husband and i would get back together this is one of those moments where we make a heaven or hell of the future by choosing honesty or deception i dont know you werent that discriminating in the past she flinches but she can endure much worse than this the past the past she says the damned sacred past cant we try living in the present for once yesterday was the only free ride were going to get she looks back into the depths of the pool i have a room she says in a deliberate voice its two doors down from yours why dont we talk there a room part of me wants to slap her for assuming so much i move sideways so that i can see her face will you really talk she pulls her hair back into a thick ponytail as though to feel the breeze on her neck her collarbones are sculpted ivory creating shadowy hollows at the base of her throat about what about what everything why you did what you did twenty years ago what do you mean this is kafkaesque can she really have edited the past so completely that she no longer remembers how badly she betrayed our dreams why you disappeared for a year where you went why you ran off to virginia why you treated me like a stranger when i flew up to ask you to get your father to drop the suit she turns to me and lets her hair fall and whatever mask she was maintaining falls with it she looks more vulnerable than i have ever seen her and when she speaks her voice is stripped of all affect penn i cant do it livy if i understood some of those things i might wellthings might not have to happen the way they are what do you mean if i answer your questions youll withdraw the charges you made against my father i dont know what i mean i started into the del payton case to destroy leo marston but compared to understanding the mysteries that shaped my life revenge seems meaningless of course there is still del payton and althea and the small matter of justice i cant pull out of the payton case now its too late for that but i can pursue it a different way if your fathers part was only stop she says shaking her head i cant talk about twenty years ago not even to make things easier on my father she takes a step toward me i want her to stay back because the closer she gets the more i want to go to her room with her she is achingly beautiful in the moonlight how did i ruin your life i ask she shakes her head absolving me of any possible sin you didnt another step but you can save it livy listen come with me she pleads right now if she had kissed me then i would have walked away but she didnt she picked up her purse from the pool chair took my hand and led me across the parking lot toward the motel a purposeful urgency in her stride the deja vu of walking beside the numbered doors is powerful enough to dislocate time if i were to close my eyes and open them again i would see the eighteenthousanddollar gown flowing behind her like a trail of mist the lifetimes of water that have passed under the bridge since that night have all flowed back in a span of moments when she opens the door and closes us inside i pull her to me and kiss her with the thirst of a binge drinker returning to the bottle my questions fade to dying sparks made irrelevant by the absolute connection of our lips and hands i dont even know i am backing her toward the door until she collides with it the unyielding wooden face holding her as i continue forward pressing against her my hands groping at her dress searching for the hem thats right she says hoarsely thats right thats the moment my hand finds her sex she is breathing like a sprinter in the last few yards of a race she kisses me with almost desperate passion then pushes down the front of the strapless dress and pulls my mouth to a breast in seconds both her arms are outstretched fingers splayed and quivering discharging the frantic energy pouring from her core touching her this way is rapture at once within her and without needing no other thing no friend no thought the knock at the door reverberates through our bodies stunning us from our trance yet still livy presses herself down against my hand unwilling to let the world back in i jerk her away from the door and onto the bed fearing someone might shoot through the thin metal the knocking comes again this time with the distance to the bed and with half my faculties restored it sounds reasonably discreet who is it i call digging in my pocket for kellys gun hating the ragged edge of fear in my voice kelly relief cascades through me i turn to tell livy everythings all right and find her standing with both hands pointed rigidly at the door a pistol clenched between them she must have taken it from her purse whoa i say holding up my hands i know this guy hes with me she lowers the gun slowly as though unsure whether to trust my judgment i turn back to the door and open it a crack daniel kellys sandy blond head leans toward mine i saw you go in here as i pulled up i just wanted you to know im back i nod i heard about what happened at the apartments you must be tired you can go ahead and get some sleep im fine wired really i hesitate to ask the next question but i want to know is caitlin with you an ironic smile there and gone shes back at the paper writing the story shes a tough lady man coming from daniel kelly this is high praise indeed thanks for looking out for her and thanks again for the levee thing he nods but theres a curious hesitancy in his face what is it kelly well i thought maybe you and caitlin were you know he looks past me through the crack in the door i guess not huh i guess not i reply feeling a strange hollowness in my chest he makes a clicking sound with his tongue im gonna get some eggs over at shoneys one of the other guysll be watching this door thanks oh and your little girl is fine no worries his words hit me like a blow maybe he meant for them to my cheeks burn with selfdisgust night boss he says and disappears from the crack i shut the door and bolt it livy is sitting on the bed her face composed the gun nowhere in evidence only her tousled hair hints at our brief encounter at the door why are you carrying a gun she shrugs the towns gone crazy hasnt it and daddy insisted leo would livys shoes hose and panties lie on the floor beside her bare feet she looks at me like she cant understand why im still standing where i am like what happened against the door was the opening movement of a symphony i glance at my watch twelvetwenty annie is almost certainly asleep but kellys words have left me with a guilty longing like an unresolved chord i need to see my daughter sleeping i need to check on annie livy stands and takes my hand pulls me toward her i know i mean it i know she puts her arms around my waist and pulls me against her livy she kisses my nipple through my shirt the sharp edges of her teeth pull at flesh and wet cloth sending a delicious current of pain through me itll only take a minute i tell her ill be right with three or four quick movements she unbuckles my pants and pushes them far enough down to free me then entwines her fingers behind my neck when i try to speak she takes my right hand and lifts it to my mouth cutting off my words her scent on my fingers is overpowering me first she whispers even as i despise myself for it in one violent motion i reach beneath her dress lift her into the air and set her down upon me chapter i am parked in the alley between wall and pearl streets the legal center of the city its nearly dark and raining steadily a drizzle with a breath of fall in it the courthouse towers above me on its pedestal of earth grayishwhite and imposing amid the windblown oaks that surround it across the street running down the block in a line stand the offices of various law firms all of them small most very profitable the most prestigious among them is marston sims founded in by ambrose marston leos great grandfather the firm has handled everything from highprofile criminal cases to corporate litigation involving tens of millions of dollars and i am parked in this alley to see whether the senior partner of the firm will commit a felony tonight i filed my requests for production this morning and if leo plans to hide or destroy any documentary evidence the sooner he does it the better at least from his point of view i would like to be there when he tries ive staked out his office because tuscanyhis fenced estatedoes not lend itself to surveillance daniel kelly is covering the back entrance for me and were in contact via handheld radios which were among the toys he and his associates brought from houston also among those toys was a hi video camera with a nightvision lens which rests on the seat beside me the rear entrance of the office is well lighted by a security lamp so kelly is using a standard camcorder borrowed from caitlin masters the pistol he lent me last night lies on the seat beside the hi camera its safety off oneadamtwelve oneadamtwelve kellys voice crackles out of the radio sitrep please i laugh and press send on my walkietalkie nothing out here but rain its like fishing thats what my butts telling me anyway yeah maybe well catch something as i set the radio back on the passenger seat something bangs against my window nearly stopping my heart i grab for the gun knowing ill never bring it up in time to save myself if the person outside the car means me harm when my eyes focus through the rivulets of water on the window i see caitlin masters her hair soaked from the rain i let out my breath with a sigh of relief and motion for her to come around to the passenger side im glad i wasnt trying to kill you she says sliding into the passenger seat youd be dead shes wearing a windbreaker with los angeles times stenciled on the chest from the pocket she takes a barrette and puts the end in her mouth then flips down the visor mirror above her seat nothing yet she asks through her teeth nope she gathers her fine black hair and pins it in a loose bun behind her head there i should have done that before i left she turns and gives me a dazzling smile well are you up on the days events im up on my events the rest of the world i know nothing about four tv vans covered the whitestone suspects walk to their arraignment jackson baton rouge alexandria and a gulf coast station the courthouse looked like it was under siege the wire services picked up all three of my stories and theyre being rerun in dozens of papers that pulitzers getting closer every day which judge did the kids get natchez has two criminal court judges a white woman and a black man the black one and he gave them bail on firstdegree murder with a confession no less he set it at a million apiece which is like a billion to those kids families but i heard the naacp may put up the cash bond two hundred thousand they might as well paint targets on the kids backs caitlin picks up the video camera switches it on and trains it on the polished mahogany door of marston sims its set deep in a deep brick alcove a brass plate on the street announces the presence of the office to the public night vision she murmurs nice wheres kelly watching the back door she zooms in on the door then pans the rainslickened street how much are those bodyguards costing you lets just say im going to have to hurry up and finish another book she laughs its money well spent that kellys been all over and done some wild things hes cute too an irrational prick of jealousy irritates me i wouldnt know about that dont get all homophobic on me she pokes my knee as she scans the street well here comes a familiar face where i turn the ignition key and flip on the windshield wipers our side of the street now i see a woman is jogging up the sidewalk in tight lycra warmup pants and a tulane tshirt its the waitress with the crush on you says caitlin jenny i lean forward and watch the darkhaired young woman approaching through the rain it is jenny give me a break i mean it that chick is fixated on you jenny jogs past the car at a good clip not paying us the slightest bit of attention the rain has soaked her tshirt leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination she ought to wear a sign caitlin says drily please stare at my tits im surprised youd comment after the blouse you wore the day you interviewed me caitlin takes her eye away from the viewfinder and gives me an elfin smile that was different i was trying to distract you it worked it always does im really rather modest modesty isnt what comes to mind when i think of you her smile changes subtly you dont really know me very well do you she reaches over and switches off the engine killing the windshield wipers any word on when ruby flowerss funeral will take place her quick segues are hard for me to follow mosemr flowersis thinking of sunday but thats not set in stone sunday but thats five days after she died thats how the blacks do it havent you read your own papers obituary column why do they wait so long well they usually have to wait days for relatives who live up north to get back to mississippi sometimes they have to ride the bus ruby has two sons in detroit a daughter in chicago and another boy in los angeles cant you fly them in ill do anything mr flowers asks me to do but he hasnt asked my father already bought rubys coffin and headstone which probably cost more than the church the funeral will be held in personally i think he overdid it ruby never wanted to stand out from her own people in life and i dont think shed want to in death why do you care when the funeral is anyway i hate to be the bearer of bad tidings penn but rubys funeral is going to be the epicenter of a media hurricane what shad johnson is going to speak and there are bound to be tv trucks there damn it thats all wrong you should thank god for small miracles al sharpton called shad this morning and offered to come down and help out with the movement shad told him to stay in new york even as i say a silent thankyou to shadrach johnson bitter gall rises into my throat take it easy caitlin says touching my arm tell me what you did today what i did it isnt what i did its what the judge did which judge the white one franklin two hours ago she set our trial date caitlin goes still our trial date the libel trial just my part of it you dont have to worry but my slander trial is set for next wednesday next wednesday thats onlyshe counts swiftly on her fingerssix days from now yep thats ridiculous i expected a quick trial date but i thought id get at least a month simply going through the materials ive requested under discovery could take a month how can the judge set a date like that easily shes in marstons pocket why do you think he picked her picked her i thought they assigned judges by drawing lots or something in this district they match cases to judges by simple rotation theoretically whichever judges name is up when a suit is filed gets that case but all the clerk has to do to steer a case to a particular judge is hold on to it until that judges turn comes up one phone call from marston to the clerk would do it how do you know he has franklin in his pocket maybe he just has the clerk i talked to a local lawyer i went to school with marston was the heavy hand in getting franklin elected big contributions an endorsement words in the right ears that was eight years ago but she wont have forgotten who put her on the bench but how can she possibly defend that trial date no one could build a defense that fast in my answer to marstons complaint i stated that my defense would be truth truth is the oldest defense against a slander charge by definition truth cannot be slanderous if franklin is challenged about the trial date shell say the defendant doesnt dispute that he uttered the alleged slander he claims that his statements are true therefore let him prove that without delay leo marstons reputation should not suffer any more than it already has while mr cage goes on a fishing expedition she can also cite the racial violence in the community resulting from my charges caitlin is shaking her head shit youre in a deep hole will you help me wade through the materials ive requested in discovery absolutely ill get my reporters and interns going through the stuff as soon as you get it she digs into her windbreaker pocket pulls out a snickers bar and tears open the wrapper after two bites she freezes and looks guiltily at me sorry she offers me whats left thats okay you eat it come on its not like we havent already exchanged germs though that seems quite a while ago i take it from her hand thanks i havent eaten for hours the chocolate seems to be absorbed directly though the lining of my mouth giving me an instant sugar buzz stakeouts are the worst caitlin grumbles she glances toward the law office then looks back at me was your wife from a wealthy family sarah no why well livy marston is from a wealthy family so and im from a wealthy family and i felt that you were attracted to me until livy showed up anyway i just wondered if something about that background draws you in some way no sarahs father was a carpenter thats probably how she stood the years when i was an assistant da when we got rich she wasnt sure how to react at first she insisted that i put every penny in the bank not spend any of it save it for the kids but after my third book hit the list she loosened up when we bought our house in tanglewood she thought shed died and gone to heaven caitlin is watching me with a strange intensity i reach out and touch her wrist hey im still attracted to you she looks vulnerable yet ready to withstand a hard truth but youre sleeping with livy marston right i know its a mistake to look away but i cant meet her eyes in this moment did kelly tell you that no i just felt it i shouldnt say anything about it i dont have any right to but i care about you and livy is just trying to keep you from hurting her father she hasnt asked me to do anything like that you dont really know her in some ways she hates her father some ways but not all caitlins eyes hold wisdom far beyond her years and shes too smart to be overt maybe she just wants to distract you maybe she doesnt even admit her real motives to herself but thats what shes doing protecting her father message received okay may i ask one more question all right did your wife like her a hollow feeling spreads from the pit of my stomach no caitlin looks away as though embarrassed by forcing me to admit this i am about to speak when she grabs the video camera zooms in on the office door and begins recording what is it the object of your obsession is parking in front of her fathers office peering through the rain i see a silver lincoln town car parked in front of marston sims a woman with shoulderlength hair sits behind the wheel she could be livy but im not sure until she gets out she walks briskly through the rain to the mahogany door her regal carriage as distinctive as a fingerprint after livy unlocks the door leos huge frame emerges from the passenger door of the town car his closecropped hair gleaming silver under the light of the street lamp what the hell are they doing caitlin whispers lets wait and see livy holds the door open for leo scanning the dark street as she waits i want to believe the best of her but even from this distance her eyes look full of purpose she lays a hand on leos shoulder as he passes through the door then takes one more look up the street seeing us but not seeing i am suddenly back in the motel room last night being led through a carnal labyrinth with livy as my guide dissolving and reforming inside her until i lay inert my mouth dry as sand my skin too sore to touch shit caitlin hisses we cant see anything now we should call judge franklin calm down they could be doing legitimate work preparing his case livy is an attorney you know ill bet theyre shredding the files you asked for right this minute lets just sit tight okay see what happens the seconds pass in tense silence with caitlin tapping the door the entire time my walkietalkie crackles from the edge of caitlins seat ive got lights in the building kelly says weve got visitors were not sure what theyre up to just stay put im here if you need me suddenly the mahogany door opens and leo backs out of the alcove with two large file boxes in his arms would you look at that caitlin breathes the son of a bitch is guilty is the timedate stamp working i think so its displayed in the viewfinder as leo loads his boxes into the backseat of the town car livy emerges from the office carrying another one shes helping him caitlin cries youve got to call the judge we dont know whats in the boxes they could be using those records to prepare leos case she shakes her head with manic exasperation as leo returns with another box livy soon does the same and one more trip by leo makes six livy locks the door behind them caitlin takes her cell phone from the holster on her belt and shoves it at me i push it back at her no lets see where theyre going first jesus shes got you wrapped around her little finger enough i start the car and wait for livy to pull out what about kelly caitlin asks i pick up the walkietalkie and press send im following livy marston kelly you keep watching the back ill call if i need you i drop the radio on the floor and glance at caitlin less for them to notice i stay several car lengths behind the town car but i neednt have worried livy drives straight to tuscany the mansion is set far back from the road with eight acres of trees shielding it from sight and sound of passing traffic a motorized gate closes after the lincoln passes through leaving us locked outside caitlin jumps out of the car even before ive stopped video camera in hand i shut off the engine and follow her which requires some fast footwork as she has already scaled the gate and run on by the time i reach it my feet crunch on the wet pea gravel as i race after her up the long curving drive tuscany was built in by a retired english general who imported the italianate craze to natchez from london three stories tall the mansion is a splendor of northern italian design with an entrance tower front and side galleries marble corner quoins huge roundheaded windows with marble hood moldings and balustrade balconies on the second floor yet despite its grandeur the overall effect of this transplanted villa is surprisingly tasteful the great door of the mansion closes just as caitlin and i come within sight of it from where we standbeneath a dripping oak with a trunk as thick as ten mentuscany looks like an epic film set floodlit surrounded by trimmed hedges azaleas mosshung southern hardwoods and luxurious magnolias the broad waxy leaves of the magnolias glisten with beads of rainwater do you know your way around the house caitlin whispers i used to ill bet come on she starts toward the house in a running crouch soon our faces are pressed to the panes of a tenfoottall window with spiky hedges pricking our backs the window glass is more than a century old full of waves and imperfections but caitlin is videotaping through it anyway through the distorting medium i see leo marston standing before an enormous marble fireplace above the fireplace is a portrait of livy as a teenager or perhaps maude leo bends obscuring part of the fireplace then straightens up and puts his hands on his hips beyond his knees yellow flames billow up from a gas jet hes building a fire caitlin says in a tone of disbelief its seventyfive degrees and hes building an effing fire my last resistance crumbles give me your cell phone i call directory assistance for judges franklins number then let the computer connect me the judge herself answers and it sounds like cocktail hour at her house penn cage judge franklin the lawyer leo marston is suing for slander oh why are you calling me at home leo lifts one of the file boxes and sets it squarely on the andirons the flames lick their way up the sides of the cardboard burning it black judge at this moment i am watching leo marston destroy what i believe is the evidence i requested today in my requests for production a stunned pause is he in the room with you no maam a few minutes ago i observed him removing file boxes from his office in a surreptitious manner i followed him home and i am now watching him burn those file boxes in his fireplace watching through a window you mean youre trespassing on his property is that really the point judge i hear the clink of ice against glass a hurried swallow judge i have the publisher of the natchez examiner with me and the events i described are all on videotape shes taping right this minute christ on a crutch what do you want me to do counselor call the police and have them come straight to marstons house and confiscate those files and id like you to come with them you might just prevent bloodshed ill do it mr cage but you get your tail off leo marstons property right this minute before he puts a load of rock salt in your butt or worse yes maam i click end and touch caitlins arm shes sending the police they wont make it in time the gates closed and they wont be able to get through what do you want to do make marston want them to get here she pulls free of my grip and bulls her way through the hedge seconds later the sound of shattering glass reverberates across the floodlit lawn leo goes rigid before the fireplace his ears pricked caitlins rock smashed the window of another room and he is unsure of what he heard then another hundredfiftyyearold pane smashes this one less than ten feet from marston he stares at the broken window looks back at the fireplace then hurries out of the room caitlin is standing in the drive like a pitcher on the mound right arm cocked a rock in her hand she may not know what leo is going after but i do and from the gallery marston could pick her off firing from the waist i charge through the prickly hedge and run onto the lawn get your ass under cover her cocked arm fires and another pane shatters into irreparable shards i sprint the last few yards and grab her arm dragging her toward a thicket of azaleas just as we plow into the bushes the front door of tuscany crashes open and leo bellows into the night where are you you gutless sons of bitches come out and fight like goddamn men i have to give him credit at this moment most natchezians are huddled in their houses terrified of a race war for all leo knows a gang of crazed rioters smashed his windows and is now waiting to pick him off from the bushes yet there he stands shotgun in hand defending his castle like horatius at the bridge he shouts twice more then fires blindly into the night i cover caitlin with my body as the shotgun booms through the trees like a cannon after five shots leo shouts a final curse then goes back inside slamming the door behind him god only knows what maude and livy are thinking surely one of them must have called the police and opened the gate by now get off caitlin groans from beneath me cant breathe i roll off and scrabble to my knees in the azaleas she smiles up at me breathing fast and shallow that wasnt exactly how ive pictured us getting horizontal together me either the smile vanishes marston can still burn those files before the cops get here theres nothing we can do to stop him give me your gun no way no how youre a menace she sighs in frustration and rolls over to watch the mansion while we wait for the police before long three uniformed cops come racing up the driveway on foot they rap on the great door which leo answers shouting at full volume condemning the police department as a useless bunch of fools and high school dropouts from their body language the responding officers do not appear to be reacting favorably to his words as he continues his tirade two squad cars roar up the drive and stop before the front steps which are bookended by negro lawn jockey hitching posts a black patrolman gets out of the first cruiser and opens his passenger door circuit judge eunice b franklin emerges looking like hell warmed over shes wearing boxy blue jeans an ole miss sweatshirt hair curlers tied beneath a blue scarf and she looks pissed i pull caitlin to her feet and hurry toward the gallery when we arrive leo is lambasting judge franklin in the same superior tone he used with the police franklin seems to be enduring it with remarkable equanimity when leo recognizes me standing behind the judge his face flushes bright red theres murder in his eyes and everyone on the gallery sees it did you smash my windows cage he yells dont say anything counselor judge franklin orders me she turns back to marston leo the issue tonight is files did you remove any files from your office tonight and attempt to burn them at last comprehension dawns in marstons eyes did that bastard tell you that caitlin aims the video camera at leos face i have it all on tape judge franklin you can watch it right now if youd like franklin looks back at marston you want to rethink your answer leo marston draws himself up like a feudal lord being forced by a priest to deal civilly with serfs i brought some files home from my office old junk tax records baddebt files franklin nods patiently but her jaw is set then you wont mind if these officers take them down to my chambers for safekeeping im sure this is all a misunderstanding but itll save you the trouble of hauling away the ashes leo blocks the door with his considerable bulk his arms outstretched from post to post eunice i think you and i should have a private word franklin glances at the video camera turn that off ms masters im sorry judge but the first amendment of the constitution guarantees my right to do what i am doing now judges do not react well to defiance eunice franklin reddens a shade and for a moment i fear she is about to order caitlins arrest to my surprise she turns to marston and says clear that door leo marstons hard blue eyes lock onto franklins eunice youd better think about what officer washington she cuts in go in there and confiscate whatever files you find take them straight to my chambers two cops push past marston whose only choices are to stand aside or defy the orders of a judge by assaulting police officers he stands aside his face red with fury eunice franklin will pay a heavy price for this but my sympathy is limited dilemmas like these are the price of backroom politics with a final savage glare in my direction marston stomps back into the dark reaches of his mansion judge franklin pokes me in the chest her eyes cold i want you in my chambers at nine am mister she points to caitlin i want that videotape there as well will marston be there i ask thats not your concern destroying evidence is a felony judge franklins lips tighten until all i can see is the spiderwork of lines around her mouth the result of years of smoking cigarettes as we stare at each other a patrolwoman carries a charred box of files through the front door go home mr cage orders judge franklin and you will pay restitution for any physical damage to this property i am about to follow her advice when livy walks through the front door of tuscany in a voice that could shave a peach she says judge my name is livy marston sutter im here as counsel for my father leo marston those boxes contain files of marston sims clients and thus enjoy the protection of attorneyclient privilege judge franklin is momentarily taken aback but she recovers quickly theyll be as safe in my chambers as they will anywhere livy looks past her to me penn would you please tell me whats going on here i stand mute before her tonights events have cast us as enemies but even at this awkward moment part of me remains inside her linking us in the most primitive way you tell me livy who broke our windows i did caitlin says as though she would welcome another lawsuit livy gives her a glance of disdain whats lois lane doing here caitlin holds up the video camera making home movies sweet cheeks i dont think youre going to like them thats it says franklin get out of here both of you go back inside ms sutter your father was trying to destroy evidence livy i couldnt let that happen evidence you mean those old tax records daddy told me the day i got back that he needed to clean out his old files i helped him because of his bad back is she really trying to convince me that her motives are pure or is she using my presence as an opportunity to try to mitigate her culpability in the presence of judge franklin i said this meeting is over snaps franklin i take caitlins arm above the elbow and lead her away from the house soon were in darkness surrounded by the smells of wet grass and decaying leaves the pulse in her brachial artery is pounding like a tomtom what do you think she asks instead of answering i turn back and gaze through the dripping trees at tuscany what was once a temple of memory is now alien to me the gallery that once hosted so many lawn parties now creaks under the tramp of police boots and the sweet air of the grounds carries the tang of gunpowder after five generations of seclusion the world outside the gates has crashed through to tuscany with a vengeance my gaze drifts upward to the third floor where a solitary light glows in a high window framed in that window is an amorphous shape that confuses me at first but at last resolves into something human its the harridan head of maude marston once a celebrated beauty now a wreck ravaged by emotional pain and by the alcohol she uses to blunt it as caitlin takes my arm and pulls me along the drive i remember dwight stones penchant for quotes and i think what havoc hath he wrought in this great house chapter the two days after judge marstons attempt to destroy the files pass in a blur of work that reminds me what it is to be a working lawyer at nine oclock friday morning judge franklin and i agree to an unconventional compromise worthy of solomon without giving reasons she makes it clear that she prefers not to charge leo with obstruction of justice or contempt of court before i can argue this point she tells me she considered recusing herself from the case but rejected the idea because marston played as big a part in getting the black circuit judge elected as he did judge franklin we both know i can go to the judicial oversight committee to plead for relief but i sense that eunice franklin intends to offer me something what she offers is the boxes marston tried to destroy one of which contains three legal files as livy indicated marstons blatant attempt to destroy them has convinced judge franklin that he was attempting to hide evidence of criminal activity she feels that a case can be made to the court of appeal that marstons act justifies giving me access to these records moreover leo himself has agreed to this arrangement rather than be charged with obstruction or contempt this tells me that the files while probably damaging to marstons reputation will not contain proof of complicity in del paytons murder this agreement accomplished the judge and i spend a few minutes getting to know each other eunice franklin is fiftysix years old and graduated from the ole miss law school a year before del payton was killed i can only imagine what she must have endured during her three years at that temple of southern male traditionalism she is a bit defensive about her court and my bigtime experience in houston seems to be the cause of this she warns me that she will run her courtroom with at least as much discipline as i am accustomed to in the big city and perhaps more she will tolerate no antics or theatrics either from myself or from marstons attorney leo will be represented by blake sims the son of creswell sims his partner of forty years judge franklin has already instructed sims that considering the early trial date his client requested and got they should have all discovery materials in my hands by the close of the business day she expresses strong misgivings about my intention to represent myself at trial but says she cannot stop me from sabotaging my case if that is my intent she defends the trial date along the lines i predicted to caitlin and adds that the recent racial tensions and violence played a part in her decision with the mayoral election only four weeks away she wants my inflammatory statements about the payton murder resolved and hopefully forgotten by the time the voters walk into the polling booths on november leaving her chambers i feel a little better about the situation than i did walking in judge franklin owes marston some favors but leos attempt to destroy evidence has made her angry under the blaze of scrutiny this trial will draw eunice may stiffen her backbone and run a relatively impartial court the media frenzy is already underway tying men like john portman and leo marston to a dead black man is like waving a red cape in front of a herd of bulls twentyfour hours after my accusations hit the paper mississippi resumed its role as whipping boy for the nation on race celebrated authors and academics weighed in with windy and selfrighteous oped pieces in every major paper from new york to los angeles at the close of last nights newscast a somberfaced dan rather recalled his days covering civil rights in mississippi black media stars roundly condemned the state speaking as though the lynchings of the distant past were still daily occurrences contrary opinions were few and the battle was becoming embarrassingly onesided until this morning when into the fray charged my old friend sam jacobs the selfstyled mississippi jew who in a halfhumorous letter to the new york times pointed out that while mississippi might seem behind the times to outsiders it actually had its collective finger on the pulse of america the magnolia state sam opined had given the world william faulkner elvis presley and tennessee williams and while that holy trinity of american culture ought to be enough for anybody for skeptics there were also robert johnson richard wright jimmy rodgers and muddy waters leontyne price charley pride tammy wynette and john grisham howlin wolf bb king four miss americas and oprah winfrey and while boneheaded nuisances like the ku klux klan had committed atrocities to shame the south africans and slavery had come near to breaking an entire people you couldnt by god refine gold without a fire the state of israel was created from the ashes of the holocaust and mississippi was on its way to redemption why the legacy of blues music alone declared sam which was jazz and rock n roll had done more to end the cold war than all the thinblooded diplomats ever minted at harvard and yale how the times selected sams letter ill never know but it prompted my editor to telephone and read it aloud to me over breakfast claiming that the list of artists only bolstered his theory that great suffering produces great art and since id had my share of the former i should now move north to more civilized environs i declared myself a loyal southerner to the last and headed out for judge franklins office i forgot the article during our conference but after i loaded marstons charred file boxes into my trunk i heard a jackson disc jockey reading sams letter on the air as i drove to the natchez examiner building sam jacobs will be a household name throughout the south by nightfall caitlin has offered me her glasswalled conference room as a work space plus staff volunteers to help me wade through the files after i lug marstons boxes into the conference room she gathers her reporters photographers and interns for a brief orientation the examiner is used as a training ground for the masters media group thus the staff hails from all points of the compass not one among them is over thirty and all are rabid liberals i view this as a positive for when the marston camp discovers im using these kids against them theyll almost certainly try to bribe a few for inside information youth and leftwing politics may give my team an immunity to filthy lucre that i couldnt hope to find elsewhere caitlins speech is modeled on those given by army officers requesting volunteers for particularly dirty missions she succinctly summarizes my reasons for provoking the slander suit then in broad strokes describes what well be looking for in the mountain of paper that will arrive later in the day this is an unusual situation she concludes some of you may think im stepping over an ethical line by involving the paper in a legal proceeding that well be reporting on thats true enough but i stepped over a harder line when i printed mr cages charges well be reporting this story the way papers reported stories in the good old bad old days were throwing the full weight of our media group behind a cause a buzz of approval runs through her audience we are seeking the truth about a terrible crime and ill publish the truth as i find it whether it conforms to my preconceptions or not i think that lives up to the truest spirit of objectivity a burst of applause follows this two of the male reporters whose goatees make them look like anarchists in a sergei eisenstein film pump their fists in the air caitlin brushes an errant strand of hair from her eyes and goes on anyone who feels uncomfortable about this see me in my office youll be excused with no questions asked and no negative consequences a blond guy in the back says and go back to covering board of supervisors meetings at least theres comedy at the supervisor meetings squawks a darkhaired girl with a brooklyn accent try covering the flower shows caitlin holds up her hands before we disperse i want mr cage to say a few words facing the ring of expectant young faces i feel as i did addressing new assistant district attorneys in houston smart kids who concealed their idealism behind shells of aggressive cynicism first of all everyone here calls me penn no exceptions second when i made those charges against leo marston i had no intention of setting foot in a courtroom but marston is a powerful man and there is going to be a trial that trial is five days from now i have five days to prove leo marston guilty of murder skeptical sighs blow through the conference room the good news is hes guilty the bad news is the people who know that wont testify your job is to wade through documentary evidence youre looking for several things first illegal activity youre not lawyers but if it looks or smells dirty to you it probably is second any correspondence mentioning ray presley or the triton battery company third any reference to or correspondence with the federal government particularly with fbi director john portman or former director j edgar hoover whoa says one of the anarchists this is like xfiles man a ripple of laughter sweeps through the group this case may be more like the xfiles than any of us wants to believe i tell him just remember that none of you are fox mulder or agent scully okay people are dying in this town and theyre dying because of this case i dont want anybody in this room trying to win a pulitzer by going after ray presley hes killed before and he probably set the fire that killed ruby flowers he wouldnt hesitate to kill any of you if he felt you were a threat to him is that clear grim nods around the room are there any questions one of the goateed reporters raises his hand this murder happened thirty years ago its gone unsolved all that time do we have a hope in hell of solving it in a week youre assuming that someone has been trying to solve it this is a small town in small towns there are sometimes truths that everyone knows but no one mentions open secrets if you will no one really wants to probe the details because it forces us to face too many uncomfortable realities wed rather turn away than acknowledge the primitive forces working beneath the surface of society amen someone murmurs in the case of del payton no one knew exactly who planted the bomb that killed him but everyone believed they understood what had happened an uppity nigger got out of line so somebody stepped in and reminded the rest of them where the line was unpleasant but inevitable my easy use of the nword obviously shocks some members of the audience i believe this crime was misunderstood from the beginning del paytons death may have had nothing to do with civil rights or only peripherally to do with it his death may be oldfashioned murder masquerading as a race crime and understanding that could be the key to solving this case caitlin steps up beside me any other questions weve got work to do no more hands go up she sends everyone back to work with a twohanded scoot gesture after theyve gone she sits at the head of the conference table a skeptical look on her face penn do we have any hope of tying marston to ray presley or the crime scene in time for the trial that depends on what we find in the discovery material do you really believe marston would send you anything incriminating ive found some pretty big surprises during discovery in my career people make blunders i motion toward the boxes the police saved from the fireplace at tuscany last night and then theres that stuff maybe well get lucky caitlin nods but she doesnt look hopeful do you realize that almost every witness who knows anything you need to tell the jury would have to embarrass themselves terribly by testifying frank jones betty lou jackson not only that theyll be putting themselves in the killers sights your atf pal will testify and maybe lester hinson if you pay him enough but the rest no way thats what subpoenas are for youre not that naive portman marston and presley know about all these people or soon will and theyll try everything from bribes to murder to keep them quiet thats why we have to crack marstons nerve between now and next wednesday and if you cant then we pray our long shots come through and those are peter lutjens for one hes going for the payton file in two days ive been thinking about that what exactly is he going to try to do the file is fortyfour volumes long he cant walk out with it under his coat he cant even photocopy it unless he has all night he wont have to remember what stone told us in colorado the file is fortythree volumes of nothing and his final report thats all we need stones final report lutjens knows that i talked to him this morning whats the other long shot stone himself she shakes her head never happen hes too scared theyve got something on that guy stones not going to talk i disagree whatever dirt portman has on stone is a twoedged sword and stones conscience is working on him its been working on him for thirty years guilt is a powerful thing caitlin stone needs to unburden himself and i think hell come through for us or for himself rather what about ike ransom whats his story i think ikes got a personal grudge against marston that has nothing to do with payton he knew id go after marston if i had any kind of weapon so he gave me the payton case but has he given you any real information any idea of marstons motive for the crime not really she drums her fingers on the table motive means and opportunity right the means and opportunity are ray presley but were stuck on motive marston actually made public statements supporting civil rights in the sixties i found them in the morgue here i think its money somehow paytons death increased marstons fortune or power i cant see that financially payton was a nonentity maybe he was an obstacle to something some deal what about sex suggests caitlin sexual jealousy thats a common motive for murder the photo shrine in althea paytons house flits through my mind followed by images of del payton huddled over his dinner table with medgar evers talking about changing the white mans heart thats not it payton was a family man all the way thats what they all say until theyre caught with their weewees in the wrong cookie jar its not sex caitlin its money or power thats what marston lives for she sighs and gets up then drops her left hand on the charred box of files i hope theres something in here youve got to remember one thing im treating this like a murder case but its not its a civil case so so the standard of proof is lower i dont have to prove marstons guilt to twelve people beyond a reasonable doubt i have to convince nine jurors that it was more likely than not that marston was involved in the payton murder that means a fiftyone percent certainty and the jury wont have to agonize over their decision the way a criminal jury would because their verdict wont send marston to jail or to a gurney for lethal injection another jury will get that job caitlin moves toward the door i think youre going to have a hell of a job convincing those nine people unless you figure out why marston would want payton dead and prove it when she opens the door the goateed anarchists pop through it with their sleeves rolled up and smirks on their faces mulder and scully reporting for duty says one caitlin shakes her head and walks out leaving me to deal with my new assistants in the forty hours between the end of my lecture on friday and dawn on sunday we built a circumstantial case against leo marston the only sleep i got was brief naps on the couch in caitlins office taken while reporters photographers and interns worked in shifts over the boxes of marston papers that arrived in desultory waves from storage rooms unknown only my anarchists who did have actual names peter and ed prosaically enoughkept pace with me during this marathon they seemed to see it as a holy mission one in which iconoclasts could cheerfully take part daniel kelly moved through the building like the ghost at the feast making wry observations delivering coffee and disappearing for brief reconnaissance patrols which he called checking the perimeter whenever caitlin left the building to cover a story kelly went with her the police scanner in her office enabled her to reach the scene of several racial altercations before the cops did most of these involved two or three individuals and broke out in stores or restaurants where inflammatory language was easily overheard on two occasions these fights escalated into brawls and kelly proved his value both times by protecting caitlin with his rather alarming skills saturday morning ed the anarchist decided we needed fresh inspiration so he sat down with a computer and inkjet printer and went to work an hour later he walked into the conference room wearing a tshirt with nail boss hog emblazoned across the chest in red i found it hard to believe that ed had ever watched an episode of the dukes of hazzard but he assured me hed followed it religiously as a child growing up in michigan and that most of his ideas about the south had been formed by this grotesque television show by that afternoon half the examiner staff was wearing nail boss hog shirts and their galvanizing effect was undeniable even caitlin popped into the conference room wearing one but the work itself was tedious and exhausting the master map that guided us on our paper journey into marstons past was his tax return it listed most of his business holdings the number of schedule cs and es was astounding and i immediately began drafting a supplemental request for production using these as a guide his form showed an adjusted gross income of over two million dollars for and the sheer variety of his holdings was staggering real estate manufacturing banking timber and despite the moribund oil business he had recently struck a significant gas field in south texas what fascinated me was the variety of small enterprises in which he participated several fastfood franchises around town a steam laundry a christmas tree farm hunting camps apartment buildings in the black sections of town we even found a scrawled note listing income he had realized from arranging private adoptions over a period of twentyfive years in short leo marston appeared to administer an empire of great and small dominions all entirely aboveboard on closer examination however a dark underside began to show itself one of the boxes leo had planned to burn contained records of a collection agency wholly owned by him listed as an officer of that company was one raymond aucoin presley this was the first tangible proof of a connection between marston and presley we found copies of letters sent to hundreds of local citizens demanding payment of debts on everything from materials bought through marston companies to personal loans made by the judge it wasnt hard to guess what function presley served when these letters failed to bring payment of the outstanding balances most important he was operating in this capacity during while serving as a natchez police officer and in the month del payton was murdered closer inspection of marstons other companies revealed that presley was listed as a paid security consultant to several of them another of the burn boxes contained records of land transfers made to marston or his business partners i noted the disturbing frequency with which the parcels of land had been sold by recent widows whose estates marstons firm had handled many other sellers could be crossindexed to debtors listed in the collectionagency box it was a letter from this box that gave me my first glimmer of a possible motive for paytons murder the letter pertained to a large parcel of land south of town near the present industrial park it was written in an oblique style but from it i inferred that marston had used a secret intermediary to buy this parcel of land thus while marston was not legally the owner he controlled the parcels future use and would receive all monies from such use without anyone but the intermediary knowing about it a related letterthis one from one zebulon hickson the owner of several carpet factories in georgia and alabama expressed interest in purchasing this land for use as a site for a new factory hickson also expressed concern about labor conditions in adams county he was aware that natchez had long been a union town but what concerned him more was the wave of racial unrest sweeping through southern factories this was clearly a euphemism for nigger trouble what made all this interesting was that the letters had changed hands in january a few months before del payton died the situation was oddly similar to the present one in which leo marston owns the land basf needs to have adequate space for its projected facility on saturday night things began to turn our way i had requested marstons telephone records but with the trial only a week away i had little hope of getting them technically phone records can be had at the touch of a computer key but the phone company is a hidebound bureaucracy and in actuality it can take weeks to get them id put in a call to a bell south executive in jackson who promised to try to expedite the process and apparently he did a local bell south technician arrived saturday night with a manila envelope containing marstons phone records logging all calls beginning the day before caitlins libelous article ran i hurried to caitlins office and we pored over the printouts together on the day the article ran there was a call from marstons law office to a number in washington dc at pm caitlin quickly confirmed this number as the main switchboard at the hoover building headquarters of the fbi the call lasted eighteen minutes one hour later marstons office had received a call from dc this one from a different number which turned out to be john portmans office in the hoover building in all six calls passed between marstons office and the hoover building that day and several more had since we could now prove that a link existed between leo marston and the director of the fbi who had worked the del payton murder as a field agent in when marston was district attorney and while we could not know what was said during those calls their timing indicated that they were almost certainly related to the payton case caitlins father faxed us a steady stream of information on both marston and portman marstons mississippi history was familiar to me but his national political activities werent he is not only a powerful force in the mississippi republican party but he also has major influence in the national gop like many mississippians marston was a nominal democrat for most of his life voting democratic in local elections and republican in presidential races but in the reagan era he jumped ship and voted gop straight down the line a close friend and adviser of senators john stennis and big jim eastlandmississippi democrats whose seniority gave them unparalleled power on capitol hill for decadesmarston became a major supporter of senator trent lott who eventually rose to the position of senate majority leader john portmans thumbnail biography fascinated me born to old money in connecticut while his father patrolled the coast of rhode island for german uboats in his yacht portman was raised in a cloistered world of governesses and squash courts he attended choate then yale where he was tapped for skullandbones and graduated second in his class at yale law he was the right age for vietnam but did not serve perhaps owing to a dearth of yacht units and while the fbi seemed an odd choice for a blueblooded lawyer during the reagan era these street credentials fueled portmans meteoric rise into the upper ranks of the justice department his stellar legal career as a us attorney and federal judge was crowned by the poetic symmetry of returning to the fields where hed begun no longer a foot soldier but a general and the media ate this up the hanratty affair provided the only bump in the road to his confirmation as fbi director and since nothing could be proved that came to naught portman sailed through the hearings without further trouble and he has ruled the bureau without a public misstep ever since in short john portman appeared to be a tefloncoated bureaucrat with no visible weaknesses his evasion of vietnam service might be fertile ground for tabloids but that wouldnt help my case any and there was probably nothing to it anyway or it would have exploded during his confirmation hearings the more i learned about him the more i became certain that the only way i would uncover his secrets would be if dwight stone decided to break his silence or if peter lutjens succeeded in stealing stones final report from the payton file in the fbi archive as i waded through the mountains of paper eyes blurring pulse skipping from caffeine the tragedies of the past few days began to weigh heavily upon me id involved myself in the del payton case for essentially selfish reasons and because of my actions my parents house had been destroyed my daughter terrorized and ruby flowers murdered the sad irony was that i had returned to natchez to help heal my daughter yet she had not received my full attention for many days and had not even seen me for the past two yet something drove me on despite the selfishness that had initiated my quest i sensed a new yet familiar energy stirring inside me as i pored over the yellowed documents and musty ledgers doing the sort of work i had done as a young lawyer the sterile hollowness and freefloating anxiety i had felt in the months after sarahs death began to fall away i felt alive again and i knew this annie would fare far better with a father who was fully engaged with the world than with one grasping at meaning while clinging to the past i was not laboring in a vacuum i was surrounded by idealistic kids who had no doubt they were on the right side of a noble quest for justice during the fortyhour marathon rumors and snippets of information filtered into the examiner building that opinions in natchez were not as clearcut or onesided as i had imagined many whites interviewed about the payton case stated on the record that if del paytons killer could be found he should pay the maximum price no matter who he might be or how much time had passed they regretted that the battle between myself and marston had generated such bad publicity for the town but justice they said had to be served a consensus was building that the rest of the nation had to be shown that mississippi was not afraid to confront its old demons if and when they could be dragged into the light the rumored riot of a few nights ago never materialized on saturday afternoon local black leaders staged a silent march to commemorate rubys death and the hushed procession walked without incident from the bandstand on the bluff to the crossroads of st catherine street and liberty road where slaves had been auctioned before the civil war the symbolism of this destination was not lost on whites but black restraint in the face of rubys murder was seen as a signal of black faith in natchezs justice system the real whirlwind was taking place outside mississippi we stood in the eye of a media storm quietly going about the business of justice while national figures raged and pontificated about our backwardness i soon began to see this as a metaphor for the payton case itself yes ray presley was probably the man who planted the bomb that killed del payton and perhaps leo marston had ordered him to do it but it was clear to me that they had not acted alone j edgar hoover had not sealed the payton file because it could potentially embarrass the state of mississippi and john portman was not threatening me or punishing peter lutjens because of the local implications of this case nor was the fearsomely equipped sniper who shot at me from the levee the type of hit man an angry southern businessman like leo marston would typically hire still more disturbing i had begun to recall dwight stones comment about the timing of paytons slaying del was killed five weeks after martin luther king and three weeks before robert kennedy could there possibly have been some connection between a black factory worker in natchez mississippi and the explosive national politics of as i pondered this question my motive which had begun as a quest for revenge and evolved with livys arrival into an exorcism of my past began to change again like a stubborn coal lying dormant in the ashes a desire for truth flickered awake in my brain fanned to life this glowing ember dimmed the baser motives that had brought me thus far revenge against leo marston is a hollow and perhaps even selfdestructive goal for by destroying him would i not also destroy the second chance ive been granted for a life with livy and what of my hunger for explanations from livy is it her fault that ive carried confusion and bitterness inside me for twenty years like shrapnel from some undecided war a war that a more mature man would have put behind him long ago ten years before livy disappeared from my life del payton was brutally murdered thats whats important thats what has brought death back to this quiet town and put the lives of those i love in mortal danger i have but one riddle to answer ike the spike told me that from the beginning not who killed del payton but why because the why of it is as alive today as it was in and therein lies the answer to all my other questions the relief that accompanied this liberating insight put me into a dead sleep on the couch in caitlins office late saturday night when sunday dawned this was the sum of our knowledge a potential land deal in that involved marston and a georgia industrialist concerned with racial labor problems in natchez a deal that as far as we could determine was never consummated phone records proving suspicious contact between marston and john portman and proof that ray presley had worked as a security consultant for marston at the time of the payton murder and while employed by the police department it was a good harvest for forty hours work but with the trial only three days away it wasnt nearly enough all the nail boss hog tshirts in the world wouldnt put me one step closer to proving marstons complicity in the murder and without that i would never unravel the tangled skein of lies corruption and official silence that made del paytons unpunished murder such a travesty and forced my native state to bear the sole guilt which by rights should have been shared with others i needed a witness a star witness i needed peter lutjens or dwight stone at eleven am on sunday i was about to call stone to set up a secure call when caitlin stuck a cup of scalding coffee in my hand and told me to go home and get dressed for rubys funeral which was scheduled to begin in three hours chapter there is no more moving religious spectacle than a black funeral if youve been to one you know if you havent you dont grief and remembrance are not sacrificed to the false gods of propriety and decorum but released into the air like primal music channeled through the congregation in a collective discharge of pain rubys funeral should be like that but it isnt its a ritual struggling under the weight of a political circus the church itself is under siege when i arrive annie in the backseat with my parents kelly in front with me the other argus men in a second car behind us sited on a hill in a stand of oak and cedar trees the oneroom white structure stands at the center of an army of vehicles including a half dozen television trucks parked in a cluster beside the small cemetery lines of parked cars stretched down both sides of the church drive to kingston road the winding old twolane blacktop leading to the southern part of the county where the cold hole bubbles up from the swamp a blacksuited deacon waves us away from the drive but kelly ignores him and accelerates up the chute created by the parked cars stopping only when he reaches the church steps camera crews instantly surround the bmw an old whitehaired black man appears on the steps and jabs a finger at the human feeding frenzy around us a wave of young men in their sunday best rolls into the reporters pushing them bodily away from the car assisted by the three argus men who drove up behind us the old man comes down the steps and opens the back door of our car im so sorry about this dr cage afternoon mrs cage im reverend nightingale yall come inside one of these young mens will park your car for you annie climbs between the seats into my arms and i hurry up the steps with her as the camera crews close around us a cacophony of shouted questions fills the air but all i can distinguish are names marston portman mackey mayor warren as soon as we clear the church door i turn and see my mother and father fighting their way through a deacon slams the door behind them leaving kelly outside to help defend the entrance two hundred black faces are turned toward the rear of the church staring at us people are jammed into the pews and packed along the walls like cordwood the building seems to have more flesh in it than air only the center aisle is clear reverend nightingale takes my mothers arm and leads her along it through the silent staring faces dad and i follow me carrying annie in my arms the rear pews hold a bright sea of color oscillating waves of blue orange yellow and green but no red never red and like proud sails above the waves the most stunning array of hats i have seen outside of a s film all the children are dressed in white like angels in training as i follow my mother rubys voice sounds in my mind you never wear red to no funeral red says the dead person was a fool the nearer we get to the altar the darker the dresses get until finally all are black at the end of the aisle reverend nightingale pulls my mother to the left and i see our destination a special box of pews standing against the wall protected by a wooden rail despite the throng in the church this box is empty its the mothers bench seats reserved for sisters who have reached a certain age eighty i think and accepted mother status today it has been reserved for us as we take our seats behind the rail i see an identical box against the other wall the deacons bench behind its rail sits rubys immediate family her husband mose her three sons all tall men with gray in their beards her daughter elizabeth wiping her eyes with a handkerchief a handful of grandchildren all in their twenties and two infants a single camera crew has been allowed inside the church to tape the ceremony the logo on the camera reads wlbt the call letters of the blackowned station in jackson as i pan across the crowd i see several familiar faces in the first row sits shad johnson wearing a suit that cost enough to buy any ten suits behind him a few feet down the same pew sits the payton family althea georgia del jr and his children althea nods to me her brown eyes full of sympathy in the second row sits the gates family the most powerful force in black politics in natchez for forty years now upstaged by the urban prodigal from chicago several pews beyond them sits willie pinder the former police chief pinder winks as i catch his eye and in the last pew sitting restlessly in the aisle seat as though prepared to make a quick exit sits a man who looks very much like charles evers the former mayor of fayette and brother of medgar looks like a man who does not intend to be bothered by anyone suddenly the back door opens and two white faces float through it caitlin masters and one of her photographers escorted by deputy ike ransom in his uniform ike remains just inside the back door like a sentry while caitlin and her photographer slip through the crowd at the back wall and stop beside the wlbt camera in the shuffling sweating silence the organist begins to play and the purplerobed choir rises to its feet beginning a restrained rendition of jesus keep me near the cross the rich vibrato of two dozen voices fills the building making the church reverberate like the soundboard of a grand piano the whole congregation knows the words and they join in softly as the last chorus fades reverend nightingale makes his way slowly down the aisle and ascends to the pulpit he is a small man with fine white hair and frail limbs but his voice has the deep resonant timbre of the best black preachers brothers and sisters mothers deacons and officers visitors and friends we are gathered here today to mourn the passing of sister ruby flowers a collective mmhm ripples through the church punctuated by a couple of soft amens reverend nightingale touches the rim of his spectacles and continues everyone in this room knows how loyally sister flowers supported this church she was born in and came to jesus when she was nine years old reverend early was pastor then he was a godly man but sparing with his praise yet as a boy i often heard him speak of how lucky he was to have womenfolk like sister flowers in his flock yes lord comes the reply yes sir in the last few days a lot of reporters been asking me what sister flowers was like do you know what i tell them tell it i say you know how when you got two people and you got to carry something heavy for a ways like a big chest of drawers theres different ways you can pick up on it you can pick up on it straight and level with your legs and your back and take your share of the weightreverend nightingale pauses letting the image sink inor you can kind of fudge it pick up with just your arms or pick up a little high puttin most of the weight on the other person soft laughter guilty recognition but reverend nightingales face is set in stone that was not sister flowers he thunders no jesus comes the chorus i know thats right sister flowers picked up square and straight he declares she picked up whenever she was asked to and more than that she picked up when she wasnt asked to praise jesus sister flowers was not a rich woman the reverend says in a conversational tone but she gave unstintingly of the money she made she had a generous heart she bought flour and sugar and butter and she baked cakes deep into the night to sell to raise money for the poor nightingale raises his right hand forefinger extended toward heaven during the depression sister flowers visited white families collecting old coats and sweaters hats shoes and mittens for the wintertime bringing them out here to kids who didnt have nothing between them and the cold the finger descends admonitory now you children today smirk and turn up your nose when i say old coats and old shoes but what you dont knowand you better thank god you dont know is that when youre cold youll take whatever coat you can get and praise jesus for it lord yes praise jesus reverend nightingale turns to the deacons bench and remarks on what fine children ruby raised my parents always felt rubys children didnt do enough for her after they were grown considering the sacrifices shed made for them but they did what ruby most desired that they do went north and found good jobs raised families part of the price of their success may have been embarrassment at their mothers humble position or confusion at her unwillingness to leave mississippi a place they regarded as backward and evil sister flowers was not seriously ill or afflicted reverend nightingale says soberly she was taken before her time by the hand of a stranger the police dont know who set that terrible fire but i know who it was a gasp of shock from the pews it was a man cut off from the lord that man is suffering right now today and i hope hell soon see the only way to wash his soul is to come forward confess his sins and pay the price of justice reverend nightingale grips the forward edge of the podium with both hands and i know why this man killed sister flowers because he wanted to stop mr penn cage from finding out who killed brother delano payton silence blankets the room every eye focuses on me now some of you may feel anger toward mr cage because of what happened to sister flowers but not one soul in this room should blame him because penn cage is doing what no manwhite or blackhas done in the last thirty years he is putting himself and his family on the line to find out who murdered brother del and why was del killed reverend nightingale slams a hand against the podium with a report like a pistol shot to keep the black man in this community down to keep honest black men from getting a leg up to keep us from making a working wage at a good job a job with some dignity he removes a white cotton handkerchief from his coat pocket and wipes his forehead the mass of bodies is turning the little building into a convection oven you may wonder why mr cage a white man is doing what hes doing he must be gonna make some money some way right he must want to get on oprah with a book or something but thats not it no sir ill tell you why mr cage is doing what hes doing hes doing it because he was raised by sister flowers my mothers hand closes around mine and he wasnt raised by sister flowers alone he was raised by dr tom cage and dr cage been takin care of black people in this town for nigh on forty years if you couldnt pay did dr cage turn you away from the door a great tide of no sir lord no issues forth from the congregation and rolls through the church accompanied by shaking heads and murmurs of gratitude when i turn to my left i see a sight i have never seen in my life my father sitting with his head bowed staring resolutely at the floor his jaw muscles clenched as tears run down his face and mrs cage says reverend nightingale mrs cage was one of the ladies who helped sister flowers gather up them old coats in the wintertime and made sure they got where they needed to get he smiles at my mother and goes on thursday last after that newspaper story ran about del i asked sister flowers about penn cage you know what she said she said pastor that boy was raised right and hell do whatever hes got to do to make things right about del ruby and i never discussed the payton case but the realization that she knew i was working on it and approved eases my conscience in a way nothing else could some of you older members may remember says nightingale that del payton visited this church several times when he was a boy del was a member of beulah baptist out to pine ridge but that boy had too fine a voice to confine it to one house of worship several sundays we were blessed to have del solo here at mandamus and many a familyreverend nightingale says famblyrequested del for solos at funerals i know right now del is beatifying heaven with that sweet voice preparing the host of angels to receive sister flowers praise jesus answers the chorus right now were going to have a solo by sister lillian lilly sister lilly is a gospel recording artist from jackson and shes come down to bless us with her talents afterwards brother shadrach johnson wants to speak to you for a few minutes you all know brother johnson is running for mayor and the elections getting close he believes whats happened in the past few days is important to us all and hes gonna talk to you about that sister winans from the midst of the choir a woman in a flowing blue gown rises folds her hands before her and begins singing precious lord with such raw power and authentic faith that the initial cries of sing it sing it fade to awed silence and many of the elderly members of the congregation weep openly when she takes her seat again the air is brittle with expectation and it is then that shad johnson stands and walks up to the podium how must he look to this audience in his twothousanddollar suit that shines like a deuceandaquarter on saturday night he must look i believe like a savior brothers and sisters he begins in a gentle voice when i came into this church i thought i was a stranger to sister ruby flowers but when i heard reverend nightingales impassioned eulogy i knew i was wrong i knew a hundred women like sister flowers when i was growing up here in natchez five hundred probably strong black women who sacrificed everything so that their children could climb one step higher up the ladder to a better life yes lord shad nods to his left and the assistant i saw at his headquarters hurries toward the back of the church he stops beside the wlbt cameraman and says a few words the cameraman looks confused but a moment later he shrugs and touches the controls on the tripodmounted camera brothers and sisters shad resumes ive asked that the camera be turned off so that i can speak frankly to you we all know whats happening in this town why theres so much agony in our hearts today sister flowers died hard she died scarred and in terrible pain she died at the hands of a murderer undoubtedly at the hands of a white murderer and the consequences of that act are tearing this community apart at this moment two of our children are sitting in jail for taking the life of a man who once ordered the beatings and murders of african americans you feel anger over this you feel rage and thats only natural shad holds up his hands and brings them softly together but ive come here today to ask you to set aside that rage because we are poised on the brink of a great victory the plantation mentality that has paralyzed this town for so long is finally eroding from the inside out significant numbers of white people have grown tired of the selfaggrandizement and profiteering of men like riley warren and those are the people who can put me into the mayors office not you my good friends lord knows i need every one of you but without those good white people all our work will have been for naught the sacrifices of ruby flowers and del payton all for nothing think about that del payton died thirty years ago he died for civil rights but how much better off are you really than you were in you can drink from the public water fountain you can go into a restaurant and eat next to white people but can you afford to pay the check how good a job can you get if this violence escalates any more i dont think well ever see those men from basf in town again there are too many towns where things are peaceful to put a good plant like that in a trouble spot so johnson lays his hands on the podium what am i asking you to do only the same thing jesus asked its the hardest thing in the world brothers and sisters especially for you younger men i want you to turn the other cheek keep cool because if you do the meek are going to start inheriting a little of this mississippi earth shad turns slowly giving every person in the room a chance to look him in the eye then stops facing me and im asking penn cage right here and now to withdraw his charges against judge leo marston a low murmur moves through the congregation even reverend nightingale looks caught by surprise after the election shad goes on therell be plenty of time to probe the death of del payton and with me running the city you can rest assured that will happen but further pressure on marston at this point could keep riley warren in the mayors office for another four years and we simply cannot afford that shad is staring at me as though he expects me to rise and answer him here at the funeral of a woman i loved like a second mother every eye in the church is upon me as though pulled by the collective will of the congregation i start to stand but my mothers hand flattens on my thigh pushing me back onto the bench at that moment althea payton rises from the first pew and looks around the church she speaks softly but in the silent room every word rings with conviction thirty years ago my husband was taken from me murdered for thirty years ive waited for justice and no man alive has lifted a finger to help me get it without i paid him money last week i went to mr penn cage and asked him to help me and he did althea raises her eyes to the pulpit from which shad stares like an attorney facing a dangerously unpredictable witness and points at him that man there wants to be our mayor hes come down from chicago special to do it and he might be a good one he sure talks a good game but i know this he never came to my house and offered to help me find out who killed my man and to stand up here like this to use this poor ladys funeral to tell a good man to stop trying to do good so he can get elected well it dont sit right with me mrs payton i think youve misunderstood my motives shad says in an unctuous voice i understand more than you think althea replies get me elected you say then ill do good but like the man said a long time ago if not now when tell him comes a shout from the back pews yes lord from the choir stand if not now when shad is about to respond when reverend nightingale eases him away from the pulpit with a forced smile althea retakes her pew as the reverend smooths his jacket and says i thank brother johnson for that thoughtful comment we sure have a lot to think about these days now the service is almost over but i think id be remiss if i didnt give our white friends a chance to speak today this is unexpected but in the silence that follows my mother stands and turns to the congregation her voice is softer than altheas but it too carries in the church ruby worked for our family for thirtyfive years she says we considered her part of our family and we always will and she sits down the expression on shad johnsons face makes it clear that he views this statement as white paternalism at its worst but the faces in the pews say something different reverend nightingale closes the funeral with a prayer then directs the choir to sing amazing grace the pallbearers carry rubys casket down the aisle and out the front door preceded by the deacons who act as an informal security force hustling reporters away from the door with the help of daniel kelly and the argus men the congregation waits for our family to depart then follows us out and soon we are all gathered in the small graveyard beside the church while five camera crews film steadily from the perimeter of the crowd rubys coffin lies above the freshly turned earth on straps that will lower her into the ground when the graveside service is done as reverend nightingale begins his prayer a horn honks loudly from kingston road blaring again and again but thankfully dropping in pitch as the vehicle goes on down the road while a cameraman runs off to try to get a shot of the heckler reverend nightingale increases his volume and pushes right through the twentythird psalm when he finishes he turns to the gathered mourners the family will remain seated the members will please turn away from the body though unfamiliar with this custom i obey from the air this would look strange indeed two hundred people gathered in a circle around a hole in the ground facing away from it im not sure of the significance of this ritual but turning away from death is sometimes the best thing we can do reverend nightingale recites another brief prayer including the words ashes to ashes dust to dust and the congregation walks away from the grave as one a half dozen younger black men remain behind beside a loose stack of shovels and i remain with them after rubys children drop flowers into the grave they start toward their cars with their own children i shake hands with them as they pass and express my condolences i sense different reactions in each but all are courteous when rubys casket reaches the bottom of the grave i pick up one of the shovels and spade it into the soft pile of earth dad starts to join me but i touch his chest reminding him of his heart trouble and he rejoins my mother and annie at the edge of the little cemetery i feel like it should be raining but the sun is hot on the back of my suit jacket as we shovel the diminishing pile of dirt over the gleaming casket i think of the white funerals i have attended how everyone walks away at the end of the graveside service leaving the coffin to be covered by a backhoe or by couple of unknown gravediggers this way is better we should be covered into the earth by people who loved us after the grave is full and tamped down and the camera crews have shot all the footage they want only a few people remain on the hill my parents stand with annie and reverend nightingale beside the bmw which someone has brought from wherever it was parked kelly and his associates drift around the edge of the hill looking for possible threats caitlin and the photographer sit on the church steps fiddling with a camera as ike ransom watches after reverend nightingale toddles off toward his baby blue cadillac ike beckons me to the side of the church out of earshot of caitlin and the photographer i walk over and speak to my parents then join ike what you got he growls stepping around me so that i can see no one but him the blood vessels in his eyes form a red network around the dark irises and the smell of cheap whisky blows past me with every word you got enough to nail marston on wednesday im working on it working the trials three days from now you think i dont know that so tell me what you got i quickly summarize my case from frank jones to betty lou beckham and everyone in between will that bitch testify in open court ike asks loudly enough to be heard across the hill betty lou i dont know shes scared of presley and her husband doesnt want her to testify ive got my father working on her what about tying presley to marston ive got something working i say grudgingly thinking of peter lutjens who at this moment may be risking prison to get a copy of stones original fbi report ike grabs my wrist his grip like a claw what you talking about i jerk my hand free ill let you know if it works out his glare is disquieting is stone helping you no you ask him to testify he wont look i need to go my familys waiting you aint telling me shit man you need to get some sleep ike sleep let me tell you something i been thinking i been thinking i messed up coming to you you may put presley in jail but that aint nothing hes dying anyway marstons laughing at you man old shad may be right about you leaving this alone even though the nigger be a little bright for my taste im going now ike he grabs my arm you keep me posted right i nod slowly let go of my wrist he looks down at the junction of our limbs as though unaware he has hold of me as the hand relaxes a question comes to me are you a member of this church ike me baptist im catholic man holy family youve known more than youve told me from the start whatever you have nows the time to tell me his head moves forward then back like a man falling asleep at the wheel of a car you think im playing the quiet game too a faint smile as though at a private joke i told you man everybody keeps something back its the only way to stay safe im gone ike be careful okay when i come around the corner of the church everyone is waiting in the cars but caitlin and kelly caitlin says something to him then breaks away and meets me halfway what was all that about she asks it sounded like he was yelling at you hes drunk hes losing his nerve as the trial gets closer what about you solid as a rock she smiles i couldnt believe shad put you on the spot like that are you going to report what he said he said it hes responsible for it good have you heard anything from peter lutjens not yet you think he really has the nerve to try for that file if he doesnt hes going to spend a lot of winters shoveling snow in north dakota god i hope he gets it if he doesnt theres still stone dont hold your breath you want to come back to the paper and wade through some files ill help not yet im going to take a drive my parents and annie are riding back with the argus guys caitlin takes my hand want some company not this time i squeeze her hand but thanks for offering she looks off toward kingston road youre taking kelly on this ride right no she looks back at me her eyes worried then suspicious she drops my hand tell livy i said hello livy i have no intention of seeing livy kelly can come if he wants but in his own car i just want to be alone for a while her eyes soften im sorry i understand ill tell him she rises on tiptoe and kisses me on the cheek keep your eyes open i will chapter sometimes we think we are moving randomly but random behavior is rare in humans we are always spiraling around something whether we see it or not a secret center of gravity with the invisible power of a black hole as a teenager most of my aimless rides led me past tuscany usually i would drive past the entrance hoping to catch sight of livy entering or leaving in her car but a few times at night i would idle up the long driveway it wasnt gated then and look up at her lighted window staring at it like a caveman at a fire then turn around and continue my endless orbit a ritual that left me perpetually unsatisfied but which i was powerless to stop after rubys funeral i circumnavigate the county on its back roads hurtling along gravel lanes with kelly in my wake driving his rented taurus like a planet and its moon we circle the town and the mystery that lies at the heart of it often the act of driving acts as a catalyst that allows the information banging around in my subconscious to order itself in a new way today is different today the emotional fallout from the funeral will not dissipate reverend nightingales portrayal of my unselfish motives shamed me in a way ive never felt before as he stood there praising me i felt like a soldier who ran from battle being mistakenly awarded a silver star at the other extreme was my anger at shad johnson who hijacked rubys funeral for his own political ends and yet if i were black his suggestion that i retract my charges against marston would make sense my public statements may already have frightened liberal whites who might have voted for shad into casting their ballots for wiley warren and the status quo after an hour of driving the secret heart of my troubled orbit finally reveals itself for the past week ive been acting like a writer i was a prosecutor for twice as long as ive been a novelist and i should have been thinking like one at least my hands know where to take me if my brain doesnt im on the church hill road less than a mile from ray presleys trailer when i pull off beside the dilapidated structure kelly parks behind me gets out and jogs up to my window whats up boss who lives here the man who killed del payton i think he killed ruby too kelly winces and what are we doing here what i should have done days ago he squints and looks up the twolane road i didnt sign on to kill anybody or to watch it done im just going to talk to him he gives me a skeptical look that sounds an awful lot like im just going to put it in a little way i mean it im here to talk but this asshole is dangerous i assume you wont stand on ceremony if he tries to kill me he makes the first move i got no problem punching his ticket come on then i get out and walk toward the trailer kelly on my heels were ten feet from the concrete steps when the front door bangs open and presley yells from inside thats far enough what the hell you doing here cage i want to talk to you whos that hippie a friend is he carrying you bet your ass a long pause i got nothing to say to you except youre playing mighty fast and loose with your daddys future all that shit youre saying in the papers you havent heard my proposition ray you might just save your life by listening however much youve got left anyway yeah fuck you you could save your daddy from going to jail by shutting the hell up and going back to houston my father will never go to jail for the mobile thing ray but you will if you open your mouth a bluejay cries raucously in the silence the sound like a rusty gate closing you got two minutes calls presley but the hippie stays out there i look back at kelly who walks casually past me and up to the open door his hands held out to his sides i cant hear what he says but when hes done he walks back to me and gives me the ok sign what did you say to him i made sure he understood that hurting you would be a bad idea he understands watch the girl in the corner though she looks shaky holding my hands in plain view i walk up the three steps and into the trailer the stink of mildew and rotting food hits me in a wave as though the trailer hasnt been opened for days as my eyes adjust to the dimness i see ray standing by his wall of police memorabilia hes dressed just as he was the other day pajama pants tanktop wifebeater tshirt and the john deere cap pressed over his naked skull hes also holding a shotgun which is aimed in my general direction and wearing a shoulder holster with the butt of a large handgun protruding from it deeper in the gloom on the couch by the iv caddy sits the pallid blonde i saw on my first visit her legs are folded beneath her and shes clenching a rifle in her hands she looks nervous enough to pull the trigger without provocation so talk says presley ive got three days to prove leo marston conspired to kill del payton he snorts maybe you can find out who killed the kennedys before wednesday too i know you killed del ray not even a tremor in the narrow face i know you lied about the dynamite you planted those blasting caps i also know the murder wasnt your idea the eyes blink slowly in the shadows like a snakes you dont know shit youll find out different on wednesday the shotgun barrel moves closer to me you cant prove i killed that nigger because i didnt kill him come on ray whats the point in lying now he chuckles softly you know how people say that boy dont know nothing well you dont even suspect nothing if youll tell the da how the payton murder really went downif youll give up marstonill get the da to grant you full immunity immunity for murder your testimony would force marston to plead guilty if leo cuts a deal it saves the city the embarrassment of a public trial for a race murder thats what the powersthatbe want rat out judge marston and john portman a short bark of a laugh boy youre so goddamn stupid im surprised you made it through law school what you think portman had to do with anything i dont know but i know hes scared enough to try to kill you to keep you quiet the nerve in presleys left cheek twitches that weasel he wasnt shit in sixtyeight he is now and hell try again hes got too much to lose cut a deal you shortcircuit the whole trial itll all be over before portman knows what hit him presley waves the shotgun furiously you think i give a fuck if that trial happens what do i care if the niggers run wild in the streets let the goddamn bleeding hearts see what happens when there aint nobody like me around to keep the jungle bunnies in line he turns his head and spits through a narrow door which i hope is the bathroom then he says youre working with a nigger on this aint you you mean althea payton shit no that nigger deputy ransom dont know him dont try to lie boy you aint had the practice that ransom aint right in the head never has been since the army he did dope and turned on his own people he sucked that bottle like a tit for twenty years the boy cant hardly function without a football in his hand you ever ask yourself why he wants marston so bad i say nothing i knew ike when he was with the pd his old shit will drag him down quick as it will me youre not listening ray if im forced to put on my case youll be indicted for murder before sundown wednesday i guarantee it presley squints at me as though measuring me for a shroud you keep pushing for that trial you wont live to see wednesday and that fag bodyguard you got out there wont be able to help you none whos going to kill me you me i aint leaving this trailer do the deal ray its your only chance me and the judge go back thirty years i aint no punk to roll over on my friends you think leo marston is your friend he jabs the shotgun at me i know you aint the blondes eyes track me over the sights of her rifle all the way to the door i shouldnt say another word but rubys blood is calling to me from the ground where were you tuesday afternoon ray he cuts his eyes at the blonde then looks back at me a smug light in his eyes i believe i was delivering a message in town a message i repeat recalling the flames eating through the roof of our house the smell of rubys cooking flesh my hands ball into fists at my sides i dont think it got received though he says i step within two feet of him im going to settle that score you piece of shit youre going to die in the parchman infirmary they dont stock your mexican cocktail there and there arent any blondes to take the edge off as you like to put it not girls anyway his thin lips part in a predatory smile revealing small white teeth youll be dead before i will its coming now and you dont even see it when i open the door the sun hits my eyes like a flashbulb but it feels good to get out of the stinking trailer kelly is standing by the cars accomplish anything he asks no when i reach the cars he pats me on the shoulder lets go back to town boss one of the things that has always separated natchez from other mississippi towns is that if you want a drink you can get it no matter the day or hour kelly suggests the under the hill saloon a national treasure of a bar but a big crowd gathers there on sundays to watch the sun set over the river and they start celebrating early a crowd is not what i want right now the bar at biscuits and blues is oak and runs a good thirty feet down one wall with a mirror behind it and glittering bottles and glasses stacked in front the restaurant is empty but for a couple eating in a booth against the wall opposite the bar clanks and clatters filter through the heavy kitchen doors but otherwise the atmosphere is perfect i order scotch kelly the same our reflections watch us from the mirror behind the bar like solemn relatives visiting from a cold northern country when the whisky comes i swallow a shot big enough to steal my breath then wipe my mouth on my jacket sleeve kelly sips with a deep centeredness like a man who has known life without luxuries and wants to savor them while he can he doesnt talk he doesnt look at me he stares through the bottom of his glass as though pondering the grain of the wood beneath yet i am certain that every movement in the restauranteven on the street outsideregisters on his mental radar kelly is covering me even now kelly mm did you have a maid when you grew up his head bobs once then i hear soft laughter an ironic chuckle did you my mother was a maid he glances at me from the corner of his eye then looks back into his glass embarrassment is not exactly what i feel its more like mortification im trying to think of how to apologize when he says nothing wrong with being a maid its honest work like soldiering i want to hug him for that how long did ruby work for your family thirtyfive years she came when i was three thats a long time and she burned to death because of what im doing she burned to death kelly rotates his stool and puts his foot on a crosspiece of mine can i ask you something sure why are you doing what youre doing the truth i dont know in the beginning i wanted to nail a guy who hurt my father a long time ago and me i take another shot of scotch and this one brings sweat to my skin thats a bad reason i guess not so bad its not worth rubys life no but thats not the only reason youre doing it youre trying to set a murder right and from what i can tell it needs setting right ive watched you these last few days youre a crusader i knew some in the service and youre one of them ive got a feeling you saw some horrible atrocity when you were young a race murder or something something thats weighed you down a long time no i never saw anything like that not much of that happened around here to tell you the truth i swallow the remainder of my scotch and signal the bartender for a refill what i do remember it probably wont sound like anything i was in the fourth grade when integration started here i was in the public school then the first semester they sent twenty black kids into our school twenty into an allwhite school the black kid in my grade was named noble jackson nobody was horrible to those kids not overtly but every day at recess wed be out there playing ball or whatever and noble jackson would be standing off at the edge of the playground by himself just standing there watching us excluded i guess he tried to play the first couple of days and nobody picked him for anything every day he just stood there by himself staring kicking rocks not understanding the next semester my parents moved me to st stephens the scotch has soured in my stomach now that im older i know that kids parents made a conscious decision to do something very hard something my parents wouldnt do they risked their childs education maybe even his life put him into a situation where it would be almost impossible for him to learn because of the pressure they did that because somebody had to do it when i think of that kid i dont feel very good because exclusion is the worst thing for a child its a kind of violence and the effects last a long time i think maybe noble jackson is part of the reason im doing this what happened to him whered he end up i have no idea ive often wondered wherever he is ill bet he got the hell out of the south as soon as he could we return to our drinks both lost in our own thoughts as the bartender returns to refill his glass kelly says got a phone book chief the bartender turns around and takes one from beneath the telephone the natchez phone book is only a halfinch thick including the yellow pages kelly flips through it then runs his finger down a page heres your man noble jackson a strange tightness constricts my chest thats probably his father let me borrow that phone kelly says to the bartender local call you bet kelly takes the phone and dials the number watching me in the mirror hello im calling for noble it is this is sergeant kelly noble daniel kelly you dont recognize my voice from bragg fort bragg im trying to track down some members of our old unit youre kidding me right never been in the service youre shining me man well noble always said he was going to get out of mississippi as soon as he could yeah how old are you well thats the right age what you do for a living ha noble sure didnt know nothing about engines you married no kidding man im sorry i bothered you my mistake all the way you have a good sunday chief kelly hangs up and the bartender puts the phone back in front of the mirror noble jackson works as a mechanic for goodyear hes thirtyeight years old married with four kids and hes lived in natchez his whole life he sounds happier about it than a lot of people would be this knowledge mundane as it sounds somehow eases my grief over ruby kelly youre a funny guy his eyes twinkle that has been said he looks past me and i hear the restaurant door open behind me his expression tells me that whoever came in is a woman an attractive one i find myself hoping its caitlin female inbound on your six he says you know her i rotate my stool and watch a tanned brunette walk toward me its jenny the waitress shes wearing black jeans and a tshirt that says lilith fair her dark hair is swept back from her neck and her large brown eyes are shining she gives me a shy wave as she reaches us jenny this is daniel kelly she smiles and shakes kellys hand then looks back at me im surprised to see you here isnt the funeral today we just came from there oh um could i talk to you for a minute sure she looks furtively at kelly alone i mean kelly starts to slide off his stool but jenny takes his arm and holds him there i didnt mean for you to leave how about one of those booths i suggest well i was hoping youd come upstairs to my apartment just for a minute my mental alarm is ringing now soft but steady even modest fame can attract some strange people and propositions and legal complications often follow caitlin pegged jenny as having a fixation on me the first time she saw her maybe shes right its practically deserted in here i say lets just grab a booth jenny suddenly looks on the verge of tears its nothing weird i promise its personal it has to do with what youre working on your case curiosity muffles the alarm in my head the payton case what do you know about that she glances at the bartender whos totaling numbers on a calculator a few feet away it has to do with the marston family im convinced okay upstairs it is have another on me kelly glad to boss keep your pants on jenny leads me to the rear of the restaurant where a spiral staircase winds up to the second floor we pass some long tables set up for a party then climb a short flight of stairs to a small landing and a red door jenny takes a key from her pocket opens the door and waits for me to go through her apartment is as spartan as the cell of a lifer you could bounce a quarter off the bed and the linens are surprisingly masculine a tall set of shelves stands against the wall to my right and its filled from top to bottom with books literary novels mostly though the familiar spines of my books are among them along with martin cruz smith donna tartt and peter hoeg theres no television but a boom box sits beside the bed an indigo girls concert flyer tacked to the wall above it caitlins suspicion that jenny has a crush on me is looking less accurate by the second with careful steps jenny crosses the room to the far corner where a microwave oven and coffeemaker stand on a table beside a lavatory she pours water from a kentwood bottle into the coffee carafe then from the carafe to the coffeemaker her back is to me but she appears to be concentrating on her movements is green tea okay she asks its fine a spoon jangles loudly in a cup jennys hands are shaking are you okay i ask she nods quickly still facing away from me just nervous how do you know the marston family are you originally from natchez no she turns and faces me revealing the anxiety in her eyes i have a sudden intuition that shes about to tell me leo marston forced her to commit some sexual act or perhaps got her pregnant shes far too young for him but if an impoverished killer like ray presley can rob the cradle why cant leo marston but you know the marstons i press her i know olivia olivia does livy have something to do with the payton case i dont know jenny why dont you just tell me what you know start at the beginning and let me decide how important it is she shakes her head youve got the wrong idea i meani misled you a little this isnt about your case my alarm is ringing again full volume now then whats it about this is so hard for me she wrings her hands and looks at the ceiling then focuses her glistening eyes on mine i thinki mean im pretty sure mr cage im pretty sure youre my father chapter im pretty sure you re my father jennys words hang in the air like ozone after a lightning strike my discomfort escalates to panic in a fraction of a second this is the root of the strange fascination caitlin picked up that first night its something ive heard about my whole life orphaned or adopted children convincing themselves that the father who abandoned them is some famous man look miss i grope for her last name then realize i never knew it doe she says isnt that pathetic thats my last name jennifer doe its on my birth certificate im backing toward the door which leads to the stairs and the second floor and the spiral staircase and the restaurant and sanity i think wed better go back down she holds up her hands in supplication pleading for my attention i dont want anything from you and im not crazy please believe me im scared to death right now im so scared i just want to know who i am hot clear water bubbles out of the coffeemaker for tea that will never be made i cant help you with that question jenny if youd listen to me for two minutes youll know you can my hand is on the doorknob livy marston is my mother this stops me i was born in february of my brain is working backward to the point of conception february january decemberoh hell just go back twelve months and add three if jenny is telling the truth she was conceived in may of the month livy and i graduated high school my birth certificate proves it she says in a defensive voice i drop my hand from the knob let me see she goes to the bookshelf takes down my second novel and opens it to the flyleaf from there she removes a white sheet of paper which she holds out to me i dont look at her face as i reach for it if i did i know i would be searching for similarities to my own the birth certificate looks authentic issued by the state of louisiana the city of new orleans the childs name is listed as jennifer doe what nearly stops my heart is what is printed on the line for mother right there in black and white is the name olivia linsford marston the line beside father is blank jesus god i murmur it was a privately arranged adoption jenny says set up before i was ever born the adopting parents wanted the name jennifer on the birth certificate my heart is skipping beats she rushes on her voice shaky i didnt know any of this until a year ago i spent most of my life in foster homes i wanted to know where id come from who my birth parents were i didnt have anybody jenny slow down i hold up my hands im going to listen okay just calm down and tell me your story she looks frozen like a strip of film stopped in midmotion the relief in her eyes is heartbreaking if she wasnt so caught up in her own emotions she might realize that after seeing that birth certificate it would take a winch to pull me out of her apartment already thoughts that havent meshed for twenty years are falling into place livy was pregnant our senior year or the summer following it rather and she carried the child to term that is why she disappeared i guess the assumptions i made about female reproductive biology in were about as accurate as my judgments of livys true nature pour the tea i say dazedly thatll calm you down i dont want it okay you said you wanted to find out who your birth parents were how did you go about doing that well like i said it was a private adoption which is big business in louisiana if you dont know it took a lot of work but i finally learned the name of the lawyer who handled the adoption clayton lacour from new orleans i did some checking on him and i found out he was well connected mafia connected i was afraid that if i just walked in and asked lacour wouldnt tell me anything about my birth parents all the law required was that he ask my mother whether or not she wanted to be found by me and i was pretty sure that whoever she was she wouldnt be too happy about me showing up on her doorstep after twenty years jennys voice is leveling out the act of telling her story has distracted her from the fears bubbling inside her id been around a little i knew the street so instead of marching in and asking my questions i applied for a job at lacours office pa gofer answering the phone whatever i dressed like a college girla loose oneand i made sure lacour saw me when i went in he practically licked me from head to toe took me into his office for a personal interview and hired me on the spot jenny would have made a good das investigator it was a race between finding out what i wanted to know and lacour getting up the nerve to jump me right there in the office whenever i was alone id search the place i brought my lunch every day told them i was dieting file room computers his personal cabinets closets everything a lot of the stuff had combination locks it took five weeks to find out where everything was and another week to copy it all what did you find lacour handled a lot of adoptions all privately arranged always white babies and for real money thirtyfive thousand dollars changed hands when i was adopted you believe that i went through all his records and finally found the jennifer doe birth certificate id always been called jenny every home i went to so i copied the file and studied it at home i found out id been adopted on the day i was born by a childless rich couple from new orleans lacour had made notes in the file he thought the couple was trying save their marriage by adopting a baby he turned out to be right they divorced when i was two and neither one wanted custody i went into the state system i was adopted by another family but her eyes glaze to opacity as she trails off i dont really want to go into that it was an abuse situation i ended up in the foster care system and thats where i stayed until i was eighteen she doesnt have to go into it as a young assistant district attorney in houston i handled cases arising out of foster care that are still burned into my heart all that mattered she says was that the file contained the name of my birth mother olivia marston it also contained the name of another lawyer the one whod brought me to lacours attention leo marston i say softly yes judge marston and clayton lacour went way back theyd done a lot of deals together oil leases real estate you name it what had happened was obvious marstons daughter got pregnant when she was eighteen and he arranged to get rid of the baby for her i was that baby what i couldnt figure out is why she didnt just have an abortion the marstons are big catholics jenny gives me the jaded stare of a runaway who has seen it all whats your point shes right of course livys sister had an abortion when she was in college what did you do after you found that out i quit lacour but before i did i stole everything pertaining to marston most of it was files the rest were tapes tapes lacour taped everything he was connected like i said and totally paranoid hed worked for the marcello family when he was younger carlos marcello the mob guy anyway he saved these phone tapes just like files sometimes when he was drinking hed talk about his insurance that was the tapes there were twelve tapes coded for marstons name i took them all on the day i split what did lacour say about you quitting i didnt stick around to talk im sure he thought i left because he couldnt keep his hands off me id used a fake name so he couldnt trace me hes bound to have noticed the missing files but so what i stole some other files related to judge marston just to confuse the trail what did you do next i went to atlanta to find my mother and she refused to see me at all when i called her at home she hung up on me so one day at her office i sort of ambushed her its a big law firm she was so afraid id make a scene that she took me into her private office acted like i was a client she told me she didnt want anything to do with me she had no interest in my life nothing she wrote me a check for twentyfive thousand dollars and told me to go away jenny is crying now but she wipes away the tears with fierce determination she broke my heart that day id been through a lot in my life i thought i was tough but to have the woman whod given birth to me offer me money to disappear to pretend that id never even been born i just couldnt stand it she closes her eyes takes a very deep breath and holds it why dont you sit down i suggest she expels the air in a long steady exhalation no this is better really what did you do next i tore up her check i probably should have kept it because i really needed the money but i couldnt i tore it up and asked her to tell me my fathers name she turned white mr cage that question scared her to death i begged her to tell me but she wouldnt i told her i would never do anything to hurt her and asked her to please reconsider then i left im so sorry jenny after that i got stoned for about three weeks from the file i worked out that my mother must have gotten pregnant at the end of her senior year of high school which meant she was probably living here at the time right and her father still lived here i figured if i hung around here awhile i might be able to find out who she was dating back then maybe figure out my birth father that way so i got on a trailways and came to natchez when i got here i found out livy marston was practically a celebrity everybody remembered her they talked about her like she was like a princess or something she was in a way did you tell anybody that she was your mother no i played it very cool id hear people talking about her sometimes waiting tables or hanging out and id ask about her it didnt take long to find out that you were her boyfriend during her senior year i even saw an old yearbook with a picture of you together and you were a celebrity i mean you are a real one it freaked me out honestly i knew so many foster kids who made up those kinds of fantasies but this fantasy was real i am past the point of being able to respond people said olivia disappeared for nearly a year after she graduated that shed gone to europe or something thats when she was pregnant with me the beginnings of nausea are welling in my stomach the logic of jennys storyand its accordance with the known factsis unassailable in five minutes a waitress has supplied the missing piece of a puzzle that has haunted me for twenty years leo marston went after my father because i got his daughter pregnant because i changed the course of her life and shattered the dreams hed had for her his dream that she would go to ole miss that she would attend the same law school hed gone to marry some suitable mississippi boy and move back to natchez to practice with her father that was what maude was talking about the night she threw the drink in my face what i cant understand is why livy wouldnt tell me she was pregnant at the time why keep it from me and why hadnt her father called mine in a rage and demanded that i marry her but in that question lies the answer to the others livys parents werent white trash from the wrong side of the tracks a family for whom a marriage to a doctors soneven a shotgun marriagewould be a step up the social ladder they were marstons natchez royalty the worst thing leo and maude could possibly imagine would be anything that might slow the momentum of their perfect daughters perfect life marriage would never have entered their minds they wouldnt want a single soul to discover that livy was pregnant and they would want the resulting child to disappear from the face of the earth i cant believe leo let livy carry the child to term as for livy keeping the pregnancy from me her psychology was simple enough she had ambitions and marriage at eighteen wasnt one of them when she thought of marriage she envisioned someone who could not possibly be found in the backward and somnolent state of her birth yet for the past few days she has acted as though shed like nothing better than to spend the rest of her life with me she never told you anything about me jenny asks in a small voice not a word i never suspected that livy had a child no one did well she does she may not want me but shes my mother jenny i know this sounds pathetic but i dont know what to say i know i sprang this on you at a terrible time im so sorry about your maid its all right she takes a tentative step toward me will you do me a huge favor mr cage if i can what is it will you get a blood test my stomach flips over a paternity test its just one tube of blood for a dna test jenny i know you feel like youve been hit with a ton of bricks i dont want to creep you out or anything but when i saw you sitting down there today you looked so vulnerable the way i feel all the time i just knew you were more compassionate thanher even if you didnt want anything to do with me i knew youd be nicer about it my mind has slipped away again livys reaction to jennys appearance in atlanta seems incomprehensible i can understand her being shocked or afraid of what her husband might think but to be so cruel it is possible right jenny asks i mean you were sleeping with livy marston in high school yes she shakes her head as though she still cant believe were talking face to face this is so scary but its liberating too i really thought you were going to just run out of here straight to a judge to get a restraining order against me jenny and you have a little girl she says excitedly i mean i could have a sister primal fear grips my heart jenny weve got to take this one step at a time you i know i didnt mean to be pushy i dont want to crash in on your life or anything id never do that ive just felt so alone my whole life in an instant her face seems to collapse in upon itself you dont know the things that have happened to me mr cage i can guess look the first thing i should do is talk to livy she wont talk about it shell talk to me jenny is wringing her hands again i heard a rumor last night someone in the restaurant said you were seeing her again they saw you out driving ive been so weirded out by that i thought you had a thing for the publisher of the newspaper jenny livy may have been cruel to you but shes not a monster im telling you shes not rational about this does leo marston know about you oh yeah she nods slowly i talked to him once he heard me out then told me that he had to honor his daughters wishes regarding me and he expected me to do the same ill bet he offered you fifty grand to disappear ha he told me it probably would have been better if i hadnt been born but that i had been so i had to do the best i could life is tough he said you believe that like his life was ever tough that son of a bitch but he scared me he told me if i tried to make any public scandal hed have to take steps to resolve the situation and he wasnt talking about legal steps god i wish id taped that conversation id seen mob guys in lacours office in new orleans they were basically okay guys most of them but leo marston hes not a nice guy he made me feel like id be doing the world a service if i slit my wrists im sorry jenny thats all i can say right now though i probably shouldnt i walk to her and take her hands in mine theyre alarmingly cold i dont know what the truth is i honestly dont but if i am your father ill take care of you its too late for me to be a father in the real sense but you wont want for anything and you wont be alone to see a grown woman break into a child is a terrible thing and i will not speak of it here the examiner building is humming like a beehive but i see no sign of caitlin as i pass through the newsroom i go straight to the conference room which at the moment contains two female reporters poring over the marston files patiently separating wheat from chaff ladies could i have the room for a few minutes they look up at me like graduate students disturbed in their library carrels then blink and look at each other uh sure says the one wearing glasses as soon as the door closes i tear through the stacks of paper on the table looking for something that seemed trivial only two days ago the scrawled note listing the income marston realized from private adoptions yesterday it was just another scrap of paper among thousands now its my personal rosetta stone its not on the table i drop to my knees and start working through the carefully stacked piles on the floor shoving aside page after page letting them fall where they will in five minutes the room is awash in paper and sweat is running down my face in ten i am trying to suppress the furious panic of an alzheimers patient who sets down his car keys and cant find them five seconds later and then i am holding the damn thing one sheet of yellow legal paper with a column of years beginning in and continuing to the present some years arent listed but beside each that is an amount of money is noted the highest figures correspond to the s and some of these are followed by a onedigit number in parentheses which probably indicates the number of adoptions handled in that year beside the year is written the figure jenny doe is telling the truth the weight of this knowledge is staggering but before i can begin to absorb it the door to the conference room opens a crack and caitlin walks in her face flushed with excitement i just heard you were here listen to this my father called twenty minutes ago he found out why dwight stone wont testify for us i fold the scrap of legal paper and slip it into my pocket why stone has a daughter so i have a daughter too maybe two your daughters not an fbi agent the scrap of paper is momentarily forgotten dwight stone has a daughter in the fbi a triumphant smile lights caitlins face ten years in john portman can ruin her career with a single reassignment and he can make it the same way it had to be something like this in colorado i had gotten such an impression of integrity from dwight stone that i couldnt fathom what would keep him from helping me expose the truth of what happened here in but children make us all vulnerable theyre hostages to fortune as the poet said hostages to fortune says caitlin i must have spoken aloud nothing it doesnt matter penn whats the matter you looked zoned out im fine bullshit you look terrible she glances around the room which is strewn with loose pages like leaves on a forest floor what happened in here what are you looking for i already found it what something personal nothing to do with our case caitlin goes to the table and picks up a few pages straightens them into a stack and sets them back down then she turns those remarkable green eyes on me and speaks in a voice raw with hurt its livy marston isnt it nothing else would get you so worked up it has to do with livy yes you cant tell me what it is not yet not until i know something for sure right now i need a telephone she waves her hand with disgust take any one you want it has to be private you can use my office there is something like pity in her eyes she escorts me through the newsroom shrugging at kelly on the way as soon as she shuts the door behind me i dial tuscany thankfully livy answers this is penn what do you want we need to talk you havent thought so for the past three days i do now its important important theres a long pause but i dont jump to fill it all right she says finally where i close my eyes i havent eaten i was thinking of getting a bite at biscuits and blues that sound okay to you silence livy im not really hungry you could watch me eat i say pushing it why dont we take a ride instead its nice outside sure and why dont we ask our daughter to come along is your father home no hes at his office with blake sims preparing for the trial ill pick you up in five minutes five minutes its important all right i may look ghastly but ill be waiting on the gallery livy marston has never looked ghastly in her life just have the gate open i hang up and start through the newsroom heading for the front of the building caitlin and kelly are talking quietly in a corner when she sees me she breaks away from him and physically bars the door penn youve got to tell me whats going on its nothing to do with you its personal she looks around the newsroom and realizes that her employees are staring at her taking my wrist she speaks in a quieter voice i consider your personal life personal to me i have no response to this caitlin matters to me but right now there is a motor spinning in my chest driving me irresistibly toward tuscany the only place where the truth of my life can be found it could be someday but its not now let me by caitlin she hesitates then drops my wrist and moves aside kelly starts to fall into step with me stay here i tell him i dont need you for this he stops but before the main door closes behind me i hear caitlin say go with him tuscany is a magnificent mansion but it would look incomplete without the indelible image of livy standing on the gallery shes wearing a royal blue sun dress belted at the waist and falling just below her knees the air is cool beneath the trees and the freshly fallen leaves have been gathered into random piles by the wind the scene looks staged like a rich color shot from an ad in architectural digest who is that beauty waiting for you wonder as you flip past it if only she was waiting for me this beauty is waiting for me only she has no idea what a dreadful gift i bring the last thing she wants to receive a demand for the truth and the means to compel her to speak it i park beside the negro lawn jockeys and remain in the car livy comes down the steps her tread light her movements graceful her eyes are curious as they take me in she walks around to the passenger door clearly wondering why i havent scurried around to open it for her unable to wait for the pretense of a drive to speak to her i get out and address her over the gleaming black roof of the car do you know a girl named jenny doe she freezes with her hand on the passenger door behind those eyes i know so well have dreamed of for years another pair of eyes is looking out frightened hunted eyes who have you been talking to she asks her voice oddly devoid of emotion does it matter i want to know if you were pregnant in thats none of your business not my business is that girl our daughter livy she takes a deep breath recovering her composure with remarkable resilience no she says simply no shes not my daughter or no shes not yours either she purses her lips as though calculating the impact of various replies stay out of this penn its none of your affair were you sleeping with someone besides me in the spring of seventyeight her eyes flash werent you my heart feels suddenly cold no but if you were how do you know for certain who the father was maybe i dont care who it was the steel in her voice cannot mask the fear and anguish in her face livy listen to me penn you are not that girls father i know that with absolute certainty and if you thought hard about it you would too what the hell does that mean i worked out the months from her birth certificate i could easily be her father you got pregnant right before you disappeared she studies me with cold objectivity as though taking some lifealtering decision if you ever mention what im about to say ill deny i said it jenny doe is my daughter but she is not yours shes twenty years old now and i have no legal responsibility to care for her as far as im concerned she doesnt exist since shes not your child you have no say whatever in the matter and you should never mention it to me again livy where is this coming from how can you be so cruel to this girl youre so naive you dont know anything you she stops as the low purr of an engine murmurs through the trees i assume its kelly until leo marstons silver lincoln town car rounds the bend by the azalea bushes get out of here livy says in a taut voice go and dont come back i was stupid to think we could ever make it work i dont move i cant leos face is masked by the glare of the sun on his windshield as he parks behind the bmw when he gets out his face is not mottled red with fury as i expect but calm a smug smile curls his lips as he walks toward me when he stops three feet away i see that his upper cheeks are flushed and when he speaks i smell the sweet odor of bourbon livy he drawls glancing at her over the roof of the bmw does this person have your permission to be on our property he was just leaving that doesnt answer my question i asked if hes a guest or if hes a trespasser like the other night livy looks at me with pleading eyes the familiar eyes i once knew hes my guest but hes leaving lets go inside in a minute in a minute leo is grinning like a sixyearold boy with a secret im glad i ran into you cage ive got some news youll be interested in is that right youre damn right thats right a friend of yours was just arrested in the hoover building in washington dc fear and guilt for peter lutjens clench my stomach seems this fellow was attempting to steal a file leo drones on a file sealed on national security grounds he had a funny name foreign name dutch maybe theres some question of treason i believe john portman is personally investigating the situation he turns to livy this boys got no case livy none at all he turns back to me laughter rumbling low and deep in his chest when wednesday gets here youre gonna wish you never opened your mouth about me youre gonna rue the goddamn day you decided to fuck with leo marston confused images fire through the synapses of my brain my father on the floor of his bedroom felled by a heart attack my mother in tears unable to cope with the stress of the malpractice trial jenny doe describing her meeting with the man who stands before me now the man who made her feel shed be doing the world a favor by committing suicide peter lutjens being handcuffed while his wife and children wait for him at home in a clutter of uhaul boxes victory is written on leos face like blood after a hunt and the wolfish blue eyes are laughing i have not struck another human being in anger since i was fifteen years old but my knee rises into his groin with preternatural speed and force the air explodes from his lungs as he doubles over my elbow crashes into the side of his head just the way a houston police detective once taught me stop it livy screams penn stop she is running around the car to get between us some part of my brain knows i should stop but im still moving forward pursuing leo as he staggers back he shakes his head and raises his big left hand to his jaw i draw back my fist then freeze as a silver derringer appears before my nose as though by magic he must have had it palmed all along a little nickelplated gamblers special go ahead you little pissant he snarls go ahead daddy livy stands two feet behind her father her voice riding a current of hysteria go inside baby you dont want to see this daddy i love him this simple declaration hits leo like an arrow he actually flinches like a bear struck between the ribs and an expression of pure hatred comes over his face go inside livy this boys forgotten his place he assaulted me on my property but livy doesnt go the three of us remain locked in our positions a pathetic standoff on the edge of tragedy that lasts until daniel kellys rented taurus rolls slowly up the drive kelly parks alongside the cars five feet from us and rolls down his window like a tourist asking for directions but what comes through his window is not a map but a browning hipower pistol which he points at leos head please go inside the house sir he says who the hell are you leo asks keeping the derringer in my face kellys suntanned face remains calm as though he were listening to a soothing piece of music im the man whos going to end your life unless you take that gun in the house bullshit leo grunts get the fuck off my property im here to do a job sir kelly says in the same lazy voice dont make yourself part of it at last leo really looks at kelly and the muscles in his jaw tighten he has vastly multiplied his family fortune by accurately judging mens characters and whatever he sees in daniel kellys eyes convinces him that today is the wrong day to tempt fate he lowers the derringer you just made yourself part of my job sonny he raises two fingers in a little toodleloo gesture then turns and walks up the broad steps of his mansion livy he says without turning around your mother needs you im coming she steps toward me and tries to take my hand but i pull it away make a public apology penn she pleads please do that and ill convince daddy to drop the suit its too late for that she looks at me sadly you cant play my fathers game and win not in this town not in this state nobody can you could lose everything you have youve got a short memory livy your father lost his case against mine twenty years ago and hes going to lose this one that was different it was a weak case to start with then why did he take it unreadable emotion flares in her eyes i dont know but i do know you nearly fainted when he told you that man had been arrested he was your last hope wasnt he he was your case if you walk into that courtroom wednesday youll be like a lamb going to slaughter i step back from her trying not to think of peter lutjens thats my problem your problem is a lot bigger than that your whole life is built around some secret tragedy whose real victim is a girl crying alone in a room three miles from here what are you going to do about that her eyes go cold again nothing and youd better not either she turns and walks up three steps then looks back to me dont say i didnt warn you about the trial this time she goes all the way up and through the massive door i get into the bmw and start to leave but kelly pulls his taurus in front of it blocking my way then he gets out and comes around to my window boss to an objective observer it looks like youre trying awful hard to get killed ive learned some upsetting things in the past half hour i havent even begun to understand them yet all i know is that i want to nail that son of a bitch more than anything ive ever wanted in my life other than to save my wife from dying and that was beyond my power maybe this is too kelly says gently i wouldnt mind bringing that bastard down a peg myself but things seem pretty seriously stacked against you sometimes youve got to pull back regroup fight another day no i say doggedly perhaps stupidly if i let the momentum die marston and portman will never pay for whatever they did any evidence that exists will disappear althea paytons words sound in my head like a ghostly refrain if not now when you know a skeptical grunt yeah maybe ive got one shot left kelly what dwight stone he knows the truth he could bring down the whole damn temple caitlin says he wont testify he wants to help me i know he does but hes got a daughter in the fbi that gives portman total control of her life and by extension stones so what can you do im going back to colorado the old kelly smile returns to his lips well i was ready for a change of scenery anyway do we still have fbi surveillance covering us ive seen them three times today theyre good thats okay youre going to keep them nice and busy for me yeah and how do we lose them we dont this time im going alone chapter the american eagle atr plows into a trough of turbulence drops like a stone then catches an updraft from the rocky mountains below and settles out again i and my fellow passengers are thirty miles from crested butte colorado and i cant wait for the wheels to hit the runway when i flew out of baton rouge it was ninety degrees when i changed planes in dallas it was sixtyeight in colorado theres two feet of snow on the ground my plane is three hours behind schedule because of the unexpected storm and the only thing i know about atr aircraft is that they fly like hogs with ice on the wings but that isnt the only reason for my anxiety in less than an hour i will be face to face with former special agent dwight stone the only man on earth who can give me what i need the desire for revenge i felt when i attacked leo marston at tuscany yesterday seems trivial now i am a different man than i was yesterday the past i thought i knew is dead because last night i faced a truth so terrible i can hardly accept it even now after kelly and i left tuscany we drove straight to the motel i felt an overwhelming desire to hug annie the daughter i knew beyond any shadow of doubt to be mine after spending the evening watching television with her i put her to bed and sent kelly out for a bottle of absolut for the first time in years i drank with the sole purpose of getting drunk it didnt take long and drunkenness brought with it the blessed inability to ponder clearly the events of twenty years before who was sleeping with whom and when and why if i really thought about it as livy had told me to do i would know that i could not possibly be jenny does father i passed out in a chair and if my mother hadnt knocked on my door to check on me i might not have fathomed the truth until much later as it was i awakened in the midst of a nightmare tortured by images i could not have conceived of the day before livy told me the truth i am not jennys father i know this because the last time livy and i ever made loveprior to this weekwas one week after graduation and she was just starting her period she had been a couple of weeks late at the time and we were both terrified she was pregnant when her cycle resumed we celebrated by going to a hotelwhich we almost never didand making love at that point livy had two weeks left in natchez before leaving for the summer program at radcliffe i was miserable because earlier in the spring i had promised my father i would go to shiloh with him after graduation of my two remaining weeks with livy i was going to give up one to tromp over a civil war battlefield i consoled myself with the knowledge that we would both be at ole miss in the fall but when i got back from shiloh livy had already left for cambridge and i did not see her again for more than a year during that time i naturally considered the possibility that livy could be pregnant but i was fairly certain that while it was possible for a woman to conceive while having her period the odds against it were high i later learned that a woman can have a period while shes pregnant but by then id written off the possibility altogether given that livys sister had had an abortion i was certain that livy would have done the same in the event of pregnancy and certainly not run off for a year like some girl in trouble from peyton place but clearly i had been wrong to assume that the question was why at tuscany livy had told me in no uncertain terms that i was not jennys father if i wasnt who was livy delivered jenny nine months after leaving natchez the father had to be someone shed slept with immediately after that last period given livys shadowy sexual history that could easily be someone i did not know but when i jerked awake last night in a clammy sweat of panic i knew that jennys father was not unknown to me this knowledge came to me even before i consciously apprehended it announcing itself with a wave of horror that sent me running to the bathroom jennys father is leo marston as sickening as this idea was i could not push it from my mind only this conclusion made sense of every incomprehensible action and statement that had followed right up to the present livys inexplicable promiscuity during high school her mothers chronic alcoholism not telling me about her pregnancy then disappearing for a year cutting herself off from family and friends starting life in virginia as though her life in mississippi had never existed settling in atlanta and most telling her unwillingness to speak to jenny even twenty years after her birth what had seemed so cruel hours before suddenly made sense jenny was a living reminder of something so terrible that livy simply could not face it what had livy said on the bridge when i asked if she could ever live in natchez again not while my parents are alive the idea that leo had sexually abused his daughter from childhood on left me feeling hollowed out like a wasting disease everyone in natchez thought livy marston had enjoyed the most privileged and perfect childhood anyone could free from want full of love and adoration but how many times had she told me that tuscany was a prison not a palace how many times did i discount her laments as the whining of a spoiled rich girl the night we first began to get close when she confessed the date rape by an older boy at school had that been a fictionalized version of rapes by her father were they still going on even then it was difficult to imagine livy submitting to leos advances at that age he outweighed her by more than a hundred pounds but by eighteen livy was a strong athletic girl yet i know very little about abuse and so much human strength springs from the mind not the body was livys entire childhood a lie were her stellar performances in every facet of high school and college life part of some elaborate coping mechanism designed to conceal the awful reality she lived behind the walls of tuscany only two things argued against this interpretation of the facts the first was leos persecution of my father if i had gotten livy pregnant leos attack would be easy to understand a quest for vicarious revenge but if leo had impregnated livy the malpractice case made no sense the second was livys decision to carry the child to term if her pregnancy had resulted from a rape by her father her decision to keep the baby seemed unfathomable even the most dogmatic catholic might consider abortion in those circumstances and livy wasnt dogmatic i reflected upon marstons persecution of my father as i splashed water in my face from the motel lavatory and ate a handful of animal crackers annie had left on the television as soon as the sugar hit my bloodstream i saw straight through to the truth of the malpractice lawsuit it was blindingly simple maude marston must have learned of her daughters pregnancy and that pregnancy somehow had to be explained what more likely candidate for fatherhood could there have been than penn cage livys most recent boyfriend whether leo actually told maude this lie or let her think of it herself did not matter when the chance to persecute my father came he jumped at ithis sole goal being to reinforce the initial lie about livys pregnancy the question of whether maude mightat some levelhave known of the incestuous relationship was something i didnt even want to think about but by trying to destroy my father as an act of vengeance leo more deeply concealed his mortal sin from his wife and perhaps even from himself i suppose its even possible that after twenty years of denial he has convinced himself that i am jennys father the man who ruined livys life truth always clarifies but with clarification comes a whirlwind of emotions no one can predict my initial reaction was horror mixed with outrage suddenly even the murder of del payton seemed trivial payton burned to death in a few agonizing minutes if i was right about jenny does parentage livy had died a thousand times before she reached adulthood she has been burning alive for more than thirty years i sat alone in the dark well of the night pondering what to do with this terrible knowledge after an hour i made some longdistance calls irritating more than a few people when dawn broke i woke kelly and spoke to him and a few hours later we executed a ruse which left him surrounded by our fbi watchers at the natchez mall cinema while sam jacobs drove me to the baton rouge airport in his hummer in baton rouge i paid cash for a ticket to dallas where i changed planes for albuquerque and there boarded the atr bound for the tiny airport at crested butte the pilot has begun his descent plowing up the long mountain valley from the southeast the snowy majesty of the rockies leaves me unaffected at my core in the moist and primitive darkness a malevolent seed is germinating a desire not to publicly humiliate leo marston not even to destroy his career as a lawyer and judge by sending him to parchman prison but to end his very life to remove him from the world not in del paytons name but in livys and in mine for the life he stole from us i will soon be listening to former special agent dwight stone explain why he cannot tell a jury what he knows about leo marston and john portman he will soberly tell me about his daughter the fbi agent and he will expect me as a father to understand his position but i will not understand i have a surprise for dwight stone the snow has stopped when we touch down at crested butte but thankfully the car rental company has fitted the tires of my ford explorer with chains i am unaccustomed to icy roads but it doesnt take me long to get the hang of it the problem is that only the main roads have been plowed the forest service road leading up into the mountains and stones cabin is plowed only to the summer houses by nicholson lake the jeep track that breaks off from that is impassable at least for someone of my limited mountain skills so i have no choice but to abandon the explorer near a large gravel pit and trek up between the mountains on foot it takes less than twenty yards to understand the necessity for snowshoes a type of footwear i have never worn in my life in my thinly padded windbreaker and tennis shoes i am practically begging for frostbite but stones cabin cant be more than three miles away its after three oclock but i should have plenty of light to make it i rang stones phone from the airport to make sure he was there and hung up as soon as he answered i dont want him or anyone tapping his phone to know im coming until i arrive the jeep track is invisible in the snow but by roughly following the course of the slate river upstream i must eventually strike on stones cabin which is situated practically on top of it today the slate which was only ten or fifteen feet wide on my last trip is a roaring flood of blueblack water sluicing down the valley like a logging flume after a seeming eternity of slipping falling digging through drifts and cracking my elbows and butt i make my way past the entrance of an old mine along the base of anthracite mesa and up to the edge of a slot canyon where the slate is compressed into a raging chute that rockets over an eightfoot vertical drop i pick my way along the edge of the canyon with care knowing that a tumble into that water could easily kill me at last stones cabin comes into sight nestled among the tall spruce and fir trees between the jeep track and the river theres a welcome column of smoke rising from its chimney i have not been this cold for many years i stop to catch my breath and marshal my strength then push on for the last two hundred yards like a climber going for the summit of everest stone answers his door with a pistol on his hip the first words out of his mouth are you damn fool then he jerks me inside slams the door and darts to the front window where he stands peering through the curtains a fearsome array of weapons lies on the coffee table before the sofaa hunting rifle two shotguns several automatic pistolsand a huge fire crackles in the fieldstone fireplace the curtains over the back windows are shut blocking the view toward the slate and the trees beyond stone must be close to seventy but his vitality is intimidating hes one of those leathery guys wholl still be jogging six miles a day when hes eighty the last time we met he seemed charged with repressed anger now the whole interior of the cabin crackles with his fury as though my first visit opened some channel to the past that made it impossible for him to hold in his rage any longer whats out there i ask he keeps staring through the window his eyes narrowed like those of a marksman you didnt see them when you came in all i saw was mountains and snow no cars no skiers nothing theyve been out there all day four of them who are they fbi i hope and if not he glances at me then they only let you come in here for one reason which is to make it easier to kill both of us shit why are we standing here then wed be sitting ducks if we tried to make it out call the police stones taciturn face hardly moves when he answers theres only the sheriff and a couple of deputies if those men are here to kill us theyll kill anyone who tries to interfere as well and i happen to like the sheriff but they could be legitimate fbi agents right they could but they dont feel legitimate what about the state police take em too long to get here in the snow and my phones tapped i have a cell phone but whoevers out there will have those frequencies covered if they mean to kill us theyll move in the second i call for help isnt it early for snow its ninety degrees in mississippi anything can happen in october it rained four days upcountry before it turned to snow thats why the rivers up like it is i edge up to the other front window and peer out i see nothing but spruce firs and show why dont they move in now theyre waiting for dark so we just sit here stone takes one more look out the window then walks over to the table holding his weapons look you started all this now youve got to live with it so just sit tight ive been in spots like this before its a game of nerves i came to colorado alone knowing that i would be walking right into the men watching stone i did this believing that stonea good man with a guilty consciencewould be unwilling to add my death to that conscience by sending me back to mississippi alone i was sure that my obvious vulnerability would convince him that the only decent thing to do would be to accompany me back to natchez to testify i didnt reckon with the possibility that the men watching him would attempt to kill him outrightand me with him he lifts a cordless phone from the coffee table punches a button on it listens then hangs up and slips the phone into his pocket you killed arthur lee hanrattys brother right i nod that makes me feel a little better he removes a pistol from the small of his back i hadnt even noticed it then takes the cordless phone from his pocket and sits on the sofa with both gun and phone in his lap well whatd you come back for the truth you know it i need it its that simple an ironic smile flickers over stones features i suppose since you and i may die together soon i could make you aware of a few facts but im not going to testify for you voluntarily or any other way and first youd better show me youre not wearing a wire its a repeat of my visit to ray presleys trailer i strip off my khakis and shirt and stone motions for me to remove my shorts and socks as well come over here he says im not submitting to a rectal exam i tell him walking toward the couch he chuckles then stands and runs his fingers through my hair following the line of my skull he sticks a finger in each of my ears sorry but the transmitters are damnably small these days now that weve got that over with i say pulling on my pants lets hear what really happened in natchez in how far have you gotten on your own ive got presley nailed down for the actual murder my witnesses are frank jones his exwife and betty lou beckham an atf bomb expert will confirm c as the explosive proving presley planted evidence at the scene and one of the fort polk thieves will put stolen military c in presleys hands stone smiles so you got my fax thanks how do you link presley to marston you he raises his eyebrows i hope youve got something else well i did have an fbi agent trying to copy your original report for me but he was arrested yesterday stone gives a somber nod i heard of course his daughter told him so he says marston orders presley to do the hit thats how you see it well theres portman of course but i dont know what his role was are there more people involved conspiracies are always complicated but in this case presley and marston make a nice package so why complicate it of course you dont even have marston yet but you did yes tell me how he picks up the cordless phone again presses a button listens then hangs up and begins speaking to me in a low clear voice his right hand thumbing the gun in his lap first of all portman wasnt my partner hoover foisted him on me fresh out of yale law and the academy his father was a wall street lawyer with washington connections he thought the bureau would be a good political incubator for his son like military service without the risk so pal edgar throws the kid into a highprofile assignment safely under the wing of veteran agent dwight stone stone stops speaking for a few moments and simply listens i hear only the crackle of the fire and perhaps the rush of the swollen slate behind the cabin portman didnt give a shit about the payton case he says finally all he cared about was kissing ass and getting promoted to the puzzle palace but you cared althea payton told me you did he nods thoughtfully cage in all the mountains of shit sometimes one case gets to you you know for me it was that one payton was a good guy who basically minded his own business and tried to better his lot in life and he got killed for it when i found out hed served in korea it got personal id known some black noncoms over there and they were okay payton survived chosin reservoir only to get blown to shit by some gutless rednecks in his home town stone slaps the cordless phone against his thigh with a percussive pop man i wanted to nail those sons of bitches my first steps were the same ones youve been taking frank jones his wife then betty lou jackson beckham now i guess betty lou knew something but she wouldnt talk then portman and me got shot at out on highway hoover got irritated after that incident scumbags shooting at the fbi and getting away with it didnt fit his pr plan he authorized a lot more money and muscle i cracked betty lou and that put presley at the scene portman and i braced presley at home and he told us to stick it that bastard didnt rattle easy ill give him that even when we got the fork polk thieves to admit selling him the c presley told us to go to hell we put on the fullcourt press on my request hoover authorized illegal wiretaps on presleys home plus all the nearby pay phones we bribed local klansmen but they couldnt find out a thing about paytons death whoever killed payton had acted without klan authority we put intermittent surveillance on presley tight enough to annoy him but loose enough for him to shake after a week he called leo marston from a pay phone near his house what did he say nothing incriminating said he wanted to talk somewhere private marston was the da then of course nothing illegal about wanting to talk to the district attorney i thought presley might be trying to cut a deal with the state authorities to avoid any sort of federal prosecution the klan had a lot of influence in parchman in those days and they could have assured him an easy stretch they also had influence over pardons but making a deal wasnt presleys style no stone agrees anyway the second hoover heard leo marstons name in connection with the case the whole case changed the director assumed personal control why hoover was a creature of politics he demanded total control over every case that involved anyone who could do him good or harm down the road what happened next we did a black bag job on marstons mansion bugged it top to bottom phones the house the garden gazebo the works it was a beautiful job you and portman hell no henry bookbinder and me the technology was primitive but henry was an artist with it god rest his soul what did you pick up stone smiles with satisfaction the mother lode one day presley drove up to the mansion and knocked on the door then he and the judge went out to the gazebo and had a long chat they said enough in thirty minutes to put marston in the gas chamber i hear a faint ringing in my ears jesus what did they say stone shakes his head you havent got anywhere on a motive for marston thats been my problem all along i know leo secretly owned some property that an outoftown company was thinking of buying there was some kind of race angle to that labor problems beyond that i dont have anything you were right on target and you didnt know it it was a carpet company from georgia zebulon hickson the owner was about a mile to the right of attila the hun he thought slavery was the finest and most misunderstood institution this country ever had when he opened new factories he went into communities where what he called the nigger problem didnt exist of course by towns like that were hard to find especially along the mississippi river which was where he wanted to be leo marston stood to make a lot of money off that land but the labor situation wasnt as stable as hickson wanted it blacks were using the unions to push into white jobs hickson had the idea that if an example was made it would calm the blacks down apparently hed done this somewhere in georgia and it had worked marstons plan seems so obvious now all it takes is a few facts i honestly doubt marston ever thought it would work muses stone he was too smart for that but he didnt care whether it worked he just wanted to sell hickson his land so he went to ray presley i fill in he said we need to make an example of somebody you got it marston didnt care who died it was just business why didnt he use the local klan put a word into the right ear and let the klan take care of payton why use a cop marston was the da he knew the klan was riddled with federal informants he wanted zero risk of the murder being traced back to him he also despised the white citizens council he called them illiterate baptist sons of bitches several times on the phone but he trusted presley yes and he was right to its ironic as hell really why youll see in a minute so presley chose del payton as the victim why i dont know he was in charge of voterregistration drives for the local naacp but he was a quiet guy had a nice house and a pretty wife saved his money he had a nicer house than presley did really that by itself could have been the reason anyway zeb hickson was all set to announce his plans for a natchez carpet factory but you had marston by the short hairs yep but you didnt make any arrests stone sighs deeply right why not as soon as hoover heard the tape of marston and presley he ordered me to forward every case note transcript surveillance report witness interview photograph and audiotape to washington after he reviewed all that he scheduled a visit to the jackson field office good pr for the troops he said but the real reason for that trip was to meet leo marston the ringing in my head is an alarm bell now about what politics clyde tolson hoovers assistant made the call i still had the wiretap running and i heard it marston thought he was going up to jackson for a pat on the back for his performance as da when he got there edgar read him the riot act then laid the classic hoover pitch on him which was work for me or endure the punishment you so richly deserve for your sins work for him how a cynical smile thins stones lips this is where it gets interesting and dirty del payton died in may five weeks after martin luther king what else was going on then the vietnam war he waves his hand dismissively the presidential primaries bobby kennedy had jumped into the race as soon as eugene mccarthy proved lbj was vulnerable after kennedy came in johnson announced he wouldnt run for reelection del payton was killed on the day bobby won the nebraska primary and hed won indiana the week before kennedy was shaping up as the likely democratic candidate in november im not following you whats the connection hoover cage compared to the presidential race hoover didnt give a damn what happened to some black factory worker in mississippi why because the fbi director has always served at the pleasure of the president hoover had been director since and he meant to stay director until he died two of his least favorite people in the world were robert kennedy and martin luther king kings assassination had thrilled him literally but bobbys presidential campaign was giving him ulcers can you guess what hoovers mission in life was in not to kill robert kennedy no no forget that crap he wanted to put richard nixon in office and he was willing to do whatever was required to accomplish that hoover and nixon went way back to the election when nixon lost to jfk bobby kennedy on the other hand had treated hoover like shit when he was attorney general so in may nixon is making sober speeches about law and order to middle america while bobby kennedy runs from ghetto to college campus preaching about racial equality poverty in mississippi the evils of the vietnam war and reaching out to the soviet union i still dont see the relevance to del payton stone looks exasperated by my slowness the relevance is to leo marston and more important to his father leos father was a major mississippi power broker a former state attorney general just like leo turned out to be he was close friends with big jim eastland a wellknown segregationist head of the senate judiciary committee and j edgar hoovers number one cheerleader on capitol hill at last the picture is coming clear the sixtyeight presidential election was the second closest in history cage after nixon and jfk in in sixtyeight nixon won by less than one percent of the vote thats how close it was in november back in may when del payton was murdered anything was possible mississippi was a democratic state but it voted strangely in presidential elections in her electors didnt vote for jfk or nixon but some guy named byrd in sixtyfour they voted for goldwater in they were leaning toward wallace i finish george wallace stone nods the racist firecracker from alabama wallace was running as an independent leo and his father were democrats but they thought bobby kennedy was a communist wallace was too racist for them and more important they didnt think he could win so they cast their lot with nixon old man marston was doing all he could to sway the movers and shakers in mississippi to forget wallace and vote republican jesus you see it now into this mess rides special agent dwight stone telling j edgar hoover that the son of one of nixons biggest supporters is responsible for a race murder in mississippi did that make the director happy no sir do you think hoover wanted to tell his buddy senator eastland that the son of an old crony was going to jail for killing a nigger who got out of line no sir and the thought of what bobby kennedy would do with that information was enough to give hoover a heart attack so what do you think hoover said to leo at that meeting in jackson i have no idea sonny boy you fucked up you had the right idea but you got caught its just a good thing you got caught by my people or life would be getting very uncomfortable right now in fact it still could then hoover talked to leos papa its a lot like the godfather nothing formal but everything understood fealty absolute loyalty stone modulates his voice into a scratchy marlon brando impersonation someday i may ask you to perform a difficult service but until that day accept this favor as a gift from that day forward hoover owned the marston family all their influence everything hoover buried your evidence all of it leo went back to his job and his future the payton investigation was allowed to die only ray presley paid a price presley hed shot at us on the highway remember hoover wouldnt let that pass it was part of the price he demanded from marston presley had to go down for something didnt matter what marston gave him up didnt even hesitate presley had a dozen sidelines for making money his police job was just a fulcrum for the rest of it he fenced stuff collected protection money and sold dope right amphetamines mostly for truckers interstate transportation of federally regulated narcotics marston gave us everything we needed to nail him and we fed it to the state police they busted him on possession with intent to distribute i showed up at the arrest just so presley would know it was payback did he find out it was marston who gave him up not as far as i know thats the irony marston was right to trust presley but presley was a fool to trust marston presleys like a dog that way a pit bull maybe stone goes through his little phone ritual again you waiting for a call no he picks up his pistol stands and walks back to the front window they still out there still there so the national security seal was completely bogus stone chuckles dryly completely think about the payton case the bureau had been tasked with destroying violent opposition to civil rights in the south instead hoover purposefully protected a race murderer for his own political ends normally he would have added the payton evidence to his personal files the infamous blackmail files but paytons file was too big for that we had agents in natchez generating reams of useless crap the national security seal was an impenetrable shield do you think the audiotape of marston and presley is still with the main file i doubt it that was the critical evidence it was probably taken to hoovers home when he died with the other blackmail material shelves of books have been written about what might have happened to that stuff youll never find that tape so marstons motive was just money stone finishes greed bastards like him only care about one thing grabbing everything within their reach they think every dollar they get takes them one step closer to immortality and every person they step on puts them one step above everyone else i dont think other people really exist for people like marston theyre just a means to an end including his daughter i think with a shiver when you had the bugs in his mansion i say hesitantly did you ever pick up anything unsavory murder is pretty unsavory im talking about sexual stuff we heard him banging his wifes best friend one day im talking about abuse child abuse he turns away from the window and looks at me no i had a daughter myself if id heard anything like that i would have gone in there and thrashed him within an inch of his life the corner of stones mouth twitches the mikes were only in for a couple of weeks though and i cant remember if henry covered the little girls room i force myself to push livy from my mind i need you to tell this story to a jury itll never happen son i think it will i know about your daughter in the midst of turning back to the window he whips his whole head toward me his eyes burning with anger i hold up both hands im just telling you i know shes whats been keeping you from helping me then you know its pointless to ask me to testify is it i talked to her today and she thinks different stone takes a step toward me you talked to my daughter today yes caitlin masters found her for me you idiot if youve put her life in danger shes all right shes fine and she agrees with me portman started playing carrot and stick with her days ago i didnt even have to tell her you could bring him down she knew you had no right to put her in jeopardy cage i want justice thats all you want revenge youre right but i used to want it for myself now i want it for someone else marston has done things he should die for stone take my word for that the old agent fingers the pistol in his hand my daughter told me two days ago that i should testify she thinks getting this thing off my chest would save my damned soul or something his face hardens shes got no right to sacrifice her career for my guilty conscience she doesnt know how things really work she knows its not her choice damn it his eyes flick around the interior of the cabin god i wish i had a bottle he paces over to the fireplace and pokes the logs sending a storm of sparks up the chimney you dont want me as a witness cage why not im damaged goods because of your drinking drinking isnt one problem its a whole constellation why were you fired five years after the payton murder it wasnt for drinking he stirs the fire some more no though i was drinking like a fish at the time when hoover cut the deal with marston i couldnt believe it i dont know why id seen him do it enough times before but usually it was cases that were dirty all the way around this murder had a real victim an innocent victim and the korea angle really weighed on me i started drinking to forget about it things were turning to shit in the bureau hoover was using us to harass antiwar protesters all kinds of unconstitutional stuff then we got nixon parts of the bureau started to function like the goddamn kgb it made me sick the booze made it tolerable for a while anyway it also made me impossible to live with i drove my wife and baby away i screwed up a dozen different ways then i topped them all youll get a kick out of this because it involves your friend marston what in i was in washington doing some shit work nixon had requested from hoover something too boring for liddy and his plumbers i was walking through the lobby of the watergate office complex and there bigger than life stood leo marston he was in town lobbying john stennis for something or other i was soused when i saw him and i snapped the payton thing had been eating at me for four years when marston saw me that smug bastard tried to make out like we were buddies from way back in on the big joke the dead nigger i straightened him out quick and everybody in the watergate lobby heard me marston lost it he took a swing at me and i pulled my gun i almost laugh remembering the way i snapped and went after marston yesterday henry bookbinder had been outside parking the car stone recalls he ran in and backed me down nobody died but marston screamed blue murder to hoover one of hoovers last acts before he died in seventytwo was firing me i guess thats a distinction of sorts where was portman then stone goes still the poker hovering above the crackling logs climbing the bureau ladder i didnt tell you everything before when hoover took over the payton case i started making copies of my case notes i also copied the audiotape that incriminated marston the hair on my forearms is standing up do you still have that copy he shakes his head portman saw what i was doing he started spying on me reporting to hoover as the case progressed i can just imagine his reports may be ideologically unsound blah blah blah anyway everything was stolen out of my apartment two days before i was fired that was portman i guarantee it on hoovers orders my heart sinks you dont want me as a witness theyd make me look pathetic on cross too many sins of my own whats portman so afraid of now from the story you told his involvement was peripheral the bureaus been under siege for ten years in the publicrelations sense its big achilles heel is racism the fbi has been sued by black agents hispanics women all claiming systematic discrimination and these groups have won portman was appointed to correct these problems to polish the image and he was appointed by a democratic president if it was to come out that his heroic civil rights work in mississippi consisted of helping to cover up a race murder hed be out on his ass in an hour the president would have no choice so lets make it known do the bureau and the country a favor stone sets the poker in its rack and sits on the hearth his face weary i wish i could every trial decision portman ever made as a federal judge would come into question every decision as a us attorney hed never work in the public sector again and once the media got its nose into his past god knows what theyd find a guy like portman doesnt cross the line once or twice its a management style with him why didnt the media discover anything during his confirmation hearings the bureau is a closed culture it outlives presidential administrations judges even supreme court justices if the leadership of that culture wants to keep portmans secrets so he can be appointed fbi director thats the way itll be stone takes out his phone and checks the line again id like to help you cage but theyve held my daughter over me for a long time since she was a kid what oh yeah after he fired me hoover sent me a message portman delivered it if i tried to air any dirty bureau laundry my kid wouldnt live to watch me on meet the press thats pretty hard to believe he laughs bitterly this was worse things were happening every day and the government was right in the middle of it i pull the curtains away from the front window and squint through the gathering dusk beyond what must be the jeep track the snowcovered wall of anthracite mesa climbs toward the sky with spruce and fir trees marching up it in dark ranks what i do not see is human beings what did you mean about presley and marston making a nice package you said why complicate it stone stands and walks toward me telephone in hand i didnt mean anything forget it youre holding something back arent you he has the phone to his ear now and his face has gone white he throws down the phone and rushes me holding out his pistol take it what the phones dead take the gun i take the gun which looks like a colt and stone snatches the hunting rifle up from the table a winchester with a scope open the back door for me he orders theres a sniper out there as i run to the back door i decide that not bringing daniel kelly with me was about the stupidest idea ive ever had stone kneels six feet back from the door shoulders the winchester and puts his right eye to the scope as though preparing to shoot right through the door open it he says slowly then get clear fast i slowly turn the handle then stretch as far away as i can from the door and pull it halfway open stone quickly adjusts his aim then fires the report of the rifle inside the cabin is like a detonation hes down shouts stone follow me where to before he can answer the front window of the cabin explodes inward and a bullet ricochets off the hearth stone whirls draws a small automatic from his belt and empties half a clip through the broken window move he yells grabbing my arm and jerking me toward the door where i ask my throat dry as sand somewhere they cant follow wheres that the river the river in what youll see move your ass chapter as stone pulls me through the back door of the cabin something explodes behind us we fall facedown on the snow stunned like cattle after being hit with an electric prod but we scramble blindly backward for the cover of the cabin wall knowing instinctively that exposure means death hunched against the side of the cabin i scan the swollen river and its banks in the dying light i see no way to use that flooded stream as a means of escape stones lips are moving but i hear nothing he turns and begins tugging at something beneath his cabin its some sort of inflatable boat a long red plastic thing like a cross between a canoe and kayak seeing that i cant hear his orders stone takes back the pistol he gave me then motions for me to drag the kayak to the water a distance of about eighty feet he obviously means to cover me while i do this but im not going to drag anything if i have to cross that open space im going to do it as fast as i can dropping to my knees i turn the kayak upside down and crawl under it sliding it onto my back like an elongated turtle shell its coated fabric skin probably wouldnt stop a pellet gun but at least ill be able to run with the thing as i start toward the river my reebokclad feet slip and crunch over the snow the bow of the kayak bobs forward and back as i rush forward obscuring my vision making my gauntlet longer than it needs to be i cringe at the stutter of an automatic weapon somewhere behind me but the reassuring bellow of stones pushes me on at least i havent completely lost my hearing the last half of my dash to the river has the terrible dreamlike quality of pursuing a receding horizon the shock of my feet hitting rocks under the snow the only tangible proof that im awake the swiftly falling darkness is probably providing more protection than stones pistol but it cant be long before someone sprays a clip at the fleeing kayak when my feet kick up the first splash i leap forward and land in a bonechilling current that pulls at the kayak like a giant hand fighting to my knees in the current i flip the kayak upright and lie down in the shallows beside it leaving only my head exposed muzzle flashes in the cabin windows punctuate the flashes below them where stone must be firing theres a brief lull and then stone comes charging out of the darkness toward the water a twobladed kayak paddle in one hand and his winchester in the other he whirls and fires twice on the run then breaks in my direction using the white propane tank for concealment hes halfway to the water when another flash lights up the interior of the cabin stone grabs his buttocks lurches forward then spins and returns fire as he goes down in the snow i start pulling the kayak toward the bank but the bottom shallows quickly beneath me forcing me into an exposed position the water feels like glacial runoff stealing my breath making my teeth chatter uncontrollably but its better than what stone is enduring every five seconds or so he lets off a round back at the cabin windows but he cant keep that up forever panic scrambles around in my chest like a crazed animal urging me to flight it wouldnt take anything just a surrender to the current i could float downstream for fifty yards then climb into the kayak and be on my way as though sensing my panic stone holds the paddle and rifle along the length of his body and begins rolling across the snow toward the river the old agent looks like a kid playing a game bullets kick up white powder in front of him but he doesnt even slow down when he is five yards away i yell ththrow me the pistol the skids across the snow but i manage to get my fingers around it before it disappears in the river the steel feels warm compared to the water its too dark to aim accurately at the cabin from here but two more muzzle flashes obligingly appear and i let off three shots at the afterimage on my retinas into the current shouts stone what about the kayak too easy to hit just hang onto the rope he rolls into the shallows then hangs up on the rocks somehow i fire twice more at the cabin then grab his belt and drag him into the current while bullets spray water against my knees the muzzle flashes are between the cabin and the river now theyre coming for us as i grope helplessly for the kayak stone rises to his knees in the water the big winchester braced against his shoulder he fires once then cycles the bolt waits three seconds and fires again a fireball the size of the cabin itself explodes out of the darkness sucking up all the air around us i feel the pull in my lungs and sinuses as a milliseconds image of a blazing man is seared into my brain and i tumble backward into the freezing water the propane tank marvels a voice in my head one shot to pierce its skin the second to ignite the gas stone is already in the main channel of the river trying to keep his head and the rifle above the surface wrapping the kayaks bow rope tightly around my wrist i leap into the black water where the current is strongest and give myself to it a couple of desultory shots ring out but they could be loose rounds in the pistols of dead men cooking off in the inferno stone has made of his home the river has us in its power now and the assassins are but a burning memory falling behind us in the dark stone stone ahead of you comes a faint reply did they hit the kayak i dont think so its got three cells check it out since im hanging onto the kayak for dear life its not difficult to obey stones order the strange craft seems intact though its cells dont seem as fully inflated as they might be stones twobladed paddle is wedged between the seats and the starboard gunwale its okay the water here is swift and smooth the moon and stars shine with white brilliance reflecting off the deep water like diamonds flung onto its surface i kick with the current hoping to ease my fear and aloneness by overtaking stone a sharp cry comes from up ahead im trying to place its direction when something smashes into my ribs knocking the wind out of me a rock stone must have hit the same one a white hand appears in the current i grab it and pull then wind the bow rope tightly around the wrist now at least we are riding the river together and will share the same fate thanks says stone his face a gray blur beside mine are you hhit bad i ask trying to control my voice bad enough i dont think it hit bone though shouldnt we get in the kayak he shakes his head well have to beach it to get in another forty yards or so its tough to judge distance in the dark so i count to ten before i start kicking toward the left bank watching for a suitable place to land my kicks seem futile against the power of the river were like cars trapped in the center lane of an interstate slaves to the main current get over stone commands hurry at last a broad shelf of rock rises out of the river like a ramp and its simple enough to float the kayak up onto it stone lets the current wash him up onto his back then lies there wheezing for air what do we do i ask gget in keep going where town six miles south six miles listen cage the rivers at flood were moving faster than you think and its a good thing because weve got to beat those bastards back to town but they can drive i clench my arms over my chest in a vain effort to stop shivering they had to abandon their vehicles just like you theyve got to cover three miles on foot before they can drive in the snow we can beat them if we hurry you ever been on white water its been ten years since ive been in a raft and on that trip my guide went overboard and got crushed between the raft bottom and some rocks breaking his leg in three places a long time ago the slate is easier to run at flood than at low water but weve got two trouble spots both slot canyons the first ones up ahead its a classfive vertical drop but the floodwater should shoot us right over it an image of an eightfoot waterfall flashes into my head the one i saw while trudging up to the cabin this afternoon in my desperation to escape the guns i somehow suppressed this memory but thats what stone is talking about going over that falls in a plastic boat just grab the sides of the kayak he says lean back and pray ill handle the paddle a mile farther on is the second one walls higher than you can reach ending in a tight chute thats like a piledriver people drive their fourwheelers out there to watch the kayakers crash jesus he grabs my windbreaker with a weak grip if i was covering the river thats where id wait itd be tough shooting though well come through that second chute like a runaway freight train and if we clear it well be okay all the way to town they wont be able to find us in the dark this river goes through town he grins right through it lets get this bus on the road i slide the kayak down the rock ramp until the current is tugging it then grab stone by the belt buckle and manhandle him over the side near the stern he goes rigid with pain when his buttocks hit the rock through the airfilled floor of the boat but theres nothing to be done i drag the kayak the rest of the way clear then roll over the side and into the bow immediately the main current has us pulling us to its center gathering speed as the rising banks constrict the water in its headlong flight to the first canyon i get to my knees and try to obey stones barked orderslean left lean right right againas he expertly handles the paddle every twenty yards or so the bow lifts out of the water and slaps back down with a combative thunk i hear the drop stone says from the stern lean left weve got to stay in the channel i dont hear what stone hears but the black trough beneath us bears steadily left and my forward line of sight has gone black then slowly the sound registers on my traumatized eardrums like holding my ear to the biggest conch shell in the world fear balloons in my chest pressing my heart into my throat i dont think stones paddle is affecting the course of the boat anymore i feel like im trapped in a roller coaster as it tops its highest incline and tips slowly forward headed for the long vertiginous fall on both sides walls loom out of the dark near enough to touch then we are airborne lean back yells stone as the kayak is hurled forward into space i obey out of pure instinct my stomach flying up my throat as the bow plummets down a thundering pipeline of water and smashes into something i cannot see then bounces up into a roiling mass of foam and spray were clear he cries one down were back in the main current riding as smoothly as a subway car on a scheduled run the walls of the canyon have fallen away and the sky above us has widened into a starry blanket that gives the snowy riverbanks a silver sheen for ten minutes we slide along as though on a nile cruise but every so often a stand of spruce near the rivers edge reminds me just how fast we are moving the farther we go the more the valley widens around us until it seems we are floating across a vast desert of snow on another night this might seem an ideal time for stone and me to talk for him to tell me what to watch for ahead or to discuss the eternal subjects like women and time but tonight all we can do is shiver in the wind chilled so deeply that if we dont find warmth and shelter soon we could die from exposure almost without our noticing the banks begin to rise again it feels like the river is cutting its way into the earth carrying us with it on its darkening journey the sound of the turbulent water grows as the walls rise like the sound of a great beast waking from a long sleep its coming stone says from behind me listen only the center of the stream is smooth now a black torrent rushing through the narrow canyon throwing off a mist of silver froth and spray the kayak hurtles down this black tunnel like its on rails but of course its not if the bow gets turned around we could spin out of control and be smashed on a rock or capsize and be pinned by an inescapable hydraulic lean right stone yells the kayaks nose pulls left then slingshots around a bend its fabric skin scraping the rock wall with a resilient wail shit theyre covering the chute its difficult to judge distance in the dark but about a hundred yards ahead of us a pair of headlights slices downward and across the narrow river bright as a bonfire in the dark and where those lights wait guns are waiting too we cant make it past that i shout toward the stern weve got to get out too late were in the canyon a jet of fear flushes through my system i feel like a steer being driven into a slaughter chute weve got to get out of the kayak then we cant run the chute without it i turn in disbelief but all i see is stones solemn face as he expertly wields the paddle the current continues to accelerate as the river is forced into an ever narrowing channel the lights are only seventy yards away now they wont see us until were right on top of them stone assures me well be moving so fast theyll only have a couple of seconds to fire what if they have automatic weapons we need suppressing fire can you handle a rifle i dont bother to answer him if we go through that chute in this kayak well be cut to pieces by anyone sighting down the beams of those headlights cage are you listening as the lights loom closer a bowelchurning roar reverberates between the walls one thing i remember my raft guide telling mejust before he broke his legwas that some whitewater guides train by floating rivers wearing only life vests if they can do that in preparation for making a living stone and i can do it without vests to save our lives i said take this rifle he yells without hesitation i throw myself onto the right gunwale of the kayak and press down with all my weight stone screams like a madman but i ignore him leaning harder and farther forward until the first rush of water surges over the side stop it you damn fool and then it is done the inflatable tube that forms the right gunwale digs beyond the point of no return and the river pours into the boat swamping us in seconds the shock of the cold water steals my breath again but i roll over the side and into the main current the kayak is still floating uprightif mostly submergedbut stone wont be able to get it above water without my help at last he heaves himself over the rear gunwale and into the river as soon as hes clear the inflatable rises in the water with a powerful wrenching move i flip it upside down in the current when i let go the buoyant craft rights itself as though nothing had happened you stupid son of a bitch stone appears beside me like a man in the last stages of drowning his eyes furious points of light in the darkness i dont reply the water is driving toward the chute with the momentum of a locomotive stone and me and the kayak bobbing along in it like fishing corks ive got to slow us down a little put us a few seconds behind the kayak a sledgehammer blow to the chest stops me dead in the water purely out of instinct i grab whatever hit me and reach out for stone with my legs an explosive grunt sounds beside me as stone collides with the object and i lock my legs around his waist its a tree trunk a trunk the width of a mans thigh and smooth as glass wedged into a crack in the ledge from which it fell the river is trying to rip stones body from between my knees but i hold him fast with a supreme effort i flex my stomach muscles and pull him higher in the water grab the tree i gasp grab the tree he drapes one arm over it loses his grip then at last manages to get both arms over the trunk can you hold yourself i ask my legs burning from exertion he nods weakly his face white as soon as i relax my leg muscles the river sweeps both our bodies up onto the surface holding us in nearhorizontal positions forty yards away halogen headlights illuminate a thirtyfoot stretch of the chute like searchlights boat boat screams a voice from the roar at the end of the little canyon a voice from the lights the illuminated water in the chute churns into boiling chaos as hundreds of bullets shred its surface the kayak materializes in the headlights as though by magic and instantly explodes into confetti that sails through the bluish beams like the remnants of a childs balloon christ stone coughs listen i hiss in his ear hoping my raft guide knew what he was talking about you go through feet first on your back feet first okay that cushions the rocks he nods his face looking bloodless in the dark how long can you hold on twenty seconds maybe thirty then we might as well go now save our strength stone nods his eyes closed have you still got your pistol i ask in my waistband lets do it on three one two three letting go of the tree trunk is like surrendering to a god so mighty is the force carrying us down the chute yet the water around us seems placid at the center of the channel there is no white water no churning froth or spray just a great black mass of fluid driving forward with unstoppable power stone falls slowly behind me as we hurtle toward the headlights but i cant worry about him now i cant worry about anything i suppose i should pray or vomit from fear or see my life pass before my eyes but i do none of these things at some point terror becomes so total and control so minimal that you simply shed fear like a coat i lie back in the water as though going to sleep only my face above the surface my arms held out from my sides like christ on the cross as i rush feet first toward the great black door at the end of the chute the inverted bowl of sky sparkles with more stars than i have seen in years and i feel a sudden and absurd certainty that whatever is about to happen happened a long time ago as the headlights white out the sky above me i expel all my air and let my head sink beneath the torrent i am nothing to those above me a ripple of water sweeping beneath them a piece of driftwood borne on the flood suddenly the black tide swells beneath me lifting me toward the sky like a magic carpet thunder roars around me atomizing the water to mist there is no air here only different states of water i am suspended long enough to hear bursts of gunfire behind me then a great fist slams me to the bottom of a well and holds me there trying with all its power to bludgeon me unconscious my lungs scream as they did the day i dragged ruby from our burning house but i dare not breathe to breathe here is to join the hammering darkness as suddenly as before the great hand hurls me up out of the well and onto the surface which feels land solid after the vaporous thunder of the chute i feel as though some great beast had sucked me into its maw chewed me for a few moments and finding me distasteful spat me out whole the air feels warm against my face i probe my arms and legs searching for broken bones remarkably i seem intact turning back toward the thundering mist i watch the exit of the chute a white mouth spitting foam between two rock walls like the jet of a great hose surely stone has passed through by now though not i fear as invisibly as i did the gunfire i heard must have been directed at him i try to tread water but my strength is gone i can only lie back and float nose and mouth above the surface waiting for some sign that stone survived an image of his bulletriddled body bobbing up beside me flits through my head but i quickly banish it my odds of surviving the night up here without him are very low stone will come if anything the exfbi man is tougher than i he is nearly seventy yes and hes wounded but its not as though physical prowess of any degree could affect ones fate while passing through that cataract stones fate is in the lap of the gods swim goddamn it for a dazed moment i think i am talking to myself but im not stone has kicked up beside me like a shipwrecked sailor looking more dead than alive did they hit you again his eyes are only half open kick your feet cage weve got another half mile to go why not get out here too close kick damn you i start kicking and soon enough the current is carrying us along as steadily as it did behind stones cabin though more slowly the river has spread out here shrubs and boulders sail past us in the moonlight while smaller rocks abrade our knees and elbows stone grips my windbreaker and speaks as we drift along crested butte is three miles south we cant stay in the river without the boat too cold and i cant run im not dying but i cant run theres a campground up here when we get close youre going to get out on the south bank right now theyre stuck north of the river follow the river south running as fast as you can hugging the bluff for cover when you see the lights of town circle to your right and come in from the south in case theyre waiting for you im not leaving you here you we havent got time for this you want a bar called the silver bell its just off the main street elk avenue the bartender is a mountain of a guy called tiny mcswain in my drinking days we got pretty tight tell tiny to take you to an airport any airport but the one you flew into still got your wallet i grab my hip pocket still there cash i nod i brought two thousand dollars in hundreddollar bills for just this reason so i couldnt be traced by credit card charges you may have to hide out until you get a morning flight denver maybe do whatever you have to do but stay out of sight a yellow light appears from the darkness ahead hovering in the air to my right about fifty yards away thats the campground stone says come on we separate and fight our way to the south bank as my hands collide with cold rock i hear a screech of brakes ahead crawling out of the water i realize my legs are nearly numb they must have driven like banshees to get here that fast stone says through rattling teeth tear off a piece of your shirttail what your shirttail in my weakened state tearing the soaked cotton is like trying to rip a phone book in half as i struggle with the hem stone jabs a stick through a stretchedtaut place and rips off a long piece what do you want me to do make a surrender flag he hands me the fabric and rolls over on his stomach wad up a hunk of that and jam it into my wound i tear off most of the shirttail and squeeze it into a tight wet tennis ball of cloth then crouch over stones back garbled voices float to us from the direction of the campground where are you hit left cheek of my ass took out a plug of muscle i think i feel along his left buttock until my fingers mush into a warm opening stone doesnt even flinch the hole is ragged but it runs across the buttock at an angle like a deep grazing wound the swelling below it is considerable though and its bound to get worse now that hes out of the cold water hurry he grunts i squeeze the cloth into a tighter ball and hold it against the opening ready do it in one hard stroke i depress the cloth into the hole as he tenses beneath me it reminds me of helping my father pack a decubitus ulcer when i worked for him in high school now i need something to hold the packing in the wound removing my soaked windbreaker i pull off whats left of my shirt and slide it under stones left leg then tie it over the hole thats the best i can do for now i tell him pulling my jacket back on whats the name of the bar he asks rolling over his face is even whiter than before the silver bell bartenders tiny mcswain good move your ass kid what are you going to do he drops one hand to his waist where the butt of his glints dully in the dark slow those bastards down for you ill stay and help you damn it you cant help me you dont have a gun youll help me by getting your ass back to mississippi and nailing portmans hide to the barn wall stone the old agent grips my arm with more strength than i thought he could possibly have left no matter what you hear keep running i mean that if it sounds like the goddamn ok corral up here you keep running until you reach that bar theres only one way ill go hows that if you promise to testify his laughter is full of irony boy if i survive this night wild horses couldnt stop me from testifying portman gave the order for these sons of bitches to kill us because he thought i was going to testify well now hes right if im alive ill get to mississippi ill drag portmans ass down from the mountaintop if i have to tear the whole mountain down with him marston too now get your ass out of here i get to my knees and look through the trees to the south dont come back stone says quietly not with tiny or the sheriff after you leave everybody up here but me is a target thats how i want it the whole thingll be over by the time anybody could get here and if i dont come out on top whoever came would die for nothing if you come back ill shoot you myself i grab his upper arm the trial starts in thirtysix hours you get your ass back to mississippi you owe it to del payton he nods in the dark that i do cage that i do my run to the town is a benumbed nightmare of falls and slides and collisions with trees an endless march into a killing wind but i never consider resting dwight stone is offering up his life to cover my escape the first gunshot echoes down the valley behind me as the glow of crested butte appears like a mirage in the distance all my instincts say turn around go back and help stone but the old soldiers tone of his last order keeps me going over rock through snowdrifts past a black mirror of a lake through thickets thorns plodding forward into the relentless wind ever forward until at last i am sliding down a white slope toward a geometric heaven of lights and warmth when i reach the level of the buildings i circle to my right in a broad arc that takes me around to the south entrance of town muted television dialogue drifts on the air and the occasional sound of a car motor rumbles from between the buildings crested butte looks less like a cowboy town than a nineteenth century new england village plopped down in the mountains the buildings along elk avenue have victorian facades and flowers line every street and window box the windows are mostly dark but as i move along the street a shopkeeper backs out of a doorway gives me a furtive glance then locks his door and hurries to a truck parked across the street twenty yards farther on a yellow funnel of light appears down a side street to my left illuminating a wooden bell painted silver i turn down the alley and crunch through the snow as fast as my tingling feet will carry me the silver bell has oldfashioned swinging doors its a rustic place that caters to locals not a ski bar fluffed up for the tourist trade there are three people sitting at the bar and two loners at the tables all look like serious drinkers behind the bar stands a giant of a man with a grayflecked black beard he has to be tiny mcswain as soon as he sees me he moves around the bar as though to throw me out before he can i hold up my hands and croak if youre tiny mcswain dwight stone sent me he stops his eyes narrowed who are you better for you if you dont know stone told me youd help me somebody heard shots up near the mesa he says suspiciously was that dwight it was the people trying to kill him him and me both ill call the sheriff wheres dwight hes back by the creek he told me not to call anybody he said everything would be over by the time anybody could get to him and if not theyd get killed for nothing those his words near enough tiny nods then we dont call anybody there are at least two men up there probably more stones a tough old boy what did he tell you to do he said tell you to take me to an airport which airport denver and he said do it quick tiny motions for a tshirtclad woman at a table to get behind the bar then takes a set of keys from his pocket lets go friend hey calls the woman where are you going if anybody asks if anybody asks me and this guy went back up the slate to help dwight tiny mcswain looks at his customers who are staring indifferently at me nobody else says different blank nods from the drinkers my broncos parked out back he says lets go chapter i am standing at the continental airlines gate in baton rouge searching the crowds of travelers for daniel kelly as fear slowly devours me from the inside a week ago i stood a few yards from here entranced by the sight of livy marston now i stand shaking from adrenaline and lack of sleep wondering whether dwight stone survived the night and whether i will live to defend myself at my slander trial which is scheduled to begin in less than twentyfour hours kelly should have been here hours ago but ive seen no sight of him a dozen businessmen who could be fbi agents have passed me stared at me even bumped into me but none has tried to stop me so far anyway if kelly doesnt show in the next five minutes im going to try to reach natchez on my own last night tiny mcswain drove me all the way to denver and dropped me at an airport motel i paid cash and checked in under a false name then lay in the chilly darkness unable to sleep twice i lifted the phone to call the colorado state police and send them up the mesa after stone i had visions of him lying wounded beside the slate river his attackers dead him dying but savable if he reached a surgeon in time but stones orders came back to me and each time i set the phone down instead i called sam jacobs in natchez being fairly sure that his phone would not be tapped the geologist promised to visit caitlin masters first thing in the morning and through her instruct kelly to be at the baton rouge airport by ten am and to meet every plane arriving from dallas after that time i know jacobs well enough to know he followed through but kelly isnt here when i did finally close my eyes last night i saw nightmarish images of leo marston raping livy as a child forcing her into a conspiracy of silence raising her in a schizophrenic world of material bounty and spiritual agony somehow maintaining such a hold on her that she still allowed him sexual access at the age of eighteen when i pondered the nature of that hold i felt the dread and horror i felt the first time i saw roman polanskis chinatown the dread came when faye dunaway told jack nicholson that the young woman she had been hiding was her daughter and her sister the horror arrived with the next line when jack reaching for a thread of sanity asked about her father he raped you and dunaway looked up and slowly shook her head all sanity spun away with this terrible confession i remember something similar from reading anais nin in college that nin had seduced her father several times but nin had been profligate in her sexual adventures and besides she was french the idea of livy marston voluntarily having sex with her father simply would not set in my mind as reality continental airlines passenger penn cage please pick up the nearest white courtesy phone it takes a moment for my name to sink in but when it does my fear escalates to alarm the caller could be kelly or caitlin but it could also be someone who means me great harm continental airlines passenger penn cage please pick up the nearest white courtesy phone theres a white phone across the concourse from me near a bank of pay phones but i cant make myself walk over to it what if portmans people are waiting to snatch whoever walks up to answer that call on the other hand what choice do i have the caller could be daniel kelly this is penn i say picking up the phone its kelly jesus are you in the airport yes but we cant meet listen to me penn we only have a few seconds kellys use of my first name rather than the facetious boss brings my inner self to attention what is it portmans men are in the airport right now youre going to have to get home on your own im going to divert these guys but you have to move fast im listening my taurus is parked in sight of the terminal in the shortterm lot space a the keys are under the mat and theres a cell phone under the seat you got that a right next downstairs near the baggage carousels theres an infiniti q on display i left a gun sitting on the left inside lip of the rear bumper jesus listen you get that gun get to the car and haul your ass back to natchez what are you going to do buy you some time but youve got another problem i havent been straight with you nobody at the company has theyve reported every move youve made to portman my chest goes hollow how do you know that because we re reporting every move you make back to the office and we dont usually do that our ceo is former fbi you know and john portman could swing a lot of corporate business to argus any time he feels like it the implications of kellys revelation ricochet through my mind is my family safe argus doesnt kill people other than in defense of a client like the other night but id find myself some new security just to be on the safe side local boys maybe buddies are good familys better kelly how do i know i can trust you because youre alive and because im telling you this why are you telling me a brief silence i think its got something to do with the way you buried your maid now get your ass out of here walk fast but dont run and if you hear shooting dont look back his order is an exact echo of stones kelly well be sharing a scotch again before you know it move out reluctantly hanging up the phone i scan the concourse like a tailback picking holes in an offensive line then start through the crowds at a rapid walk looking back frequently for signs of pursuit after clearing the metal detectors i dodge a golf cart carrying a handicapped woman then bound down the escalator to the baggagecollection point where annie and i said goodbye to caitlin masters before we knew who she was parked in the middle of the floor is the infiniti q midnight blue i look around once then crouch down and reach under the bumper feeling along the inside lip for kellys gun my fingers collide with something hard but as i try to close them around it the gun clatters to the floor glancing around at the people waiting for luggage i drop to my stomach and sweep my hand across the tile and the gun skitters into my chest its kellys browning hipower i jam the pistol into my waistband beneath my shirt and trot past the rental car desks to the glass doors leading to the outdoor parking lot ive heard no shots or even shouts since my conversation with kelly but this actually increases my anxiety did he manage to divert whoever was waiting for me or is he lying dead beneath a pay phone the slug from a silenced pistol in his head the taurus is parked sixty yards from the terminal i can see it from the doors exiting the terminal with a group of lsu fraternity guys i fall in with them until they stop near a blazer thirty yards from the door then break for the taurus at a flatout sprint to my surprise the wind cuts through my jacket with a cold bite maybe fall has come to mississippi at last laying kellys pistol on the seat beside me i retrieve the keys crank the engine and force myself to drive normally as i leave the lot in ten minutes im on highway natchez lies eighty miles to the north but much of the road is twolane blacktop and heavily traveled by log trucks the trip can be agonizingly slow during the day i reach under the seat for the cell phone switch it on and dial the natchez examiner caitlin has been handling the transportation of my outoftown witnesses huey moak and lester hinson are scheduled to arrive in baton rouge tonight and wed planned to have one of the argus men pick them up penn caitlin asks after a minute of hold music yes remember your phones tapped whats going on ive been freaking out here have you asked any of the argus guys to pick up the witnesses yet not yet i can call them now dont why not just dont dont even mention it ill be there soon and ill handle it hang tight until then stay inside the newspaper building if you can penn kelly was acting a little strange before he left like i might not see him again you might not things are pretty fluid right now im on my way listen an hour ago my receptionist told me i had a call from the editor of the rocky mountain news when i got to the phone he told me he was sending a reporter down to cover your trial and he wanted to know if the guy could use our office facilities and he said the reporters name was bookbinder henry bookbinder bookbinder stones dead partner and the rocky mountain news is based in denver i want to scream with joy but i just say did he say when this reporter would arrive only that hed be here in time to cover the trial and theres something else what cnn court tv and some others have been pressing judge franklin to allow the trial to be televised cameras arent allowed in mississippi courtrooms i know but this is a civil case apparently if both parties agree the judge could allow it but why would leo agree portman would tear him a new one if he did cnn and the other networks have been saying publicly that if marston and portman have nothing to hide they should have no problem with cameras its a pr nightmare for portman its extortion basically i assume youd have no objection to cameras of course not good because i already told a cnn reporter that you didnt thats fine listen if that reporter you mentioned shows up keep him inside the building until i get there i will thanks ill be there before you know it as i hang up the phone i yell you tough old son of a bitch though he is probably a thousand miles away right now dwight stone is almost certainly alive if he can reach natchez by tomorrow morning without being killed my slander trial will provide more fireworks than the city has seen in decades and leo marston will be indicted for murder only now that prospect does not offer even a shadow of the satisfaction it would have two days ago if im right about leo being jenny does father every judgment i ever made about livy marston was wrong in my mind she has already been transformed from a privileged princess into a tragic figure a lost girl trying to find her way i try to keep the taurus under the speed limit a state trooper has haunted this stretch of road for years handing out tickets like confetti as the hardwood forest drifts past i lean back in the seat and force myself to ponder one of the connections that came to me last night in the darkness of the denver motel sometime near dawn a remarkable and frightening idea struck me a possible link between del payton and leo marston dwight stone believes ray presley randomly chose del payton to be murdered but if my theory of paternal incest is true there could be a secret link joining the payton and marston families one which dwight stone would have known nothing about althea payton althea is a nurse now she works in the hospital nursery but where did she work in the s could she have worked for a private physician a pediatrician perhaps is it possible that she noticed some physical evidence of sexual abuse while handling livy marston and reported it to the doctor if she had what would have been the likely result in the s sexual abuse of children was grossly underreported and became public only in the most egregious cases a man as powerful as leo marston would have had little to fear from a doctor especially if the evidence was equivocal and even if it wasnt would the doctor have the nerve to confront leo to bring in the police to investigate the district attorney of course leo marston would never have been to the pediatricians office he wouldnt have taken time out of his day to carry his daughter to the doctor maude would have done that a pediatrician might have been more comfortable bringing certain suspicious symptoms to the mothers attention but if he wasnt a compassionate nurse certainly might have mother to mother i can see althea payton doing that pulling maude aside and pointing out a couple of things in the interest of the child what would leo have done if maude had confronted him with such a thing denied it of course deny deny deny then he would have demanded to know the source of maudes suspicions if she told him it was althea what then killing althea would certainly silence her but it was del who had died not his wife perhaps leo had initially taken no action but later when the necessity arose to kill a black man to make an example for the georgia carpet magnate had leo chosen del payton out of some perverse desire to strike back at the woman who had threatened him a wild scenario perhaps but leo long ago demonstrated his penchant for holding grudges whatever the case unraveling the truth of this low tragedy will be a nightmare for everyone involved the idea of confronting livy with my deductions leaves me numb a few miles before i reach town i call sam jacobs at work tell him my family might be in danger and ask for his help jacobs is thirtyeight years old with a wife and two kids but by the time i arrive at the prentiss motel he is parked outside with a magnum sitting on the front seat of his hummer when i see that i know i am looking at the jewish boy who discovered the list of klansmen and white citizens council members in his fathers attic with me twentyfive years ago with sam beside me i inform the three remaining argus security men that their services are no longer required its an awkward moment but they say little and leave the motel with expressionless faces im tempted to tell them to pass a message to their boss when they get back to houstonthat he should look forward to a multimilliondollar lawsuitbut i dont want to do anything that might hurt daniel kelly in the future my parents are stunned by my action but as soon as i explain what kelly told me my father gets on the phone and speaks to two patients of hisavid huntersand they promise to arrive within the hour loaded for bear dad then makes my day by informing me that while i was in crested butte he finally persuaded betty lou beckham to take the witness stand tomorrow and tell the jury that she saw ray presley in the triton battery parking lot only seconds after del payton died what we need now is a new place to stay a secure location and its my mother who solves this problem when our house burned a friend of moms offered us rooms in her bedandbreakfast which occupies the slave quarters of her home aquitaine a massive greek revival mansion completed in not wanting to impose on her friends hospitality mom declined but these are special circumstances and the fall pilgrimage has just ended so our staying there wont cost the chatelaine her peak season fees one phone call secures us lodgings in the slave quarters of aquitaine since the fire destroyed most of our things moving from the motel to the mansion is relatively painless the twostory slave quarters was sited across the ornamental gardens from the main house which occupies most of a city block on the north side of town near stanton hall once were settled in our rooms i order out for pizza and spend the fortyminute wait playing with annie in the garden she dances around the rim of the central fountain like a gymnast oblivious to the anxiety mounting in the adults as the hours tick down to tomorrows trial that she does not pick up on our feelings shows me just how far she has come in her journey from the hypersensitive state that followed sarahs death after devouring my share of pizza i deal with the messages that came in while i was in crested butte althea payton called several times but the most persistent caller was ike ransom dad says ike is desperate to talk to me and that he sounded both angry and afraid during their conservations i call althea and give her an encouraging update editing the violence into a less frightening picture nevertheless she tells me that del jr wants to help me any way he can and that shes going to send him over to help keep the nogoods away until the trial in less than an hour del arrives carrying a sawedoff shotgun and takes up a post on the balcony of the slave quarters overlooking the street which leaves me ike i am not particularly anxious to talk to him after the way he acted at rubys funeral whatever the source of his hatred for leo marston it has pushed him into unstable territory ike clearly has both a drug and alcohol problem and since he is unwilling or unable to provide me with any facts that will help prove marston guilty of murder in a court of law i see no urgent need to call him i call ray presley instead dwight stones revelation that marston gave up presley to the feds as part of his deal with j edgar hoover was music to my lawyers ear presley considers leo marston his friend and loyalty is the supreme virtue to men of presleys ilk but if ray was to learn that the five years he spent in parchman were courtesy of leo marston his attitude toward the judge might change fast but whether he will or not remains a mystery because presley doesnt answer his phone i am working up the courage to call livy when the telephone rings in my room somehow ike ransom has discovered that weve moved to aquitaine and he wants to see me he got my phone number from the main house i start to beg off but he stops me cold he has he says what weve been looking for since day one hard evidence linking leo marston to paytons murder he will say no more and he refuses to come to the b ampb he insists on a facetoface meeting and says i must come alone when i ask why he tells me that no one can know he is the source for what hes about to tell me where do you want to meet i ask recalling the feeling of being shot at in the warehouse by the river and not liking it too much youre three blocks away from it he replies where are you talking about the old pecanshelling plant an image of a hulking brown brick building where i sold the pecans i collected as a boy comes into my mind it is set right on the edge of the bluff and as ike said its only three blocks west of where i am now what about the surveillance on me here slip out the back alley on foot they lookin for that bmw or you could send your jew buddy out first in the bmw then come on in that maxima your mama got its nearly dark and i want to refuse largely out of fear but ike is offering something of which i have precious little hard evidence dwight stones testimony could be powerful but without his fbi files to back him up it will be his word against marstons and portmans too if the fbi director decides to honor my subpoena hard evidence is worth a threeblock trip when i ask thirty minutes the place is an equipmentstorage yard now drive around to the left side of the building the chain on the gatell be cut ill be there i hang up and speak to sam jacobs on the balcony and sam declares himself ready to draw off the surveillance long enough to get me clear of aquitaine the old pecanshelling plant stands on prime real estate in natchezs old warehouse district a sort of nomansland between the town proper and a sleepy residential area filled with victorian gems it has an unobstructed view of the river and one day will probably be the site of a luxury hotel at the moment it is an eerily lighted compound surrounded by a high fence and razor wire with the rigid arms of great cranes jutting against the night sky as ike promised the chained gate on the left side of the building has been cut open i nose the maxima through it without getting out and negotiate my way through backhoes draglines and d bulldozers parked like pattons army marshaling for a campaign i cant see the river but forty yards to my left the bluff drops away to a vast dark sky leaving the impression that im driving along the edge of a mountain out of the blackness to my right a pink and blue light bar strobes like a carnival then vanishes i slow nearly to a stop trying to place the location of ikes cruiser there i turn right and idle toward the main building as the black silhouette looms over me the lights flash again in their light i see that ike has opened the old truck door of the plant and is parked in it as i approach he starts his engine and pulls forward leaving me plenty of room to pull inside the building i park the maxima beside his cruiser and shut off the engine kellys browning is in the glove box but i dont want to cause any kind of reflex reaction in ike especially if hes wired on speed ike is standing by my passenger door between his car and mine i get out and walk around the trunk of the maxima extending my hand to shake his what have you got ike he holds out his hand but instead of shaking he grabs my wrist and jerks me to my knees on the concrete floor as i try to look up something slams into the top of my skull the blow drives every thought out of my head leaving only white noise my first coherent perception is of something cold and hard pressed against my hairline thats a gun he says dont fucking move the terror generated by the gun barrel is absolute paralyzing if any muscle in my body is moving its the sphincter of my bladder ike what the hell are you doing his breath is ragged above me like a sick animals ike where the fuck you been he shouts and the reek of cheap whiskey rolls over me like steam answer me goddamn it ike whats wrong lets talk face to face man i said where the fuck have you been colorado i went back to see stone i knew it you sneaky son of a bitch you been holding out the whole time what that motherfucker tell you he told me what we want to know he told me what happened here in sixtyeight ive got marston nailed man he twists around me and jabs the gun into my cervical spine what did stone say happened he told me why marston wanted payton dead it was a land deal marston stood to make a lot of money off some land but he had to make an example of a black union worker first he paid presley to do it for him presley chose payton bullshit another fog of whiskey blows over me what do you mean bullshit dont lie to me goddamn it dont you lie he jerks back the slide on the gun and everything inside me goes into free fall my thoughts my courage my blood pressure ike please ive got a little girl man just tell me what the problem is and the gun barrel rakes around my neck under my jaw up my right cheek to my eye all i can see now is the taut belly of ikes brown uniform get up he says coldly get up the gun barrel stays screwed into my eye socket as i rise but my terror abates slightly the prospect of dying on my knees was as debasing as it was frightening ikes gun is shaking as he pulls it out of my eye socket and lays the barrel against my forehead i see his eyes bloodshot and jerky the eyes of a man in agony you a goddamn liar he says i shoulda known a white boy wouldnt go against his own in the end you been dicking that marston bitch all along you in with em all the way he shakes his head as though at his own stupidity setting up to get the nigger like always ike i have no idea what youre talking about im setting up to get leo marston and im going to use ray presley to do it if i can find him dwight stone and ray presley are going to send that bastard to the extermination chamber at parchman but ike isnt listening at the word presley his eyes glaze over with blind rage that fucking presley he told you didnt he told me what talk to me ike somethings been eating you up since we started this what is it he bites his lip and presses the gun harder against my forehead then suddenly he lets it drop to his side i didnt know what i was doing man he says in a desolate voice hadnt been back in the world but three months couldnt get no kind of job i applied with the police three times they wouldnt even talk to me had all the negro cops they needed they said didnt have but three same with the sheriff id done more police work in saigon than them motherfuckers done their whole lives and they wouldnt even give me a chance im more confused than ive been since the start of this mess but im not about to interrupt him what else could i do man he almost wails wasnt gonna go on no welfare i had to deal he slaps at a mosquito on his sweating face presley got me on a traffic stop just speeding but he pulled his weapon and made me open my trunk he found half a pound of white lady illegal search if i ever saw one but you think that mattered back then in them days he coulda sent me to parchman for fifty years behind that much heroin a dark perception is blooming in the corner of my brain a fetid cloying orchid of a thought what did he want you to do ike dont play that shit you already know the pain in his eyes is terrible to behold i hold up both my hands i know what you tell me thats all what you think happened man motherfucker put it to me right there on the side of the road said he had somebody needed killing said id been killing for uncle for two years what was one more i knew what one more was but what could i do man he had me i didnt want to die on parchman farm presley took my dope and told me if i tried to back out hed plant it on me and bust me all over again he wanted you to kill del payton what you think i been saying the nausea of a roller coaster that hurtles in only one directiondown sweeps over me as the whole sick plan falls together in my head you asked presley to get the c didnt you he stares at me with strangled emotion presley wanted the car blown up i didnt know nothing about dynamite but id worked with c in nam i told him if he could get me some plastic i could do the job jesus ike did you know del no he was ten years older than me grew up out to pine ridge did you know about his civil rights work hell no i thought he was dicking a white woman or something didnt matter though i was so fucked up i didnt know nothing bout nothing ike listen what you did was terrible but dont you judge me he cries the whites of his eyes making him look wild in the dark dont you cast no stone i been torturing myself thirty years after i realized the work del was doing i just about went crazy the whole town was marching for him i wanted to scream out what id done what presley made me do but i didnt have the guts i couldnt face my own sin the diabolical irony of ray presleys plan leaves me cold he actually blackmailed a black man into committing a civil rights murder he and marston must have laughed for weeks over that one theyve been laughing for thirty years does stone know this or does he really believe presley killed payton stone course he knows he came to see me back then he had the whole thing dogged out why didnt he arrest you why didnt he tell me about you ike seems only partially aware of what im saying i dont know why he was different i guess why didnt you tell me all this at the start what could i tell you man i knew what id done i knew about presley but thats all i knew what happened but i didnt know why and that was the only way you were gonna get marston but how did you know marston was involved did presley tell you he didnt tell me shit a year after it happened somebody called me on the phone wouldnt say nothing i was about to hang up when they started playing this tape it was marston and presley talking about del being killed talking about me i figured it was stone had to be stone must have called and played ike ransom the copy hed made of the evidence tape hed sent to j edgar hoover and his reason i suspect was a dark one thirty years ike thirty years couldnt you figure a way to trade what you knew for immunity or who was i gonna go to man spittle flies from his mouth the fbi already knew what had gone down and they didnt arrest nobody a few years later i tried to find stone but the bureau had fired his ass portman was a us attorney and i knew better than to trust that yankee piece of shit and marston was on the state supreme court whats a drunk nigger cop from mississippi gonna do against people swingin that kind of weight you tell me then why tell me why try at all after thirty years his broad shoulders sag as though under a great weight and he speaks toward the floor i didnt have no choice it ate at me so long i thought it would get better over time but it got worse a few months back i found myself going to church not wanting to needing to you know being raised catholic i guess dont matter if you stop goin you can give up on god but it dont matter cause he dont give up on you the tortured paths this man has pushed himself down are beyond any imagining ike you came to me knowing you could go to jail for the rest of your life that you could be executed that means a lot and ive figured a way to turn presley against marston if youll get on that witness stand tomorrow and tell the truth is stone gonna testify yes is he here in town this isnt the time to lie no but hes on his way here some people tried to kill us last night portmans guys probably we got split up ike starts pacing back and forth patting the sigsauer against his leg but hes alive you cant let your decision be based on what stone does this things eating you alive because you know you did wrong terrible wrong its got nothing to do with you or me you owe it to althea payton to tell the truth you owe it to del you owe it to yourself man i dont owe nobody but god the sig jerks up again aimed at my chest now you dont know how close its been at first i thought maybe you could nail marston without me having to go down but that was stupid crazy the closer you got to the truth the more i saw i was gonna have to pay the piper no matter what one night i got so drunk i thought about killing you just to stop it all that night you left the newspaper by yourself i was right behind you my heart feels like a ball of lead i couldnt do it though part of me just wanted to pay i guess father tom says you got to but i cant go to parchman farm i done sent too many brothers there myself i cant die in them cotton fields up there you wont have to ike cnn will be covering that trial tomorrow you get on the stand and tell the story you just told me youll have johnnie cochran down here begging to defend you what you did was wrong but youre the least guilty of the three by far i think stone believed that too you know what the right thing is thats why you came to me in the first place he lets his gun fall again then half turns from me and murmurs in the dark i started out all right but i turned off somewhere that day my shoulder got hurt everything started going down he holsters his pistol and walks past me toward the wide door and looks out at the luminous clouds scudding over the river beyond him i can see a few stars infinitely small on this first cool night he turns back to face me but since hes silhouetted in the door i cannot see his features ill do it he says father tom gonna think im the best man he ever knew but he gonna be the only one every black man woman and child in this country gonna curse my name he half turns again and a dim shaft of light illuminates his face in eight years as a prosecutor i never saw a man look so lost ike opens his mouth to say something then flings an arm out as though to grab me but he cant because hes flying backward snatched like a puppet on a string before he hits the floor a peal of thunder booms through the warehouse ike he doesnt answer hes lying facedown on the dirty floor blood pumping from a fistsized hole where his left shoulder blade used to be chapter i run to ike then drop to the cement floor as a second shot booms through the building a third punches through the front and rear windshields of the maxima which is parked two feet to my left and the concussion of the gun echoes around the old structure for three or four seconds the shooter is inside the building inside and probably at the front shooting across the open floor but he must not have a nightvision scope he shot ike as the deputy framed himself against the lighter background of the open loading door now that were flat on the floor his shots are far off the mark ikes face is less than six inches from mine his eyes wide and glassy like those of a wounded deer ike i whisper can you hear me his eyelids blink once slowly but he doesnt speak the man is dying before my eyes i need a gun kellys browning is in the glove box of the maxima but im not about to try to reach it if i rise off the ground i will silhouette myself against the open door just as ike did if i had walked to that door first i would be dying now ike i need your gun as i reach down to his holster something cracks through the air less than a foot above us and the report that follows seems trivial compared to that supersonic passage of metal fighting down panic i try to wrest the sigsauer from ikes holster but it wont budge he must have snapped the strap when he holstered it unsnapping it by touch i yank out the sig and take the safety off as i aim it across ikes back a bullet crashes into his body knocking us both a foot across the cold floor he doesnt make a sound then like a rising wind a wail of inhuman agony escapes his throat i shove my arm across his waist and fire three quick rounds into the darkness at the front of the building something sharp pricks the skin of my forearm bone splinters the last shot smashed ikes pelvis he screams again the sound sickeningly reminiscent of those sarah made when the narcotics began to lose their race to keep up with the pain of her bone lesions who is shooting at us an anonymous sniper like the one who shot at me on the levee that night the one kelly killed with a strange rush of clarity i realize that the levee sniper wasnt shooting only at me as id thought at the time what did ike say that night how you know he was shooting at you ike had known from the beginning that he carried knowledge people would kill him for as i cower behind his body a voice calls out from the other end of the building give it up the niggers dead before i can process these words another truncated wail bursts from ikes lungs brrrraaaaaaah my instinct is to run for the door run until my legs buckle beneath me but that would be suicide the moment i rise ill make myself a target i could probably crawl out but ike isnt dead yet i cant leave him my next thought born from rage is to stand up and charge the darkness that shields the sniper emptying ikes automatic as i run with a defiant yell i fire off two more rounds then jump to my feet and grab ikes legs two shots boom through the building as i drag him facedown and screaming behind his cruiser but the bullets crack past without finding flesh or bone kneeling beside him i break the most fundamental rule of firstaid by turning him over onto his back at this point it cant matter much his eyes are still open his jaw is moving but no sounds come from his throat i lean over his mouth brrr he groans i take one of his hands in mine and squeeze the cold flesh ike what are you saying press me he must think i can stop the bleeding where your shoulder pressleee press lee the niggers dead son of a bitch no sniper hired by john portman would talk that way he wouldnt talk at all the man at the other end of this building is raymond aucoin presley the trial is tomorrow and presley has no intention of being indicted for murder thats why he wasnt at his trailer when i called earlier hes been following ike around laying for a shot ray i yell at the top of my voice stop shooting i need to talk to you both windshields of ikes cruiser star into chaos as safety glass rattles across the floor what you got to say i want to hear comes the voice i recognize so easily now you want it in the head or the heart i will live or die by my actions in the next minute listen to me ray you want to hear this want to hear you choke on your own blood every hair on my body is standing erect presley isnt nearly as far away as he was a moment ago hes moving up for a kill shot crawling to the left side of the cruiser i fire two quick rounds into the dark then dart back to avoid return fire aimed at my muzzle flash not even close boy the tire beside my head explodes into ragged strips of rubber as presleys next shot reverberates through the building when the echo dies i call you want to know who sent you to parchman ray i think youll be surprised he fires again smashing up a divot of cement beside ikes head parchman ray didnt you ever wonder who ratted you out silence then talk fast boy im getting close he is close it takes every bit of nerve i possess to hold my ground it was marston ray leo sent you up stone solved the murder but hoover didnt want leo going down for it leos old man had too much political clout hoover cut a deal to protect him but he said you had to go down for shooting at stone and portman on the highway it was leo who gave you up thats bullshit for the first time the voice has come from more or less the same place stone said marston didnt even hesitate he fed the state police details of your drug business so they could catch you in the act thats why stone was at the bust you lying piece of shit youre just trying to save your own ass hes buying it leo didnt give a shit about you ray how else do you think they got you you must have had a lot of time to think about it five years man more silence ray no sound at all nothing but the slow ticking of the two cars barely audible through the ringing in my ears the son of a bitch is probably moving up to kill me and if i dont move im going to die but if i break for the door im framing myself for a shot shivering against ikes body i realize that i no longer hear his breathing his eyes are still open but they are fixed and dilated ike the spike is dead ray talk to me ray nothing the loading door beckons but as i gather my legs beneath me ruby flowerss voice sounds in my head an echo from childhood broad is the gate that leads to destruction but narrow the way that leads to salvation to my leftin what must be a corner of the old shelling plantis a pool of darkness so black it could be the bottom of the marianas trench my legs are tensed beneath me like steel springs gripping ikes gun in my right hand i launch myself low and hard toward that black hole as the darkness envelops me a stroke of lightning flashes in my brain and i know no more consciousness returns like blood to a sleeping limb pain is the first sensation then light the pain radiates from my forehead the light is faint but real thirty yards away illuminating a parked police car not a police car a sheriffs cruiser ikes cruiser i roll over slowly and feel along the cold cement for ikes gun my right wrist bangs into something cold and immovable i touch it with my hand and feel along it a steel rail its one loading arm of a forklift thats what i slammed into when i ran into the pool of darkness a goddamn forklift the gun is underneath the fork closing my hand around its butt i get to my feet and walk toward ikes car strangely i am unafraid unafraid because i know im alone if i wasnt i would be dead ray finally believed what i was telling him and once he did his priorities changed at the edge of the darkness i look at my watch eight fortyfive i met ike around eight ray started shooting about ten minutes after we started talking i dont know how long the shooting lasted but hes had at least twenty minutes to reach the target i offered up to him to save myself ikes body lies behind his cruiser where i dragged it in that last furious rush his eyes are open but unseeing i feel his carotid artery to be sure then hold my hand over his mouth nothing climbing into the maxima i start the engine and dial tuscany on the cell phone while it rings i floor the accelerator and make a wide squealing turn on the cement floor then roar through the main loading door the phone clicks as i hit canal street and nearly skid into the curb on the other side liv marston says a clipped voice if youre a reporter its perm what do you want the voice hasnt warmed even one degree i know you dont want to listen to me but youve got to is it about the trial no youve got to get out of the house what i hesitate before i reply some savage part of me wants to get livy away and leave her father to face the retribution of his past poetic justice if ever there was any but i cant do it ray presleys on his way to tuscany hes going to try to kill your father he could already be at your house or on the grounds somewhere silence did you hear me livy i heard you tell your father to call the police theyll send an army out there to protect him are we done now are we done did you understand what i just told you presley is coming there to kill your father i hope he comes here you what a police car tears around the corner of main and canal lights flashing heading in the direction of the pecanshelling plant in fifteen minutes every cop and deputy in this town will be combing the downtown streets youre playing in things you dont understand penn i tried to tell you the other day you were a fool to involve yourself in any of this i understand more than you think i know now why you did the things you did in the past the choices you made such as i dont want to discuss it on the phone it has to be face to face we dont have anything to say to each other im begging you livy meet me one last time for the sake of whatever it is thats bound us together all these years if you will i think it will change both our lives maybe forever this time she hesitates its not about the trial i dont give a damn what happens at the trial name a place anywhere i dont care ill even come to tuscany no jewish hill jewish hill yet another landmark from our past in the cemetery thats about as private as you can get isnt it locked at night park at the foot of the hill by the wall its not like weve never done it before do you still have the gun you had in the motel yes bring it and drive fast leaving the house what time im five minutes from the cemetery leave now all right livys borrowed fiat is parked at the foot of jewish hill when i arrive next to the low stone wall of the city cemetery she got here first because i took a wide circle through town to avoid the police i park behind the fiat and shove ikes pistol into my waistband then get out and walk up to the spyder livy is not in the car to my left across cemetery road stands the dark silhouette of weymouth hall an antebellum mansion that marks the twohundredfoot drop to the river its widows walk silhouetted against the stars to my right is the low wall and the nearly vertical slope of jewish hill one mile south along the bluff the police are taping off the pecan plant as a crime scene i climb the wall and push through the shrubbery then dig my hands into the face of the hill and begin climbing as i near the top a ghostly figure appears at the edge looking down at me its livy her hair is flying behind her caught in the wind blowing up the bluff from the river shes wearing a white blouse a fitted jacket and slacks tapered to the ankles she bends and catches my hands then pulls me up to the flat plateau of gravestones statuary and mausoleums did you call the police i ask she brushes a strand of hair from her eyes daddy called some offduty cops they got there before i left how did he react when you told him presley might be coming to kill him what do you want penn it scared him to death didnt it livy your father gave the cops what they needed to send presley to parchman when we were kids really a hard smile tightens her mouth good what i dont understand is why my call didnt scare you she walks past me to the edge of the hill the lights of vidalia louisiana a mile away outline her like another marble angel among the stones why are we here penn whats the big mystery you are she turns back to me im the mystery youre the mystery of my life but i understand you now something flickers in her eyes i cant tell if shes intrigued or afraid do you enlighten me then i know who jennys father is even in the dark i can tell she has gone rigid she turns away from me then back her chin held high how do you know did he tell you tell me god no he hates me why would he tell me she shakes her head i cant believe this i cant believe you know this its so pathetic i know its bad livy i realize i cant ever understand what it waswhat it isto be in your position how could you possibly know unless he told you no one knows he doesnt even know not as far as i your father doesnt know about jenny she blinks my father of course he knows but he doesnt know you know who the father is my mind reels trying to parse the semantics livy who is jennys father you just said you knew pretend i dont suspicion now if you dont know im not telling you livy who do you think it is i take a step toward her but she moves back nearer the edge of the hill as though she knows what i am about to say as though she could fly from the edge of the hill if i dare speak the truth i think jennys father is your father she stares at me like she hasnt heard correctly then she closes her eyes and lowers her head into her hands you dont have to say anything i say softly you shut up penn please just shut up you might say something even more asinine than you already have what she takes her hands away from her face she is not crying she is staring at me with what looks like morbid curiosity did you actually think my father raped me her voice is strong but that could be the strength of denial not truth i still think so what i cant figure out is how he forced you when you were eighteen a bitter laugh thats easy he didnt christ first you accuse my father of murder now incest could you possibly be more sick she holds her palms out to me have i done something to deserve this ill tell you what you did to deserve this you told me you wanted a future together and then disappeared you let your father try to destroy mine without lifting a finger to stop him and went on with your life as though none of it ever happened my god penn we were just kids havent you grown up yet after twenty years have you youve been chasing me around like the lost love of your life trying to relive our past pulling me into bed every chance you got was all that heat manufactured to distract me from going after your father at last she gives me an unguarded look no if my incest idea is so off the mark why did you treat that poor girl like you did you gave jenny up for adoption which is understandable but she had a pretty shitty life and when she showed up at your door looking for a little information maybe an explanation you treated her like dirt and your father did worse how dare you judge me you dont know anything about it youre right why is that her eyes flash in the dark you want an explanation all right remember the week after graduation the week you went touring battlefields with your dad i remember i had two weeks before radcliffe the senior parties were still going on everybody was getting as drunk as they had been before graduation maybe drunker someone from south natchez threw a party on one of the sandbars past the paper mill it was wild trucks driving all over the sand people shooting guns skinnydipping one car even went into the river you were out of town so guys were hitting on me all night ray presley was there watching me for daddy like he always did at some point the police showed up ray put me in his truck and talked to one of the cops got me past the roadblock she turns toward the river and the wind carries much of her voice away i was as drunk as id ever been and i decided to play a little game ray was always watching me making me nervous hanging around like some malevolent shadow and id always heard these stories how hed killed people been in prison other stuff anyway i started teasing him i asked if hed ever killed anybody and he admitted that he had i asked him what it was like what prison was like stuff like that then i told him id always heard this story about how he had the biggest thing in town you know his equipment he kept driving but i could see i was getting to him he was gripping the wheel so hard so i said hey is it true or what and he said only one way to find out it was like a dare you know so i said okay lets see it the knowledge of whats coming hits me like a blow to the solar plexus livy she holds up her hand she means to tell this story no matter what so he unbuckles his belt and takes it out while hes driving and it was i mean the stories were true i know this sounds grossray presley right what a creep but he was only thirtyfive or so then younger than we are now so i took the dare further i thought id drive him a little crazier to get back at him for all the times hed ogled me it was the stupidest thing i ever did he pulled off lower woodville road right into the woods i knew then things were slipping out of control but i wasnt sure how to get out of it i figured you know just be calm let him kiss me touch him enough to get it over with and get out of there the next thing i knew my dress was around my chest and he was raping me you dont have to tell me this she turns to me her eyes bright with pooled tears a little too real for you i think i passed out the first time i woke up later and it was happening again outside the truck i started screaming so he stuffed my dress into my mouth it was like being simultaneously strangled and bludgeoned to death from the inside when it was over we got back into the truck but he wouldnt leave he was completely freaked out i think he thought my father was going to kill him so he just sat there trying to figure out what to do he sat there for twenty minutes with me screaming at him trying to get out and run going crazy then he did it again i knew then that he was crazy i mean three times in an hour thats just not normal for a thirtyfiveyearold man the deja vu is almost too powerful to endure livy and i once sat in the dark while she told me the story of being raped by a high school football player during a date twenty years later only the context has changed im sorry i had no idea i couldnt even have imagined that but isnt it such a touching little story her tears are rolling down her cheeks now ray presley proud father of my first and only child i want to hold her but i think she would probably hit me if i touched her i couldnt believe i even conceived she says wiping her face but i did and you think i should have welcomed jenny with open arms she modulates her voice into a hysterical exaggeration of a tv mom hello sweetheart where have you been all my life give mama a hug the delirium in her voice sends chills through me jenny had nothing to do with what presley did to you that night she is that night to me dont you get that do you think i could ever look at her without reliving every second of those rapes i shrug and stay silent i am not a woman i cant know when i told you presley was coming to kill your father you said you hoped he would come id kill him in a minute she says in a flat voice like stepping on a cockroach i knew it was something like this something dark dark the whole thing is so sally jessy raphael it makes me want to vomit you didnt tell your father presley had raped you a shadow of shame crosses her face no id started the whole thing hadnt i i suppose i could have lied and said he attacked me out of the blue but my father is pretty hard to lie to hes scary that way he sees dishonesty in people maybe because hes so dishonest himself dont penn but he knew you were pregnant eventually i mean she nods my sister told him shed gotten pregnant three years before and daddy made her get an abortion it really messed her up our great catholic parents practically forcing her to terminate her pregnancy youd think that when i turned up pregnant she would have done all she could to help me hide it but shed felt inferior to me her whole life i was the special one the adored one she just had to tell them that id screwed up as badly as she had livy why in gods name did you have the baby under the circumstances under the circumstances i wasnt thinking rationally okay after the rape i was so upset i went to radcliffe a week early two months later when i found out for sure i was pregnant i thought about terminating it but then my sister blabbed and the next thing i knew my father was in cambridge trying to force me to have an abortion you know how he and i are the simple fact that he tried to force me was enough to make me refuse especially after all the lip service hed paid to catholic dogma but more than that the pregnancy gave me a chance id never had before an absolute excuse to break the pattern laid out for me before i was born i didnt know what i wanted but i knew i didnt want to spend four years at ole miss in a sorority full of girls majoring in fashion merchandising and looking for husbands thanks for telling me in time to change my plans a momentary look of penitence im sorry about that i never told you to go there no you just talked about how wonderful it would be if we were both there what i cant believe is that you let your parents think i had gotten you pregnant you did didnt you thats the root of all the pain that came after she takes a deep breath and sighs i suppose i did suppose nothing you didnt have the guts to admit you teased ray presley into raping you but you didnt mind letting me take the blame for knocking you up penn you dont understand when ray took me home that night he threatened me he said that if i told my father what had happened hed kill my mother your mother he knew i wouldnt care about myself ray said my father might kill him for hurting me but hed thank him for killing my mother and on some level i felt like he might be right daddy was such a bastard to mother back then a wave of shame rolls through me shame for thinking livy was so selfish and shallow that she would let my family pay for something that was someone elses fault without any excuse but the shame passes quickly livy is twisting the truth even now youre lying i dont mean about the threat im sure presley threatened you but youve always cared about yourself more than anything else and i dont think you would have bought rays threat not for long he was scared shitless of your father he still is in some ways and when leo decided to go after my father out of revenge you could have spoken up you could have said daddy it wasnt penn but you didnt you knew why he took that suit and you never said a damn word to change his mind it was too late by then i was at virginia and i flew up there to see you and you said nothing youre gutless livy i never knew that about you until now i suppose i am about the big things just like your father he wanted a man dead but he didnt have the balls to do it himself he was district attorney and he arranged to have an innocent man killed for profit that is such bullshit you think so youll find out different tomorrow your father and ray presley set up one of the most heinous murders ive ever come across and j edgar hoover covered it up to keep your grandfather happy to keep them pulling for nixon in the sixtyeight election what are you babbling about never mind her face has taken on a strange cast i met him once you know hoover when i was a little girl up in jackson with my father oh they were big buddies and the root of their friendship was the murder of del payton she shakes her head as if im hopelessly insane by sundown tomorrow your father will be indicted for murder unless he can kill my witnesses and hes trying hard believe me what are you talking about your father and john portman tried to kill me last night she shakes her head youre lying when have you known me to lie livy ever your father killed for money and power in and hell do it now to cover his ass thats all hes ever been about hes played every angle and skimmed every deal from factory locations to backroom adoptions everythings money to him livy has gone still what do you mean backroom adoptions come on that cant be news to you i saw a record of the private adoptions he handled over the years he did about twenty of them and yours was one jennys i mean for big money too big for those days anyway she reaches out and touches my arm tell me what youre talking about you really dont know remember those records you and leo took out of his office last week the ones he tried to burn yes there was a scrap of paper in there a record of income from adoptions he pocketed thirtyfive grand off of yours one of the highest prices paid for any baby on the list i guess he wanted top dollar since the baby came from his gene pool the blood has drained from her face look at it if you dont believe me ive been carrying the list around in my wallet since the day jenny told me her story i thought it was a record of our child being given away let me see it i pull out my wallet and fish the scrap of yellow paper from the bill compartment livy snatches it away and holds it up in the blue glow of the streetlight across the road trying to read in the dark her face is in shadow but after a few moments the paper starts to quiver in her hand that son of a bitch she murmurs that son of a bitch you still think im lying that he would profit from my pain like that i doubt he gave it a second thought making money was his habit everything that passed through his hands had to turn a profit you should know that better than anyone she looks up at last her eyes empty of everything but desire for the truth these are the eyes i knew in high school do you really believe my father ordered del paytons death its not a question of belief i know you can prove it if my witnesses reach the courtroom alive she folds the paper slowly im going to do something you may not believe im going to do it because i dont believe my father killed del payton i cant believe that but if it should turn out that he did i wont protect him what are you talking about the papers you requested under discovery business records all that yes you got sanitized versions theres another set of files one that nobody sees not the irs not anybody my heart jumps in my chest you realize that withholding those papers from the court is a felony im not telling you this to hear the boy scout oath repeated back to me before i tell you where those files are i want a promise from you what any evidence of illegal activity that doesnt directly pertain to the death of del payton youll forget you ever saw livy thats nonnegotiable all right agreed where are these files she bites her bottom lip still resisting the deeply bred urge to protect her familys secrets ever since i was a little girl daddy kept his sensitive papers in a big safe under the floor of his study he called it his potato bunk whatever that means if hes hiding anything from you its in there how can i get a look in there hes home tonight isnt he hes probably upstairs by now mothers been flipping in and out for the past few days hes probably up there feeding her darvocet and prozac cocktails what about the offduty cops he called they wont look twice at you if i drive you in she looks sincere but its anger thats driving her now her relationship with her father has always been one of extremes love and hate commingling in proportions that change too fast to be assayed to see the secret safe in leo marstons study ill have to go back to tuscany and at tuscany on this night leo could kill me and tell the police anything he wanted he could even have one of his cops kill me my only real protection would be the woman standing before me are you sure you want to do this i ask she folds the paper in half then twice again into a tiny rectangle which she slips between the buttons of her blouse and into her bra her eyes shine with utter resolution ive never been more sure of anything in my life chapter the grounds of tuscany are dark i parked my mothers shotup maxima at a gas station a quarter mile up the road from tuscanys gate then got into livys fiat for the ride to the estate as we approached the gate she took a remote control from her purse touched a button and the barred fence slid back into itself that was twenty seconds ago we should have seen the lights of the mansion well before now livy i know ive never seen it like this the floodlights are always on i told you he was scared of presley look she says pointing at a dim light high in the trees theyre on the third floor mothers room i close my hand around the butt of the gun in my waistband ikes gun a thin beam of light slices through the darkness and comes to rest on the windshield of livys car i start to pull the gun but then our headlights sweep across a black police uniform livy slows to a stop the cop walks around to her window and shines his light onto her chest sparing her the direct glare of the beam evening miss marston everything okay yes my friend and i are going in for a drink have you seen anything suspicious no maam not a thing why are all the lights off your daddy said he didnt want nobody taking potshots through the windows i see dont you worry billy and me are on the job i feel so much better knowing that she gives him a synthetic smile then rolls up her window and drives on tuscany materializes suddenly like a spectral palace in the moonlight ringed by towering oaks and dark magnolias livy pulls around to the back of the mansion and parks in a small garage theres a new entrance here she says to the pantry she unlocks the door then takes my hand and leads me quickly through the enormous house pantry kitchen breakfast room parlor living room the interior is shrouded in darkness but the sense of space of high ceilings and broad doorways communicates itself through the sound of our footsteps and the way the air moves livy stops me by putting her hand against my chest then opens a door peeks inside and pulls me through leos private study looks as though it had been surgically removed from an english manor house shipped to america and meticulously reconstructed inside tuscany the paneling alone must be worth a hundred thousand dollars livy sets her purse on the desk and points to a bokara rug on the floor before it there theres a club chair sitting on the rug as i start to move it she takes my arm and looks into my eyes remember your promise have you known your whole life that your father was a crook she gives me a look of disdain my father made a science of walking the line between whats legal and whats not so have a lot of other businessmen thats the way you get rich like those adoptions i say softly lets not forget why were here youre so damned selfrighteous you must have cut a few corners in a decade of practicing law i was a prosecutor livy i stayed on the right side of that line youre talking about you never conveniently misplaced a piece of exculpatory evidence to keep it from the defense never i suppose you never cheated on your wife either sorry why dont we look at those files she studies me a moment more then drops her hand and pulls the club chair off the bokara i roll up the rug and prop it against leos desk where the rug had lain discolored floorboards outline a trapdoor three feet square livy goes to the desk and brings back a small metal handle with a hook on one end kneeling she slips the hook into an aperture i cannot see and folds back the trapdoor exposing the steel door of a floor safe she bends over the combination lock thinks for a moment then spins it left right and left again he hasnt changed the combination in years she says getting to her feet i crouch to turn the heavy handle of the safe but the butt of ikes gun digs into my stomach after setting it on the desk beside livys purse i get down on my knees turn the handle and pull open the heavy door inside is a hoard of velvetcovered jewelry boxes stock certificates cash gold coins manila envelopes and computer disks nine square feet of paydirt how much time do we have i ask reaching for the manila envelopes maybe five minutes maybe all night maybe you should go upstairs and talk to your parents then i could be sure im staying here the envelopes are thick and marked with handwritten labels the handwriting is leos after wading through the mountain of discovery material i recognize it as easily as my own one label reads fedtax not to be shown at audit another thirdparty holdings land a third reads grand cayman trust account thats got nothing to do with del payton livy says over my shoulder maybe not but it could probably put leo marston in jail for a few years and cost him a considerable portion of his fortune reluctantly i set these envelopes aside and continue searching there are more offshore accounts records of hidden shares in oil fields a dozen other ventures i am about to abandon the files for the computer disks when a label jumps out at me as though written in neon it says only edgar inside this folder is a thick sheaf of personal letters all signed yours edgar the first begins dear leo in the matter of the nixon funds please be assured that i consider your work in this area to be exemplary and also a direct favor to me he has his idiosyncrasies yes but he is a sound man and we understand each other the possibility of a muskie or mcgovern in the white house cannot be contemplated for one moment the woodwind oomph of a wine bottle being uncorked draws my gaze away from the safe livy has taken a bottle of red from leos cherrywood bar and opened it with a silver corkscrew pretend its our lost bottle she says in a cynical voice she takes two waterford goblets from the bar and fills them to the rim then lifts one to her lips she drinks a long swallow and passes it to me her upper lip is stained red but she doesnt wipe it she simply watches me drink i cant read anything in her expression the wine is tart on my tongue acidic she takes back the glass drains it then sets it beside the bottle and lifts the second glass to her lips half the wine disappears in three swallows she is more upset than i thought i turn back to the safe and flip quickly through the hoover letters searching for any mention of del payton john portman or dwight stone most of the letters date from the seventies after the secret relationship was well established and deal with political matters is there a computer in here i ask glancing at the inch floppies theres a powerbook in the bottom drawer of the desk im reaching for the disks when livys wineglass shatters on the floor beside me someones coming as quickly as i can i slide the manila envelopes back into the safeall but the edgar fileand shut the steel door the rug she hisses while i unroll the rug livy shuts the trapdoor and jumps clear i slide the rug into place just as someone begins jerking at the doorknob whos in there says a muffled voice its leo livy thumps the envelope in my hands if you want that file youd better do something with it quick leo bangs on the door whos in there its me daddy im coming unbuckling my belt i shove the envelope down the back of my pants retuck my shirt over it then zip up and rebuckle the belt as i do this livy unbuttons the top three buttons of her blouse and musses her hair lets make it look real she says and pulls my face to hers her kiss is passionate desperate even fueled by anger and wine and god knows what else in the few seconds that it lasts it flushes my face and brings sweat to my skin my senses are still buzzing when she walks to the door and unlocks it what are you doing in here with the door locked leo asks im not alone he pushes his sixfootfourinch frame through the door and swings his head around to me his hard features go slack with amazement what the hells going on here penn and i were talking talking leo is still wearing a suit though he has untied his necktie button that blouse olivia livy does not button the blouse she steps away from her father leaving no obstacle between him and me i cant believe you brought this bastard into our house he says his eyes locked on mine i want an explanation make one up anything you like her defiant tone draws leos gaze away from me for a moment dont take that tone of voice with me young lady ill take whatever tone i please leo looks off balance livy is not playing the role of favorite daughter whats going on here he asks whats cage been telling you what could he tell me have you been keeping things from me of course not no she reaches into her blouse and brings out the scrap of legal paper which she unfolds and hands to him without a word leo stares at it for several seconds then looks up blankly whats this think about it she says her arms folded over her chest his face shows only confusion he looks like he might have had a couple of drinks since receiving the warning about presley why dont you save me the trouble the adoption livy says in a dead voice your adoption yes what about it you took money for it leo shrugs so thirtyfive thousand dollars that paid a full year of your tuition at uva her mouth falls open paid you sold my baby to pay my college tuition my baby leos face softens as he senses the hurt in his daughter honey you didnt want that child i tried to get you to terminate the pregnancy but you were against it given that adoption was your choice i dont see whats wrong with selling your own flesh and blood her eyes are blazing now like you needed the fucking money profanity doesnt become you olivia profanity try obscenity selling my misery for money thats about as obscene as it gets i was just another profitloss entry i guess offset the liability of college tuition with the asset of unwanted babies what the hell right leo reaches out to her honey dont even try to justify it she says coldly backing away his look of sympathy evaporates i dont have to justify anything you made a mess i cleaned it up it was the only big one you ever made but it damn sure ruined most of what came after he swings back to me thanks to this punk leave me out of this i tell him youve had the wrong idea about me for twenty years how so livy looks at me and shakes her head ask her livy i dont know what hes talking about leos eyes roam over the study taking in the wine bottle on the bar his bookshelves and finally the desk where his gaze settles on the sigsauer lying beside livys purse he is nearer the gun than i and he knows im thinking that it was you who said ray presley was coming here to kill me wasnt it cage thats right i was doing you a favor i think you were lying he stabs a finger in my direction i think you broke in here looking for some kind of evidence and i think id be within my rights to blow your goddamn head off he picks up the sigsauer cycles the slide and walks around the desk presley killed ike ransom tonight i say quickly he tried to kill me but i got clear by sending him after you i told him you gave him up to the fbi as part of your deal with hoover something twitches in leos cheek youre still lying youre using my daughter to try and get at me he turns to livy the trials tomorrow and hes desperate hes using you a dark light shines in livys eyes the way you used me against him leo isnt much of an actor his feigned surprise is almost comical once i got here she says i realized why youd asked me to come what you wanted me to do the sad thing is i wanted to do it i thought penn could wipe away all the mistakes id made i thought his wifes death was fate that we were being given a second chance thats only natural leo says in a soothing voice but he took advantage of you honey what did he ask you to do for him nothing he loves me he always has her smile is full of irony and selfdisgust and he has more integrity than both of us put together leo snorts spare me the wine and roses did you have to bring him here couldnt you have checked into a motel the way you always did olivia dont say anything just go back to your room go upstairs and take care of mother better late than never instead of walking to the door leo gives me the superior stare ive received in the private chambers of a dozen judges the trials tomorrow he says in a peremptory voice im going to give you one last opportunity to save face and to help this town call your little tart at the newspaper and get her to print a public apology for the remarks you made about me a full apology from you and a retraction from the paper if thats printed tomorrow ill dismiss the suit his offer leaves me dumbfounded there can be only one reason for it hes running scared i dont see your lips moving leo says youd better jump while you can the offers good for sixty seconds dwight stone is alive i think aloud and neither you nor portman can find him his face remains impassive fifty seconds a wicked elation flows through me you can stick that offer right up your ass tomorrow all of us turn at the sound of the door ray presley is standing in the study aiming a revolver at leos chest it looks like a magnum hes abandoned his pajamas in favor of levis redwing boots and a black western shirt only the john deere cap remains the same the vulpine eyes burn from beneath its bill just as they did the day i bought my fathers back from him evening judge he says presley looks like hes lost ten pounds since i saw him last hes still ropy and tough but he seems diminished somehow imagining him raping livy is almost beyond me he looks so much older than she now yet livy has backed against the wall opposite me like a frightened girl like shes trying to become her own shadow im not armed ray leo says from behind his desk but i see that hes holding ikes sigsauer behind him throw that sig on the floor judge presley says like a chiding parent i saw it in your hand when i came in marston knows better than to try to raise the gun and fire before ray can pull his trigger he tosses ikes gun onto the floor at presleys feet i saw the boys outside too presley says his voice almost friendly you knew i was coming didnt you ray anybody makes a move its their last presley says glancing at me i hit what i aim at like ike ransom i say he smiles that nigger talk any before he died enough you lookin to get killed too college boy fuck you ray the smile disappears i came here to kill one but i can kill three just as easy and damn near as quick he motions toward livy and me you two come here stay right in front of me backs to me i move slowly gauging my chances of getting to livys purseand gun before ray shoots me less than zero at this point but if i can get closer livy and i stand shoulder to shoulder facing leo across the desk with presley behind us presleys hand pats its way up my legs around my waist up my torso dont you touch me livy says in a voice that could freeze alcohol but he must have touched her because she suddenly spins into his gun and slaps him hard enough to rock him back on his heels livy shouts leo dont be stupid presleys harsh laugh fills the room as livy backs away from him panting with outrage if she grabs for her purse ill have to stop her presley might endure a slap with a laugh but hell recognize a lunge for a gun ray leo says in a careful voice this boys got nothing on us he cant connect us to del a snort from presley he cant connect you but hes got me nailed down tight as a tick dont make no never mind though this visits got nothing to do with that dead nigger this is about you and me judge leo affects puzzlement i dont understand raymond presley jerks up his gun at this use of his christian name what must once have been a gesture of friendship yes you do you gave me up to the feds while you kept raking in the money you made me your goddamn scapegoat marstons eyes flick toward me not in anger but with purpose in them hes prodding me to think leo is first and foremost a survivor and he intends to live through this if that means a shortterm alliance with me to neutralize the most immediate threat he wont hesitate nobody in this room but me knows what five years of prison means presley says five years ill never get back and i need them years now you got to pay for em judge he fingers the trigger of his gun raises his aim to leos head and there aint but one way to do it marston remains calm ray you shot at those fbi boys on your own hook hoover demanded a price and you were it cost of doing business son you understand that you were sentenced to seven years and i got you out in five it cost me to do that you want to kill me for it presleys chin quivers with rage and the gun trembles in his hand it cost you you could pass out half a million bucks and you wouldnt feel it youd make it back in a couple of months but time you dont never get that back make your peace with the lord judge and be quick ray i shout trying to hold his attention if you shoot him youll spend every hour you have left behind bars presley laughs if i stick around to get arrested which i aint tomorrow night ill be in mexico and nobody in this world can stop me getting there i know ways in and out that the wets aint even thought of i can see why youd want to shoot him i go on id like to shoot him myself but the way i figure it you two are already square he gives me an uncertain look what do you mean i mean i just found out what you did to him in seventyeight what you talking about i nod at livy well to her i mean thats the same as to him isnt it it damn sure gives him the right to shoot you if anything gives a man that right shut up livy hisses presley starts to turn the gun on me but he steadies himself and holds it on marston whats that cage leo asks what are you talking about tell him ray keep tapping on the pressure point presley takes a step closer to marston but he doesnt fire i think he wants marston to know the truth before he dies do you know a girl named jenny doe i ask leo please livy begs ive met her leo says do you know who her father is his eyes flash with anger you are you pissant sorry judge i never knew that girl existed and i am most definitely not her father then who is the man holding the gun on you leo blinks three times quickly livy has gone white but presleys face is a strange mix of wonder and defiance he obviously knew nothing about jenny doe until this moment you and me got a kid he says his eyes on livy olivia leo says quietly tell him livy i urge her he raped me she says simply when i was eighteen ray raped me three times one night and got me pregnant thats a goddamn lie presley bellows she give it to me judge teasing me with it all the time passing around like a bitch in heat grabbing my privates she told me she wanted it that night livy leo says again the mere fact that hes asking tells me leo believes presleys story could be true livy knows this too her lips are pressed tightly together her nostrils flared she stares into the middle distance for a few moments alone with her demons then she looks at her father with absolute sincerity he raped me daddy i should have told you when it happened but i was too afraid he told me he would kill mother if i did all these years i let you think penn was the father he wasnt it was him leos face goes through a dozen different emotions only a small number of them readable but the one that finally settles in his features is rage pure unalloyed rage this is the natural reaction of any father but there is more here ray presley served leo for more than thirty years performing deeds too dirty for his master to soil his hands with but whatever bond this forged between them presley was always a servant a hired man the realization that he transgressed this class boundarytrespassed into the very flesh of the marston family lineprobably offends leo more than the act of rape itself his jaw muscles are working with enough force to grind his teeth to nubs if he keeps it up and his bluegray eyes burn with a fearsome light you whitetrash bastard he says each word dripping with contempt you touched my little girl ill snap your neck like a stick presley shakes his gun in front of him like a man waving a crucifix before a vampire youre the one goddamn it ratting me out after all i did for you so i fucked your slut daughter you think i was the first she handed it out like candy in school and god knows what she did after she left this town like father like daughter i guess to my surprise leo does not explode at this but instead seems to calm down he drops his hands to his desk drawer how much will it take to buy you off ray to make you go to mexico and never come back more than you got judge ive got a lot thats the lords truth but you aint got enough to buy your life not this time leo reaches into the drawer and feels around inside his mouth goes slack presley smiles darkly and takes a step forward what you lookin for judge you lose something leo freezes his hand still in the drawer his face has lost all color its the face of an animal a predator backed into a corner by a larger one presley reaches into his pocket with his left hand and removes the derringer leo pulled on me the day kelly backed him down youre too predictable judge he points the derringer at livy whos standing to his left and straightens the arm pointing the at leos head he means to shoot i have only one weapon to hand the halfempty wine bottle on the bar behind me presleys attention is divided between what he perceives as the most immediate threats he probably figures i wont even mind him shooting leo visualizing the bottle as i saw it last i reach back with my right hand relaxing my fingers so that i wont knock it off the bar by mistake my fingertips touch cool glass i close my hand around the neck of the bottle now its a matter of peripheral vision if presley would glance at livy again i could swing without him seeing the bottle until its too late focusing on livy i concentrate the full power of my will on communicating to her what i need her eyes search mine trying to read my thoughts as she stares i incline my head very slightly toward ray presley cocks the hammer of his and leo at last gives in to terror ray im begging you please dont do it presley wrinkles his lips in disgust livy says our daughter looks just like you ray presleys profile vanishes as he looks toward her and in a single fluid motion i swing the bottle in a sweeping arc that terminates at the base of his skull the impact of the heavy glass club slams him forward and he falls over the front of the desk somehow he still has both pistols in his hands i leap forward and hammer at his head with both fists thinking of livy lying under him with her dress stuffed down her throat as i flail away i see leos huge hands take hold of presleys ivscarred wrists and pin them to the desktop like brittle sticks presley pulls the trigger of the derringer leo flinches as though stung by a hornet but he looks less hurt than pissed off he rakes a huge right hand down presleys left wrist stripping the derringer from the smaller hand and tossing it on the floor with his other hand he yanks the out of presleys right which is still pinned to the desk presley tries to raise himself off the desk but all my weight is on him leo presses the to presleys forehead let him go cage i smack presley once more for good measure then heave myself off him despite the blows to his head he straightens up like a punchdrunk boxer who can remember only one thing stay on your feet leo pulls open his jacket long enough to reveal a bloodstain on the right side of his shirt but he doesnt examine the wound any more closely than that this creates a problem he says the anger gone from his voice already he is computing the calculus of how rays actions will affect tomorrows trial cage you and i should try to he stops at the sound of livys voice im not sure but i think she said ray in the intimate voice of a lover she must have because presley turns from the desk to the sound of her voice his eyes glassy but still curious i wanted you to see this she tells him then she brings up ikes sigsauer and shoots him in the chest ray sits down on leos desk as though he has decided to have a think there then his eyes bulge as he looks down at the red river flowing from his upper chest with a depressingly regular rhythm livy stands with the automatic held stiffly before her smoke drifting from its barrel exactly the way it looks in old westerns she doesnt look the slightest bit upset she seems in fact to be contemplating a second shot before she can fire again i jump in front of her and grab her wrist she doesnt resist as i pull the gun from her hand lock the door cage leo orders from behind his desk hurry i obey without hesitation though im not sure why the guards will be here any second he says shot ray do you understand he broke in tried to kill me and i shot him leos eyes are full of paternal concern will you back me up are you kidding you cant lie about something like this not these days his eyes glow with hypnotic intensity listen to me cage we can tear each other to pieces at trial tomorrow but if youve ever cared for my daughter help me protect her now you cant pull it off not nowadays there are nitrate tests a hundred things i look at ray who despite horrific blood loss is still sitting on the desk besides hes still alive leo walks around his desk and takes the sigsauer from my hand before i can ask what he means to do he backs three feet away from ray aims at his head and blows his brains out presley flips backward over the desk and lands with his head in the corner now hes dead leo says giving me a look so matteroffact that it makes a psycho like arthur lee hanratty look like a cub scout so much for your nitrate tests the study door shudders under a sudden barrage of rapping judge marston shouts a male voice judge are you all right cage leo asks calmly the sigsauer still in his hand are we agreed i look at livy who seems to be undergoing some sort of delayed shock reaction then at ray presley the man who engineered the murder of del payton and the living death of ike ransom who killed ike in the end and probably killed ruby flowers who raped the girl i loved at eighteen dooming us to lose each other forever agreed i say softly the offduty cops are still rapping and yelling at the door leo crosses the study opens it and waves the officers in two uniforms step into the room guns drawn youre a little late boys leo says pointing at the body behind the desk he got past you the cops gape at the corpse on the floor without his john deere cap presley looks like a hundredyearold man with three eyes goddamn says one of the cops in an awed voice aint that ray presley ill be damned if it aint says his partner you were right judge its a good thing i was ready for him leo says he got off a shot hit me in the gristle but i nailed him youd better call the chief billy so we can get this mess straightened out ive got to be in court tomorrow the cop called billy starts around the desk to examine ray more closely but leo says why dont you use the hall phone billy stops sure thing judge when youre done talking to the chief yall come back and drag this piece of trash out of here for me billy bites his lip well its a crime scene judge we cant move anything you know that its more of a crime to have this bastard bleeding all over my bokara rug um says billys partner the one who stopped livy and me outside is your daughter okay shes fine says leo though livy is standing like a statue near the door a little squeamish all the blood you know an absurd laugh escapes my lips livy is about as squeamish as a fur trapper after billy and his partner leave the study leo walks back behind his desk and sits in his chair penn he says using my christian name for the first time in two decades i was wrong to blame you all those years for what happened to livy i see that now thats why you went after my father i ask making sure because of me he nods i was wrong to do that too its a hard thing to accept after all this time i guess livy bears the ultimate responsibility he gives me a fatherly look you call your girl at the newspaper and tell her to run that apology well end this thing like gentlemen and save the town a hell of a lot of misery i might do that i say quietly if you were a gentleman his eyes narrow but since youre an amoral hypocritical heartless bastard i wont tomorrow youre going to be indicted for capital murder in the death of del payton i turn away from him and walk toward the door goodbye i say touching livys hand dont think twice about presley you did the world a favor ill tell it just the way your dad wants it i squeeze her hand then pause and kiss her lightly on the cheek she says nothing at first but as i move away she says penn i cant let you take that file what leo says his voice instantly alive with suspicion what file i showed him your safe i was angry penn please give me the envelope i cant help you destroy my father not like that not after all thats happened i reach for the doorknob wondering how far shell go to stop me she wont shoot you cage but i will i dont know if hed shoot me in the back or not but i have a daughter waiting for me at home and i will not bet our future on the honor of leonidas marston turning to face him i untuck my shirt slip the hoover file out of my pants and toss it toward him theres a flutter of papers as the letters scatter across the desk and floor i start to leave but then i bend down and lift the fallen wine bottle from the bokara it survived the impact with presleys skull though most of the wine has spilled out glancing back at livy i invert the bottle and pour the remaining wine onto the desk splashing the red fluid across hoovers personal missives to leo pretend its our lost bottle i tell her you two were made for each other i reach for the brass knob open the door and walk out into the hall the last thing i hear is leos voice floating after me see you in court chapter an hour before jury selection in the slander trial of penn cage the police blocked motorvehicle access to the streets surrounding the natchez courthouse the television vans had already been let through at least eight despite the fact that only crews from cnn and the blackowned jackson station would be allowed inside the courtroom judge franklins decision to allow cameras in her court was a landmark in mississippi jurisprudence and she had carefully defended it in her pretrial order besides stating that marston v cage was a civil case and that both parties to the suit had agreed to have the proceedings televised franklin observed that community interest in the payton murderwhich was the central issue of the trialwas at such a pitch that the window into the court provided by the news camera could go a long way toward fostering the perception of fair and impartial justice the police roadblocks did nothing to limit the crowds outside the courthouse caitlins newspaper account of the deaths of ike ransom and ray presley had electrified the city black families laid out blankets beneath the oak trees on the north lawn and endured without complaint the desultory showers that had fallen since dawn the whites stood mostly on the south lawn huddled under umbrellas with calvinist stoicism the division was not solely racial there was intermingling at the edges of each crowd but for the most part a natural segregation had occurred police officers milled through the throngs watching for verbal altercations that could all too easily spark violence under the circumstances none of this concerned me as i entered the courthouse flanked by two sheriffs deputies all i could think about was dwight stone except for the strange call caitlin had received yesterday saying that stones dead fbi partner would be at the trial id heard nothing this morning caitlin picked up a story off the ap wire saying that four unidentified men had been found dead in the mountains near crested butte colorado this buttressed my hope that stone had at least survived our encounter by the river but many hours had passed since then i tried calling his daughter several times but had no luck dwight stone seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth in a city with over six hundred antebellum buildings more than sixty of which are mansions one might expect the courtrooms to be marvels of architectural splendor spacious and highceilinged paneled with oak and smelling faintly of lemon oil in fact while the original natchez courthouse was built in and has been expanded several times since its secondfloor courtrooms are small compared to those in houston and surprisingly functional in character the circuit court has seven rows of benches for spectators with another six in an upstairs balcony at the rear several of which have been coopted today by the cameras of cnn and wlbt viewed from the rear door the jury box stands against the right wall with the door to the jury room in the far right corner the witness box stands to the right of the judges bench and awkwardly a little behind it attached to the rear wall the judges bench is set on a dais at the center with desks for the court reporter and circuit clerk extending forward into the room at right angles to the bench the reporter sits on the right the clerk and his deputy on the left beyond the clerks desk on the left is a large open space for the presentation of exhibits the lawyers tables stand just beyond the bar not far separated from the clerks and reporters desks with the podium beside the table on the right the only touches of southern atmosphere are the white capitals of the doric columns visible through the windows behind the judges bench and the intertwining oak branches beyond them which give an unexpected airiness to the otherwise close room and then there is the clock on the wall symbolically enough it has no hands and i am reminded of carson mccullerss dark and poignant novel she would feel right at home in the midst of the strange and tragic case that has brought us here today walking up the aisle toward my table to begin the voir dire phase of the trial i receive one of the greatest shocks of my life seated at the plaintiffs table alongside leo marston and blake sims is livy marston sutter she doesnt look up at me but any fleeting hope that she might be here for moral support is quickly banished by her appearance from her pulledback hair to her tailored navy suit and prada shoes she is every inch a lawyer every movement precise every glance measured livy radiates a selfassurance that draws the eyes of everyone in sight of her producing in both men and women a desire for her attention and approval blake sims looks dowdy beside her he wears the traditional uniform of the ole miss lawyer blue blazer white pinpoint buttondown striped tie dress khakis and cordovan wing tips his face is pink and fleshy the face of a student council president with sandy blond hair and blue eyes the more i think about sims the more obvious it becomes why leo wants livy here leo himself sits facing the bench with imperious detachment he is a head taller than blake sims and his closecropped silver hair and chiseled features give him the look of a wise but austere judge which he was four decades spent roaming the corridors of power have served him well his tailored english suit was made for the television cameras and no one looking at him this morning would suspect that he executed a man last night moving toward my table i scan the faces of the spectators who have managed to get into the packed courtroom this morning i arranged with the bailiff that my parents be allowed in with sam jacobs escorting them and also althea and georgia payton with del jr all are seated in the second row on the right behind my table the first row was roped off for city officials who have turned out in force mayor warren and district attorney mackey shoot me glares whenever i look their way beyond them are many faces from my youth and peppered among these the characters who have populated my life for the past two weeks expolice chief willie pinder reverend nightingale some of the neighbors who helped search for annie on the day of the fire charles evers what sobers me is my awareness of those who arent here ruby ike ray presley dwight stone i shake hands with my father over the bar then take my seat as i begin reviewing the notes i made last night about questioning potential jurors someone touches my shoulder its caitlin masters for the first time since the cocktail party she has abandoned her informal uniform of jeans and buttondowns for a dress a blue sleeveless one that emphasizes her lithe body the effect is so profound that i simply stare at her i do own dresses she says obviously pleased by my reaction you look very nice any word from stone she bites her lip and shakes her head then pats her pocket he has the number of the paper theyll call me the second he or his daughter calls in if he calls is portman here theyve got him in a room upstairs with five fbi agents she reaches out and touches my forearm hold on to your hat theyve got the governor up there too the governor of what mississippi hes here as a character witness for marston i feel my face flushing hes not on the witness list she gives me a get real look do you think judge franklin is going to tell the governor to go back to jackson without letting him take the stand damn i fight the urge to tear out a handful of my hair take it easy african americans hate the governor did you get any sleep sleep last night after the police and the sheriffs department took turns grilling me for hours over the shootings at the pecan plant and at tuscany i met with betty lou beckham and her husband mr beckham is totally against his wife testifying but she promised my father she would and she means to go through with it considering the embarrassment she will suffer when the circumstances that allowed her to witness the crime come to light she is doing a brave thing indeed after meeting the beckhams i went to the eola hotel and woodshedded with huey moak and lester hinson whom kelly had delivered safely from baton rouge when we finished i spent the few hours before dawn trying to build a convincing case against marston that did not rely on the testimony of dwight stone i failed hang on as long as you can caitlin says squeezing my hand if stone is alive hell be here do you think portman would be here if he thought there was any chance stone would show with tv cameras dont secondguess yourself youve got a murder to prove and thats what youre good at pick your jury and forget the rest she gives my hand a final squeeze and walks back to the benches judge franklin enters the court wearing a black robe with a white lace collar looking very different than she did the night she confiscated leos files from tuscany shes obviously had her hair done and her makeup looks televisionready she takes her seat on the bench and the bailiff calls the court to order blake sims rises and informs the judge that livy marston sutter has been retained as cocounsel and with the courts permission will occupy the second chair at the plaintiffs table during the trial judge franklin makes a show of asking if i have any objection but she clearly expects me to go along i could point out that livy is not licensed in mississippi but with her considerable trial experience and sims acting as lead counsel i dont really have a leg to stand on livy meets my eyes only once during the entire voir dire process which turns out to be a surprise in itself i had always assumed i would enjoy the advantage of a largely black jury white professionals tend to use their jobs and influence to avoid jury duty but this morning that tradition goes out the window not one white in the first group taken from the venire or pool of potential jurors tries to evade his civic responsibility the usual excuses about job and health problems are not voiced nor are distant blood relations to trial principals invoked every juror in the pool wants a frontrow seat blake sims handles voir dire for marston pacing before the jury box in a rather annoying fashion while he questions the potential jurors about their backgrounds and what theyve read in the newspapers most admit that theyve read about the case how could they have avoided it but claim they have formed no opinion as to the guilt or innocence of either party most of them are lying of course thats the way these things go you cant keep human nature out of a human process as the voir dire progresses i notice that sims is avoiding direct questions about racial views at first i thought this was circumspection with cameras in the courtroom he would want to avoid any hint of racial bias but as he exercises his peremptory challenges his strategy becomes clear he has seen that he has a shot at a predominantly white jury and he means to get it even if it means breaking the law after sims rejects the fourth black juror i stand and make my first objection of the day citing batson v kentucky and the line of subsequent cases extending the prohibition against excluding potential jurors on the basis of race to civil cases judge franklin immediately sustains my objection and livy finally turns in my direction her eyes hold nothing for me they are merely the eyes of opposing counsel acknowledging my small victory in a war that will see many more skirmishes before the issue is decided after this point the voir dire passes more quickly than any in my career i judiciously exercise my peremptories culling on the basis of instinct when my mental radar picks up echoes of bluecollar or rural backgrounds combined with religious fundamentalism i pull the trigger i challenge some whites for cause after tripping them up on questions about prejudice but most racists quickly figure out how to conceal their true beliefs nearly every potential juror admits knowing leo marston to some degree so many that i cannot realistically disqualify them on this basis by elevenfortyfive am we have empaneled twelve jurors seven white five black and two alternates judge franklin recesses for lunch and instructs the lawyers to be ready for opening statements at one i eat a quick lunch with caitlin in an empty conference room near the chancery court gobbling deli sandwiches from clara nells between calls to the newspaper to see whether theyve heard anything from stone or his daughter they havent then i hurry downstairs through a crowd of courthouse employees and rubbernecking lawyers to give my witnesses one last pep talk paying particular attention to betty lou beckham who looks as though she might come apart at any moment admitting on the stand that she was fornicating in a car with a married man must be akin to donning a scarlet letter in the village square if it wasnt for my fathers influence betty lou wouldnt be coming near this courthouse today after holding her hand for a few minutes i return to the crowded courtroom sit at my table and wait for one oclock to tick around on the clock without hands judge franklin brings her court to order with a stern look and blake sims rises from the plaintiffs table and walks to the podium to make his opening statement sims is the son of leo marstons former law partner now deceased and was raised in greenville because of a divorce he speaks with a cultured delta accent rarely heard in natchez and though greenvillethe home of hodding carters delta democrattimeswas perhaps mississippis most liberal city during the civil rights era simss accent might evoke some negative responses in the black jurors ladies and gentlemen of the jury he begins my client needs no introduction but allow me to say a few words about him leo marston is one of the most distinguished figures in mississippi jurisprudence he is a former attorney general of mississippi and former justice of the state supreme court he is a friend and adviser to mississippi congressmen and has been for more than thirty years hes a powerful business force for the city of natchez bringing industry and jobs to adams county he is also a pillar of the catholic church and a major supporter of charities in our area sims leaves the podium and walks halfway to the jury box testing judge franklins formality she makes no objection to his move with that in mind he goes on i want to ask you a question what is a mans name worth the defendant in this case mr penn cage has signed an agreement stipulating to certain facts first that he uttered the vile charges in question second that he uttered them in the full knowledge that they would be published in a newspaper and third that my clients reputation has been severely damaged by his charges that being the case i wont waste your valuable time trying to prove damages mr cage has publicly called my client a murderer what more malicious charge could anyone make against another human being child molestation perhaps sims slowly bobs his head as though weighing this issue my client does not contest the fact that a tragic murder took place in may of mr cage may even have evidence against the man who committed that crime but what he does not havewhat he cannot possibly haveis evidence that leo marston had anything whatever to do with that crime leo marston was in fact the district attorney at that time the chief law enforcement officer of the county mr cage may present some sort of circumstantial evidence which he may try to weave into a web of deception to fool you good people but my client and i know that you will not be fooled del payton was a civil rights worker murdered to stop him from doing his noble work and leo marston is demonstrably one of the most racially progressive leaders in this town and has been since he was a young man sims lists various procivil rights statements leo made during the sixties his friendships with black leaders donations to black causes he cites testimonial letters he will enter into evidence attesting to marstons contributions to mississippis economy letters from john stennis and jim eastland both deceased trent lott mike espy and five former governors what we have here sims concludesgiving me a theatrical look of disdainis an irresponsible and sensational attack carried out by a man who has had a personal vendetta against my client for more than twenty years before this trial is over you will understand why and i want you people to know something else the money involved in this case is of secondary importance to my client what he wants and what he deserves is the vindication of his good name sims fold his hands with the apparent probity of a deacon but if you good people should see fit to teach mr cage a moral lesson about the price of such irresponsible action so be it we leave that to you thank you sims is unable to conceal his selfsatisfaction as he takes his seat but if he was hoping for congratulations from his client or cocounsel he is disappointed leo stares sullenly ahead like a truck driver in the eleventh hour of a drive while livy sits with the cool composure of a pinch hitter waiting to be called to the plate in the restless silence of the crowd i rise from my table and walk slowly toward the jury box their faces are expectant as they always are at the beginning of a trial before boredom has set in before resentment against vain attorneys who love to hear themselves talk has settled in their veins i lay my hands on the rail and speak directly to them ladies and gentlemen my name is penn cage i am a writer before i wrote books i was a prosecuting attorney i spent every day of my life putting violent criminals behind bars i put more than a few on death row i was born and raised right here in natchez but like a lot of our young people i had to move away to earn my living several jurors nod their heads probably those with adult children i earned that living as a prosecutor in houston texas now if you were to go to texas and ask about penn cage you might find some people willing to speak ill of him if you went to the penitentiary at huntsville youd find a lot of them general laughter from the gallery what you would not find is a single person who would describe me with the word mr sims just used irresponsible because when you are prosecuting murderers and asking for the death penalty irresponsibility is not a weakness you can afford its not a trait that my former boss the district attorney of harris county would tolerate for one minute folks you are looking at a man who says what he means and means what he says from the rapt faces of the jury i can see that i havent lost the old touch its a good feeling like climbing onto a horse after ten years away and feeling him respond without a moments hesitation its a pity that i have no case when i called leo marston a murderer i say evenly i meant it together with a brutal and crooked cop named ray presley leo marston engineered the death of a young father army veteran and civil rights worker named delano payton and contrary to what mr sims suggestedand what the citizens of our town have believed for thirty yearsthat murder had nothing to do with civil rights no leo marston had del payton killed for profit i glance back at livy but she refuses to look at me the same reason he does everything else and despite what mr sims told you money is never of secondary importance to leo marston mr sims also mentioned the term circumstantial evidence in a rather derogatory tone after all the television lawyers weve seen a misconception has grown up that circumstantial evidence is somehow inherently weak but that is simply not true circumstantial evidence is merely indirect evidence lets say a woman is shot to death at midnight with a thirtyeight caliber pistol when the police arrive they learn from one neighbor that the woman and her husband were in the middle of a messy divorce and from another that the husband sped away from the house at five past midnight the next day the police discover that the husband has a thirtyeight revolver registered in his name everything i just told you is circumstantial evidence but i think a pretty clear picture of what happened is emerging in your minds im not saying its conclusive evidence im saying this is evidence that cannot be ignored more nods from the jury especially from the women mr sims asked what a mans name is worth ill tell you i turn and point at leo the man who acted with such shocking dispatch last night his bluegray eyes burn with the subzero cold of liquid nitrogen after this trial that mans name wont be worth the price of a cup of coffee he ordered one of the most terrible crimes in the history of this city and by so doing stained the name of natchez mississippi for thirty years and with the help of j edgar hoover he sabotaged the investigation that followed that crime the coldblooded details of this premeditated murder will sicken you just as they did me but you must hear them for the time has come to remove the bloody stain from the name of our fair city thank you the jury seems a bit flabbergasted by the passion of my indictment but its been my experience that juries like passionto a point and in my present situation passion is better than nothing when blake sims rises to present his case he does just as he promised he ignores the question of damage to leos reputation he accomplishes this by a neat reversal calling three character witnesses whose combined testimony is designed to canonize his client making the image of leo marston as a coldblooded murderer one that jurors will feel guilty for even entertaining the first is governor nunn harkness a republican with a twofisted shootfromthehip style that has won him two terms despite his methodical gutting of social programs playing to the balcony tv cameras harkness praises leo to the skies lauding his success in bringing industry and gaming to mississippi and lamenting that while marston is a bit too liberal on issues like affirmative action he is morally beyond reproach its a pitchperfect performance by a master and the jury is visibly impressed when sims tenders the governor to me for crossexamination i dont ask a single question best to get nunn harkness offstage as soon as possible simss second character witness is thomas omalley bishop of the catholic diocese of jackson once the priest of st mary cathedral in natchez omalley has moved up the hierarchy for fifteen minutes he waxes poetic about the multitudes of poor children whose christmases leo marston brightened with toys then he moves on to the church itself to hear omalley tell it leo singlehandedly restored the cathedral to its present splendor donating over half a million dollars to the restoration effort as the bishop speaks i am reminded of michael corleone being honored by the pope in the godfather iii i shudder to think what sins omalley must have heard leo confess during his years as a priest in natchez but none of that will ever pass the bishops lips when sims tenders omalley to me i let him go without a word unless youre dealing with questions of sexual molestation or mismanagement of funds a catholic bishop is bulletproof simss third witness is another matter as bishop omalley leaves the courtroom pausing in the aisle to shake the hands of a half dozen former parishioners sims calls fbi director john portman portman enters the courtroom with two bodyguards who take up posts at the door as their master walks up the aisle lean tanned perfectly coiffed and attired in a dark blue suit the fbi director is clearly accustomed to television he ascends to the witness box with the air of a medical expert about to hold forth on matters beyond the understanding of a lay audience this time it is not blake sims but livy who rises from the plaintiffs table and approaches the box judge franklin gives sims a questioning look but sims says nothing you will be handling this witness ms sutter asks franklin using livys legal surname with the courts permission your honor franklin turns to me any objection counselor no your honor livy walks past the podium and up to the witness box though portman is much older than she both emanate a sense of confidence and ease to which lesser mortals should not begin to aspire mr portman what is your current position she asks im the director of the federal bureau of investigation the fbi do you know the plaintiff in this case i do ive known leo marston for thirty years how did you meet portman purses his lips like hes thinking back leo was the district attorney in natchez in i was serving here as an fbi field agent at that time investigating the death of delano payton mr marston gave the bureau valuable assistance during that investigation my heart lurches why do you think he did that livy asks portman opens his hands palms upward as though the answer were obvious leo marston believed in the necessity of civil rights legislation at no small risk to himself he worked to help us enforce that the man was a hero livy nods thoughtfully how did you first become aware of the charges made by penn cage against leo marston leo contacted me in washington by telephone on the day the charges were printed in the local newspaper we spoke at length at that time and several times subsequent so much for the phone records livys strategy is all too clear she plans to undercut what little documentary evidence i have before i can present it what was the substance of those conversations she asks judge marston expressed anxiety that this sensitive case was being dragged through the media and that his reputation was being damaged you called the payton case a sensitive case why is that portman adopts a pose of paternal concern im afraid i can only speak indirectly to this issue as ive stated to the press our file on delano payton is sealed on the grounds of national security interest it has been for thirty years earlier this week the senate intelligence committee voted to maintain the sanctity of that file please tell us anything you can about the case portman nods agreeably the payton case involved a veteran of the us army a man who served in vietnam j edgar hoover the fbi director at that time felt that the details involving this man if released during the vietnam conflict might damage national morale particularly the morale of line troops in vietnam where racial problems had become an issue he has to be talking about ike ransom but the vietnam war has been over for more than twenty years livy points out why is the file still sealed as i said i cant speak as fully to this issue as i would like im sorry mr cage has seen fit to exploit this case in his bid for publicity or revenge or whatever it is livy pretends to be intrigued by this aside have you had experience with mr cage in the past i had some dealings with him when he was an assistant district attorney in houston texas i found him to be highly partisan and indeed an unstable sort of man for that type of job he actually killed the brother of a man he tried for murder and the facts of that incident were never satisfactorily explained i think the citizens of texas were well served when he left that job to pursue a career in which a vivid imagination is an asset not a liability i feel like throwing my pen at portman just to break up the rhythm he and livy are like tennis pros giving an exhibition match sleek and practiced the volleys perfectly timed every shot a winner one final question she says as one of the agents who originally investigated the payton murder what do you think of the allegation that leo marston was somehow involved in that crime a superior smile touches portmans lips god hes enjoying this i find the notion utterly preposterous the fact that we are sitting here today discussing it is a travesty of justice thank you mr director your witness i would prefer to crossexamine portman after i have presented my case but i cannot let his slurs against me stand unchallenged nor can i be sure that portman will even stick around natchez after he leaves the stand i rise but remain at my table mr portman you and i were involved in a jurisdictional dispute over the extradition of a murderer from texas to los angeles california where you were a us attorney is that correct broadly where was that murderer ultimately tried and convicted houston texas thank you you also stated that i killed the brother of a man i tried for murder that trial ended in a conviction did it not yes and wasnt the man i convicted also the subject of our jurisdictional dispute he was but was i charged in the shooting of his brother not to my knowledge your honor i have further questions for this witness but i would prefer to examine him during the presentation of my case seeing franklin gearing up to explain to me why the director of the fbi cannot be expected to sit around at my beck and call i add i hope to recall mr portman before the end of the day judge franklin turns to portman with a solicitous smile will that impose an undue hardship on you mr director i can be available until the end of the day barring an unforeseen emergency very well you are temporarily excused franklin turns to the defense table mr sims does the plaintiff intend to call further witnesses blake sims leans across leos massive chest and holds a whispered conference with livy she listens then shakes her head they want this show to close as quickly as possible your honor says sims reserving the right to call rebuttal witnesses the plaintiff rests judge franklin looks at her watch this phase of the trial has taken much less time than i anticipated lets take a tenminute break and then mr cage will present his defense as the jurors file out i turn and look for caitlin shes sitting with my parents she slides along the bench then comes up to the bar behind my table i can tell by her face that she doesnt have good news no word from stone nothing im sorry youd better drag out the testimony of every witness you have i hate to do that juries always sense it i dont think you have a choice what a comfort the tenminute recess lasts about two minutes and then im on my feet again doing what i have done countless times in my life presenting a murder case i do not stall for time i do not equivocate i present it just as id planned my witnesses come and go like commentators in a documentary frank jones admits he lied about being alone in the triton parking lot his exwife describes finding the soiled stockings in their car betty lou tearfully places ray presley at the crime scene earning points with the jury for testifying against her own interest then describes presleys subsequent threats and brutal harassment huey moaks expert testimony establishes that paytons car was destroyed by c proving the evidence discovered by presley was planted and lester hinson testifies that he sold c to ray presley in april all this testimony runs like a swiss watch and therein lies the problem neither blake sims nor livy rise once to crossexamine my witnesses they dont even challenge huey moaks credentials every time i tender a witness sims waves his hand from the table and says no questions your honor their strategy is simple theyll happily let me prove ray presley guilty of murder and they will probably let me draw connections between presley and ike ransom if i can as long as i cant link presley or ransom to leo marston i am fulfilling the scenario painted in simss opening statement the payton murder was a race crime committed by a racist in his closing argument sims will probably laud my efforts to find justice in this terrible tragedy but to suggest any nefarious link between such men and leo marston must indicate some secret malice toward marston on my part my dilemma is simple either i begin the long laborious task of building circumstantial links between presley and marston which will last well into tomorrow and bore the jury to tears not to mention sabotage my opportunity to crossexamine john portman in this lifetime or i can question portman now do what damage i can and pray that dwight stone descends from the heavens like the deus ex machina of my dreams without stones testimony as a fulcrum i cant force portman to help my cause but by forcing him to lie i can set him up for a later fall on perjury charges and for the director of the fbi that could be a very long fall call john portman i say loudly bailiff says judge franklin call john portman portman returns to the courtroom wearing the same confidence with which he left it he takes his seat in the witness box shoots his cuffs and gives me a serene smile director portman i begin in your earlier testimony you stated that leo marston rendered valuable assistance in the investigation of del paytons death what was the nature of that assistance he pretends to agonize over this question he provided certain information to us in other words he acted as a federal informant yes a couple of the white jury members frown im going to ask you a direct question please answer yes or no did the fbi solve the murder of delano payton in portman takes a deep breath but says nothing we have come down to the nutcutting as we say in the south if he lies now he is laying himself open to perjury charges director portman i asked whether the bureau learned the identity of del paytons murderer in yes we did a gasp goes up from the spectators order snaps judge franklin why didnt the fbi arrest or charge anyone in connection with that murder for reasons of national security let me be sure i understand this the fbi preserved the national security by protecting the identity of a man who had murdered a veteran of the korean war portman shifts in his seat director hoover made that decision not me did you agree with his decision it wasnt my place to agree or disagree you were just following orders yes like a good german i remark recalling stones phrase i strongly resent that mr cage franklin warns dont push me withdrawn director portman did you the loud clearing of a throat behind me breaks my train of thought i start to ignore it but something tells me to turn caitlin masters is crouched at the bar behind my table urgently beckoning me with her hand your honor i beg the courts indulgence i walk back behind my table and kneel so that caitlin can whisper to me her lips touch the shell of my ear i just talked to stones daughter she says she and stone were both at the newspaper two of my people are bringing them over now theyll be on the courthouse steps in two minutes relief and elation flood through me mr cage judge franklin presses were waiting i squeeze caitlins arm then rise and walk back toward the witness box with a briskness portman cannot fail to notice caitlins news has galvanized me director portman was there only one man responsible for paytons death or more than one more than one a murmur from the spectators how many two three ten portman folds his arms across his stomach i decline to answer on grounds that it might damage the national security but you did say more than one so a minimum of two was one of those conspirators a natchez police officer named ray presley he gives me the great stone face i decline to answer on grounds that it might damage the national security did you work the payton case alone director i was part of a team did that team include a veteran agent named dwight stone portmans eyes track me as i move trying to read the source of my newfound confidence yes was the payton murder your first major case as a field agent it was had agent stone wide experience in working civil rights cases for the bureau yes did you admire and respect agent stone portman hesitates at the time yes did you earlier this week order the assassination of agent dwight stone who is now retired objection shouts blake sims with livy close behind franklin bangs her gavel in a vain attempt to silence the gallery mr cage youd better be prepared to substantiate that statement i intend to do just that your honor i turn back to portman did you also order the assassination of sheriffs deputy ike ransom the man murdered at the old pecanshelling plant last night the spectators collectively suck in their breath as portman turns to judge franklin for help franklin looks hard at me then says the witness will answer the question i did not portman says in an indignant voice did you last week order the assassination of former natchez police officer ray presley mr cage franklin interrupts im losing my patience one final question your honor director portman if special agent dwight stone walks through that door back there and takes the stand will you remain in natchez to be recalled as a witness by me he looks right through me i will no more questions judge director portman you are excused says franklin portman glances up at the tv cameras then stands shoots his cuffs again and leaves the witness box as he passes me on the way to the aisle i say call retired special agent dwight stone the hitch in portmans walk is momentary but for me it occurs in slow motion his eyes flit instinctively to the main door searching for his old enemy then they return to me the fear in them tamped down varnished over with the gotohell defiance of a man who has survived every threat to his monumental egotism call dwight stone judge franklin orders the bailiff opens the back door a tall wiry man wearing a denver broncos windbreaker and leaning on the shoulder of a much younger woman limps through it with a cane in his left hand even from my table i can see the steely resolve in stones eyes but he is not looking at me as his daughter squeezes in beside caitlin he limps up the aisle using the cane his eyes never leaving the face of john portman the man who threatened his daughters life and who tried to kill us two nights ago i have a feeling that a lot of dead koreans and chinese saw the look that is on stones face right now i would not want to be john portman at this moment but when i turn back to portman what i see unsettles me he looks surprised but unafraid chapter when stone finishes his slow journey to the witness box he pauses for a few deep breaths then turns to judge franklin may i stand during my testimony your honor do you have a physical malady that prevents you from sitting i was shot two nights ago in the left buttock predictably some spectators snicker in spite of stones obvious pain you may stand says franklin glaring at the crowd i move slowly toward the podium running through memories of everything stone told me two nights ago in colorado he lied to me thenby omission leaving ike ransom completely out of his story i need the truth today the whole truth stone must be made aware that ike the spike no longer needs his protection instead of stopping at the podium i adopt livys tactic and continue right up to the witness box in a voice barely above a whisper i say ike ransom was shot to death last night as judge franklin orders me to speak at an audible level stone winks and my heartbeat rushes ahead mr stone were you ever an agent of the federal bureau of investigation i was a field agent for sixteen years did your duties ever bring you to natchez mississippi yes in what capacity in may of i was assigned to investigate the death of delano payton i arrived here the day after he was murdered who gave you that assignment j edgar hoover personally yes did you succeed in that assignment did you solve the murder i did even though portman said the same thing during his testimony the crowd buzzes in expectation its plain that dwight stone does not intend to hold anything back could you briefly describe how you went about doing that objection says livy rising to her feet judge this man is testifying to information that has been sealed to protect national security his willingness to break the law or even to commit treason is no reason to allow him to divulge protected information in front of television cameras i try not to let my anxiety show on my face but livy may have just stopped this trial dead at least until government officials are brought in to decide what stone may and may not say judge franklin looks at me ms sutter raises a serious issue mr cage you have argument on this point i could argue for an hour but i would probably lose perhaps we should hear mr stone on this point judge hes an attorney himself franklin gives stone an inquisitive glance mr stone stone shakes his head like a soldier pondering a heavily defended hill he has just been ordered to take judge the heart of my testimony goes to the justification of that national security classification after sixteen years working for j edgar hoover i can tell you this no man more readily abused such classifications for his own personal ends than hoover he sealed the del payton file solely to mask evidence of criminal activity it had nothing to do with the national interest if you allow my testimony youll know beyond a shadow of a doubt that youve done the right thing he looks franklin square in the eye have the courage of your office judge she regards him thoughtfully my dilemma mr stone is that once youve spoken your words cannot be taken back stone sighs with all respect judge im going to tell my story regardless of your decision ive been silent too long i can tell it here on the stand or outside on the steps franklin tilts her head back shocked by stones frank threat i have a third choice i can have you jailed for contempt stone doesnt even blink you can jail me judge but you cant stop me from speaking that is the one thing you cannot do eunice franklin studies stone for a long time what does she see in him he is ten years her senior but from another era altogether is he a veteran cop with a conscience or an unstable and dangerous hasbeen as john portman would portray him livy opens her mouth to argue further but franklin stops her with an upraised hand no additional argument ms sutter if mr stone has the courage to risk jail i will risk censure if he strays into what i feel is dangerous territory ill stop him continue with your story mr stone under protest livy says in a cold voice noted mr cage i turn to stone with as much gratitude as i can bring to my eyes mr stone could you describe how you went about solving the delano payton murder in clear and concise language the former agent gives a chronological account of his investigation up to the point that he nailed ray presley his story mirrors exactly the testimony given by my earlier witnesses from frank jones to lester hinson and he confirms that john portman worked with him every step of the way their discovery that lester hinson had sold c to ray presley stone says prompted a rather intense meeting with presley during which presley stated that hed merely acted as a middleman in the deal purchasing the plastic explosive for a young natchez black man an army veteran this brings us just past the point at which stone began lying to me in colorado what was that young black mans name mr stone ike ransom are you aware that a sheriffs deputy by that name was murdered last night yes was he the same man you interviewed in yes john portman stated that the fbi file on del payton was sealed because of the involvement of a certain vietnam veteran was ike ransom that man yes what did you do after patrolman ray presley told you hed bought the c for ike ransom portman and i interviewed ransom at his apartment two minutes after we were inside he confessed to the murder of delano payton livy jumps to her feet but her objection is drowned by the explosive reaction of the crowd judge franklin bangs her gavel but it takes some time for order to be restored even the jury is gaping at stone your honor says livy i object this witnesss testimony is hearsay franklin nods and looks at me under the mississippi rules of evidence livy is right but all rules are proved by exceptions as i come to my feet i troll my memory for the details of exceptions under mississippi law which i scanned less than six hours ago in the office of the chancery judge an old high school friend your honor this qualifies as a hearsay exception under rule b deputy ransom was on my witness list specifically to testify to this information his murder last night has made that impossible since the declarant is unavailable due to death mr stones statement should be admitted franklin looks surprised by my knowledge of mississippi law livy says your honor mr cages exception is sidebar franklin cuts in approach the bench livy and i meet before franklin and lean toward her judge says livy this is patent hearsay and no exception should be made judge ike ransoms confession was a statement made against interest a murder confession so obviously subjected him to criminal liability that great weight must be accorded to it franklin taps her pen on a notepad as she considers my argument given the totality of the circumstances im going to allow it his entire statement i press lets see where it leads i may stop him livy starts to argue then thinks better of it she returns to her table as i approach stone please continue mr stone he lifts his cane from the rail and leans heavily upon it ike ransom was a mess suicidal probably he was living in squalor that would be difficult to believe by todays standards there was drug paraphernalia in plain view what we called heroin works back then he was literally dying to tell someone his story what was his story he had recently separated from the army after a tour in vietnam hed served as a military policemen there as i recall hed tried to find work with the local police department but was turned down desperate for money hed turned to drug dealing he admitted this to you yes two weeks before del payton was murdered ransom was stopped on a rural road by patrolman ray presley presley discovered a large quantity of heroin in ransoms trunk he offered to overlook this if ransom agreed to kill a man for him objection blake sims cries on what grounds asks judge franklin but livy has taken hold of simss jacket and pulled him back down to his seat theres no objection she says franklin gives them an admonitory look continue mr stone patrolman presley also promised ransom that if he carried out this murder presley would ensure that he was eventually hired by the police department presley had told the truth about ike ransom asking him to get the c ransom was afraid of dynamite but hed had experience with c in vietnam did you report ransoms confession to director hoover i did what was his reaction i would describe it as glee glee could you elaborate on that mr hoover was being forced to aggressively pursue a civil rights agenda this did not reconcile with his personal feelings he particularly hated martin luther king and robert kennedy my revelation that the murder of del paytona crime which robert kennedy considered a civil rights murder had in fact been carried out by a black man gave the director obvious enjoyment he remarked that he would dearly enjoy telling bobby kennedy that paytons death had been nothing but another shine killing those were his words did hoover in fact report this to bobby kennedy not to my knowledge what did he do he authorized me to wiretap the home of ray presley and also the pay phones within a twomile radius of his home did you learn anything from those wiretaps a few days later presley called leo marston the local district attorney and asked for a private meeting objection cries sims to livys obvious displeasure it looks to me like sims may be objecting on the order of his client leos face has grown steadily redder during stones testimony grounds asks judge franklin when sims hesitates franklin says i want no more frivolous interruptions of this testimony you can object from now till doomsday but mr stone is going to tell his story is that clear sims sighs and takes his chair while leo sets his jaw and glares at franklin stone relates the story of wiretapping tuscany and of hoover taking personal control of the investigation because of its political sensitivity the meeting between presley and marston took place in the gazebo outside the marston mansion it became clear in the first ten minutes of that conversation that ray presley had arranged the death of delano payton at the specific request of the district attorney leo marston judge franklin is so engrossed by stones testimony that it takes her several seconds to realize that the spectators are out of order she furiously bangs her gavel ill clear this court she vows pointing her gavel at the balcony for emphasis i would have expected livy to leap to her feet at stones last statement but she seems as engrossed in the story as judge franklin how did that become clear mr stone i ask marston knew every detail of the murder right down to ike ransoms request for the c did their conversation shed any light on the possible motive for this crime yes stone lucidly lays out the pending land deal between marston and zebulon hickson the carpet magnate from georgia he explains leos secret ownership of the land hicksons concern with black labor problems and his insistence that an example be made of a black union worker before committing to purchase marstons property yes mr stone im sure everyone in this courtroom is wondering why since you solved the murder no one was arrested for it can you explain that after director hoover had all the evidence and reports in his possession including the audiotapeshe set up a meeting with leo marston at the jackson field office of the fbi after this meeting took place i was instructed to stand down my natchez detail and report to tuscaloosa alabama for other duties i was told that no arrest would be made because that was in the best interests of the bureau and the country what did you make of that stone shakes his head id seen it before hoover liked having leverage over people particularly people in government leo marston came from a powerful political family his father had tremendous influence in both mississippi and washington over the next year i learned that hoover used the leverage of the payton murder to force leos father to influence the presidential election by trying to swing mississippis electoral votes away from george wallace to richard nixon who was a protege of hoovers it was also clear in that leo himself was destined for higher office director hoover and leo marston developed a mutually beneficial relationship that flourished from paytons death in until hoovers death in judge franklin is shaking her head in amazement i cant believe that livy or sims did not object to stones last statements but they probably assumedrightly i suspectthat judge franklin meant to hear him out no matter what so i summarize trying to bring it all into perspective for the jury j edgar hoover was willing to bury conclusive evidence of a civil rights murder in order to strengthen his own political influence how did you react to this not well please be specific i began drinking it affected my work i cheated on my wife she divorced me took my daughter from me i was eventually dismissed from the bureau a fragment of ikes confession in the pecanshelling plant comes to me from the ether did you ever make any attempt to right what you considered the terrible wrong that had been done in the payton case surprise flashes in stones eyes yes how i had retained a copy of the incriminating tape about a year after the murder when i knew no official action would ever be taken against the killers i called ike ransom hed been hired as a police officer by then just as presley had promised what did you tell him nothing i played him my copy of the tape then i hung up what did you think ransom would do after hearing that tape i dont know i suppose i hoped that he might take direct action you hoped he would kill presley and marston stones face remains impassive the thought entered my mind mr stone when you described these events to me two days ago you didnt mention ike ransom why he looks at the rail his eyes filled with something like grief i felt some sympathy for ike ransom despite what hed done sympathy for a murderer ransom was a combat veteran i was one myself del payton too ransom had a bad time in vietnam i could tell that right off when presley caught him with that heroin his choices narrowed down to nothing parchman prison or commit murder that may not mitigate his act but when i interviewed the man he was paralyzed by remorse he was the only one of the three who ever showed any and to this day im surprised he lived through those weeks stone rubs his free hand over the one holding the head of the cane then expels a lungful of air presley and marston were arrogant about what theyd done and why not the system rewarded marston for it i ask stone to briefly explain the presley angle of the marstonhoover deal marstons betrayal of presley to the fbi my goal being to show the jury that even last nights attempt by presley to kill marston had its roots in the payton murder when stone finishes judge franklin looks overwhelmed by the implications of the case one last question mr stone why knowing all that you did did you wait so long to come forward with the truth he looks past me but i doubt he sees anything of the courtroom cowardice he says plain and simple hoover used john portman to threaten my family if i caused a scandal after my exwife died i thought about coming forward but by then my daughter had graduated law school and against my advice joined the fbi she was subject to the will of the justice department of which john portman was a major part the murder had happened so long ago i just tried to put it behind me did you succeed no its haunted me my whole life thank you mr stone i tender the witness subject to redirect judge franklin lays both hands on her desk and sighs im going to take a recess here id like to think for a bit and im sure mr stone would like to rest his legs livy stands abruptly id prefer to crossexamine now your honor franklin frowns and looks at me mr cage i should probably opt for the recess to give stone time to decompress but something pushes me in the opposite direction something in me is driven to witness livys performance how far is she willing to go to protect her father how far now that stones testimony has destroyed any remaining illusions she might have had about leos innocence no objection your honor proceed ms sutter livy squeezes leos shoulder in a gesture that looks genuine then she approaches stone at an oblique angle walking slowly with a burgundy montblanc pen in her hand not looking at him but at the jury every man and woman in the box watches her with fascination mr stone what year were you dismissed from the fbi were you summarily dismissed or were efforts made to help you stop drinking i wasnt fired for drinking your record states that you were but im interested why do you think you were fired for drawing my service weapon on leo marston in the lobby of the watergate office complex livy doesnt bat an eye theres no mention of such an incident in your record were there any witnesses to it my partner henry bookbinder will he corroborate your story he would if he were alive any other witnesses not that i know by name only marston himself leo actually smirks from his table he loves seeing livy perform this way this is what he fantasized about before she ran off to virginia and then atlanta lets return to your dismissal she says i admired the candor of your earlier testimony being honest about things like losing your wife and child must be very hard i know because im going through a divorce myself livy wins instant points with the jury for this personal revelation one with stratospheric value in the natchez gossip market stone stands with a resigned frown on his face like a soldier being courtmartialed one who knows something bad is coming and that he has no choice but to endure it i wonder livy says with false spontaneity were you completely honest about your dismissal stone just waits do you know a woman named catherine neumaier his face sags would you like some water stones jaw clenches he is clearly offended by livys feigned concern i did know catherine neumaier shes dead now dead twentyfive years did miss neumaier have a profession she was a dancer a dancer she had no other profession not to my knowledge fbi records indicate that miss neumaier was a prostitute i dont know anything about that how did you meet miss neumaier i was working an organized crime task force i was assigned to try to compromise her as an informant because she had ties to organized crime she danced in a club owned by sam giancana the mafia boss of chicago yes did miss neumaier become your informant yes was she an alcoholic no fbi records indicate that she was also that she took drugs stone sighs she had a severe health problem lupus she took pills to help her stay awake for work pills to help her sleep did you have a sexual relationship with miss neumaier his eyes dont waver yes wasnt it this relationship that caused the breakup of your marriage yes were you reprimanded for unprofessional conduct because of this sexual relationship with miss neumaier officially and only after the fact unofficially hoover encouraged it from the start you were encouraged by the director of the fbi to have an affair with a mob prostitute i find that difficult to believe stones eyes are burning now all patience gone from his face lady the total tonnage of what you dont know about federal law enforcement would sink a damned oil tanker livy is already smiling in triumph when judge franklin reprimands stone for his language did you feel she goes on prodding a different nerve that john portman had anything to do with your dismissal from the fbi i know he did how do you know portman had known since the payton case that i didnt go along with what hoover had done allegedly done keep telling yourself that im warning you mr stone franklin cuts in how did mr portman influence your dismissal livy asks he reported all my conversations and movements to hoover after the director took over the payton case why would he do that because he sensed that i wasnt going to toe the line he sensed my sympathy for del payton and ike ransom hoovers standard procedure would have been to tell portman to keep a close eye on me and report back this was portmans first major case he would have kissed hoovers hed have done whatever hoover told him to without question what else did portman do two days before i was fired evidence pertaining to the payton case was stolen from my apartment portman took that i thought you told us that director hoover requested that all the payton evidence be forwarded to washington i kept copies of certain things against direct orders yes why do you think it was portman who allegedly stole this material he left me a calling card a business card no a map livy looks less certain here what kind of map my evidence was hidden behind a wall panel after the theft the panel was purposefully left out of place when i looked inside the wall i found a map of natchez mississippi thered been no map there before that was portmans calling card that was the only place wed ever served together i suppose he thought it displayed a certain wit how do you feel about mr portman personally since he sent four men to kill me last night i dont feel too well disposed toward him the jury will disregard that statement judge franklin cuts in confine yourself to the question mr stone all right i think john portman is a rich spineless bureaucrat who didnt get spanked enough when he was a kid franklin turns red but livy is ecstatic stone is giving her exactly what she wants before franklin can reprimand him she turns to face the jury box mr stone did you enter into a conspiracy with the author penn cage to ruin the careers of john portman and leo marston he blinks in surprise what absolutely not but you see the symmetry of the suggestion i do not she turns back to him with a knowing smile come now youre a smart man im suggesting that you and mr cage made a deal of sorts mr cage hated leo marston you hated john portman alone neither of you could do much to destroy those men but together objection i say at last livy smiles i withdraw the question your honor and i have no further questions for this witness i cant understand why shes releasing stone so soon until she says if this is mr cages final witness i would very much like to call mr cage at this time as a rebuttal witness her suggestion stuns me all i can think to say is ms sutter is out of order judge just a moment says franklin you are excused mr stone but dont leave the courthouse stone makes no move to leave the witness box he looks down at livy with contempt and says youre not worth a hangnail on catherine neumaiers little finger your father is a murderer and you know it but you stand there mr stone snaps franklin leave the stand or ill be forced to hold you in contempt stone looks away from livy like a man looking away from a dead enemy then limps off the stand with his soldiers bearing as he passes me he stops shakes my hand and leans close i told you you didnt want me as a witness i squeeze his hand and whisper bullshit i wanted the truth and you gave it to me the question is was the jury ready for it as stone passes the spectators benches his cane rapping on the hardwood floor his daughter rises takes his elbow and helps him toward the doors ms sutter says judge franklin this is an unusual request whose testimony are you calling mr cage to rebut mr stones your honor franklin considers this for a few moments mr cage do you plan to call additional witnesses i had planned to recall portman but now that livy has undercut everything stone said by making him look bent on revenge im not sure what to do and now she wants to question me i suppose she is finally answering the question of how far she is willing to go i have no more witnesses your honor does the defense rest then a strange sense of sadness flows through me not for myself but for althea payton sitting out there in the benches she nods at me as though to say at least we tried subject to calling rebuttal witnesses the defense rests very well please take the stand mr cage without looking at livy i mount the steps to the witness box and seat myself everyone in the room is watching me my parents the paytons austin mackey who looks like hes in shock from the revelations hes heard in the past half hour high in the back of the court more faces watch from the balcony and among them the larger gleaming eyes of the cnn and wlbt cameras one pair of eyes is not watching me livy marstons and its a damn good thing if she had the nerve to look me in the eye while playing out this obscene charade i might decide to stand up and announce her sins to the world but i wont do that and she knows it its not in me to do something like that but maybe it is in her mr cage she says facing the jury did you and i have a romantic relationship when we attended the st stephens preparatory school yes was it a serious relationship define serious an extended relationship of a sexual nature she has guts ill give her that yes when did that relationship finally end two minutes ago our freshman year of college did it end that year because my father leo marston handled a malpractice suit against your father thomas cage yes in the course of that lawsuit did your father suffer a nearfatal heart attack yes did you blame my father for that yes did that lawsuit effectively end any chance of you and i getting married yes at last she turns to me but her eyes look opaque as though she has closed them against all my feeling for her steeling herself against mercy did you blame my father for that as well does she want me to tell the truth does she want me to say no i blame you the whole goddamn thing happened because you got yourself pregnant by a stupid redneck murderer and couldnt deal with it for a long time i did and did you conspire with former special agent dwight stone to destroy my father and john portman i did not she holds my eyes a moment longer as though waiting for me to counterattack with everything i know about her i say nothing what would it accomplish besides convincing livy that im willing to sink as low to destroy her father as she is to protect him would it convince the jury that marston and portman are guilty if stones testimony didnt do that the marston familys dirty laundry certainly wont no further questions livy says turning away at last judge franklin looks at me as though i have fulfilled the assertion she made on the day we met in her office i have a fool for a client mr cage she says i find myself in the curious position of asking if you would like to crossexamine yourself i almost laugh out loud here it is my chance to say anything i want and curiously enough i have no inclination to say anything without ike ransom or ray presley to confirm stones story i can add nothing that will sway the twelve people in the jury box no questions your honor youre excused mr cage excused my parents are watching me with agony in their faces althea payton nods her lips tight caitlins black veil of hair frames her porcelain face among all the others shes looking at me with something like pity in her eyes she thinks im unable to turn livys sword against her not trapped in a situation where my conscience is forcing me to endure humiliation without fighting back as i walk back to the defense table i turn toward the jury i do not give them my lawyers lookfull of confidence certain of victorybut a simple human look an unstated question their faces are hard to read stones testimony resonated with the black jurors but even they cannot help but connect the simple dots livy held up before them i blamed leo marston for making my father ill and ruining my prospects with his daughter stone hated portman for his dismissal from the fbi once the two of us were brought together a conspiracy was almost inevitable factually this theory has at least one major hole but emotionally it makes sense it plays and some of the jury members are bound to buy into it as i reach the table the door at the rear of the courtroom opens and a young woman walks in its jenny doe she looks toward the judges bench then pans her eyes until they settle on me she waves at me i nod to her and take my seat just as judge franklin says ms sutter does the plaintiff rest any lingering illusion that blake sims is leading leo marstons legal team crumbles into dust livy nods the plaintiff rests your honor as franklin turns to me someone pulls at my elbow mr cage its jenny crouching at the bar behind my table mr cage says judge franklin does the defense rest jenny grabs my arm above the elbow and jabs her thumb into a nerve i jerk my elbow away mr cage says franklin is that young lady bothering you may i have a moment your honor if you must i twist in my chair until im face to face with jenny what the hell are you doing her eyes are glittering with excitement i have something for you she whispers i think i have what you need to win your case what are you talking about i tried to get in here this morning to watch the trial but it was too crowded and its a good thing for you because i went back to my apartment and watched it on tv i didnt realize what i had until i heard that mr stone talking about j edgar hoover i ran mr cage judge franklin presses im ready to give this case to the jury i hold up my hand jenny for gods sake get to the point its the tapes i blink in bewilderment tapes she reaches into the pocket of her jeans and pulls out a black maxell cassette tape this she says its one of the tapes i stole from clayton lacours office remember the mobbedup lawyer who handled my adoption when i stole all the files relating to marston i stole his phone tapes too lacours conversations with marston twelve tapes and on this one hes talking about your case about del payton he never actually says the name so i never realized what i had but when that poor beckham woman started saying the name ray presley something zinged in my mind i couldnt place it until mr stone started talking about j edgar hoover i had to fastforward through eight different tapes before i found it i sprinted the three blocks over here jenny what is it what do they say she shakes her head her eyes brimming with secret joy just get the judge to play it you wont believe it i close my eyes thinking furiously mr cage ive had enough says judge franklin does the defense rest i take the tape from jenny get to my feet and lay my hands on the table no your honor i request a conference in chambers critical new evidence has just come to my attention i believe it will be conclusive evidence and objection livy cries shaking her head she has already seen the tape in my hand she probably thinks its dwight stones recording of her father and ray presley talking in the gazebo of tuscany no such evidence was disclosed to us your honor i didnt know about it myself until a moment ago the young lady behind me just brought it to my attention livy looks at jenny with dread in her face who is that person franklin asks livy closes her eyes her name is jenny doe judge who she is is less important than what she has what does she have a tape of leo marston discussing the payton murder with a new orleans attorney named clayton lacour judge franklin looks to livy for an objection but livy is still standing with her eyes closed as though she can no longer stand the schizophrenic nature of what she is being called upon to do today prodded by leo blake sims gets to his feet judge i object to the introduction of this surprise evidence on the grounds of eunice franklin stops him with an upraised hand ill hear argument in my chambers she stands in her black robe and looks down at me mr cage this had better not be desperation grandstanding the tape will speak for itself i assure her praying that jenny knows evidence when she hears it counsel in my chambers says franklin she points at jenny you too young lady chapter we stand like human islands in judge franklins chambers an archipelago of attorneys situated around the mainland of her mahogany desk blake sims to the left im in the center with jenny behind me livy stands to the right apart and alone reading the spines of the books in franklins shelves ms sutter are you with us livy half turns to the judge but doesnt come close to eye contact with me or jenny yes your honor the judge looks up at me her eyes hard all right mr cage what exactly is on this tape blake sims is shaking his head but he doesnt speak i havent heard it myself judge but this woman claims that it refers directly to the murder of del payton and i have reason to believe shes telling the truth franklin transfers her glare to jenny how did you come by this tape young lady i worked for clayton lacour the lawyer who made the tape i went to work for him to try to find out the identities of my birth parents im an adopted child and i knew that lacour had handled my adoption jenny glances at livy who is pointedly ignoring her while working for lacour i found out leo marston had been involved in my adoption when i quit that job i took all the files and tapes pertaining to judge marston with me you mean you stole them yes maam judge franklin looks like she wants a cigarette or a drink and probably both i dont understand why were there tapes at all mr lacour taped most of his phone calls he was connected with the marcello family in new orleans you know mafia he was seriously paranoid franklin sighs and holds out her hand let me have the tape i hand over the cassette the judge studies it for a few moments then speaks without looking up did you learn who your birth parents were yes your honor who are they livy goes rigid beside the shelves at least one of them is in this room right now judge do you want me to say more franklin shakes her head in amazement not at this time she looks up at me i dont know exactly whats going on behind this lawsuit but i dont appreciate having my court used as an arena to play out private vendettas is that clear absolutely your honor i want counsel back at their respective tables youfranklin points at jennystay with me im going to listen to this tape then ill make my decision as to admissibility if i walk back into that courtroom and announce that the tape will be played i dont want to hear a single objection if i dont mention the tape the same holds true and i will give this case to the jury its late and theres too much craziness surrounding this trial to drag it into tomorrow if we dont have to she claps her hands together everybody out as i walk back to my table caitlin nods in encouragement from the bar i take my seat and slide back within earshot of her what do you have she whispers im not sure a tape of marston and a new orleans lawyer jenny says it will nail marston you havent heard it no franklins listening to it now shes going to rule on admissibility im praying here caitlin says im actually praying the wait is almost impossible to bear two minutes stretch to five then ten the spectators are silent at first but as the minutes drag on they begin to whisper without franklin to intimidate them the whisper grows to a hum then a dull roar it reminds me of students assembled in a gymnasium twice i look across the aisle to marstons table but leo and livy stare straight ahead their faces set in stone only blake sims looks worried sims looks in fact like he would rather be getting a root canal than sitting at his clients table at last judge franklins chamber door opens silencing the court jenny doe walks through first and heads for the spectators benches her head bowed franklin emerges carrying a cassette tape player a cheap jam box with a silver antenna sticking up off of it at marstons table blake sims actually covers his eyes yes whispers caitlin from behind me judge franklin takes the bench sets the tape player before her then turns to the jury box members of the jury i am about to play a tape recording of two voices having a telephone conversation one i am told belongs to a lawyer in new orleans the other i am convinced belongs to the plaintiff in this case leo marston i have instructed counsel to make no objections to the playing of this tape the supreme court might disagree with my decision but this is not a murder trial and i suspect that it will never see an appeals court a murmur of anticipation ripples through the crowd the language on the tape is profane judge franklin goes on as language spoken between men in private sometimes tends to be i will play only that portion of the tape i believe relevant to this case i want no displays of emotion i want absolute silence i will eject anyone who disobeys that order she rubs the bridge of her nose and sighs then another liverspotted hand emerges from the black robe it presses a button on the machine and turns the speakers toward the jury static fills the courtroom then an unfamiliar male voice comes from the speakers the new orleans accent plain brooklyn with a little crawfish thrown in this must be clayton lacour and this problem leo its you know one of those things you could earn a lot of gratitude by fixing im listening a collective intake of breath by the crowd as it recognizes the resonant voice of leo marston order demands judge franklin this goddamn new guy they got at the field office here lacour goes on hughes his name is hes not playing by the old rules this is the new sac im talkin bout hes stoppin by for coffee at carloss office at the town and country for gods sake got surveillance on him around the clock uncle c is gettin ulcers you gotta help me out here cher im not sure what you want what i want its not me leo im just passing a message from the man from marcello yeah elvis was down here a few months ago and he told carlos you were tight with hoover he said elvis yeah presley that ah whats his first name ray carloss guys call him elvis a pause on marstons end then thought frank costello greased the skids with hoover for marcello well you didnt hear it from me okay but carlos and frank are on the outs just now not a good time for carlos to call new york for a favor so anyway elvis was down here and he told the man you guys cooled out a nigger down there two or three years back and hoover let it slide for you a gasp from the jury box said you call him edgar like hes your uncle or something lacour laughing now anyway carlos wants you to talk to the old queen and get this harold hughes off his back this fucking guy dont know how it works down here does marcello understand how things work with hoover what do you mean hoover expects a quid pro quo hey theres always a quid pro quo right thats business but look elvis wasnt just talkin shit about this nigger was he no hoover grew up in washington dc when it was still a southern town this business youre talking about was in sixtyeight hoover would have traded twenty nigras for one electoral vote for nixon it was that close you tell marcello ill speak to edgar but remember quid pro quo that goes for me as well hey do i know you or dont i now what about those gas leases where they re dredging down by houma judge franklin switches off the machine the silence is total im not sure anyone in the courtroom is breathing the jury appears to be in shock particularly the black jurors who are staring at leo marston as they might at a dangerous wild animal blake sims gets to his feet to start listing objections but franklin stops him with a gesture a chilling screech of chair legs rips through the courtroom as all heads turn toward the source of the soundthe plaintiffs tablelivy rises from her chair puts her purse over her shoulder and without looking at her father or anyone else walks around the table and down the aisle to the door at the back of the courtroom this act is probably more damning to her father than the tape to me it suggests a chance for the possibility of redemption at least she draws the line somewhere i suppress the urge to go after her even though i know that at this moment she might do something truly desperate i must play my part in this grotesquerie to the end as i turn back toward the bench austin mackey stands and hurries after livy ill have to wait to find out what hes up to mr sims judge franklin says from the bench i know what youre going to say first that the voice on this tape is not leo marstons second that if the voice is marstons it has been spliced together using some miracle of modern technology third you want to request a continuance while your experts examine the tape franklin drums her fingers on her desk mr sims that is not going to happen i am not going to recall this jury three weeks from now just to hear your experts denounce the tape and mr cages experts argue that its genuine ive known leo marston for twentyfive years and i believe the tape is genuine mr sims i am giving this case to the jury most of the heads in the jury box are nodding does the plaintiff rest franklin asks under protest sims says weakly noted franklin turns to me does the defense rest your honor the defense rests franklin is about to begin instructing the jury when leo marston rises from his chair and walks toward the aisle as though to follow livy out judge marston franklin says from the bench he gives the judge his broad back and starts down the aisle leo she calls marston ignores her he is nearly to the doors his enormous shoulders rocking with purposeful motion bailiff says franklin her voice quavering with what sounds like fear please restrain mr marston the bailiff a middleaged black man stands in front of the door and lays a hand on the butt of his holstered gun leo looks prepared to make the poor man use it you will stay to hear the verdict of this jury mr marston franklin says in a firmer voice unless youre dismissing this suit leonidas marston finally stops and turns back to judge franklin his face a mask of contempt im entitled to a jury of my peers he says his voice booming through the courtroom i wont be judged by that rabble sitting up there franklins face reddens to the point that i fear she might stroke out leo im holding you im dismissing the suit he growls then he turns back to the door as though he could as easily dismiss the consequences of this proceeding from his life as the bailiff looks to judge franklin for guidance the door behind him is yanked open and austin mackey walks through followed by two large deputies the deputies block the door while mackey walks far enough up the aisle to make sure the tv cameras capture the full range of his limited charisma judge franklin he says in the deepest voice he can muster regardless of the verdict of this jury i am ordering the arrest of leo marston for the crime of capital murder pandemonium erupts in the courtroom order franklin shouts quiet in this court the grand jury will be convened in two weeks mackey goes on and i intend to bring the case before them at that time judge franklin shakes her head and gives the district attorney a sarcastic smile let me state for the record mr mackey that you are a day late and a dollar short since mr cage has proved your case for you i suggest you forward your salary for the month to him mackey blushes from his neck to the top of his head but he recovers quickly and turns back to the deputies blocking the door place mr marston under arrest the charge is capital murder it must gall mackey to have to get the deputies to make this arrest but even with his overarching ambition mackey hasnt the nerve to try to arrest leo marston it would be like a rabbit confronting a bengal tiger i half expect leo to fight the deputies to the floor but he allows himself to be quietly handcuffed judge franklin says blake sims i request that judge marston be taken out through a side door to spare the embarrassment of a mob scene hes done great service to this city and this state no matter what else he might have done technically leo is mackeys prisoner now but this is eunice franklins court he defers to her franklin stares at leo who is looking indifferently ahead as though bored by the events around him his problem has become one for the criminal courts and he knows that particular jungle better than most take him out the front door franklin says as the deputies escort marston out judge franklin looks to the jury box ladies and gentlemen you have done your duty i apologize for the incompleteness of the process at least it only took one day you are discharged she turns to the gallery this court is dismissed a wild roar erupts from outside the building undoubtedly prompted by the appearance of leo marston in handcuffs i have no desire to be in that crowd of jubilant blacks and confused whites people who still know nothing of the facts of this case and who probably wont fully absorb them for several days as the spectators rise from the benches in a rush i am surrounded by people slapping my back and trying to shake my hand the first hand i take is my fathers his grip is firm and strong his eyes filled with pride you did a fair job son he breaks into a smile my mother is in tears beside him she reaches out and hugs me while behind her charles evers and willie pinder give me brief salutes then turn and move toward the door as i stare after them caitlin materializes out of the crowd smiling with relief well i guess we won she says right youre damn right dad agrees im thinking of ruby my mother says quietly me too i tell her she takes my hand you had to do it i see that now before i can say anything else caitlin steps up to me stands on tiptoe and kisses me on the cheek ive been wanting to do that all day she turns to my parents i hope you dont mind public displays of affection my mother surprises the hell out of me by saying thats quite all right i punch caitlins shoulder can you win the pulitzer if youre personally involved in the story youre covering she waves her hand as though swatting a fly to hell with the pulitzer ill take it if they offer it but im not chasing it anymore my father grips my right shoulder and turns me in place judge franklin is standing behind me in her black robe she extends her hand and shakes mine thats the first time ive ever seen a slander case hijacked into a murder trial she says i couldnt figure any other way to do it i apologize dont sometimes you have to go the long way around to get justice i appreciate what you did the hearsay exception letting the tape in a hint of a smile comes to her lips the truth will out goodbye mr cage i nod thanks and turn back to caitlin who takes my hand pulls it behind her back and squeezes it tight out of the swirl of my parents friends althea payton steps forward wearing a dark blue dress behind her stands del looking very uncomfortable in a sunday suit i can finally get on with living althea says softly her liquid brown eyes meet mine and for a moment there is no one in the courtroom but us i think you know what im talking about she adds an image of sarah flashes behind my eyes but too much has happened today to let it in i do del reaches over his mothers shoulder and shakes my hand thanks man i shake his hand nod thanks then prepare to accept the congratulations of all the others waiting behind him but my thoughts are already far away somewhere outside this building livy marston is walking or driving alone pondering the wreckage of her life her father is right where i hoped he would be but livy isnt despite all i have seen of herthe coldness and dishonesty and manipulationpart of me longs to be with her now the bottle of wine we sank twenty years ago still waits at the bottom of that cold clear pool buried under mud and sand and time but there all the same and god help me i wish i were going to her bed tonight but im not i will not the past is dead epilogue i am standing in line for its a small world at walt disney world in florida annie is in my arms but this time we are not alone caitlin stands beside us smiling as the line snakes toward the boats filled with parents and wideeyed children we are not a family the three of us not legally but we are very happy together in this moment caitlin takes my hand as the line moves forward not looking at me but simply being with me with the comfort of familiar lovers i hardly ever think of livy now and when i do it is only with sadness for her not for us she flew back to atlanta the day after the trial but whether to conclude her divorce or to reconcile with her husband i have no idea before she left i had coffee with her at the eola hotel in the awkward silence between us i made three requests first that she inform jenny doe that her father was a boy who is now married and does not want his identity revealed second that livy provide funds for jenny to attend the college of her choice and establish a trust fund that will provide a livable income for the rest of jennys life and third that she make no fuss over jenny using the marston family name should she elect to do so i suspect that jenny will elect not to but i want her to have the choice the threat of what could happen should livy not live up to these conditions did not need to be stated my knowledge of the contents of leos secret safe could decimate her family fortune the remaining fallout from the trial happened quickly less than fortyeight hours after portions of dwight stones testimony began running on cnn john portman was asked by the president to resign as director of the fbi one week later it was announced that he had accepted a position with the detocqueville trust a conservative thinktank based in alexandria virginia four days after portmans resignation special agent peter lutjenss transfer to north dakota was rescinded and he resumed his duties in washington dc dwight stones daughter also resumed her bureau duties but stone has confided to me by telephone that she plans to resign soon she seems to have some crazy idea about practicing country law with her father in colorado two weeks after stone mounted the witness stand in natchez a grand jury indicted leo marston on capital murder charges he is scheduled to go to trial in two days with austin mackey prosecuting the consensus of the natchez legal community is that he will be found guilty and receive life imprisonment when the masses finally turn on a tyrant they turn viciously in the mayoral election wiley warren defeated shad johnson by a percentage margin of shad did not win the votes of those good whites he needed to push him over the top and the ill feeling stirred up by my pursuit of the payton case may well have been the cause of that such is life wiley warren has not been a bad mayor and if shad means business he can stick around four more years and become a true citizen of the town i may do that myself the cool november air has thinned the crowds at disney world and weve had our run of the park some popular rides have no lines at all yet the fantasyland ridesdumbo and alices tea party and its a small worldare always backed up at least to the end of the chute some parents have the stupefied looks of ride hypnosis but most of the faces are alight with joy the longing for that kind of innocence never quite fades as we near the magical grotto the syrupy sweet chorus of its a small world after all envelops us and i think again of jenny doe as a foster child she never set foot in a place like this she never had the chance to believe it was real or to return later and laugh about how corny it is jenny was not my child but she could have been she could have been in the dreadful moment that she told me she thought she was my fear had testified to the possibility our actions have consequences that last long after us entwining the present with the future in ways we cannot begin to understand i have resolved a simple thing i will do those things which make me happy today and which i can also live with ten years from now as caitlin helps annie into the flatbottomed boat she turns back and looks at me her green eyes sparkling my mind is a thousand miles away and she knows it she kisses me anyway pulling me gently back to reality with a warm and promising gesture of love caitlin is not a substitute for the wife i lost she is a different person her own person sarah will always be the secret sharer in my heart and in annies too but annie no longer walks the streets of disney world with haunted eyes searching for a face she will never see in life again and when i make love with caitlin holding her tenderly in the dark as annie sleeps i push not into the past but into the future as the little boat jerks forward off the rollers and settles into the water i put my arms around caitlin and annie and hug them to me with all my strength and soul their laughter is like lamplight in the dark i can live with this
