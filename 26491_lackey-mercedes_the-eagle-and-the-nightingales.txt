bardic voices the eagle and the nightingales mercedes lackey copyright dedicated to gail gallano mother of all tulsa wildlife rehabbers chapter one all the world comes to kingsford faire the midsummer faire of kings a gypsy known only as nightingale sat on a riverside rock on the edge of the faire grounds with the tune of faire of the kings running through her head not that she liked that particular piece of doggerel but it did have one of those annoying tunes that would stick in ones mind for hours or days a light mist hung over the kanar river and a meadowlark nearby added his song to the growing chorus of birds singing from every tree and bush along the riverbank the morning air was still cool and smelled of river water with a faint addition of smoke sunlight touched the pounded earth that lately had held a small city made of tents and temporary booths then gilded the grey stone of the cathedral and cloister walls behind the area that had been home to the kingsford faire for the past several weeks nightingale didnt particularly admire the fortresslike cloister but examining it was better than looking across the river she kept her eyes purposefully averted from the ruins of kingsford on the opposite bank although she was still painfully aware of the devastation that ended only where the river itself began there was no avoiding the fact that kingsford as she had known it was no more that inescapable fact had lent a heaviness to her heart that was equally inescapable this had been a peculiar year for the annual kingsford faire with something like half of the city of kingsford itself in ruins and the rest heavily damaged by fire i am glad that i was not here but the suffering lingers perhaps other people could forget the suffering of those who had been robbed of homes livings and loved ones by that fire but nightingale couldnt not even with the wooden palisade surrounding the faire and row after row of tents between her and the wreckage on the other side of the river the pain called out to her even in the midst of each brightly dawning midsummer day it had permeated everything she did since she had arrived and crept into her dreams at night she would never have used the sight here even if she had needed toshe knew she would only see far too many unquiet ghosts with no means at her disposal to settle them she had dreams of the fire that had swept through the city last fall although she had no way of knowing if her dreams were a true vision of the past or only nightmares reflective of the stories she heard shed had one last night in fact a dream of waking to find herself surrounded by flames that reached for her with a lifelike hunger such a complete disaster as the fire could not be erased over the course of weeks or months even now with the fire a year past there were blackened chimneys and beams standing starkly in the midst of ashes and a taint of smoke still hung in the air the faire had been profitable for just about everyone who came this year herself included knowing that the folk of kingsford would be needing every possible article of daily living even so many months after the fire merchants had flocked to the fairesite across the river with their wagons piled high their packbeasts loaded to the groaning point they had prospered and they had been generous to those who came to entertain the bardic guild bane and scourge of the free bards for as long as that loosely organized group had existed had been remarkable for its reticence during the faire her polite encounters with guild bards had been odd enough that they still stuck in her mind time after time she had gotten a distant nod of acknowledgement from bard and guild hireling alike and not the harassment and insults of previous years one might have thought that the guild did not particularly want attention drawn to it she mused the guild simply held its auditions and performances quietly and gave no opposition to anything that the free bards did there were rumors never verified that the bardic guild had a hand in the burning of kingsford and that the church in the person of a justiciar mage and priest called ardis as a consequence had its eye on them nightingale discarded both rumors there was no reason to believe the former and the church and the guild had always operated handinglove in the past and it was unlikely that situation would change any time in the future never mind that ardis was reputedly the cousin of the head of the free bards talaysen also called master wren there was only so much a single priest could do and one could not change attitudes by fiat the meadowlark flitted off his yellow breast with the black v at his throat vivid in the morning sun well i endured nightmares sorrow hanging like a heavy mist over the faire and all it will take more than old sorrows and nightmares to keep me from my music nightingale had suffered too many lean seasons in her short life to allow personal discomfort to get in the way of her performances she was after all a professional however much the poseurs of the guild might deny that so she too had passed a profitable term at the faire and now at the close of it found herself prosperous enough to afford a donkey to carry her burdens for her for the first time in her life as a musician heretofore when she traveled she had been forced to rely on the kindness of fellow free bards or gypsies who would grant her a corner of their wagons to stow her goods in and while the company was welcome this arrangement forced her to depend on others and constrained her to whatever itinerary they chose and not one of her own choosing when given the option she preferred to avoid cities towns even larger villages altogether unfortunately such destinations were usually where her traveling companions preferred to go she closed her eyes and pressed her hands against her temples for a moment not because she had a headache but to remind herself to stay calm and bulwarked against the outside world she could not help but wish she had chosen not to come to the faire this year but to stay in one of the lands held by those who were not human or even pass a season or two in the halls of an elven king perilous as that was for mortals the faire had posed a trial for her ability to keep herself isolated from her own kind and more than once she had been tempted to give over her ambitions for a wider reputation as a musician and simply walk away but all that was in the past now there was a sweettempered little donkey tethered beside her his panniers loaded with her gear and her two harps strapped over the top of it all she had a tent as well if a small one and with the donkey she could carry provisions to see her through to better lodgings instead of being at the mercy of greedy or stingy innkeepers she was all packed up and ready to go and eager to be on the road and away from the allpervasive aura of tragedy that hovered over the city across the river only one thing kept her here an appointment that she had made last night and she wished he would just show up so that thank you for waiting my friend talaysens speaking voice was as pleasant as his singing voice and nightingale gratefully turned her back to the river and the churchs stronghold to catch his hands in hers in the traditional greeting between gypsies of the same clan talaysen smiled at her his greygreen eyes warming and gave her hands a firm squeeze before releasing them free bard talaysen looked prosperous too in his fine leather jerkin good linen trews and silk shirt with the knots of manycolored ribbons on the sleeves that denoted a free bard he did not owe his prosperity to the faire however talaysen shared the post of laurel bard to the king of birnam with his wife bard rune and his clothing reflected his importance they were the only free bards with any kind of position in all of the twenty kingdoms not that he has ever let rank go to his head nightingale reflected allowing his pleasure at seeing her to ease the distant ache of kingsfords sorrow within her he has made birnam a haven of freedom for all of us i would wait until the snow fell for your sake master wren she told him truthfully scanning his honest triangular face for signs of stress and his red hair for more strands of grey than there had been the last time she saw him she saw neither and felt nothing untoward from him which eased her worries a little he had been so adamant in asking her not to leave after the faire closedat least until he had a chance to speak with herthat she had been afraid there was something wrong with him personally they were old friends though only once briefly had they ever been lovers well it is lucky for us both that you wont have to do that he replied and his eye fell on her little donkey so the rumors of your prosperity were not exaggerated congratulations she raised her eyebrow at that for there was something more in his voice than simple pleasure in her good fortune there was some reason why he was particularly pleased that she had done well a reason that had nothing to do with friendship or his unofficial rank as head of the free bards this simplifies matters he continued i have a request to make of you but it would have been difficult if you had already arranged to travel with anyone else this winter a blackbird winged by trilling to find them standing in his territory so near to his nest her other eyebrow rose a request she said cautiously a certain sense of foreboding coming to her of what nature wren can charm birds out of the trees and honesty out of elves and id better remember that if hes asking favors of me it was mortally hard to refuse wren anything but i can hold my own with the elves it will take more than charm to win me talaysen sighed and shifted his weight from one foot to the other like a naughty little boy who had been caught in the midst of a prankwhich further hardened her suspicions there is something i would like for you to do for meor rather not for me but for the free bards unfortunately it will involve a rather longer journey than you normally make i expect it will take you from now until the first harvest faires to reach your goal even if you travel without stopping on the way she pulled in a quick breath with surprise from now until harvest faire she repeated incredulously where in the world do you want me to go lyonarie she had thrown out the name of the high kings capital quite by accident it being the farthest place from here that she could think of but the widening of his eyes showed her that her arrow had hit the mark out of all expectation a pocket of sudden stillness held them both and it seemed to her that the air grew faintly colder around her you want me to go to lyonarie she asked incredulously butwhy what possible business have the free bards there and of all people why me i am no court bard i know nothing of lyonarie and and i hate cities you know that she thought numbly and you know why because we need information not rumor because of all people you are the one i know that is most likely to learn what we need to know without getting yourself into trouble over itor inflaming half the city he nodded at the ruins of kingsford behind her and she winced there were also rumors that enemies of the free bards had set that fire and that it had gotten out of hand youre clever youre discreet and we both know that you are a master of bardic andother magics perhaps not a master she demurred and my talents are as much a hazard as a benefit but he wasnt about to be deflected i know i can trust you and that i can trust you to be sensible he continued those are traits this task will need as much as mastery of magic which is why you are not entrusting this to peregrine she asked you could trust him but he is not always sensible especially when he sees an injustice he does not do well in cities any more than you do talaysen pointed out and he wont abide in them unless he must under direct threat to himself or his clan and because i have a large sense of duty i will endure them if i must she thought with misgiving i had better have a very good reasonother than that wren wants me to however what could possibly be so pressing as to send me across half the twenty kingdoms she replied favoring him with a frown and there of all places peregrine may not like cities but neither do i and i have better reason than he to avoid them her frown deepened im not minded to risk another witchhunt because i seem to know a little too much for someones comfortor just because i am a gypsy not in lyonarie he began but she interrupted him so you say but no one had word of what was chancing in gradford until robin stirred the nest and the wasps came flying out to sting she retorted talaysen did not wince this time instead he looked ever more determined and i ask again what is so pressing as to send me there now talaysens changeable eyes grew troubled and the signs of stress that had not been there before appeared faintly etched into his brow and the corners of his generous mouth king rolend is concerned and as laurel bard and leader of the free bards he often asks me for my opinion high king theovere has beenneglectful now nightingale snorted this is hardly news his neglect has been growing since before lady lark joined us and so just what is it that i am supposed to do march up to the high king and charge him with neglecting his duty talaysen smiled faintly scarcely though i suspect you could and would do just that if it suited you no what rolend and i both want is the reason why theovere has become this way he wasnt always like thishe was a very good ruler and kept the power neatly balanced among the twenty kings the guilds and the church hes mature but not all that old and there has been no suggestion that he has become senile and he hasnt been illand besides his father lived thirty years more than he has already and he was vigorous and alert to the last she shook her head though rather than agreeing to take on talaysens little wildgoose hunt with no more prompting than that i wont promise she said as the dim sense of foreboding only increased with talaysens explanations i will think about it but i wont promise all i will say is that i will take my travels in the direction of lyonarie as master wrens face reflected his disappointment she hardened her heart i wont promise because i have no way of knowing if i can actually reach lyonarie she pointed out im afoot remember you and rune came here in a fine wagon with a pair of horses to pull you and the babytravel is harder when you walk not ride you ought to remember that a hundred things could delay me and i wont promise what i am not sure i can deliver but if you reach lyonarie talaysen persisted and she wondered at his insistence surely heand the king of birnamhad more and better sources of information than one lone gypsy if i decide to go that far and if i reach lyonarie any time before the next kingsford faire i will reconsider she said at last i will see what i can do more i wont promise he wasnt satisfied but he accepted that she saw it in his face you still havent answered the other question she continued suspiciously why choose me his answer was not one calculated to quell her growing unease nor warm the prickle of chill prescience that threaded her back much as i hate to admit this said talaysen wielder of bardic magics and friend to the high king of the elves i was warned that this situation was more hazardous than we knew and told to send you and only you in a dream three weeks from the day she had left talaysen beside the river nightingale guided her little donkey in among the sheltering branches of a black pine as twilight thickened and the crickets and frogs of early evening started up their songs black pines were often called shelterpines for their trunks were bare to a height of many feet and their huge heavy branches bent down to touch the ground around them like the sides of a tent the ground beneath those branches was bare except for a thick carpet of dead needles nightingale held a heavy resinscented branch aside with one hand while she led the donkey beneath it her hair was wet for she had bathed in a stream earlier that afternoon and the still cool darkness beneath the branches made her shiver it wasnt just the cool air or the dark that made her shiver not all the warm sunlight on the road nor the cheerful greetings of her fellow travelers had been able to ease the chill talaysens words had placed within her heart he was warned to send me to lyonarie in a dream she thought for the hundredth time that day as she unloaded her donkey and placed the panniers and wrapped bundles on the ground beside him what kind of a dreamand who else was in it wren can be the most maddening person in the world when it comes to magiche hates to use it and he hates to rely on it and most of all he is the last person to ever depend on a dream to set a course for him so why does he suddenly choose to follow the dictates of a dream now there had been a great deal that talaysen had not told her she knew that as well as she knew the fingerings of her harp or the lies of a faithless lover but he had simply shut his secrets inside himself when she tried to ask him more perhaps if she had agreed to his scheme he might have told heror perhaps not talaysen was good at keeping his own counsel she went outside the barren circle of needlestrewn ground within the arms of the black pine and found a patch of long sweet grass to pull up for the donkey she hadnt named him yet talaysen had driven all thoughts of such trivial matters out of her head infuriating man she hadnt even been able to enjoy the feeling of freedom that picking and choosing her own road had given her once the donkey had been fed and hobbled she made a sketchy camp in the gloom of dusk with the economy of someone who has performed such tasks too many times to count she scraped dead dry needles away from a patch of bare earth laid a tiny fire ready to light rigged a tripod out of green branches over it and hung her small kettle full of the sweet water she had drawn at the last stream from the apex of the tripod she took the tent and her bedding out of one of the panniers and dropped them both nearest to the trunk of the tree then she lit the fire and laid her bedding out atop the stillfolded tent her weathersense gave her no hint of a storm tonight so there was no point in putting the tent up and screenmesh was not needed since this wasnt the territory for bloodsuckers she preferred to sleep out under the open sky when she could she would sprinkle certain herbs over the smoldering remains of her fire to keep biting insects away as she slept sometimes the touch of the moon gave her dreams of her own and it would be useful for one such to come to her tonight the water in the kettle was soon boiling and she poured half of it over tea leaves in her mug she threw a handful of meal and dried berries into what remained porridge was a perfectly good dinner and she had feasted every night of the faire it would do her no harm to dine frugally tonight and there were honeycakes to break her fast on in the morning an indulgence she had not been able to resist when she passed through the last village this afternoon the moon rose serene as always its silver light filtered through the branches of the tree she sheltered beneath the donkey dozed standing hipshot with his head hanging the firelight flickering over him but not waking him somewhere in the further distance an owl called nightingale strained her ears for the notes of her namesake bird but there was no sweet sad song wafting on the warm air tonight it was the wrong season for a nightingale to be singing but she never drifted off to sleep without listening for one no matter where she was or what time of year it might be nearby crickets sang cheerfully enough that she didnt miss the absence of that song too much although it was very lonely out here abruptly a whistle joined the cricket chorus and nightingale sat bolt upright on her sleepingpad that was no nightbird song that was the first few bars of lonely road there was someone out theresomeone near enough to see the light of her tiny fire even through the masking branches might a friend come in to your fire bird of the night asked a voice out of the darkness it was a clear voice a silvery tenor a voice of a kind that a trained musician would recognize although she did not recognize who the speaker was it held that peculiar lack of passion that only elves projected an elf first master wren and now one of the elvenkin the chill that had threaded nightingales spine since her meeting with master wren deepened elves did not often call themselves the friend of a mortal not even a gypsy though nightingale could boast of such a distinction if she cared to she was very far from the hills and halls of those few of the elvenkin who normally called her friend any friend is welcome to share my fire she replied cautiously but an unfriend in the guise of a friend should be aware that the fierce horned owl is as much a bird of the night as the nightingale the voice replied with a hollow chuckle your reputation as a hunter in the dark also precedes you the branches parted with no hand to part them as if servants held two halves of a curtain apart and the speaker stepped through them as into a hall of state it was quite unmistakably one of the elven lords though the circlet of silver he wore betokened him a lord only and of no higher estate than that amber cateyes regarded her with a remote amusement from beneath a pair of upswept brows the unadorned circlet confined hair as golden as the true metal cut to fall precisely just below his shoulders his thin face pale as marble was as lovely as a statue carved of marble and quite as expressionless prominent cheekbones tapering chin and thin lips all combined to enhance the impression of nothuman the tips of his pointed ears peeking through the liquid fall of his hair only reinforced that impression he was illdressed for walking through a forest in the dead of night though that never seemed to bother the elvenkin much he wore black from his collar to the tips of his soft leather boots black velvet with a pattern of silver spiderwebs velvet as soft as a caress and fragile as the wings of a moth nightingale had worn cloth like that herself when she spent time beneath the hills call me a friend of a friend bird of the night the elven lord continued as the branches closed behind him without even snagging so much as a sleeve nightingale sighed the elves always made such a performance out of the simplest of thingsbut that was their nature and in token of this i have been asked to gift you with another such as the gift you already bear the maker of which sends his greetings he held out his hand and in it was a bracelet a slender ring of silver hardly thicker than a thread it had a liquid sheen that no other such metal hadit was the true elvenforged silver silver that no mortal could duplicate more valuable than gold she opened herself cautiously and touched it with a purely mental hand she did know that bracelet she wore its twin on her right wrist the maker could be trusted insofar as any elf could be trusted she relaxed just a trifle in the name of friendship then i accept the gift and welcome the bearer she replied holding out her hand the elf dropped the silver bracelet into her open palm without a word the bracelet writhed in a strange halfalive fashion and slipped across her palm and ringed itself onto her hand then moved over her hand and onto her wrist joining to the one already there as it did so she heard a strange wild melodybut only in her mind this was the music of magic true magic the magic that the gypsies the elves and some fewvery fewof the free bards shared if she had not already had this experience with the quasilife of elven silver more than once she would probably have been petrified with fearbut that first bracelet had been set on her wrist when she was scarcely more than a child and too inexperienced to be frightened she had not known then that elves could be as cruel as they were beautiful and that very few of them were worthy of trust by human standards for a moment a fleeting moment she felt very tired very much alone and a little frightened when she pulled her hand back to examine her wrist she could not tell where the first bracelet began and the second endedonly that the circle of silver on her wrist was now twice as wide as it had been she did not try to remove it she knew from past experience that it would not come off unless she sang it off the elven lord dropped bonelessly and gracefully down on the other side of her fire and caught her eyes in his amber gaze i come with a message as well as a gift he said abruptly with that lack of inflection that gave her no clue to his intentions the message is this the high king of the mortals serves his people ill the high king of those who dwell beneath the hills would know the reason why for when mortals are restless the hillfolk often suffer if nightingale can sing and learn her friends would be grateful the chill spread to nightingales heart and she shivered involuntarily at this echo of master wrens words first talaysen speaking for one king now an elven messenger speaking for anotherthis was so unreal that if someone had written it as a storysong she would have laughed at it as being too ridiculous to be believed why is this happening to me is there no further word from my friend she asked hoping for some kind of explanation but the elf shook his head his hair rippling with the movement no further word only the message have you an answer it wasnt a wise thing to anger the elves while their magic was strongest in their hills they could still reach out of their strongholds from time to time with powerful effect songs had been made about those times and few of them had happy endings ii dont know she said finally as silence grew between them punctuated by the chirps of crickets firelight flickered on his face to be caught and held in those eyes i am not certain i can send him an answer i am only one poor limited mortal but the elven lord smiled thinly you are more than you think mortal you have the gift of making friends in strange places this is why the high king asks this question of you why the runestones spelled out your name when he asked them why the mortals grew more troublesome with every passing month and who could remedy the wrongness nightingale grew colder still the elves lived outside time as humans knew it and as a consequence had a greater insight into past and future than humans did elven runestones were the medium through which they sought answers and if the runestones really had named her but i have only his word for that and the word of the one who sent him elves lie as readily as they speak the truth it is in their nature i will do what i can she said finally giving him a little more of a promise than she had given talaysen i cannot pledge what is not in my power to give the seat of the high king of the mortals is far from here and i am alone and afoot she waited for his response acutely aware of every breath of breeze every rustling leaf every cricket chirp he could choose to take offense that elves were unpredictable was a truism the elven messenger regarded her with one winglike eyebrow raised for a moment then grudgingly acknowledged that she had a point she breathed a little easier i will take him your answer he said as he nodded and rose fluidly to his feet before she had blinked twice the branches of the tree she sheltered beneath had parted once again and he was gone there was nothing else to do then but finish her porridge strip off her leather bodice and skirt and lie down in her bedding but although she was weary she stared up into the interlacing branches overhead listening to the crickets and the breeze in the boughs tense as an illstrung harp this was two wren and the elves gypsy lore held that when something came in a repetition of three it was magical a geas meant to bind a person to an unanticipated fate whether or not that person wanted it it was a long time before she was able to sleep she made better time than she had thought she would she had assumed she would be walking at the same pace unburdened as carrying her own packs but she found that she could make a mile or two more every day than she had anticipated with no difficulty whatsoever she reached the crossroads and the small town of highlevee three days sooner than she had expected to which only increased the tension she felt if she went south or north she would be traveling out of the kingdom of rayden and away from the road that would take her to lyonarie if however she traveled eastward she would soon strike the kings highway which led to lyonarie and there would be no turning back shed hoped to have more time to think the problem through though the height of summer was past the heat had not abated in the least the sun burned down on her with a power she felt even through her widebrimmed pale straw hat dust hung in the air as a haze undisturbed by even a hint of breeze the grasses of the verge were burned brown and lifeless and would remain that way until the rains of autumn she had kilted up her skirts to her knees and pushed her sleeves up over her elbows for coolness but she still felt the heat as heavy as a pack of weights on her back summer would linger in lyonarie long past the time when it would be gone hereor so she had heard at the moment that did not seem particularly pleasant as she led the donkey down the dusty main street of highlevee a little after noon she found herself dragging her feet in the dust as if by walking slower she could put off her decision longer it was with a decidedly sinking feeling that she spotted someone she knew sitting at a table outside the royal oak tavern just inside the bounds of the town it wasnt just any acquaintance either omens come in threes so do portents and so do the bindings of a geas set by fate and the lady if ever there was an omen this must surely be itfor there was no reason no reason at all for this man to be here at this time unless rather than a geas this is a conspiracy set up among my dear friends for sitting at his ease quite as if he belonged there was a man called leverance by those who knew him well the trouble was most of those who knew him well lived within the walls of the fabulous fortresscity that the deliambrens called home he should not have been here he should by all rights have been back there amid the wonders of deliambren technology as they called it few of the odd halfhuman folk ever left those comfortswhy should they there they had lighting that did not depend on candles as bright as the brightest sunlight on a dark winter night they had heat in the winter and cool in the summer and a thousand other comforts even the wealthiest human could only dream of he should not have been sitting calmly at a wooden table with a wooden mug in one hand nibbling at a meat pasty and watching the road his strange features shadowed by a wide hat of something that was not straw he should definitely not have been watching the road as if he was watching for her she knew that he was going to hail her as soon as she saw him the scene had that feeling of inevitability about it she thought about trying to ignore himbut what was the use if leverance was not the next person to request her to go to lyonarie someone else surely would be omen or conspiracy it seems that i am caught so she led her donkey toward him feeling weary to the bone and wondering if for once she might get a real answer to her question of why me after all the deliambrens didnt believe in portents and omens their faith was placed on machinery on curiosity on discovery on something they called science dont tell me she said before he could open his mouth even to greet her you want me to go to lyonarie to find out why the high king has been neglecting his duties deliambrens resembled humans for the most part far more than did say a mintak leverance wore ordinary enough human garb a jerkin trews and boots of leather and a shirt of what appeared to be silk she knew better than to assume that the garments were as ordinary as they seemed however for nothing about a deliambren was ever ordinary like all deliambrens the long pale hair growing along the line of his cheekbones was immaculately groomed and blended invisibly into the identical shoulderlength hair of his head his eyebrows were similar to those of an elf in the way they rose toward his temples but were thicker and as long as a mans thumb leverance fancied himself as something of an adventurer so his hair was simply cut off straight rather than being styled into some fantastic shape as many deliambrens sported nightingale sighed but only to herself knowing that leverance was certain he was blending in with his surroundings it would be quite impossible to convince him otherwise he stared at her with a flash of surprise quickly covered whyever do you say that he asked innocently too innocently because every other person i know seems to want me to go there she replied tartly and sat down on the wooden bench across from him the wood of the table was smooth and bleached to grey by sun and rain and another time she would have been quite pleased for a chance to sit here in the shade on such a broiling day she had lost what patience she had and decided it was time to show it you may order me something to eat and drink and you may pay for it if you are going to try to get me to go to lyonarie you might as well begin with a bribe she kept the tone of her voice tart to show him she was not going to tolerate any evasions no matter how clever both of leverances eyebrows twitched but he summoned the serving girl with a single lifted finger and placed an order for wine cheese and sausage pastries the serving girl dressed far more neatly than nightingale in her buff linen skirt bodice and white blouse glanced covertly at the gypsy her contemptuous expression saying all too clearly that she could not imagine why this exotic deliambren would be ordering luncheon for such a scruffy stranger and a gypsy to boot nightingale straightened abruptly gathering all her dignity about her then caught the girls glance and held it just long enough that the girl flushed then paled then hurried off now at least there would be no more covert looks and poorly veiled contempt i wish i knew how you did that leverance said with interest and admiration nightingale shrugged there was no explaining it to him he simply wouldnt understand why spending most of her time with elves and other nonhumans made nightingale seem strange and fey to those of her own kind most people if asked why they avoided her after one direct confrontation would stammer something about her expressionhow they were sure she saw things that normal folk couldnt and wouldnt want to well and i do but that is not why i unnerve them as long as the impression she left with them caused them to leave her alone she planned to cultivate the effect if she had reasons to be fonder of her own company and of nonhumans than of her own kind it was none of their business well leverance said when the girl returned with the food and vanished again with unseemly haste as it happens i was sent to find you and to ask you to go to lyonarie he laid the food out before her wine in a pottery bottle beaded with moisture a thick slice of cheese and crusty rolls beautifully brown pastries a small pottery firkin of butter she took her time selecting a roll and buttering it then pouring herself a cup of wine why she asked then amended her question no never mind why me she bit into the roll it might just as well have been straw for she could not taste it now i discover if this is simple mortal conspiracy or something i cannot escape leverance stroked the hair on his cheekbones thoughtfully several reasons actually although you are not the only person being asked to go there and you can refuse not the only person thats new or does he mean that it is only his people who are sending more than one person to gather their information she snorted delicately you still havent answered the question he held up a finger you are very observant and yet you are very adept at making yourself unobserved he held up a second finger you have served as a willing collector of information for your people for the elves and for mine in the past a third finger joined the other two for some reason that my people are unable to fathom things happen around you and you are able to influence things through no medium that we recognize and which other people refer to as magic we dont believe in magic but we do believe you have some kind of power that acts in a way we cant measure we think that will help keep you safe and sane where other investigators have failed other investigators this was the first time nightingale had heard about othersand the chill now filled her body soul and heart she put down the roll all appetite gone the still hot air could not reach that chill to warm her how failed she asked in a small voice he correctly interpreted her frozen expression nothing seriousno one died for hadrons sake they were just found out somehow and they were discredited in ways that forced them to leave the city we think we failed by choosing someone too high in rank you know how to extract information of all kindsharperus says that you have the ability to sieve gold out of the gutters that is why you he scratched his head then added besides the roads north and south of here are closed north the bridge is out and south sire yori has put up a roadblock and hes taking all beasts of burden as armytaxes you could only go on to the kings highway or retrace your steps nightingale flushed and mentally levied a few choice gypsy curses on the deliambren for choosing the precise words guaranteed to make her go on gypsy lore held that to retrace ones steps was to unmake part of ones lifeand you had better be very sure that was something you wanted and needed to do before you tried it leverance blinked benignly at her as she muttered imprecations just as if he didnt know the implications of his words well he asked can you go will you help signs and portents omens and forebodings i do not want to go but it seems i have no choice but she was not going to tell him that for one thing if they had sent others on this path others who had been found out that argued for someone knowing in advance that they had been sent she trusted those deliambrens that she personally knew but within very strict limitsjust as she trusted within limits those elves she knew but there were gypsies that she would not trust so why should every elf every deliambren or even every free bard be entirely trustworthy talaysen probably didnt know about the others the elves might not have thought it worth stooping to ask help of mere mortals until now only the deliambrens know the whole of this but if there was someone acting as an informant against their agents there is no reason why it could not have been an elf a deliambren or even one of us everyone has a price it is only that most honest folk have prices that could never be met i will think about it she temporized giving him the same answer she had given master wren my road goes in that direction i cannot promise that i will end up there if there is an informant damned if i will give you the assurance that i will be the next one to play victim it is too easy for a lone woman gypsy or no to simply disappear she smiled sweetly and ate a bite of tasteless roll as if she had not a care in the world i am alone and afoot and who knows what could happen between here and there i make no promises i cannot keep leverance made a sour face youll think about it though he persisted at least keep the option open she frowned she really did not want to give him even that much butshe had a certain debt to his people did i not say that i would leverance only shrugged you hedge your promises as carefully as if you were dealing with elves he told her sourly as she packed up the rest of the uneaten lunch in a napkin to take with her dont you know by now that you can trust us the suns heat faded again although no clouds passed before it and she took in a sharp breath as she steadied herself looking down at the rough wood of the table grey and lifeless unlike the silver of her bracelet trust them he wants me to trust them the elves want me to trust them and talaysen damn his eyes trusts me there is too much asking and giving of trust in this her right hand clenched on the knot of the napkin her left made a sign against illwishing hidden in her lap i only pay heed to what my own eyes and ears tell me she said lightly forcing herself to ignore her chill you should know that by now since it is probably one of the other reasons why you picked me thank you for the meal she rose from the bench and untied her donkey from the handrail beside the road without a backward glance for him are you sure you wont leverance began plaintively now she leveled a severe look at him one that even he could read i gave you what i could promise deliambren a nightingale cannot sing in a cage or tethered by a foot to a perch you would do well to remember that and with that she led her donkey back out into the road it was after all a long way to lyonarie and the road wasnt growing any shorter while she sat she only wished that she could feel happier about going there chapter two from the vantage of a low hill at the top of the last crest of the kings highway lyonarie was a city guaranteed to make a person feel very small entirely insignificant that was nightingales first impression of the metropolis anyway there was no end to it from where she stood seated in the midst of a wide valley it sprawled across the entire valley and more it did not look inviting to her like something carved of old grey sunbleached wood or built out of dry ancient bones it seemed lifeless from here and stifling in a way she wished that she could feel the same excitement that was reflected in the faces of the travelers walking beside her instead her spirit was heavy she hunched her shoulders against the blow to her heart coming from that grey blotch and she wanted only to be away from the place heathaze danced and shimmered making distant buildings ripple unsettlingly as she approached one small traveler in a stream of hundreds of others she had the strangest feeling that they were not going to the city it was calling them in and devouring them it devours everything life dreams hope the great hulking citybeast was unlike any other major population center she had ever been in there were no walls at least not around the entire city though there were suggestions of walled enclaves in the middle distance that was not unusual in itself many cities spilled beyond their original walls it would have been very difficult to maintain such walls in any kind of state of repair much less to man them the city simply was it existed just as any living growing thing existed imbued with a fierce life of its own that required it to swallow anyone that entered and make him part of it never to escape again was this the reason why i felt such foreboding that was reason enough for someone of nightingales nature the possibility of losing her own identity of being literally devoured was always a real danger it was not just the heat that made her feel faint thousands of silent voices dunning into my mindthousands of people needing a little piece of methousands of hearts crying out for the healing i have i could be lost in no time at all here she would have to guard herself every moment waking and sleeping against that danger she took off her hat and wiped her forehead with her kerchief wishing that she had never heard of lyonarie the shaggy brown donkey walked beside her his tiny hooves clicking on the hard roadbed with no signs that the heavy traffic on the road bothered him traffic traveled away from the city as well as toward it righthand side going in lefthand side leaving with heavy vehicles taking the center ridden horses and other beasts coming next and foot traffic walking along the shoulder the road was so hard that nightingales feet ached especially in the arches and her boots felt much too tight shed had a general description of the city last night from the innkeeper at the tavern shed stayed in from this direction the kings highway first brought a traveler through what was always the most crowded noisy and dirty section of any city the quarter reserved for trade oh i am quite looking forward to that stench heat and angry people what a lovely combination about six or seven leagues from the city itself the road had changed from hardpacked gravel to black cracked pavement a change that had given both nightingale and her beast relief from the dust but which gave no kind of cushioning for the feet she knew by the set of the donkeys ears that his feet hurt him too this greyblack stuff was worse than a dirt road for heat on top of that waves of heat radiated up from the pavement and both she and the donkey were damp with sweat i do wish id worn something other than this heavy linen skirtand i wish id left off the leather bodice i should have chosen a lighter set of colors than darkgreen and black this is too much to suffer in the name of looking respectable i think i could bake bread under this skirt she dared not kilt it up either not and still look like an honest musician and not a lady whose virtue was negotiable the road up the valley toward lyonarie led across flat fields every inch cultivated and growing a variety of crops until suddenly with no warning the fields were gone and buildings on small plots of land had taken their place as if they had grown there as well like some unsavory fungus these were small mean houses a short step up from the hovels of the very poor crowded so closely together that a rat could not have passed between them made of wood with an occasional facing of brick or stonework they were all a uniform grimy grey patched with anything that came to hand and the few plants that had been encouraged to take root in the excuses for yards had to struggle to stay alive under the trampling feet of those forced off the roadway by more important or more massive traffic the sight made her sick how can anyone live like this why would anyone want to what could possibly tempt anyone to stay here who didnt have to no amount of money would be worth living without trees grass space to breathe the houses gave way just as abruptly a few moments later to warehouses two and three stories tall and this was where the true city began those who ruled the city now showed their authority a token gate across the road a mere board painted in red and white stripes was manned by a token guard in a stiff brown uniform he paid no attention to her whatsoever as she passed beneath the bar of the gate his attention was for anyone who brought more into the city than his own personal belongings those who drove carts waved a stiff piece of blue paper at him as they passedor if they didnt have that piece of paper pulled their wagons over to a paved area at the side of the road where one of a halfdozen clerks would march upon them with a grimly determined frown no one cared about a single gypsy with a donkey assuming they recognized her as a gypsy at all she passed close by the guard fanning herself with her hat in her free hand as he lounged against the gatepost picking his teeth with a splinter she was near enough to smell the onions he had eaten for lunch and the beer he had washed them down with and to see the bored indifference in his eyes she was just one of a hundred people much like her who would pass this man today and she knew it there was virtue and safety in anonymity right now and suddenly she was glad of the sober colors of her clothing better to bake than to be memorable how could i have forgotten i wanted to be sure that no one would remember me there might be someone waiting and watching to see if i show up it must be the heat or all this emotionbabble but the press of minds around her was a more oppressive burden than the heat this was why she hated cities and lyonarie was everything she disliked most about a city but constructed on a more massive scale than anything she had previously encountered there were too many people here all packed too closely together all of them unconsciously suffering the effects of being so crowded most of them were unhappy and had no idea how to remedy their conditionother than pursuing wealth which brought its own set of problems whether the pursuit succeeded or failed their strident emotions scratched at her nerves no matter how well she warded them out never mind that im here so now i need a plan however sketchy she hadnt actually formulated a plan until now shed been hoping perhaps for some unavoidable reason not to go on to lyonarie geas or fateor nothere she was and it was time to make some kind of a plan something simple the simpler the less likely it will be that ill have to change it once past the guard nightingale pulled the donkey off to the side of the road taking a moment to stand in the shade of one of the warehouses she fanned herself with her hat pretended to watch the traffic and considered her next move on this little gameboard it is a game tooand i can only hope ive made myself less of a pawn than i would have been if id jumped into it without care and thought people streamed by her as she stood on the baking pavement with her patient little beast as she watched she saw everything from farmers hauling wagonloads of cabbage to the carriages of prosperous merchantsfrom footsore travelers like herself to the occasional creature more alien than a deliambren they all apparently had places to go and they were all in a dreadful hurry to get there they paid no attention to her their eyes were on the road and the traffic ahead of them the buildings on either side of the road trapped the rays of the sun the pavement beneath absorbed the heat and radiated it up again sweat ran down her face and back and not even the most vigorous fanning helped cool her even a little she licked her lips and tasted salt wishing for the cooler clothing shed worn at kingsford fairethe light skirt made of hundreds of multicolored ribbons sewn together from knee to waist but left to flutter from knee to ankle the wide laced belt of doeskin the shirt of fabric just this side of seethrough and the sandals the leather of her bodice and boots was hot stifling hot the soles of her boots were far too thin to cushion her feet in any way or deflect the heat of the pavement what she really wanted right now was a cool place to sit a cool drink and a moment in semidarkness to build up her mental defenses well the sooner i join in this game the sooner i can leave if im both lucky and clever i might even be able to get out of here before winter at least i didnt lose any time on the road in fact she had made such good time getting here that it was not quite harvest faire season she had met with no obstacles and her earlier good start had been typical of the whole journey shed been able to stop before dark every night and hadnt even been forced to spend much of her hardearned faire money in fact her purse was now a bit heavier than it had been when she had left kingsford she had made such good time that it had been possible to trade performances in the kind of small country inns she preferred in return for food a bed and whatever came into her hat if she had just been making her rounds of the fairecircuit she would have been pleased but not particularly surprised by this she was a good harpist a fine musician and there was no reason why innkeepers should turn her away her hat usually had a few coppers in it at the end of the night no matter how poor the audience but the very smoothness of her travel had made her suspicious or rather apprehensive it felt as if someone or something was making quite sure she would get to lyonarie and seeing to it that she would be ready for just about anything when she arrived there a geas the hand of god or the gypsys lady of the night or just a string of unprecedented good luck and did it matter not really what did matter was coming up with a course of immediate action that would keep her inconspicuous if i were truly in the service of any of my soneedful friends what would i do first she asked herself the answer seemed obvious find a tavern or an inn at the heart of the city and take up lodging there if she was expected to gather information that would be all that she would do there would be no time for anything like taking on a regular job as a musician and that would make her conspicuoussomeone who carried musical instruments yet did not try to find a position someone who spent money but did nothing to earn more it would be logical to devote all of her time and energy into collecting information but it would not be wise so since that is what is predictable and logical it is what i will not do she considered her options further as she also pondered the question of highking theovere the two were inextricably linked how to gain information on the high and exalted without venturing out of her persona as low and insignificant at least now that she wasnt moving she didnt seem to be quite as warm as talaysen had pointed out the king should have been overseeing the business of his twenty vassalsbut they had been left more and more at loose ends without a guide or an overseer as often as not though the king of birnam was an exception they had been making use of this laxness to enrich themselves or simply to amuse themselves the king of birnam thought more of his people and their lands than himself he was a good ruler and as a result his kingdom prospered in good times and survived the bad in reasonable shape but those lands whose rulers were not out of rolends mold were showing all the signs of a careless hand on the reins the signs were everywhere and touching everything in rayden for instance there was little or no upkeep on the public roads bridges were out roads were rutted and full of potholes signs were missing or illegible in some remoter parts of rayden and in other lands the neglect was far more serious as rivalry between sires and even dukes had been permitted to escalate into armed feuding the high king was supposed to represent the central unifying power in the twenty kingdoms now the church was well on the way to taking over that function as if her thought of the church had summoned a further reminder of its power the tolling of bells rang out over the rumble of cart wheels on pavement and the babble of thousands of voices nightingale lifted her eyes from the road to see the spire of the chapel housing those bells rising above the warehouse roofs and that represented another interest in the dance there were perhaps hundreds of chapels in lyonarie ranging in size from a single room to huge cathedrals the church was an allpervasive presence here and there was no way to escape it the church might also have an interest in keeping theovere weak and ineffectual she swallowed in sour distaste there was no love lost between herself and most representatives of the church too often of late she had been the subject of attempts by churchmen to lay the blame for perfectly ordinary accidents at her door because she was a gypsy a free bard and presumably a wielder of arcane and darksome powers in some places at least it seemed that the church was trying to incite people against gypsies nonconformists nonhumansindeed against anything that did not obviously and directly benefit the church itself as much as a flock of sheep would benefit the herdsman well one advantage of being in a large city was that there were too many people for the church to play at the kinds of games some churchmen were able to foment in less populous places it was harder to find an individual to use as a target and a scapegoatharder to incite people against a stranger in a town when so many people were strangers and in fact people living on the same street might not even know or recognize each other still it behooved her to find a venue that was not too near a chapel if she could not near the prosperous either they have the leisure to notice things all things considered although this was probably the worst part of town this district would be a good one to try to find a tavern that might have need of a musician another good thing about a city this largenot all the guild bards in the world could take all the positions available here really most of them are going to be positions no guild bard in his right mind would ever want now that she had gotten her mind moving and had managed a little rest she felt ready to rejoin the mob she pulled the donkey into the stream of traffic again and scanned the fronts of the buildings she passed for tavern signs ill look for information from two sources she decided as she walked letting the traffic carry her along rather than trying to force a faster pace once i get established ill build myself a little army of streetchildren and pay them to go listen for me no one ever pays attention to them and they can get into the most amazing places this would not be the first time she had built herself such a network children were never regarded as threatening by adults but streetbrats were wise beyond their years and knew how to listen for anything that might be of value the nice thing about children was that they tended to stay loyal to the person who hired them they might be wise beyond their years but they lacked the experience that taught them doubledealing children still believed in their heart of hearts in playing fair servants tootheyre the other invisibles ill show up at the kitchen doors clean but very shabby ill ask to play in return for food the courts of kings might boast the cream of entertainers but the servants never saw it and any chance for a little entertainment of their own usually was snatched at kitchen gossip often reflected the doings of the great and powerful long before many of their masters knew about it so long as she pretended not to notice she would probably get an earful raven never did learn that lesson silly boy he would always start asking questions rather than letting servants babble to each other she would be just as invisible as a servant or a street urchin just another common tavernmusician there werent many free bards who traveled all the way to lyonarie it was a long way from rayden where the group first came to be organized and free bards had their routines like anyone else likely no one would even recognize the knot of multicolored ribbons on her sleeves as anything other than decoration even if they did know her for what she was well the guild had made it difficult for a free bard to work in rayden and the church had done the same in gradford so it made sense for someone to come this far afield for work i look like a gypsy and there is no disguising that but that might work for me rather than against me people like things that are a bit exotic it gives them a taste of places theyll never see a kind of life theyll never lead gypsies didnt like cities much which also might mean she would not be recognized as one ah well it was always a case of playing odds being a gypsy and if she was recognized and it caused her troublewell she would deal with that when she saw what cards were in her hand the donkey suddenly gave a frightened bray and reared back against the leadrope trying to dig all four hooves into the pavement the rope scraped her palm and she tightened her grip automatically as she looked around for what danger might have alarmed himbut a sudden whiff of powerful odor told her that he had simply reacted to another aspect of a city that she hated there was no mistaking that charnel reek as it wafted into her face blood and feces urine and fear she put her hat back on her head and soothed him with her free hand as she continued to pull his lead gently but firmly until he started walking again his eyes rolled but he obeyed her she couldnt blame him for balking shed have done the same in his place he might even have scented a relative in that reek or rather an exrelative the warehouses gave place to something else and now she knew why she had seen so many carts laden with smaller beasts on this road this was the district of slaughterhouses and all that depended on them she held the donkeys halter firmly under his chin as he fought to escape shivered and rolled his eyes there wasnt anywhere he could go and the press of traffic on all sides was enough to keep him moving nightingale wished she had taken thought to cover her mouth and nose with a neckcloth as so many around her were doingshe needed both hands to control the donkey and her kerchief was in her pocket the reek of the slaughterhouses and holding pens was not all that came drifting by on the breeze there were other equally unsavory smellsthe stench of the leatherworkers vats the effluvium of the gluemakers pots the pong of garbage and dungcollectors heaps fortunately there was something of a real current of moving air here and it ran crossways to the road as soon as they were out of the immediate area the worst of the smell faded diluted by distance but now the slaughterhouse odor gave way to new odors or rather older ones nightingale winced and tried to barricade herself against a stench that was both physical and mental her stomach heaved and she tasted bile in the back of her throat mighty god even animals wouldnt live like this even flies wouldnt live like this and why does the church allow this there is a question for you only the poorest would live here so near the slaughterhouses and the dreadful stench the flies and the diseaseand the tenement houses lining the road bore ample testament to the poverty both monetary and spiritual of those living within the houses themselves leaned against each other dilapidated constructions that a good wind would surely send tumbling to the street drunken men and women both wrapped in so many layers of rags and dirt it was hard to tell what sex they were lay in the alleys and leaned against the houses filthy children crowded the front stoops big bellies scarcely covered by the rags they wore scrawny limbs showing that those bellies were the sign of malnourishment and not of overeating they too lay about listlessly on the steps or sat and watched the passing traffic too tired from lack of food to play the scream of hungry babies joined the sound of commerce on the road nightingale resolutely closed her ears to other sounds of quarrels and blows of weeping and hopelessness this was new poverty was always part of a city but never starvation not like this it was one more evidence of king theoveres neglect even here in the heart of his own land and city i cant do anything about thisat least i cant do more than im already planning to do i can recruit some of my children from thesei can feed as many as my purse will permit she salved her conscience with that there was too much here for even every gypsy of every clan to correct she sighed with relief as more and sturdier buildings took the place of the tenements more warehouses mills for cloth flour and lumberand something that nightingale had never seen at firsthand among humans before although she was familiar enough with the deliambren version which they called manufactories here in enormous buildings people made thingsbut not in the way they were accustomed to make them in villages and towns elsewhere people made things together each person performed a single task in the many stages of building something then passed the object on to the next person who performed another task and so on until the object was completed every example was like every other example every chair looked like every other chair for instance and every pair of trews like every other pair of trewsthe system worked very well for the deliambrens but nightingale was of two minds about it it did mean madegoods were much cheaper no one needed to be an expert in everything and almost anyone could afford wellmade trews or chairs or teamugs but it felt like there was no heart in such goods and nothing to show that a teamug was special ah what do i know i am a crafter of music not of mugsand i am sure there is still a demand for trews and chairs and mugs made by individuals the system did the deliambrens no harm they took as much pleasure in life and crafting as any other being still i would not like to work in such a place but that does not mean that other folk would feel the same stop making judgments for others nightingale the donkey relaxed as they entered this district she let go her tight hold on his leadrope and let him have his head again the shape of this area was determined by the river that ran through it there was scarcely a bit of bank that did not have a mill wheel on it to make use of the swiftlyflowing current the buildings here were oldand nightingale suspected that few of the people traveling beside her had any idea how very old they were the mill wheels and millraces were recent additions to buildings that had been standing beside this river since before the cataclysm the buildings were not pretty they were simple brute boxes with square windowholes where there might once have been glass now they were covered with whatever might let in light and exclude weather glass in some places oiled paper or sheets of parchment in others but mostly sheets of white opaque stuff the deliambrens used for packing crates and padding the base color of these dull boxes was an equally dull grey where in the past people had tried to apply paint either to cover the entire building or as crude advertisements the paint remained only in patches as if the buildings had some kind of scabrous disease but the irony was that these places were solid still they had stood for centuries and likely would stand for centuries more nightingale had been inside the deliambren fortresscity she had seen buildings like these being erected one actually poured the walls using wood to make the molds to give the walls their form as if they were huge ceramics once the grey stuff set it was stronger than granite and less likely to age due to weathering so the irony lost to those beside the gypsy was that these buildings which seemed relatively new were actually much much older than the tenements that had been falling down the road crossed the river on a bridge that also dated back to the cataclysm nightingale privately doubted that anyone could bridge the lyon river in these daysexcept perhaps deliambrens it was a narrow and fierce stream with a current so swift and deep that to swim the lyon was a common euphemism for suicide for a moment there was relief from the heat the waters of the lyon were as cold as they were swift and a second river flowed above ita river of fresh cool air nightingale moved as slowly on the bridge as she could stretching out her moment of relief on the other side the manufactories gave way again to housing but fortunately for nightingales peace of mind the people here lived in better conditions than those near the slaughterhouses there were more of those precataclysm buildings in fact given over to living quarters rather than manufactories these had more windows and from the look of things the ceilings were not as high granting more levels in the same amount of space in between these older buildings newer ones rose not quite as dilapidated as the tenements on the other side of the river but by no means in excellent repair these newer buildings huddled around the old as if for support as if without those grey bulwarks they could not stand against wind and weather nightingale tried to imagine what this area might have looked like before the wooden tenements were built but had to give up she just could not picture it in her mind why would people have put so much open space between the buildings then build the buildings so very tall wouldnt it have made more sense to lay everything out flat the way a small village was built that way everyone could have his own separate dwelling and one would not be forced to hear ones neighbors through walls that were never thick enough for privacy ask anyone who has ever spent the night in an inn with newlyweds in the next room well there was no telling what the ancestors had been thinking their world was as alien to the twenty kingdoms now as that of any of the nonhumans nightingale certainly was not going to try to secondguess them however this area would be a good one in which to start her search however much she disliked the crowding she could hide herself better in a crowd than in more exclusive surroundings at the first sign of a tiny cross street she pulled the donkey out of the stream of traffic and into the valley between two buildings looking for a child of about nine or ten one who was not playing with others but clearly looking for someone for whom he could run an errand such a child would know where every inn and tavern was in his neighborhood and would probably know which ones needed an entertainer and people think that children know nothing nightingale kept her back quite stiff with indignation as she pulled her donkey away from the door of the muleteer her guidea girlchild with dirty hair that might have been blond if one could hold her under a stream of water long enough to find outsighed with vexation it was an unconscious imitation of nightingales own sigh and was close enough to bring a reluctant smile to the gypsys lips honest mum if ida thunk he was gonna ast ye pony up moren music ida not hev brung ye here the girl said apologetically nightingale patted the girl on one thin shoulder and resolved to add the remains of her travelrations to the childs copper penny you couldnt have known she told the little girl who only shook her head stubbornly and led nightingale to a little alcove holding only a door that had been bricked up ages ago there they paused out of the traffic while the girl bit her lip and knitted her brows in thought ye set me a job mum an i hevnt done it the child replied and nightingale added another mental noteto make this girl the first of her recruits her thin face hardened with businesslike determination ill find ye a place i swear jestwas it only wee inns an taverns ye wanted something about the wistful hope in the girls eyes made nightingale wonder if she had phrased her own request poorly i thought that only small inns or taverns would want a singer like me she told the girl im not a guild musician and the harp isnt a very loud instrument so ye don mind playin where theres others playin too the girl persisted ye don mind sharin th take an th audience an all well that was an interesting question she shook her head and waited to reply until after a rickety cart passed by not at all im used to sharing all of us do at faires for instance a huge smile crossed the childs face showing a gap where her two front teeth were missing i thunk ye didn like other players mum so i bin takin ye places where they aint got but one place oh i got a tavernplace thats like a faire tis an they don take to no guildsmen neither ye foller me mum an see if ye don like this place the child scampered off in the opposite direction in which they had been going and nightingale hauled the donkey along in her wake the girl all but skipped she was so pleased to have thought of this tavernplace whatever it was and her enthusiasm was quite infectious nightingale found herself hoping that this would be a suitable venue and not just because her feet hurt she was wilting with the heat and her shoulders ached from hauling the increasingly tired and stubborn donkey she also wanted to be able to reward this child and not have to thread her way out of the neighborhood the little girl knew and hunt up a new guide the streets were all in shadow now although the heat hadnt abated much longer and it would be twilight she would have to find at least a safe place to spend the night then it wasnt wise for a stranger to be out in a neighborhood like this one after dark in a smaller city she wouldnt have worried so much but she had heard of the gangs who haunted the back streets of lyonarie by night she was a tough fighter but she couldnt take on a dozen men with knives and clubs the child turned to make certain that she was still following and waved at her to hurry nightingale wished powerfully then for that rapport with animals that peregrine and lark seemed to share if only she could convince the donkey that it was in his best interest to pick up his feet a little but he was just as tired as she was and surely he was far more confused hed never been inside a city at all much less had to cope with this kind of foottraffic poor thing the child slipped back to her side moving like an eel in the crowd tisnt but three streets up mum just tother side uv where ye met me she said looking up into nightingales face anxiously oh i swan yell like the place i hope so the gypsy replied honestly i can promise you at least i wont dislike it as much as i did the last the little girl giggled la mum yere furrin an the freehold its got more furriners than i ken got mintaks got larads got kentars got a couple a ospers even half the folk come there be furrin too now that certainly made nightingale stand up a bit straighten why all the she sought for a polite word for the nonhumans why they got all the fuzzballs the child asked innocently well cause other places they don like fuzzballs they don like furriners they even looks at ye down the nose if ye got yeller skin or sompin not freehold no they figger fuzzball money spends as good nor bettern a churcher i like freehold ida taken ye there fust but i thunk ye wanted a place where ye wouldnah where i wouldnt have any competition nightingale replied laughing at the childs chagrin oh my girl i promise you i am sure enough of my own songs that i dont have anything to fear from other musicians the child grinned her gaptoothed grin again and shrugged yell see she only said yell see if i be takin ye wrong freeholdits a fine place looktis right there crost the street but the building the girl pointed to was not what nightingale expected the gypsy blinked wondering if the child was afflicted with some sort of mental disorder this wasnt a tavern or an inn buildingit was a warehouse it was one of the old precataclysm buildings four tall stories high with a flat roof and black metal stairs running up the side of it from the second story to the rooftop and more black metal bridges linking it and the buildings nearest it from roof to roof she narrowed her eyes and tried to see if someone had partitioned off a little corner of it at ground level as a tavern but there was no sign of any partitioning whatsoever whoever owned this building owned the whole thing set into the blank face of the wall was a huge sliding door and a smaller entrydoor was inset in it this was a warehouse but there was a sign above the entry door and the sign did say the freehold the child scampered on ahead and pounded enthusiastically at the door it opened and she spoke quickly to someone nightingale couldnt see by the time she managed to coax her willfully lagging donkey to the doorway whoever had been there was gone and the child was dancing from one foot to the other with impatience hes gone t git the boss the child told her ye wait here wit me an the bossll be here in a short bit nightingale looked up at the sign above her head just to be sure it did say the freehold that much hadnt changed but how could anyone ever make any kind of profit running a tavern in a place this size the cost of fuel and candles alone would eat up all the profits she tried to make a quick estimate of just how much it would cost to heat this huge cavern of a place in the winter just as she came to the conclusion that she didnt have the head for such a complicated calculation the boss appeared in the door a human of middle years average in every way from his hair to his clothing looked her up and down in surprise you are a gypsy arent you he said before she could say anything to him and a free bard she nodded cautiously but he only smiled showing the same gap at the front of his teeth that the child boasted well in that case we might be able to do some business will you enter what about the beast she asked dubiously keeping a tight hold on the donkeys halter she was not about to leave him outside not in this neighborhood bring him in theres a stable just inside the door the man replied readily enough if you have a big enough building you can do anything you want really and the owner thought it would be nice if people didnt have to go out into the weather to get their ridingbeasts oh that was all she could say really it was all anyone could say who would have thought of having a stable inside your tavern trust a deliambren to think of something like that the man continued as an afterthought hes almost never here of course but hes always coming up with clever notions for the place and the hearthgods know a deliambren has the means to make anything work ah now it makes sense and now it made sense for a tavern to be situated in a warehouse for only a deliambren would have the means to heat the placeyes and probably cool it in the summer as wellwithout going bankrupt she turned to the girl and held out the promised penny and with the other hand fumbled the bag of travel food off the back of the packs here take this too she said holding it out as soon as the child accepted her penny with unconcealed glee and greed can i find you in the same place if i need a guide again the child accepted the bag without asking what was in ithardly surprising since almost anything she was given would be worth something to her even the bag itself she clutched the bag to her chest and nodded vigorously yes mum ye jest ast fer maddy an if i aint there i be there soon as i hear she grinned again shyly this time i tol ye that yed like this place mum didn i jest you did and i dont forget people who are clever enough to guess what id like maddy nightingale told her thank you before she could say anything more the child bobbed an awkward curtsey and disappeared into the crowd the boss of the tavern was still waiting patiently for her to conclude her business with maddy dont you think you ought to look us over and see what we can offer before you make a decision the man asked her although his amused expression and his feelings as loud as a shout told her he was certain she would want to stay here this was quite unlike the proprietor of the muleteer whose feelings of lust had run over her body like a pair of oily hands she simply raised an eyebrow he chuckled and waved her inside the doorway opened into a roomor more correctly an anteroompaved like the street outside furnished with a few wooden benches with a corridor going off to the right a mintak boy appeared in the entrance at the sound of the donkeys hooves on the pavement nightingale had seen many mintaks in the course of her travels but never a youngster like all the others she had seen this boy wore only a pair of breeches and an open vest his hide exactly like a horses was a fine glossy brown his head was shaped something like a cross between a horse and a dog but the eyes were set to the front so that he could see forward out of both of them like a human instead of only one at a time like a horse he had a ridge of hairagain much like a horses manethat began between his ears and traveled down his neck presumably to end between his shoulderblades unlike the adults who were muscular enough to give any five men pause this boy was thin gawky awkward exactly like a young colt although he had threefingered hands that were otherwise identical to a humans with nails that were much thicker and black his feet presumably ended in hooves for nightingale heard them clopping on the pavement this lady is a musician and shell be joining us kovey the man said take her little beast and he turned back to nightingale i assume that room and board will be part of the arrangement thats the usual she replied shortly unable to be anything but amused herself at the way he had decided that she was going to stay right then have her things taken up to the gallery and put em in the first empty room then leave word at the desk which it is the mintak boy nodded his hairy head and trotted over to them extending his hand for the donkeys leadrope the donkey stepped up to him eagerly as nightingale put the rope into his large square hands he smiled shyly showing the blunt teeth of a true herbivore interesting if i did not have the abilities i do i would be very suspicious at this point they have parted me from my transportation and my belongings and gotten me inside a building with no clear escape route do they assume that i am naive or do they assume that as a gypsy i do have other senses at my command it could be either her clothing marked her as country folk it could be presumed that she was not familiar with the ways of cities and the hazards therein on the other hand the man had not only recognized her as a gypsy but as a free bard boy and donkey trotted off down the corridor and nightingales escort ushered her past the second doorway and into the tavern proper the man waited for her reaction but she was not the country cousin she looked and she didnt give him the gasp of surprise that he had expected she had assumed that the tavern took up a good portion of the building as estimated from outside and she had not been mistaken maddy had not been mistaken in comparing this place to a faire the main portion of the tavernshe couldnt think of a better name for ithad a ceiling that was quite three stories above the rest and pierced with the most amazing skylights she had ever seen they were not clear but made with colored glass exactly like the windows in the larger cathedrals below the skylights hung contrivances that nightingale guessed were probably lights beneath these skylights was an open floor all of wood with a raised platform at one end and with benches around it exactly like a dance floor and stage at a faire except that at a faire the dancingarea would be floored in dirt this took up approximately half the floor space the restwell it looked very much as if someone had taken all of the entertainment and eating places at a really huge faire and proceeded to stack them inside this building all around the walls from the ground floor to the ceiling there were alcoves for eating and drinking many with comfortable seating and a small stage for one to three performers many of the alcoves had recognizable bars in the back some had doors that could be slid across the front cutting them off from the main room some boasted braziers and what might be odd cooking implements as well some had nothing at all but the seating not that this place was as elegant as the skylights indicated in fact the opposite was true the building showed its heritage quite clearly walls and the ceiling were roughly finished huge metal beams were exposed and ropes and wires hung everywhere still it was a monumental undertaking putting this place together at all and nightingale rather liked the unfinished atmosphere that was the differenceoutside things looked unkempt in here they looked unfinished out there in the rest of the city there was the feeling of decay and decline but in here there was unfulfilled potential it was then that she realized that she was no longer hot or even warm that from the moment she had passed within the front door she had been cooled by a dry crisp breeze that came out of nowhere ah more deliambren magic of course and how better to lure patrons to a place like this down in a dubious quarter of the city than to ensure that they will be invisibly cooled in summer and warmed in winter there was no one on the main platform but about half the other small stages had performers on them not just musicians but a juggler a contortionist a mockmage and a storyteller who had his audience often in stitches savorythough unfamiliararomas drifted from three of the tiny kitchens it was difficult to say precisely where every sound and scent came from in this cavernous place but nightingale had the impression that there were similar setups just off the second or third floor balconies and as maddy had claimed a good half of those customers that nightingale spotted were not human the top floors lodgings her escort said diffidently he waved his hand vaguely at the upper story right sides for customers lefts for staff youll be staff of course youre assuming im going to stay nightingale could not resist pointing out dryly he turned to her with his mouth agape in surprise youwhy wouldnt you he managed after a moment during which his mouth worked without any sound emerging you might not want me for one thing she said with patient logic you dont know anything about me youre a free bard aint you the man retorted at her nod he shrugged as if that was the only answer he needed tyladenthats the boss the ownerhes left orders free bards show up looking for work they got it he says youre all good enough thats enough for me hes the one with the cashbox the man had a pointbut there were still a few things she had to get clear before i agree to anything i want to know the terms ill be working under here she told him severely he nodded his former surprise gone you pick the shiftexcept we got no openings on morning so its afternoon supper to midnight or midnight to dawn you can doubleshift if you want but we dont really like it thus far sounds reasonable go on she told him as the sound of a hurdygurdy brayed out on her right terms are pretty simple room and board and you pick what kitchen you want your meals out of we dont go writin up food so if you want to stuff yourself sick thats your problem you hire on as a musician thats what you dono cookin no waitin tables no bartending no cleanup she sensed that he was about to add something else then he took a look at her and left the words unsaid she knew what they were of coursethat she was not to offer extra services to the customers we dont argue if the customer brings aa friend here and wants a room to share foroh a couple of hours he said finally but we dont offer him things like that here oh please she said exasperated ive been on the road most of my life you dont have whores and you do have an arrangement with the whores guild i take it so you dont allow your entertainers to freelance their sexual services he looked just as startled as he had when she had suggested that she might not want to work here but again he nodded she suppressed a smile well occasionally clothing does make the person it appears i dress like a churchgoing country girl he assumes thats what i am i wonder what hell think when he sees some of my performing clothing perhaps that i am some mental chameleon that will be fine with me she began but he held up his hand to forestall her theres only one more rule he told her thats the one you might not like no puttin out a hat she raised one eyebrow as high as it would go just how am i supposed to make a living may i ask she said more than a bit arrogantly no one has ever made that part of my arrangements before he flushed and looked apologetic thats the rule theres a charge at the door t get in you get a salary an it depends on how big a draw you are lowest is five coppers each shift highestwell we only had one person ever get highest that was a halfroyal a halfroyal the equivalent five gold pieces it was nightingales turn to stare at him with mouth agape very few guild bards were ever granted that kind of money and no free bard that nightingale had ever heard ofnot even talaysen laurel bard to a king was ever paid that much so in other words im on trial until you see what kind of an audience i can collect she said finally after she had gotten over her astonishment and i have to take your word for what im worth he lifted his shoulders apologetically thats the terms thats what the boss set he replied she considered it for a moment leaving her own pride out of it this wasnt entirely a bad thing she could if she decided it was worth it exert herself only enough to pay for her army of children she had shelter food and an excellent venue to hear a great deal a place like this one would be very popular not only with workingclass folk but with those with wealth and jaded appetitesor a taste for uncommon entertainment if she had petitioned the lady of the night for the perfect place for her informationgathering she could not have come up with anything better most of all she would only have to work six hours of every day that left her at least six to make her own investigations provided she cared to exert herself that much she could make herself as conspicuous or as inconspicuous here as she wanted in fact that was not a bad idea she could play the exotic gypsy to the hilt here within these four wallsbut her persona outside the tavern could be as plain as a little sparrow no one would connect nightingale withwhatever she called herself in here and if she did thatwell she might not find herself in the halfroyal category but she was fairly certain that the five coins she would earn each shift would be silver not copper i believe i can live with these terms she said without bothering to try and strike a better bargain not that there would be much point to tryingthe price a deliambren set was not subject to bargaining one accepted or one did without excellent the man positively beamed i saw that you had harps we dont have any harp players right now i can put you up in the oak grove thats on the third floor far enough away from the dancing that you shouldnt have any trouble with noise what shift supper to midnight she replied immediately and he beamed again perfect lets go check the front desk and find out what room youve gotah he looked a little embarrassed i didnt catch your name thats because i didnt give it to you she replied softening the words with a faint smile as she ran a list of possible alternative names in her mind she would save nightingale for nowjust in case this deliambren was already part of her friends little plot my name is lyrebird he nodded with approval the lyres a harp right got a nice sound to itim kyran by the way kyran horat she held out her hand and he shook it in the way of gypsies sealing a bargain welcome to freehold lyrebird he said heartily i think youll be happy here you can lighten up now the bargaining is over she chuckled then looked away from him and out over the expanse of the building and all it contained there would be enough people here every night that sheor rather lyrebirdas flamboyant as that persona would be would simply be one more flamboyant entertainer among many she would earn enough to not only get her covert quest done but quite possibly turn a profit this place was built by a deliambren so she could probably expect some luxuries in her quarters that kyran hadnt even seen fit to mentionwhich was a far sight better than anything shed find in an ordinary inn all things considered this had turned out to be luck of the sort that had eased her journey all the way here i think youre right kyran she replied as she suppressed the shiver that thought brought her shall we find out about that room luck this good has to break sometime she thought as she followed him i only pray that when it does it does not turn as bad as it has been good and if this was the result of that fate geas or whatever else had brought her herewell that turn of good luck to bad very bad was all too likely chapter three nightingale found nothing to complain about in the room that kyran assigned to her except the lack of windowsand on the whole although it did make her feel a bit closed in that might have been as much of a benefit as a lack certainly there was not going to be much of a view around here and if the wind happened to come from the wrong directionwell what traveled on the wind from the direction of the slaughterhouses was nothing she wanted to have to endure she surveyed what was likely to be her refuge for the next several weeks if not months and on the whole was pleased there was one light overhead in the main room a second in the bathroom both controlled by plates on the wall that one touchedher escort had shown her how to use them and she had not revealed that she already knew what they were this was deliambren light of course not an oil lamp or candle it replicated natural sunlight at about an hour after sunrise warm clear but not too bright the overall effect with the four walls bare of decoration was of a white box but that was not altogether baddeliambren taste in artwork was not always something she admired and only the lady knew who or what had this room before she got it the one thing this room did boast that was quite out of the ordinary was its own tiny bathroom its out of the ordinary unless you happen to be acquainted with deliambrens that is by their standards this is all patched together old and rather tired the bare minimum for civilization she considered the closer examination shed been able to make as she walked up the open staircases and along the balcony to her room all visible equipment was very shopworn by deliambren standardstheir equivalent of secondhand goods it was all too heavy and too bulky to steal which made it safe to use here surrounded by humans who just might try to carry it off otherwise and those dangling wires and furlongs of conduitthose werent just afterthoughts things they hadnt quite tucked out of sight this equipment was probably reliable but to nightingales eyes at least was very clearly cobbled together from several other mismatched pieces of heavy equipment and likely there was no place else for those wires to go the bathroom stuck off one corner of the main room was in keeping with the general feeling of making do a tiny box tiled on all surfaces with some shiny white substance that might be ceramic it had a small sink one of the deliambrendesigned privies and an oblong object in one corner that she was certain must puzzle the life out of ordinary folk she had been inside the fortresscity any number of times the deliambrens used these things in places of bathtubs at a touch water cascaded from the nozzle in the wall and although one could not soak in this contrivance it was the best thing in all the world for washing hair to her delight her employers provided soap and towelsprobably she thought cynically because so few of their new employees had more than a nodding acquaintance with either that was fine with her those were two more things she was not going to have to provide it isnt a tenth as luxurious as the baths in their guest quarters at home though she thought smugly and if you look closely those tiles show some chips and scratch marks which means they have been reused probably all of the fixtures are reused they probably believe that these rooms are as austere as a church cloister and feel guilty over putting their employees through such hardship a rectangular opening high on the wall with a screen over it allowed warm airor cool as nowto flow into the main room while another on the opposite side removed it there was a similar arrangement in the bathroom all of the furnishings were built into the walls meaning that they could not be movedwhich was a minor annoyance there was a wardrobe on the same wall as the bathroom a chest which doubled as a seat and a bed that folded up into the wall if she needed more floor space a tiny shelf folded down next to the bed it was a very nice bed thoughand typically deliambren it bore very little resemblance to the kind of beds that she would find in other inns here wide enough for two the bed was a platform that dropped down on a hinge at the head of it to within an inch or two of the floor and perched on a pair of tiny legs that popped out of the foot the mattress was made of some soft substance she simply could not identify the same followed for the sheets towels and pillows they werent woven that was the only thing she could have said for certain a single light small but bright enough to read by was built into the cavity at the head of the bed it too was controlled by a palmplate other than that the room itself was unremarkable and as she knew quite well unlike the kinds of quarters that deliambrens reserved for their guests oh i imagine that my good host knowing that the rooms for staff among humankind are very simple opted for this as being typical trust a deliambren never to ask advice on something like this the fact was by most human standards between the heating and cooling and the bathroom this place was palatial her panniers covered with road dust and shabby with use as they were looked as out of place here as a jackdaws nest in a porcelain vase though this vase had a few cracks in it there was no doubt what it was she put the bed back up into the wall in order to have more room to work then set about unpacking her things and putting them away the harps she left in their cases for the moment but set beside the cushioned chestseat her costumes were next and she quietly blessed her instincts as she unpacked them one by one and shook them out thoroughly before putting them away in the wardrobe she had been tempted to get rid of the more flamboyant of them relics of her first days on the road and illsuited to her current life there were three of them all made of ribbons and scarves sewn into skirts seamed together from the waistband to the knee then left to flutter in streamers from the knee to the ground with them went patchwork bodices made to match the skirts and shirts with a maydance worth of rainbowribbons fluttering from each sleeve one was made up in shades of green from forestgreen to the pale of new leaves one in shades of red a scarlet that was nearly black to a deep rose and one in shades of blue from the sky at midnight to the sky at noon i was so proud of being a free bard then that i thought every bit of clothing i owned should shout to the world what i was they were my flags of defiance i suppose and fortunately at the time no one who might have taken exception actually recognized them for what they were now i hardly ever wear them except at kingsford faire she hung those at the front of the wardrobe they would do very nicely for lyrebird in a casual mood the majority of her clothing sensible enough skirtsthree of them of linen and woolbodices to match of linen leather and more wool and six good shirts with only a modest knot of ribbon on each sleeve she hung in the rear they were clearly worn and had seen much travel the wool skirt and bodice were carefully mended and three of the shirts plainly showed their origin as secondhand clothing to the experienced eye those she would use on the street she could even add a patch or two for effect she had done so before then came underthings and a nightshift stockings and a pair of sandals her winter cloak and a pair of shawls for weather too cold for shirtsleeves but not chill enough for the heavy cloak then at the bottom of the pannier the other clothing that wouldoh most definitelybe suited to the exotic lyrebird these costumes would virtually guarantee that she was seen and remembered the packet she removed from the bottom of the pannier was hardly larger than one of her sensible skirts folded into a square she had never worn these garments in human company beforenot that anyone had ever forbidden her to but she had never felt safe in doing so some would have considered them to be a screaming invitation to the kind of activity the proprietor of the muleteer assumed she would be open to others would have considered their mere possession to qualify her for burning at the stake she unfolded the outer covering of black a square of that same soft black velvet that the elven messenger had worn and shook out the garments one by one and as always she sighed what woman born could refrain from a sigh presented with these dresses they were elvenmake of course and not even the deliambrens could replicate them elven silk incredible stuff now there is magic the sleeves the skirts floated in the air like wisps of mist they gave the impression that they were as transparent as a bit of cloud and yet when she wore them there was not a cloistered sister in the twenty kingdoms who was as modestly clad as she there was so much fabric in them that if one took a dress apart and laid the pieces out they would fully cover every inch of space on the dance floor below yet each dress packed down into the size of her hand and emerged again unwrinkled uncrumpled one dress was black with a silver belt otherwise unadorned but with its multiple layers of sleeve and skirt cut and layered to resemble a birds feathers one was a true emeraldgreen embroidered around the neckline sleeves and hem with a trailing vine in a deeper green it had a belt of silk embroidered with the same motif the third was the russet of a vixens coat and the sleeves and hem were dagged and decorated with cutwork embroidery as delicate as lace the belt that went with this was of goldembroidered leather they would suite lyrebird very welland because no one save the elves had ever seen nightingale in this finery there was very little chance that anyone would recognize her from a description she would certainly stand outbut no one would know her nor would anyone recognize in the plain shabby little mouse who would go out into the streets the flamboyant harpist of freehold in her elven silks and since most of my customers and the members of my audience are going to be nonhuman lyrebird is going to be perfectly safe from any untoward conduct even in her elven silks very few nonhumans were going to find her attractive or desirable which was just fine so far as she was concerned she selected the russet for her first performancewhat better place for a russet vixen than an oak groveand gratefully stripped out of her sweatsoaked clothing and headed for the bathroom the watercascade worked just like the one she remembered and to her great pleasure the soap was delicately scented with jessamine and left a fresh perfume in her hair she luxuriated in the hot water pouring over her body washing every last trace of the long journey away this would be wonderful for easing the aches and strains of long playing caused by sitting in one position for hours at a time she dried and styled her long waistlength black hair in an arrangement very unlike nightingales simple braid this was an elaborate coil and twist along the back of her head with the remainder of her hair emerging as a tail from the center of the knot or allowed to trail as a few delicate tendrils on either side of her face she slipped the silken dress on over her clean bodyit would have been a desecration and a sin to have put it on without a full bathreveling in the sensuous feel of the silk caressing her hips and legs slipping sleekly over her arms now she took the cover off the larger of her two harps the one she could only play while seated and tuned it she ignored her stomach as she did soshe could eat later if need be but at the moment she had to get the harp ready in good time before her performance kyran had told her that he would send one of the servers up to her room to guide her to the oak grove when it was time for her to playher performance would extend past midnight just this once because she would never have had time to bathe and change and ready herself before suppertime it was very hard though to ignore the savory aromas wafting up from below most of them were as strange as they were pleasantnot exactly a surprise if most of the clientele were not human she was going to surprise kyran however he probably expected her to perform humanmade music only but lyrebird was a bird of a different feather altogether hmm perhaps i ought to have worn the black she was going to sing and play the music of at least three nonhuman cultures besides the elves human music would comprise the smallest part of her performance and again since very few people even among the gypsies and the free bards knew that she collected the music of nonhumans this would be utterly unlike nightingale she retired to her room in a glow of triumph harp cradled in her arms two hours after midnight entirely pleased with herself and her new surroundings her particular performance roomwhich was indeed decorated to resemble a grove of trees with mosscovered rocks for seats and tables growing up out of the floorwas far enough from the dance floor that her own quiet performance could go on undisturbed she had begun with purely instrumental music elven tunes mostly which attracted a small mixed crowd from there she ventured into more and more foreign realms and before the night was over there were folk standing in line waiting for a seat in her alcove most of them were not human which was precisely as she had hoped word had spread quickly among the patrons of freehold that there was a musician in the oak grove who could play anything and sing almost anything most of the nonhumans were hungry for songs from homeand most of the time she could oblige them with something if not the exact song they requested as she climbed the stairs to her room oblivious to the cacophony of mixed music and babbling talk she hardly noticed how tired she was she was confident now that her salary would be in the threeor foursilver area if not five that would be enough it would purchase the help of quite a number of children at a copper apiece kyran had checked on her during one of the busier moments which was gratifyinghed had a chance to see with his own eyes how many people were lining the walls waiting for seats his eyes had gone wide and round when hed seen her in costume too he certainly didnt expect that out of the drab little starling at the front door finally she reached the top of the stairs the balcony overlooking the dance floor and the hallway leading off of it though the hall muffled some of the echoing noise from below she couldnt help but notice that her room was just not far enough from the balcony for it to do much good she put the harp down to open her door set it inside and turned on the light then closed the door behind her the din outside vanished cut off completely once the door was closed she sighed with relief her one worry had been that she might be kept awake all night by the noise evidently the deliambren had thought of that as well she set the harp safely in the corner and reached for the plate that released the bed it swung down gently as a falling feather and she fell into it and got up immediately at a tapping at her door she answered it frowning had someone followed her up here expecting the kind of entertainment that kyran had sworn she would not have to provide if so he was going to get a rude surprise nightingale did not need a knife or a club to defend herself her lyncana friends made a fine art of handtohand combat and while she was a mere novice by their standards she was confident that there was not a single human no matter how large and muscular who could force himself upon her many had tried in the past and many had ended up permanently singing in higher keys but when she opened the door there didnt seem to be anyone thereuntil she dropped her eyes evenin snack for ye mum said a towheaded urchin with a pair of ears that could have passed for handles holding up a covered tray he had to shout to be heard over the bellows and cheers from the dance floor below boss figgered yed be hungered she wasnt about to argue she took the tray from the boy with a smile and before she could even thank him he had scampered away down hall to the staircase nimble as a squirrel and just as lively hmm my first reward for a job well done that could be she wasnt going to press the point she was hungry despite a few bites taken here and there during the breaks in performing after all she hadnt eaten since noon and that was a long time ago she took the tray over to her bed set it down lifted the cover and nearly fainted with delight there was quite enough there in that snack to have fed her for two days if shed been husbanding rations a tall corked bottle of something coldwater beaded the sides and slid down the dark glass enticinglystood beside a plate holding a generous portion of rare roast meat sliced thin and still steaming three perfect crusty rolls already buttered shared the plate with the meat very few humans would have recognized the next dish which resembled nothing so much as a purple rose but she knew a steamed kanechei when she saw it and her mouth watered to conclude the meal there was a plate of three nutstudded honeycakes her stomach growled and she fell to without a second thought when she finished there was nothing left but a few crumbs and a blissful memory following deliambren tradition she took the tray to the door and left it next to the wall just outside as she looked up and down the hallway she saw another tray or two which meant that she had done the right thing the shouting from below had died down somewhat but it sounded rather as if the drummer for the musical group was having some kind of rhythmic fit and the audience was clapping and stamping their feet in time she closed the door again quickly why is it that the drunker people become the more drumming they want maybe the alcohol blunts their ability to enjoy anything subtlelike a melody she had intended to read some of her own notebooks of nonhuman songsbut after that wonderful meal and especially the light sweet wine that had accompanied it she could hardly keep her eyes open so instead she slipped out of her gown and hung it up with a care for the delicate cutwork drew her nightshirt on over her head turned off the light and felt her way into bed she hardly had time to settle herself comfortably when sleep overtook her therefore my friends and brothers the young priest said earnestly his brown eyes going from one face below him to the next yes and my sisters too you must surely see how all these things only prove the unity of everything in the cosmoshow god has placed the warmth of his light in every heart whether the outer form of that heart walk on two legs or fourbe clad in skin hide scales or featherswhether the being call god by the name that we know him or by something else entirely what matters is this only that a being whatever form he wears strive to shelter that light to make it shine the brighter and not turn his face to the darkness the homely young priest signaled his musicians and stepped back with a painfully sincere smile nightingale slipped out of st brands chapel just as the tinyand obviously musically handicappedchoir began another hymnsong slipping a coin into the offering box as she passed it she stepped out into the busy street and blended into the traffic squinting against the bright noon light this was the fourth chapel she had attended in as many days and it had her sorely puzzled in the other threeall of them impressive structures in good neighborhoodsshe had heard only what she had expected to hear that only humans had souls that nonhumans having no soul to save had no reason to be good that if they had no reason to be good they must therefore be evil this wasnt the first time such an argument had been used against nonhumans obviously one of the things that the church absolutely needed in order to galvanize its followers was an enemy it was difficult to organize opposition to an abstract eviland even more difficult to get people to admit that there was evil inside themselves that meant that the ideal enemy would be something outside the church and outside the members of the church and as unlike the human followers of the sacrificed god as possible easy enough to point the finger at someone and say he doesnt look like you he doesnt believe in what you believe he must be eviland your natural enemy she thought cynically as she settled her hat on her head and let the crowd carry her along toward freehold she had expected this if the church was snatching secular power away from the high king lyonarie would be the place where it would show its truest handand that would be the place where the church officials would take a stand showing who they had selected to be the great enemy what she had not expected was that here the church was openly divided against itself when her patrons first began telling her about this in discussions she had started during the breaks between her sets she had at first dismissed it as being a trick of some kind after all why in the world would priests openly preach against what was supposedly church canon she couldnt come up with a reason behind such a trick unless it might be to lull the nonhumans into complacencybut what other reason could there be she decided to take to the chapels herself to find out thus far she had discovered a pattern at least chapels in certain districtsaggressively humanonlyalways held priests who followed the canonical path but chapels elsewhere might just as often harbor priests like brother brion back there priests who preached the brotherhood of all beings and stressed the similarities among the most various of beings rather than their differences they could have been operating the kind of trick she suspectedbut they could not hide the feelings behind their words not to her not when she chose to follow the music of their emotions and the music was of a sweeter harmony than that sadly undertalented choir back there these priests truly deeply believed in what they were saying and if the stories her patrons told her were true there were just as many priests of this radical line as there were who followed canon the crowd carried her up to the front door of freehold and she slipped out of the stream and onto the doorstep one or two others followed her there but she knew after a quick glance that these were patrons not fellow staff and she simply granted them a brief smile before opening the door and taking the other hallway to the right the one that led to the back stairs rather than the stable she really didnt want anyone to know that tanagerher streetnameand lyrebird were one and the same especially not customers but as she climbed the dimly lit back staircase to the top floor she couldnt help thinking about the words of that soearnest young priest and all the trouble those words must surely be causing him in certain circles and in her brief experience priests no matter how well meaning and sincere simply did not do or say things that would get them in trouble with their own superiors except that here and now they were what in the name of the gypsy lady and the sacrificed god was going on here tfyrr tried to concentrate on the music coming out of his friend harperus miraculous little machine but it was of no real use a black mood was on him today a black mood that not even music could lift he finally waved at the little black cube which shut itself off obediently he turned and stared out the windows of harperus selfpropelled wagon at the human hive called lyonarie humans again why am i doing this surely i shall never interact with humans without something tragic occurring he examined the scaled skin of his wrists where the marks of his fetters were still faintly visible at least to his eyes the invisible fetters the ones that bound his heart hurt far more than the physical bonds had why did i agree to come here how is it that harperus can charm me into actions i would never take on my own months ago he had agreed to help harperus in yet another of his schemes a partial survey of the human lands all had been well right up until the moment that he had been caught on the ground by humans who claimed that he was a demon a creature of evil and had fettered and imprisoned him starving him until he was more than half mad their intent had been to kill him in some religious spectacle that was what harperus said i scarcely recall most of it little had he known he had friends among the crowd assembled to see him die a pair of free bards who had provided him with a distraction the means to his escape unfortunately not everyone had been distracted at the crucial moment a single human guard had seen that he was about to flee and had tried to stop him to a fatal end that was the reason for his black depression it did not matter that he had killed in selfdefense the point was that he had killed the man he had eviscerated in his pain and hungermadness had only been doing his duty in fact no matter what harperus claims since he was doing his duty to the best of his ability he was as good as iperhaps my spiritual better certainly he iswasnot the one with blood on his conscience could this mean in the end that the fanatics who had called him a demon and evil were actually right the question haunted him and harperus who had found him shivering in a field after his flight had not helped harperus merely shrugged the entire question off saying that the guard had followed the orders of a superior who was in the wrong he further claimed that the man must at some point have known that his superior was in the wrong and that evened the scales between himself and the man he had murdered but harperus is a deliambren and they are facile creatures they can make white into black and sun into midnight with their socalled logic harperus simply could not understand why this should torment him so after all it was over and done with and there was nothing more to be said or done but to move on oh yes to move on without a load of guilt upon my soul so heavy that i cannot fly tfyrr sighed gustily and turned away from the window waving at the machine again it started right up obediently not that tfyrr didnt know this particular human song by heart but he wanted to have every nuance that harperus had recorded this was a love duet sung by two of the finest of the human musiciansat least in tfyrrs estimationthat harperus had ever captured in his little cubes lark and wren why do so many of these humans bear the names of birds i wonder of course part of the passion here was simply because the two who sang this song of love were lovers and they allowed their feelings free voice still tfyrr had heard other humans who were their equals since he had descended from the mountains of his homeland and not all of those were represented in harperus collection the one called nightingale for instance a haspurs memory was the equal of any deliambren storage crystal and his meeting with nightingale was fraught with such power and light that for a moment it completely overwhelmed his terrible gloom he and harperus had taken a place for the deliambrens livingwagon in a park a place created by gypsies for travelers to camp together this was enlightened altruism they charged a fee for this and the intent of the place was to sell them services they might not otherwise have in the wilderness between cities still they erect and maintain such waymeets surely they deserve recompense i cannot fault them for charging fees tfyrr had been restless and harperus had not seen any reason why he should have to remain mewed up in the wagonthe gypsies were very assiduous about protecting the peace of their patrons so he had gone for a walk out under the trees surrounding the campinggrounds and after an interval he had heard a strange wild music and followed it to its source it had been a woman a gypsy playing her harp beside a stream he had known enough about humans even then to recognize how unique she was blackhaired darkeyed her featherless skin browned to a honeygold from many miles on the open road beneath the sun she was as slender and graceful as a female of his own race and as ethereal as one of the beings that harperus called elves with her large brooding eyes high cheekbones pointed chin and thin lips she would probably have daunted him in other circumstances since those features conspired to give her an air of haughty aloofness but her eyes had been closed with concentration her lips relaxed and slightly partedand her music had entwined itself around his heart and soul and he could not have escaped if he had wanted to they had shared a magical afternoon of music then once she finished her piece and realized that he was standing there she had been as eager to hear some of the music of his people as he had been to learn the music of hers an unspoken but not unfelt accord had sprung up between them and tfyrr sometimes took that memory out and held it between himself and despair when his guilt and gloom grew too black to bear the wagon lurched and tfyrr caught himself with an outstretched handclaw deliambren chairs were not made for a haspur the backs were poorly positioned for anyone with wings harperus had compromised by having a stool mounted to the floor of the wagon with a padded ring of leathercovered metal that tfyrr could clutch with his foottalons a few krr above the floor it was only a compromise and tfyrr found himself jarred out of his memory of that golden afternoon with nightingale as the wagon lurched and he had to clutch not only the footring but the table in front of him to avoid being pitched to the floor those stabilizerthings must be broken again much of the deliambrens equipment had a tendency to break fairly often harperus spent as much time fixing the wagon as he did driving it most of the time the things that broke merely meant a little inconvenience once or twice the deliambren had actually needed to secure the wagon in a place that could be readily defended at need and call his people for someone to bring him a new part still this was a marvelous contraption tfyrr had out of purest curiosity poked his beak into the wagons of other travelers and this behemoth was to those little horsedrawn rigs as he was to a scarcely fledged starling the wagon was divided into four parts an eating and sitting part where he was now a sleeping part a bathing and eliminating part and a mysterious part that the deliambren would allow no one into but himself tfyrr suspected that this final part was where the controls for the wagon were and where harperus kept some of the technical and scientific instruments that he used not that it mattered tfyrr was supremely incurious where all that nonsense was concerned the wagon could propel itself down a road without any outside pulling by horses or other draftbeasts right at the moment it was doing just that although up until this point the deliambren had taken exacting pains to keep humans from knowing it could move of itself on the hottest days it remained cool withinon the coldest it was as warm as the haspur could have wished there were mystical compartments where fresh food was kept remaining fresh until one wished to eat it there was another kind of seat for elimination of bodily waste and a tube wherein one could stand to be sluiced clean with fresh water the whole of the wagon was most marvelously appointed shiny beige wall and ceiling surfaces leathercovered seating rough heavy rugs fastened down on the floor that one could dig ones talons into to avoid being flung about while the wagon was moving even the beds were acceptable and it had been difficult for tfyrr to find an acceptable bedmuch less a comfortable onesince he had come down out of the mountains the very windows of this contrivance were remarkable he could see out but no one could see in tfyrr still did not understand how that was possible unfortunately the view displayed by those windows at the moment was hardly savory and harperus claims that this is not the vilest part of this city it is difficult to believe the haspur lived among the tallest mountains on alanda while they were not very territorial by nature they were also not colonybreeders each haspur kept a respectable distance between his aerie and those of his neighbors no enclave of haspur ever numbered above a thousandand there were at least that many humans just in the area visible from the window of the wagon they crammed themselves together in dwellings that were two and three stories tall with the upper floors extended out over the street in such a way that very little sunlight penetrated to the street below there must have been four or five families in each of the buildings and each family seemed to have a half dozen children at absolute minimum tfyrr could not imagine what it must sound like with all of them meeping and crying at once and how did their parents manage to feed them all a young haspur ate its own weight in food every day during the first six years of its growth after that he ate about half his own weight each day until he was fullgrown that was one reason why haspur tended to limit their families to no more than twotfyrr could not even begin to imagine the amount of food consumed by six children this was not even a good place in which to raise young in addition to the lack of sun there was a profound lack of fresh air in this quarter the buildings restricted breezes most cruelly tfyrr did not want to think about how hot it must be out there in the street why these people werent running mad with the heat was a mystery and the noise must be deafening a jarring cacophony also likely to drive one mad perhaps they are all mad perhaps that is why they have so many offspring haspur did not have a particularly good sense of smell which he suspected was just as well for he was certain that so many people crowded togetherlike starlingsmust create an environment as filthy as a starling roost the crowds seemed to be thinning though and the standard of construction in the residences rising the farther they went he was not imagining itthere definitely was more room between the buildings there were even spots of green though the greenery was imprisoned away behind high walls as if the owners of the property were disinclined to share even the sight of a tree or a flower with the unworthy there were fewer children in the street too and those few were not playing they were with adults supervised some even seemed to be working under adult supervision sweeping the gutters scrubbing walls polishing gates they paused for a moment tfyrr couldnt see what was going on at the front of the coach but a moment later they were on the move again and he saw why they had stopped there was a simple wooden gate meant to bar the road now pulled aside and several armed guards to make certain no one passed it without authorization they watched the coach pass by stoically enough but tfyrr noted that they did seemimpressed puzzled well harperus is deliambren and he was bent on displaying deliambren wonders to the court of the high king i suppose he must have decided to begin with everyone in the city harperus had insisted that here in lyonarie it was of utmost importance to display as much power as one could conveniently abstractly tfyrr understood this the powerful were never impressed by anyone with less power than they after all but this business of going out of their way to look strange and different including operating the coach without horses looking different can be hazardous i have had a crop full of what that hazard can be displaying too much power can incite as much envy as anything else and the envious when powerful are often moved to try and help themselves to what has excited that envy at whatever cost to the current owner still harperus claimed that he had connections at the court of theovere and given the dangerous trends of the past two years he and his people had felt it was time to employ those connections theovere was a music lover of the most fanatic vein apparently this was what had been occupying the time he should have been spending doing his duty as high king originally harperus was going to offer theovere one of the music machines and a set of memorycrystals as a blatant bribe for a little more influence in legislation but since the time that original plan had been conceived he had evolved a better one better not just because it means no dangerous technology will be in the hands of those who might somehow manage to find an unpleasant use for it but because it will meanor so he thinksthat he will have a direct influence instead of an indirect one tfyrr sighed flipped his wings to position them more comfortably and drummed his talons on the table he was not looking forward to this harperus plan was to have tfyrr appointed as an official court musician to the high king himself harperus was unshakably certain that once the high king heard tfyrr sing the haspur would become a royal favorite and once a nonhuman was a royal favorite it would be much more difficult for other interests to get laws restricting the rights of nonhumans past the high king interests such as the human church perhaps though i am not particularly sanguine about one haspur being able to overcome the interests of the church however optimistic harperus may be religion rules the heart and the heart is the most stubborn of adversaries rule the religion and you rule the heart and no one can oppose youunless what you offer is better then you must convince them that what you have is better and people will die to hold on to what they already believe tfyrr twitched his tail irritably harperus was optimistic about a great many thingsand tfyrr did not share his optimism in most of them even if we can get in to see this high king there is no guarantee he will be impressed with my singing even if he is there is no guarantee that he will actually do anything about it personally and from what i have seen if he leaves my disposition up to his underlings they will find a way to lose me no harperus is counting on a great deal of good luck and good luck seems to have deserted me tfyrr glanced out the windows again and was impressed though in a negative fashion by the homes he now passed these dwellingseach a magnificent work of art each set in its own small park and gardenwere clearly owned by those of wealth and high rank and the guards on that gate they had passed showed just how unlikely it would be for a commoner to get access to these lovely gardenspots so the low and poor must crowd together in squalor while the wealthy and high live in splendor if i were low and poori think i would go elsewhere to live my home would still be poor but at least i would have sunlight and fresh air green things about me and a little peace butperhaps these humans enjoyed living this way starlings certainly did that made them even less understandable not that he had come close to understanding them so far the humans own sacrificed god spoke of fairness and justice and faith in the goodness of others these things should prevent believers from doing harm to strangers why should an underling clearly seeing his superiors doing vile things to another living being believe that those things were justified how could he be convinced that another being who had done no harm was a monster worth destroying how could such a man be so convinced that those superiors were correct that he would spend his own life to carry out their will perhaps those superiors were right perhaps tfyrr was as potentially evil as they claimed after all he was the one who had killed perhaps he misunderstood what the sacrificed god was all aboutafter all if the deliambrens could make white into black maybe the humans could too i only hope that harperus plan works as well as he thinks it will tfyrr thought depression settling over him again i might somehow redeem myself if only i can be in a position where i can do some real goodor perhaps this helplessness to affect anything for the better is punishment for my evil tfyrr was not as expert at reading human expressions as he would have liked but there was no mistaking the look the court official facing them wore on his refined visage disdain not all of harperus deliambren charm or magic had been able to remove that look from the face of this socalled laurel herald he had taken in the splendor of harperus costumea full and elaborate rig that made the deliambren look to tfyrrs eyes rather like one of those multitiered flowerbedecked overdecorated cakes that some races produced at weddings and other festivities he had watched the coach drive itself off to a designated waiting place with a similarly lifted brow of course he was probably used to seeing similar things every day and his livery of scarlet and gold embroidered on the breast with a winged creature so elaborately encrusted with gold bullion that it was impossible to tell what it was supposed to be was just as ornate in its way as harperus costume he sat behind a huge deska desk completely empty so far as tfyrr could seein the exact center of an otherwise barren marblewalled and mosaicfloored chamber the walls were covered with heroic paintings of stifffaced humans engaged in conflicts or stifffaced humans posing in front of bizarre landscapes there was a single bench behind the desk where many young humans in similar livery sat quietly now he waited for harperus to declare himself which harperus was not at all loathe to do the deliambren adored being able to make speeches i am harperus the deliambren ambassadoratlarge he announced airily to the functionary he went on at length detailing the importance of his position the number of dignitaries he had presented his credentials to and the exalted status of the deliambren parliament finally he came to the point i have a presentation to make to theovere he concluded not his majesty high king theovere but the simple surname as if he and the high king were of equal stature tfyrr was impressed by harperus audacity if nothing else the title harperus claimed was not precisely a fiction although very little of what the deliambren actually did on his extensive trips ever had anything to do with conventional diplomacy and it was entirely possible he had presented his credentials to every one of the dignitaries he namedthey were all wealthy enough to afford deliambren goods and harperus often acted as a courier for such things the official favored harperus with a long moment of silence during which the laurel herald scrutinized the deliambren as carefully as an oldster examining her daughterinlaws aerie for dirt in the corners unpolished furniture or a fraction less klrrthn than was proper harperus simply stood there radiating a cool aplomb tfyrr was grateful that no human here could possibly have enough experience with haspur to read their expressions and body language or he would have given it all away with his rigid nervousness he stood as straight and as stiffly as a perchingpole his wings clamped against his back probably the official didnt notice or if he did thought it was stiff formality and not nerves he didnt seem to notice the haspur at all in the simple silk bodywrap tfyrr probably looked like a slave finally the laurel herald elected to take them at face value he signaled to a boy he referred to as page one of the dozen waiting quietly on the bench behind his desk and gave them over into the boys keeping take them to the afternoon court the herald said shortly and turned his attention to other business on his empty desk after an interminable walk down glasswalled corridors that passed through the middle of mathematically precise gardens the boy led them towarda structure if the scale of the palace had been anything tfyrr considered normal it would have been another wing of a central building but since everything was on such a massive scale this wing was the size of entire palaces it was certainly the size of the huge cathedral in gradford which was one of the largest human buildings tfyrr had ever seen thats court my lords the boy explained enunciating carefully thats all that goes on in that palace building just court morning and afternoon court informal court formal court judiciary allocation city the boy rattled on until tfyrr shook his head in disbelief how many ways could one entitle the simple function of hearing problems and meeting people evidently quite a few the bureaucracy here must be enough to stun a thinking being i feel dizzy the doors at the end of the corridor swung open without a hand to open them as they approached tfyrr glanced sideways at harperus who smirked in smug recognition a deliambren device of course why am i not surprised the doors closed behind them silently and the haspur noted larger versions of the deliambren lighting that harperus employed in his coach hanging from the ceiling encased in ornate structures of glass and gold there were probably hundreds more examples of deliambren wonders here but none of them would be of the type that could be taken apart without destroying them well no matter what the church says about the evil magic of those who are not human past high kings have not scrupled to buy and use our devices tfyrr grimaced no matter what happens i would place a high wager that they would continue to use such things even in the face of a church declaration of anathema the church would either look the other way or the high king would pay the fine and continue to have his lighting and his selfopening doors the high king would be able to afford whatever fine the church levied without even thinking about it tfyrr knew after traveling so long with harperus just how much that lighting those doors probably cost nor was the display of wealth limited to the nonhuman devices so prominently displayed and used of course the money came from somewhere and tfyrrs mind played out an image of the human hive they had come through they followed down a hallway paved in polished marble with matching marble paneling graceful designs had been incised into the marble of the walls and gold wire inlaid in the grooves at intervals along the wall and beneath the lighting where they were displayed at their best advantage were graceful sculptures of humans and animals also of marble with details of gold inlay between the sculptures stood small marble tables topped with vases made of semiprecious jade malachite and carnelian the vases were filled with bouquets not of fresh flowers but of flowers made of precious stones and gold and silver wire tfyrr could not even begin to calculate the cost of all of this surely just one of those flowers would keep a commoner out in lyonarie fed and clothed for a year the page led them to a pair of goldinlaid bronze doors each a work of art in itself depicting more humansthough for once these were not in conflict but gathered for some purpose the doors swung open and the boy waved them in theyll have brought your name to the presiding herald the boy whispered as tfyrr caught sight of a jewelbedecked throng just inside the door hell add you to the list just listen for him to announce you and then present yourself to his majesty thank you harperus said gravely the boy bobbed an abrupt little bow and hurried off harperus strode between those open doors as if he had every right to be there and tfyrr moved in his wake like a silent winged shadow he had not donned all of the finery that harperus had wanted him to put ona huge gemmed pectoral collar anklebracelets armbands and wristbands a dusting of gold powder for his wings now he was glad that he had not not only had the wrist and armbands and bracelets felt far too much like fetters but tfyrr was certain that he would only have looked ridiculous in the borrowed gear as if he was trying to ape these jeweled and painted humans who were ohsocarefully not staring at the nonhumans in their midst there did not appear to be any other nonhuman creatures in this room although it was difficult to be certain of that they could have been crammed up against the white marble wallsthat evidently was the place where those of little importance were relegated the magic circle of ultimate status was just before the throne within earshot of everything that went on upon the dais harperus strolled toward that hallowed ground quite as if he had a place reserved for him there and to tfyrrs amazement the haughty courtiers gave way before him perhaps they are frightened by his costume the nearer they got to the throne the more annoyed and resentful the glances of those giving way for them became just at the point where tfyrr was quite certain harperus was about to be challenged the deliambren stopped folded his arms and stood his ground his whole attitude one of genial listening tfyrr did his best to copy his friend harperus was truly paying attention to what was going on around the throne unlike many of the humans here as tfyrr watched and listened following the deliambrens example he became aware that there was something very wrong the high kingwho did not look particularly old though his short hair was an iron grey and his face sported a few prominent lines and wrinklessat upon a huge gilded and jeweled throne that was as dreadful an example of bad taste as anything harperus had ever inflicted on an unsuspecting tfyrr the kings entire attitude however was not at all businesslike but rather one of absolute boredom on both sides of the throne were richly dressed humans in floorlength ornate robes embroidered with large emblems with enormous chains of office about their necks like so many dressed up dogs with golden collars but these dogs were not the ones obeying the command of their masterrather the prey was in the other claw entirely harperus had been right harperus had actually been right the high king virtually parroted everything these socalled advisors of his told him to say now tfyrr was mortally certain that very few of the courtiers were aware of this for the advisors bent over their monarch in a most respectful and unctuous manner and whispered in carefully modulated tones what it was they thought he should say they were taking great care that it appear they were only advising not giving him orders but a haspurs hearing was as sharp as that of any owl and tfyrr was positive from the bland expression on harperus face that the deliambren had some device rigged up inside that bizarre head and neckpiece he sported that gave him the same aural advantage during the brief time that they stood there waiting their turn king theovere paid little or no attention to matters that tfyrr thought importantgiven as little acquaintance as he had with governing there were several petitions from guildmasters three or four ambassadors presenting formal communications from their kings a report on the progress of the rebuilding at kingsford well those might easily be dismissed as theovere was doing by handing them over to his seneschal there was nothing there that he really needed to act upon although his barely hidden yawn was rather rude by tfyrrs standards but what of the rest there was an alarming number of requests from dukes barons and even a mere sire or two from many of the twenty kingdoms asking the high kings intervention with injustices perpetrated by their lords and rulers wasnt that precisely the kind of thing that the high king was supposed to handle wasnt he supposed to be the impartial authority to keep the abuse of power to a minimum that was how tfyrr understood the structure of things the high king was the ultimate ruler and his duty was not only to his own land but to see that all the others were wellgovernedenforcing that even to the point of placing a new king on a throne if need be but most of these petitions like the rest of the work he delegated to his poor overburdened seneschaleverything that he did not dismiss out of hand with a curt take your petty grievances back to your homeland and address them properly to your own king the seneschal however overworked he already was always looked pained when the king used that particular little speech but he said nothing perhaps there isnt a great deal that he can do tfyrr thought the seneschals chain was the least gaudy of all of the chains of officeperhaps that meant that among the advisors he had the least power the rest of the advisors however were not so reluctant to voice their opinionswhich were universally positive they actually congratulated the high king every time he dismissed a petition or passed it on to the seneschal they were particularly effusive when he trotted out that little speech a fine decision your majesty someone would say another would add as predictably as rhyming death with breath it is in the interest of your land and people that they see you delegate your authority so that when you are truly needed you will be free to grant a problem your full attention and a third would pipe up with you must be firm with these people otherwise every dirtfarming peasant who resents paying tax and tithe to his overlord and the church win come whining to you for redress of his socalled wrongs and the high king smiled and nodded and suppressed another yawn tfyrr flexed his talons silently easing the tension in his feet by clamping them into fists until they trembled how in the world did harperus think he could help with this situation the king was getting all of this bad advice from highranking humans who were probably very dangerous and hazardous to cross memories of fetters weighing him down made him shiver with chill in that overly warm room hazardous to cross but before he could say anything to harperus the presiding herald announced their names and it was too late to stop the deliambren from carrying out his plan my lord harperus jin lothir ambassadoratlarge from the deliambrens and tfyrr redwing envoy of the haspur a tiny portion of tfyrrs mind noted the rich tones of the humans voice with admiration the rest of him was engaged in trying to watch the reactions of anyone of any importance to the announcement the kings face lit up the moment harperus stepped forward as the deliambren launched into a flowery speech lauding the greatness of king theovere and the vast impact of the high kings reputation across the face of alanda the advisors waited and watched like an unkindness of ravens waiting for something to die they didnt know what harperus was up toif indeed he was up to anything that bothered them but what clearly bothered them more was the fact that for the first time theovere was showing some interest and no boredom theovere might not be the man he once was but he still knows where the marvels come from now tfyrr wondered if the trouble was with the kings age there was a certain illness of the aged where one regressed into childhood theovere certainly betrayed some symptoms of childishness tfyrr followed the speech he knew it by heart and his cue was just coming up without pausing or skipping a beat harperus went from the speech to tfyrrs introduction and i bring before you one who has heard of your generous patronage of the art of music the envoy of goodwill from the haspur of the skytouching mountains where no human of the twenty kingdoms has ever ventured here to entertain you and your court harperus stepped back and tfyrr quickly stepped forward one of the advisors opened his mouth as if to protest tfyrr didnt give him a chance to actually say something he had already filled his lungs while he waited for his cue and now he burst into fullchested song although the haspur had their own musical styles they also had the ability to mimic anything so exactly that only another haspur could tell the mimicry from the genuine sound tfyrr had chosen that lovely human duet to repeatit was ideally suited to his voice since it was antiphonal and he could simulate the under and overtones of an instrumental accompaniment with a minimum of concentration he did improve on the original recording however while master wren was a golden tenor lady larks lovely contralto was not going to impress an audience this sophisticatedso tfyrr transposed the female reply up into the coloratura range and added the appropriate trills glissandos and flourishes the king sat perfectly still his eyes actually bulging a little in a way that tfyrr found personally flattering though rather unattractive with his superior peripheral vision he could keep track of those courtiers nearest him as well and many of them were positively slackjawed with amazement his hopes and his spirits began to rise at that point perhaps he was impressive to this jaded audience perhaps he would be able to accomplish something here the instant that he finished the staid etiquettebound courtiers of high king theovere broke into wild and completely spontaneous applause but the advisors applauded only politely their eyes narrowed in a way that tfyrr did not at all like they resembled ravens again this time sizing up the opportunity to snatch a bite so harperus muttered under his breath as tfyrr took a modest bow or two now do you think im crazy i know you are crazy the haspur replied in a similarly soft voice but you are also clever that is a bad combination for your enemies the deliambren only chuckled chapter four ah tfyrr thought with resignation perched uncomfortably upon the tall stool that had been brought for him i do enjoy being talked about as if i was not present this was not the first time he had found himself in that position at least in this case the discussion concerned his life and prosperity not his imminent and painful death and at least this time he was seated and on a relatively appropriate stoolin deference to his wings and tailrather than standing in an iron cage fettered at every limb harperus was not part of this discussion this council session the deliambren had not been invited this was probably more of an oversight than a deliberate insult since the subject of this meeting was tfyrr and not harperus tfyrr wished profoundly for his company though as the only nonhuman as well as the object of discussion he was alternately being ignored and glared at it would have been less uncomfortable if harperus had been there to share the experience by the standards of the palace so far this was a modest room paneled in carved wood with wooden floors and boasting deliambren lighting the council members all of the kings advisors sat at a rectangular marbletopped table with the king at the head and tfyrr at the foot they had carved wooden chairs that could have doubled as thrones in many kingdoms the king had a simpler wooden replica of the monstrosity in the room in which he held court gilded as well as carved behind the king stood a circle of four silent bodyguards in scarlet and black livery armed to the teeth in enameled helms and breastplates as blankfaced as any elf if they projected the fact that they are dangerous any harder there would be little puddles of danger on the floor around them look its danger dont step in it i want him as my personal court musician king theovere said with a glare across the table at his seneschal the king had convened this council meeting as soon as court was overand he had cut court embarrassingly short in order to arrange the time for the meeting evidently nothing could be done not even the appointment of a single musician to the royal household without at least one council meeting but it was obvious to tfyrr that no matter what his advisors thought this meeting was going to go the kings way he wondered if they realized that yet lord marshal lupene shrugged his massive shoulders the marshal was an old warrior now gone to fat to an embarrassing extent though from the way he carried himself it was likely he didnt realize itor didnt want to your majesty might consider what the envoys both have to say about it they might have other plans theovere did not quite glower but tfyrr was as aware as theovere that the the lord marshals implying that the king had not already consulted with tfyrr and harperus was cutting dangerously close to insubordination this lord marshal must have been very sure of himself to chance such insolence he is willingeven eager theovere said angrily as tfyrr nodded slightly though no one paid any attention to him the deliambren ambassador says that he can manage without tfyrr along that he and tfyrr were really no more than convenient traveling companions i tell you i want him in my employ starting from this moment lord chamberlain vidor who had charge of the kings court musicians pursed his thin lips the lord chamberlain was as cadaverous and lean as the lord marshal was massive your majesty cannot have considered the impact this will have on his other musicians vidor intoned keeping his disapproval thinly veiled musicians are delicate creatures with regards to their sensibilities and moraleappointing this haspur could wreak great damage among them after allhe isnt even human much less a guild bard theovere turned towards his chamberlain and raised one bushy eyebrow the second follows upon the first doesnt it he asked testily the guild wont accept nonhumans which makes it altogether impossible for tfyrr to be one i have in fact considered the impact of this appointment and i think it will serve as an excellent example to my other musicians having tfyrr in their midst will keep them on their mettle they have been getting lazy too much repetition and too little original work they could use the competition his tone grew silken as he glanced aside at lord guildmaster koraen perhaps it might give the bardic guild cause to reconsider their ban on nonhuman members with so excellent a musician being barred from their ranks and from lending the guild my prestige my notoriety tfyrr added silently seeing some of the same thoughts occurring to the guildmaster koraen was good at hiding his feelings but tfyrr detected the sound of the bulky balding man grinding his teeth in frustration the guild has just lost a fair amount of prestige thanks to my performance and might lose some royal preference if i continue to succeed here this man is going to be my enemy he mentally shook his head what am i thinking they are all going to be my enemies the only question is how dangerous they consider me the bardic guild the guildmaster began theovere slammed his open palm down on the table the bardic guild had better learn some flexibility he all but shouted the bardic guild had better learn how to move with the times the bardic guild had better come up with something better than elaborations on the same tired themes if they want to continue to enjoy my patronage but this sets a very bad precedent your majesty interjected another council member a thin and reedy little man who had not been introduced to tfyrr he wore a sour expression that seemed to be perpetually fixed on his face my lord treasurer is correct agreed the lord judiciar smoothly an oily fellow of nondescript looks who had been among the first to congratulate the king every time he dismissed a petition it sets a very bad precedent indeed you are the high king of the twenty human kingdoms what need have you to bring in outsiders to fill your household now for the first time tfyrr saw signs of petulance on the kings face a childish expression that looked frankly quite ridiculous on a man with grey hair and the royal temper held barely in check now brokebut not into shouting i want him in my household and by god i will have him in my household the king grated dangerously glaring at them all in fact his expression suddenly grew sly ill appoint him my chief court musician yes why not i have a vacant place for a chief musician in my personal household let tfyrr fill it that is a position solely under my control subject to my discretion and the council can only advise me on it as you know as the expressions of the council members around the table changed from annoyed to alarmed he chuckled like a nasty little boy who has been picking the wings off flies butbut your majesty the lord chamberlain spluttered obviously blurting the first thing that came into his head that is impossible thethechief court musician must be a knight all of your majestys household must be of the rank of sire or better oh well if that is all there is to it before anyone could stop him the king rose from his seat and walked to tfyrrs pulling out his ornamental short sword as he came i can certainly remedy that i am a knight as well as a king and according to the rules of chivalry i can make other knights in either capacity as i choose they need only be worthy and tfyrr is certainly far more worthy of this post than any bardic guild popinjay youve presented me with thus far oh good heavens hes lost his mind tfyrr was not certain what he should do so he did nothing except to rise turn to face the king and bow this did not seem to bother theovere at all the king tapped him on each shoulder in a perfunctory manner then resheathed the sword the council members sat numbly in their places struck dumb by the sudden and abrupt turn of events clearly the king was not supposed to take so much initiative obviously they have never tried to balk him before they have just learned a lesson i believe they thought the king too much in their control to slip his leash like this there the king said casually sire tfyrr i now name thee a knight of the court whose duties shall be to serve as my chief minstrel in my own household do you accept those duties and swear to that service i do tfyrr rumbled and then a storm of protests arose by the time it was all over the council had suffered complete defeat tfyrr was still sire tfyrra title which was fundamentally an empty one since no gift of land went along with the honor he was still the chief court musician when the lord chamberlain swore that the other court musicians would never share quarters with a nonhuman the king gleefully added a private suite in the royal wing to the rest of tfyrrs benefits when the lord treasurer protested that the kingdom could not bear the unknown living expenses of sounusuala creature theovere shrugged and assigned his expenses to the privy purse the only real objection that anyone could make that theovere could not immediately counter was the objection that the people will not understand finally theovere simply glared them all to silence the people will learn to understand he said in a threatening tone that brooked no argument it is about time that the people became a little more flexible just as it is about time that the bardic guild and the members of my court and council became a little more flexible and the example can be set here and now in my own household he glared once more around the table i am the king and i have spoken you work for me is that understood tfyrr then saw something he had not expected as the faces of the council members grew suddenly pale and they shut their lips on any further objections what he thought with interest what is this and why they have been treating him like a child until this momentnow why do they suddenly act as if they had a lion in their midst what was it about that phrase i am the king and i have spoken that has sudden changed the entire complexion of this silence reigned around the table and theovere nodded with satisfaction good he said now you may all go attend to your pressing duties i am sure you have many you keep telling me that you do the council members rose to a man in a rustling of expensive fabric bowed and filed silently out leaving only tfyrr and theovere and theoveres everpresent bodyguards the king chuckled i am not certain your majesty that i deserve such preferential treatment tfyrr said at last after a moment of thought i have had enemies made this day of nearly every important man in this court this appointment has just become a most comfortable and luxurious setting in which to be a target perhaps if you chose to return to your original plan he suggested gently i am only one poor musician and there is no reason to make my position in your household into a source of such terrible contention theovere shook his head i meant what i said the high king replied they can learn to live with it there has been too much talk of late about the superiority of humansand you have just proven that talk to be so much manure and you have done so in my open court it is time and more than time for people to learn betteryou will serve as my primary example thus making me a target for every malcontent in the city if not in the twenty kingdoms thank you so much your majesty i will call a page to show you to your new quarters and have your friend the deliambren sent there to meet you the king continued rising to his feet tfyrr did likewise with some haste bowing as the king smiled one of the bodyguards reached for a bellpull and as the king moved away from the table a young darkhaired snubnosed boy appeared in the stillopen door clad in the high kings livery of gold and scarlet the king acknowledged tfyrrs bow with an indolent wave of his hand and walked out of the council room trailing all but one of his bodyguards the one left behind the one who had summoned the page gestured to the boy as tfyrr rose from his bow this gentleman is now the kings chief court musician in his personal household the bodyguard said to the boy in a voice lacking all expression he kept his face at an absolute deadpan as well and tfyrr could only admire his acting ability his name is sire tfyrr you will escort him to the royal wing see that he is comfortably lodged in the gryphon suite and from here on see that his needs are attended to for the immediate future you will see to his special needs in furnishing his quarters then when sire tfyrr indicates find the deliambren ambassador and escort him to sire tfyrr the child bobbed his head in wordless acknowledgement and the bodyguard left apparently satisfied that the kings orders had been correctly delivered as soon as he was gone the boy glanced up at tfyrr and the haspur did not have to be an expert in human children to see that the boy was frightened of him his face was pale and his fists clenched at his sides if tfyrr said or did anything alarming the poor fledgling would probably faintor forget his duty and bolt for someplace safe to hide i am a haspur young friend tfyrr said gently and chuckled we dont eat children we do eat meat but we prefer it to be cookedand we would rather not have had a speaking acquaintance with it before it became our dinner the child relaxed marginally would you follow me sire tfyrr he said in a trembling soprano do you have any baggage that you will need brought to you my friend harperus will see to all that tfyrr told him and added as an afterthought he is the deliambren you should have no trouble finding him he is the only being in the palace who is dressed to look like a saints palanquin in a holy day festival parade that broke the ice finally the little boy giggled and stifled the laugh behind both hands but the eyes above the hands were merry and when he turned a sober face back to tfyrr his eyes had a sparkle to them that they had lacked until that moment if you would come with me then sire the boy said gesturing at the door tfyrr nodded certainlyah what is your name it seems rude to call you boy or page regan sire the boy said skipping to keep up with tfyrr as the haspur strode down the hallway but my friends call me nob tfyrr coaxed his beak into something like a human smile he had learned that the expression made humans feel better around him very well nob he said projecting good humor and casualness into his voice now if you were in my place granted a title and a new home what would you do first you mean about the suite and all sire nob asked looking up at tfyrr with a crooked grin well i might have some ideas then by all means tfyrr told him let me hear them harperus lounged at his ease on one of the damaskcovered sofas in the reception room of the suite watching tfyrr try out the various pieces of furniture that nob had suggested he order brought down from storage somehow it all matchedor at least it coordinated as the main colors of the suite were warm golds and browns with gryphons forming the main theme of the carvings padded stools proved surprisingly comfortable as did an odd backless couch that nob particularly recommended and to replace the bed when tfyrr had sketched what a haspur bed looked like nob had studied the sketch for a moment and then snapped his fingers with a grin of glee he hadnt said a word to tfyrr but he had called another servantan oddly silent servantand handed him the sketch with a whispered explanation six husky men appeared about an hour later just as harperus arrived with more servants bearing tfyrrs baggage the men took the bed out without a single word and returned with something that was the closest thing to a haspur bed that tfyrr had ever seen in these human realms he stared at it mouth agape while nob grinned from ear to ear he had a suspicion that there was more to this than met the eye and his suspicion was confirmed when harperus took one look and nearly choked very well he said mustering up as much dignity as he could obviously this is not the haspur bed that it appears to be what is it nob clapped both hands over his mouth stifling a laugh you tell him my lord he said to harperus gasping inay i cant do it he turned around growing scarlet in the face obviously having a hard time containing himself tfyrr waited curiosity vying with exasperation while harperus struggled to get himself under control itsits something no wellbred boy should know about at nobs tender age harperus managed finally lets just say it isnt meant for sleeping enlightenment dawned ah a piece of mating furniture tfyrr exclaimed brightly and clicked his beak in further annoyance when both nob and harperus went off into paroxysms of smothered laughter i cannot and never will understand why the subject of mating should make these humans into sniggering idiots he thought a little irritably it is just as natural as eating and there are no whispers and giggles about enjoying ones breakfast so that explains the eversoreticent servant that found the thing in a place like this there must be a servant in charge of romantic liaisons by the winds there was probably even a division of laborone servant for discreet liaisons one for very discreet liaisons one for indiscreet liaisons one for the exotic well at least nob hadnt been so bound up in this silly human propriety nonsense that he refused to have the object sent for it might be a piece of mating equipment to these humans but it made a perfectly fine nestbed and tfyrr looked forward to having one of the first completely comfortable nights hed had in a very long time finally after many false starts the page got himself back under control although he would not or could not look harperus in the eye if you need me any more sire he told tfyrr with a decent imitation of a sober expression just ring for me ring for you tfyrr asked puzzled and nob walked over to the woodpaneled wall pulled aside a brown damask curtain and pointed to a line of gilded brass bellpulls this is the guardsthis is the kitchen if im off running an errandthis is the bath servants if im off running an errandthis is the maid in case you need something cleaned this is for meim your page now sire ill be sleeping in that little room just next to the bathroom unless you want someone older ill be your body servant too that means i dress you nob eyed the simple wrapped garment that tfyrr wore for the sake of modesty doesnt look as if theres all that much work tending to your wardrobe not really tfyrr agreed do you want to be assigned to me oh yes sire nob replied immediately and his artless enthusiasm could not be doubted theres status in it id be more than just a pageand youll be a good master sire i can tell he finished confidently tfyrr sighed i hope i can live up to that young friend he answered as much to himself as to the boy well so what are all these other bells when nob finished his explanations harperus intervened i can show him the rest young one the deliambren said easily my people built most of the complicated arrangements in this palace you go see to getting your own quarters set up yes my lord nob said obediently as tfyrr nodded confirmation of harperus suggestion thank you my lord i appreciate that as the boy whisked out of the suite harperus turned to tfyrr well now youre a sire and that lad is your entire retinue the thing to remember is that nobs duty is always to you first that means if you keep him doing things for you all the time he has no right to eat rest or even sleep tfyrrs beak fell open as he stared aghast harperus just shrugged its the way these boys are brought up he said philosophically chances are he was hired as a child of four or five and he doesnt even live with his own family anymorehe probably doesnt see them more than twice or three times a year his whole life is in palace service just remember that and if you want the boy to have any time to himself youll have to order him to take it ill keep that in mind tfyrr said absently every time i think i have seen the last of subtle human cruelties another pops up can it be that there are masters who would keep their servants so bound as to permit them no time to eat or sleep is that why he said he thought i would be a good master well come let me show you the bathing room old bird harperus said oblivious to tfyrrs thoughts youll probably like it better than the one in the wagon since this is a royal suite there should be a tub big enough for you to splash around the way you do when you find a pond the deliambren shook his head with amusement honestly you look like a wren in a birdbath when you do that i do not tfyrr responded automatically but followed harperus anyway this room was bigger than the entire traveling wagon put together tiled on the walls floor and ceiling in beige and brown the bathroom was all deliambren in its luxury every fixture sculpted into some strange floral shape the floor heated the rack for the towels heated as well the sink was big enough to bathe an infant in the tub fully large enough to have a proper haspur bath and the convenienceconvenient and discreetly placed behind its own little door the usual deliambren lighting could be made bright or dim as one chose there was even one of the deliambren waterfalls that harperus called a showerstall though it was much more luxurious than the one in the wagon there were fulllength mirrors everywhere and tfyrr kept meeting his own eyes wherever he looked the deliambren showed him the various controls then ran water into the basin there he said under the sound of the running water if theres any spies listening and im sure there are this should cover our conversation ah tfyrr nodded cautiously and pretended to finger another fixture as if he was asking questions well did this proceed as you hoped im overjoyed you could not have done better harperus told him gleefully you absolutely exceeded my wildest wishes i didnt do anything tfyrr objected feeling uncomfortable about taking praise for something hed had no hand in you kept your beak shut and let the king have his way by not giving his advisors anything to use against you that was enough harperus said now ill have to make my instructions very briefthere is one bag that isnt yours there are some devices in it that you will recognize i want you to place them around your rooms tell nob that theyre statues from your home then talk to nob about everything that happens to you that you think i should know if there are spies listening it wont matter they wont be surprised that youre asking advice from a page theyll think it shows how stupid you are and they wont know what those statues are tfyrr made a caw of distaste if they are what i think they areive seen those little eavesdroppers of yours they are hideous and you will make nob and those spies believe that my people have no artistic talent whatsoever harperus grinned and went on youll need to get directions eventually to a tavern called the freehold its owned by a deliambren and hell be your contact back to us if you need anything else he correctly interpreted tfyrrs dubious expression dont worry before the week is out people will think its odd if you havent visited there at least once its the center of social activity for every nonhuman of every rank in lyonarieand a fair number of humans as well its like jenthan square in the fortresscity you might even go there just to have a good time tfyrr nodded relieved and harperus reached over and turned the water off you may want to leave specific orders with nob for baths he said as if he was continuing an existing conversation you know how the lights work of course can you think of anything else his eyebrows signalled a wider range to that question than was implied by the circumstance tfyrr only shook his head not really he said truthfully spreading his wings a little to indicate that he understood the question for what it was i only hope i can serve theovere as well as you expect me to i am after all less of an envoy and more of a messenger of good will harperus raised his eyebrows with amusement at tfyrrs circumspect reply in that case ill leave you to settle in by yourself he said once the boy finishes with his own gear you should have him fetch a meal for the two of you youll be expected to eat in your own quarters of coursepeople are likely to be uneasy dining around anyone sporting something like that meathook in the center of your face people will be offended if i dare to actually take my meals in public with the rest of the courtiers and folk of rank after all im only a lowly nonhuman i shouldnt allow myself any airs of course tfyrr agreed allowing his irony to show im not at all surprised harperus took his leaveand tfyrr swallowed his own feeling of panic at being entirely alone in this situation and went to look for his servant he found nob putting away the last of his belongings in a snug little room just off the bathroom when he suggested food nob was not only willing he was eager suggesting to tfyrr that it was probably well past the boys usual dinnertime or else that like small males of every species he was always hungry but when nob returned with servants bearing dinner it was with many servants bearing dinner and with three of the kings advisors following behind tfyrr welcomed them quickly covering his surprise and invited them to take seats while the servants made one small table into a large table set places for all of them and vanished leaving nob to serve as their waiter if you would arrange yourselves as is proper my lords he said finally i have no idea of precedence among you except that you are all greatly above my rank i would not care to offend any of you his three unexpected dinner guests all displayed various levels of amusement lord seneschal acreon actually chuckled lord secretary atrovel a cocky little man who clearly possessed an enormous ego smirked slightly lord artificer levan pendleton only raised his eyebrows and smiled the seneschal a greying man so utterly ordinary that the only things memorable about him were his silverembroidered grey silk robes and chain of office took charge of the situation as our host sire tfyrr you must take the head of the table as the lowest in rank i must take the foot lord levan and lord atrovel both made token protests which the seneschal dismissed as they obviously expected him to lord secretary lord artificer i leave it to you to choose left or right hand the seneschal concluded atrovel a short wiry darkhaired man robed in blue and gold grinned well since no one has ever accused me of being sinister i shall take the right he punned levan pendleton cast his eyes up to the ornately painted ceiling but did not groan since i am often accused of just that it does seem appropriate he agreed taking the seat at tfyrrs left we are all here sire tfyrr in hopes of showing you that not everyone in the kings council isahdistressed by your presence acreon winced so blunt levan he chided the lord artificer only shrugged i can afford to be blunt acreon the man replied and turned again to tfyrr tfyrr found him fascinating the most birdlike human he had yet met his head sported a thick crest of greying black hair his face was sharp and his nose quite prominent perched on the nose was a pair of spectacles they enlarged his eyes and made him look very owllike the rest of the man was hidden in his silverygrey robe of state but from the way it hung on him tfyrr suspected he was cadaverously thin why can you afford to be blunt my lord tfyrr asked a bit boldly the human laughed because i am in charge of those who make strange devices sire tfyrr he replied genially no one knows if they are magical or not so no one cares to discover if i can accomplish more than i claim to be able to do that is why folk think me sinister that and the delightful little exploding toys and the cannon you have conjured atrovel said with a smirk no one wants to retire to his room only to find one of those waiting for him either oh piff levan said waving a dismissive hand theyre too easy to trace if i were going to get rid of someone id choose a much subtler weapon poison delivered in a completely unexpected manner for instance in bathwater or a bouquet of flowers it would be a fascinating experiment just to find out what kind of dosage would be fatal under those circumstances and he turned toward nob who was offering a plate of sliced meat his eyes wide as the plate thank you childand ill have some of that pudding as well there you see atrovel threw up his hands no wonder no one wants to dine with you youd poison us all just to see how we reacted he helped himself to the meat nob brought him and turned toward tfyrr levan would like to get on your good side because his worst rival is lord commerce gorode hes in charge of the manufactory guild and they are always trying to purloin artificers designs without paying for themand lord gorode already hates you just because you arent human ah tfyrr said nonplussed at this barrage of apparent honesty he hoped that harperus little devices were hearing all of this the seneschal atrovel continued pointing his fork at acreon who munched quietly on a plate of green things without saying a word is on your side because he actually thinks youre honest are you i try to be tfyrr managed and both levan and atrovel broke into howls of laughter by god this is more entertaining than court dinner levan spluttered tfyrr you must be honest or youd never have answered that way what a change from all those oily wily guild bards dare i actually ask if you are interested in music instead of advancing yourself music isis my life my lord tfyrr said simply expecting them both to break into laughter again but they didnt they both sobered and the seneschal nodded you see acreon said quietly honest and a true artist innocent as this boy heresire tfyrr i thought you might need a friend now i am certain of it i hope you will consider me to be your friend and call on me if you need something the boy cannot provide tfyrr was at an utter loss of what to say so he replied with the feeling that was uppermost at that moment thank you thank you very much lord acreon he said as sincerely as he could i am not so innocent that i do not realize that my position here is extremely delicate the king offended many of high estate today but i am the safer target for their wrath and they will probably try to vent it sooner or later innocent but not stupid levan said jabbing a fork into his meat with satisfaction i like that so atrovel why are you here anyway atrovel waved his knife airily because i enjoy seeing so many of our pompous windbagsah excuse me noble council membersdiscomfited it is no secret that i dislike most of them and am disliked in return the king trusts me because i amuse him they hate that i enjoy causing them trouble they are boring they have no imagination and they dont appreciate music that is enough for me and you appreciate music tfyrr asked although none of them really watched him eating they werent going out of their way to avoid watching him swallow down neat small bites of absolutely raw meat that was interesting although he could eat other thingsand would dine on the cooked meat on one tray soonhed deliberately chosen the raw steak as a kind of test levan snorted and picked up his goblet to drink before answering enjoy oh my dear tfyrr this is the foremost musical critic of the court or at least he thinks so i know so atrovel replied casually raising one eyebrow your performance by the way was absolutely amazing were you simulating an instrumental accompaniment with your voice so someone had noticed a very simple one tfyrr admitted a ground only i could not have replicated a harp for instance oh dont start levan interrupted i like music as well as the next man but having it dissected pah you two wait until youre alone and let the rest of us just listen without having to know what it all breaks down to fine words from one who spends his life breaking things into their components to find out how the universe runs acreon pointed out mildly he had graduated from salad to some mild cheese and unspiced meats tfyrr suspected chronic indigestion hardly surprising considering how hard he worked i prefer to leave some few things a mystery and music is one of them levan replied with dignity howeverare all your people so gifted or are you the equivalent of a bard among them tfyrr passed an astonishingly pleasant hour with the three royal advisors and after the seneschal and the artificer pled work and left spent two more equally pleasant hours discussing the technicalities of music with lord atrovel the diminutive fellow was as much of a dandy as harperus and just as certain of the importance of his own opinions but he was also scathingly witty and his observations on some of the other council members had tfyrr doubled up in silent laughter more than once when lord atrovel finally left tfyrr sent nob off to bed over the boys protests that he was supposed to help the haspur undress and unwrapped himself he let the silk wrapping fall to the floorconsciously no more picking up after himself no more going to fetch things i have to give the boy something to do or hell think he isnt doing his job this was not a situation he had anticipated to say the least he had thoughtwhen he actually let himself entertain the notion of success at allthat he might possibly end up as one of the kings private musicians he had a notion what that meant he would have been a glorified servant himself that would have been finebut this was out of all expectation he palmed the lights off and stayed awake awhile cushioned in his new bed thinking i have a servant a retainersomeone who depends on me to be a good master or a bad and has no choice but to deal with what i tell him to do what kind of a master will i make that was one worry on top of everything else could he would he become abusive he had a temper the winds knew if he lost it with this boy he could damage the child physically on the practical side he had no idea of the strength or the endurance of a human fledgling harperus had said the boy waswhat something like twelve years of age what could he do what shouldnt he do perhaps it will be safest to watch him and send him to rest at the first sign that he is tired i wonder if he can read if not i shall see to it that he learns if so i shall find out if he enjoys reading and make that one of his tasks it would be a safe way to make the boy rest even if he didnt think he should as for the task harperus had assigned to him i believe i have a far wider field of opportunity than either of us thought he would have to give this a great deal of consideration if he was going to be the kings chief musician that implied that he would be performing solo probably quite often possibly even on a daily basis he would have plenty of opportunity to sing things that just might put the king in mind of some of the duties he was neglecting i wish that i had one of the free bards here the ones that harperus says work magic he thought wistfully it would greatly help if i could use magic to reinforce that reminder if only nightingale were here she and i make such a good duoand she is a powerful worker of magic i know she must be even though harperus didnt mention her by name and it would be so good to have a real friend someone i could trust completely to be here with me as well wish for visyr and syri to come help him the free bards were all very nearly as far away as the fortresscity and his other two friends well it would be enough for the moment for him to keep the deliambrens aware of developments by means of those ugly little devices of theirs they must surely have gotten an earful tonight before the talk turned to music and that brought him to something else he really should think about lord acreon lord levan and lord atrovel out of all of the kings advisors threeadmittedly three of limited power but stillhad openly allied themselves with him the question was why had they done so the reasons were without a doubt as various as the men themselves and likely just as devious tfyrr was under no illusions each of these men had agendas of their own that allying themselves with him would further the king would certainly notice that they were openly his friends and that could hardly hurt them right now the king was not very happy with most of his advisors and while he might forget that by tomorrow he also might remember whatever had been done to lull the king into the state he was in now for the moment tfyrr had cracked it and with that crack some of their power had escaped lord acreon the seneschal tfyrr had the oddest feeling that the seneschal had meant every word he had said that he had sided with tfyrr because he thought that tfyrr was honest a real musician and needed a friend who understood the quagmire this court truly was he wasnt entirely certain if acreon actually liked him but acreon was going to help him perhaps acreon himself is not certain if he likes me i doubt that he has had much commerce with anything other than humans i wonder if i frighten him a little he does not strike me as a particularly brave man physically although i think he is very strong in the spirit i also think perhaps he does not know how strong he is could acreon be trusted probably of the three he was the one with the least to lose and the most to gain if tfyrr succeeded out of all expectation in making the king see where his duty lay he was already overburdened and uncredited for most of the work he did if the high king began acting like the ruler he was supposed to be a great deal of that burden would be lifted from the seneschals shoulders he might even be able to enjoy spiced meat again without suffering a burning belly he decided that he would make use of the seneschal in the lightest way possibleby asking advice not on difficult things but on the subject that the seneschal probably knew better than any other his fellow advisors acreon would probably tell him the truth and if the truth were too dangerous tfyrr suspected he would be able to hint well enough for the haspur to guess at the truth very well trust the seneschal as long as acreon had nothing to lose by what tfyrr was doing levan pendleton the lord artificer was a puzzle he liked music well enough he was fascinated by the workings of things and devoured facts the way a child devoured sweets those traits tfyrr was used tothe deliambrens were rather like that he is also utterly amoral he saw no difficulty in ridding himself of an enemy by murder had even boasted tonight how he would do so tfyrr adept at reading the nuance of voices if not of human expressions sensed that he meant every word he said he might even have been warning me obliquely he all but said openly that he was for sale he might have been telling me that someone might buy his services to use on me there were only two things that levan pendleton valuedfact and truth they were also the only things he cared about he had said more than once that no matter what the cost he would not conceal facts or distort the truth at least when it came to his discoveries about the workings of the world he had described as if it were only an amusing anecdote how his stand had already gotten him in serious conflict with the church and that only his rank and position had saved him from having to answer to church authority tfyrr could supply him with plenty of facts anyway he had traveled in lands that the lord artificer had never even heard of and that meant he could enlarge levans knowledge of alanda as for things closer to home the devices and machines that the artificer so loved if he could not explain the workings of deliambren machinery he could at least supply information on the workings of simpler things the staged pumps that brought water up to the highest aeries for one thing or the odd twowheeled contrivance that the velopids rode instead of horses i can probably entertain levan for months even years and as long as i entertain him i am too valuable for him to eliminate i am also too valuable for him to permit anyone else to get rid of me i can trust levan pendleton but within strict limits and those limits would be determined mostly by what tfyrr himself could or could not supply an added benefit was tfyrrs vast collection of music much of it from strange cultures levan liked music and to have someone who could not only perform it but explain the meaning or the story was something he had not anticipated this could be a very good position to be in so long as tfyrr did not overestimate the limits of his entertainment value levan pendleton would be most useful simply as a patron if people didnt like to go to dinner with himthey would also be disinclined to try to eliminate or disgrace one of his friends lord secretary atrovel now there was a puzzle he seemed completely shallow a sparkling brook that was all babble and shine on the surface but was nothing more than a lively skin of water unable to support or hold anything of value yet the man was witty and while it was possible to be witty and be stupid it wasnt very likely atrovel had access to everything the king did and said that was his job now it was probably not a bad idea to have a flippant fellow for a secretary a man who really didnt care a great deal about the correspondence and documents he handled but stilltfyrr had the feeling that that sparkling surface was not all there was to atrovel perhaps though the deepest thing about him is his pride he was certainly a man who had no doubts whatsoever about his own worth and had no modesty about it either he would be the first to tell you just how important he was that might have been what tfyrr sensed beneath the flippant exterior was a man with a deep sense of pride in himself if that was true then the worst thing one could do to lord atrovel would be to harm his pride to make him look foolish he would never forgive that and as secretary he had access to the means to take revenge certain papers could fall into the hands of an enemy perhaps certain others vanish before they could be signed lord atrovel could be trustedwarily and tfyrr would have to be very careful of that touchy little mans feelings oh this is all too much to think aboutyet there remained one more human that tfyrr sensed he must consider tonight before he slept high king theovere now therethere was a puzzle and a question more complicated than that of lord atrovel for one thing he is not sane he is not rational he has mood changes that do not necessarily correspond to what is going on around him and his ability to concentrate is not good his priorities are skewed his advisors dont care because his insanity gives them leeway to do anything they really want the problem is what caused this theovere was not the man he once was harperus had been quite emphatic about that high king theovere had been wellrespected if not precisely beloved he had kept every one of the twenty kingdoms under his careful scrutiny so what happened why did he suddenly begin to lose interest in seeing things wellgoverned was it a lack of interest was he ill in some way that simply didnt show itself on the surface there were certainly hints of that in the childishness the petulance the obsessive interest in music and other trivialities and yetand yet there was still something of the old king there as well king theovere wanted tfyrr the way a child wants a new toy yes but there was something else beneath that childish greed he is using me something in him is still vaguely aware that there is trouble in his kingdoms trouble involving nonhumans and he is using me he said so himself i am to provide an example of excellence and tolerance and i dont think the advisors are truly aware that he is using me in that way even though they heard him say so they dont believe he could still have that much interest outside his little world of bards and musicians so was there something there that tfyrr could touch perhaps even something he could awaken i think so in spite of the childishness the pettinessthere is something there i believe that i like him or rather i like what he could be there is a king inside that child still and the king wants out again at some point king theovere had been an admirable enough leader that his bodyguards were still inspired to a fanatic loyalty a man simply did not inspire that kind of loyalty just because he happened to have a title i wish i could talk to one of the bodyguards honestly tfyrr thought wistfully it would never happen though they had absolutely no reason to trust him for all they knew he was just another toy this one presented to the king by a foreigner instead of one of his advisors but a toy and a distraction nevertheless i dont want to be a toy and i especially dont want to be a distraction i want to remind him of what he was well to that end he had delved into harperus store of memorycrystals and come up with several songs about king theovere most of them werent very good which didnt exactly come as a shock since they had been composed by guild bardsbut there were germs of good ideas in there and decent if not stellar melodies i could improve the lyrics even nob could improve on some of those lyrics he could sing those and literally remind the king of what he had been and there were other songs he had picked up himself on the way songs that actually had some relevance to one of the situations the king had sloughed off into the seneschals hands i can certainly sing those songs that raven and the rest wrote about duke arden of kingsfordhow he saved all those people during the fire how hes beggaring himself to rebuild his city that should get his attention where reports wont and if tfyrr got his attention he just might be moved to do something about the situation if i put a situation in front of him in musicah yes that is a good idea and who better to suggest such situations than the man who would otherwise have to take care of themlord seneschal acreon oh now there was an idea calculated to make the seneschal happier hell help this is exactly the kind of help that he has been looking fori would willingly bet on it the only problem is that if anyone besides acreon figures out what im doing theyll know im not just a blankbrained musician theyll know im getting involved and i might be dangerous which will make me even more of a target than i was already well that couldnt be helped he had made a promise and a commitment and it was time to see them through now i have a plan now i have a real means to do what harperus wants me to and i have a chance to redeem myself in the process to counter the evil i have already done suddenly the tension in his back and wing muscles relaxed as it always did when he had worried through a problem and found at least the beginnings of a solution that was all he needed to be able to sleep in the next instant all the fatigue that hed been holding off unconsciously descended on him ah i didnt realize i was so tired he was already in the most comfortable nest hed had in ages and in the most comfortable sleeping position hed had since hed begun traveling with harperus this nest is very good very very good i dont think i want to move it was just as well that he was settled in for as soon as he stopped fighting off sleep it stooped down out of the darkness upon him and carried him awayto dreams of falling iron manacles and screams midnight youd think the city would be quiet it wasnt though the rumble of cartwheels on cobblestones persisted right up until dawn and a deeper rumble of the machineries turned by the swiftly moving river water permeated even ones bones nightingale perched like her namesake on the roof of freehold staring out into the darkness at the lights across the street no deliambren lights thesethough they were clever enough shed noticed them earlier this evening just outside the building where two of them stood like sentinels on either side of the door some kind of special aira gaswas what these lights burned one of her customers had told her that it was piped into them from somewhere else and burned with a flame much brighter than candles without the flicker of a candle with lights like that you wouldnt have to wait for daylight to do your work no you could work all night or better still you could have someone else work all night for you there were similar lights burning inside that huge building but not as many as the owner would like he would have been happier if the whole place was lit up as brightly as full day only a few folk worked inside that building at night those who cleaned the place and serviced the machines nightingale leaned on the brick of the low wall around the roof rested her chin on her hands and brooded over those lovely clear cursed lights and all they meant she had learned more in her brief time here than she had ever anticipated and most of it was completely unexpected when she had arrived here she had been working under the assumption that the free bards and the nonhumans chiefest enemies were going to be the church and the bardic guild that if anyone was behind the recent laws being passed it would be those two powers it made sense that wayif the high king really was infatuated with music and musicians it made sense for the most influential power in his court to be the bardic guild and the bardic guild and the church worked handinglove back in rayden well they have gotten a completely unprecedented level of power that much is true but the bardic guild was by no means the most important power in the court they werent even as important as they thought they were no the most important power in this place is across the street in those buildings in the hands of the men who own them the merchants who owned and managed the various manufactories were individually as powerful and wealthy as many nobles but they had not stopped there no seeing the power that an organization could wield they had banded together to form something they called the manufactory guild it was no guild at all in the accepted sense there was no passing on of skills and trade secrets no fostering of apprentices no protection of the old and infirm members no this was just a grouping of men with a single common interest profit not that i blame them there everyone wants to prosper its just that they dont seem to care how much misery they cause as long as they personally get their prosperity and the manufactory guild was now more powerful than the bardic guild and even many of the trade guilds they even had their own lord advisor to the king their agenda was pretty clear they certainly didnt try to hide it they tended to oppose free access to entertainment in general simply because entertainment got in the way of working they wanted to outlaw all public entertainment in the streets whether it be by simple juggler free bard or guild bard they had laws up for consideration to do just that too and some very persuasive people arguing their case pointing out how crowds around entertainers clogged the streets and disrupted traffic how work would stop if an entertainer set up outside a manufactory how people were always coming in late and leaving early in order to see a particular entertainer on his corner there was just enough truth in all of it to make it seem plausible logical reasonable oh yes very reasonable they had another law up for consideration as well a law that would allow the employers at these manufactories to set working hours around the clock seven days a week it seemed very reasonable againand here was the example right across the street there was no reason why people couldnt be working all night not with these wonderful clear lights available it would be no hardship to them not the way working by candlelight or lamplight would be it was the church that opposed this law it was the church that decreed the hours during which it was permissible to work in the first place and the conditions for working church law mandated that sevenday be a day for rest and religious services church law forbade working after sundown except in professions such as entertainment on the grounds that god created the darkness in order to ensure that man had peace in which to contemplate god and to sleepor at least rest from his labors so he could contemplate god with his full attention the manufactory guild wanted a law that permitted them to hire children as young as nine on a multitude of groundsand nightingale had heard them all so that children can be a benefit to their families instead of a burden so that families with many children can feed all of them instead of relying on charity so that children can learn responsibility at an early age to keep children out of the street and out of wickedness and idleness oh it all sounds very plausible except of course that one would not have to pay a child as much as an adult a family desperate enough to force its nineyearold child into work would be desperate enough to take whatever wage was offered and that child who supposedly was learning to read and write from his chapel priest would be losing that precious chance at education there were churchsanctioned exceptions to the lawchildren were allowed to be hired as pages or messengers and to help their parents in a business or a farm but all of those exceptions were hedged about with a vast web of carefully tailored precepts that kept abuse of those exceptions to a relative minimum and all those exceptions required that the child receive his minimum education you cant keep a childs parents from working him to death or from abusing him in other ways but you can at least keep a stranger from doing so that was basically the reasoning of the church which decreed the completely contradictory precepts that a child was sacred to god and that a child was the possession and property of his parents then theres that lovely little item the job security law that was a law that specifically forbade a worker in a manufactory from quitting one job to take anothereffectively keeping him chained to the first job he ever took for the rest of his life unless his employer chose otherwise or got rid of him that one had yet to be passed as well but there was very little opposition and the moment it was it would mean the complete loss of freedom for anyone who went to work in a manufactory they say that retraining someone is costly and dangerous since folk in a manufactory are generally operating some sort of machinery oh surely machinery no more complicated than a spinning wheel but i would think that to most people who think a wellpump is very complicated machinery theyd look at the manufactories and agree that having an inexperienced person operating machinery could be very dangerous as if most of what ive been watching people actually do was any more complicated than digging potatoes but the manufactory guild wanted to keep that ignorance intact and here the church itself was divided one group saw clearly the way this would take freedom away from anyone who worked in those places leaving them virtual slaves to their jobs but the other group was alarmed at the wild tales painted of accidents caused by inexperience and was in favor of the law she shifted her position turning her back on the lights of the manufactory to stare up at the sky you didnt see as many stars here as you could in the country she didnt know why maybe it was all the smoke from the thousands of chimneys getting in the way like a perpetual layer of light clouds the nastiest piece of work shed heard about was something that so far was only a rumor but it was chilling enough to have been the sole topic of conversation tonight all over freehold this wassupposedlya proposed law that had the support of not only some of the church but the manufactory guild and the trade guilds as well they called it the law of degree nightingale shivered a chill settling over her that the warm breeze could not chase away even the name sounded ominous it would set a standard a list of characteristics which would determine just how human someone could be considered based on his appearance but the standard was only the beginning of the madness for it would mandate that those who were considered to be below a certain degree of humanity were nothing more than animals in other words property bad enough that such things as being indentured are allowed everywhere and that slavery is sanctioned in at least half the twenty kingdoms the church at least has laws that govern how slaves are treated and an indentured servant has the hope of buying himself free but thisthis would be slavery with none of the protections after all it wouldnt be reasonable to have a law stating that a man couldnt beat his dog so why have one saying he cant beat his mintak deliambrens for instance would be considered human under the lawbut mintaks and haspur with their hides of hair and feathers their nonhuman hands and feet their muzzles and beaks would be animals some people were arguing that as property these nonhumans would actually have protection they did not have nowprotection from persecution by the church animals by church canon could not be evil because they had no understanding of the difference between good and evil it was also argued that some of the violence done to nonhumans in the pastthe beatings and ambusheswould end if this law was passed because since they would then be the property of a human anyone harming one of them would have to pay heavy restitution to the owner naturally all those nonhumans not falling within the proper degree of humanity would have their property confiscatedcattle cant own homes or businesses of courseand both they and their property would be taken by the crown im sure that never entered the lord treasurers consideration and of course as soon as the ink was dry on the confiscation orders the crown would then have itself a nice little animal auction more money in the kings coffers and it wouldnt even be slavery which is wicked and really not civilized nasty insidious and very popular in some quarters yes it would protect the nonhumans from the demon hunters for a little whileuntil church canon was changed to make it possible for animals to be considered possessed which it would be after all its in the holy writ there were the demons possessing a human that were cast out and then possessed a herd of pigs and made the pigs drown themselves small wonder that the manufactory guild was also behind this one at least according to the rumors if it was passed the owners of manufactories could neatly bypass all the church laws on labor by acquiring a nightshift of animals to run the machines without wages there was no church law saying animals couldnt work all nightnor any church law giving them a rest day if it passed well most of the nonhumans would flee before they could be caught i suspect but there are always those who cant believe that something like that would happen to them there would probably be just enough of those poor naive souls and their children in lyonarie to make up a workforce large enough to work the manufactories at night there would be a business in hunters too springing up in the wake of this law hunters no more like kidnappers they would be going out and trying to entrap nonhumans in whichever of the other human kingdoms existed that did not pass this law and bringing them back here to sell nightingale clutched her hands into fists and felt her nails biting into the palms of her hands if she ever found out who the nasty piece of work was that first came up with this idea she would throttle him herself with my bare hands and dance on his corpse she told herself she had to relax at the moment it was no more than a rumor and she had only heard about it here no one had mentioned it in the high kings servants kitchen this morning nor even in the chapels friendly to all species it might be nothing it might only be a distortion of one of the other laws being considered it might even be a rumor deliberately started by the church in order to make some of the other things they were trying to have passed look less unappetizing or to allow them to slip something else past while the nonhumans are agitating about the rumor she would wait until the morning and see what was in the kitchens and on the street she took a deep breathafter a first cautious sniff to make sure that the wind was not in the wrong direction she let it out again slowly exhaling her tension with her breath this was an old exercise one that was second nature to her now as always it worked as did her mental admonition that there was nothing she could do now this moment it would have to wait until tomorrow so she might as well get the rest she needed to deal with it when she finally felt as if she would be able to sleep she got to her feet and picked her way across the rooftop avoiding the places where she knew that some of her fellow staff might be sheltering together starwatching supposedly the deliambren who owned this place was considering a rooftop dining area but so far nothing had materialized and the staff had it all to themselves and a good thing too the streets hereabouts arent safe for starwatching or nighttime strolls before bed when customers of wealth came here they came armed or they came with guards not only were there thieves in plenty but there were people who hated those who were not human who would sometimes lie in wait to attack customers coming in or out of freehold they seldom confined their beatings to nonhumansthey were just as happy to get their hands on a fuzzylover and teach him a lesson about the drawbacks of tolerance once or twice a week some of the staff would turn the tables on them but that was a dangerous game for it was difficult to prove who was the attacker and who the victim in a case like that if the nightwatch happened to hear the commotion and come to break it up instead of running the other way as they often did the freehold staff often found themselves cooling their heels in gaol until someone came to pay their fines the law was just as likely to punish freehold staff as the members of the gang that had ambushed the customers nightingale was still ambivalent about joining one of those expeditions she could add a good margin of safety for the group if she used bardic magic to make gang members utterly forget who their attackers had been but if she was caught doing something like that and fell into the hands of the church flame is not my best color she thought trying to drive away fear with flippancy she reached the roof door to the staircase going down and turned to take one last look up at the stars and she thought oddly enough of tfyrr i am glad he is safe with old owl the deliambren she thought soberly if any of the rumors are true he would be in grave danger at least with harperus he has protection and a quick way out of any danger that should come so at least one person she cared for was safe and with that thought to comfort her she took the stairs down to the staff quarters and to her empty bed chapter five nightingale slipped out into the early morning mist by way of a back staircase she had learned about it from one of the waiters the second day of her arrival at freehold it was mostly in use by night rather than by day it locked behind you as you went out but nightingale had learned from that waiter that she already had a key every staff member had a ring of keys they got when they settled in nightingale didnt know even yet what half of them went to but one of them locked the door to her room and one unlocked this back staircase door she had visited the usedclothing market soon after setting up her network of children and had acquired a wardrobe there that she really didnt want too many people in freehold to know about it was not in keeping with lyrebird or with the sober and dignified woman she had portrayed herself as when she arrived in fact she rather doubted that she would have had a hearing if shed shown up at the door in these patched and worn clothes they were clean scrupulously clean but they did not betoken any great degree of prosperity that was fine she wasnt trying to look prosperous she was trying to look like the kind of musician who would be happy to sing in the corner of a kitchen in exchange for a basket of leftovers she made one concession to city life that she hoped no one would notice for it was quite out of keeping with her costume she wore shoes she had no stockings and the shoes were as patched as her skirts but she did have them and no one as poor as she was supposed to be would own such a thing but im not going out into a mucky street or traipse around on cobblestones all day without something to protect my feet she thought stubbornly as she crossed the street headed east skipped over a puddle and skirted the edge of a heap of something best left unidentified there was just so much she would do to protect her persona and there was such a thing as carrying authenticity too far she did not carry a harp at all only a pair of bones and a small handdrum the only things a musician as poor as she would be able to afford the mist here beneath the overhanging upper stories of the buildings chilled the skin and left clothing damp and clammy but in an hour or so it would be horribly hot and the one advantage this costume had was that it was the coolest clothing she had to wear other than the elven silks that was mostly because the fabric was so threadbare as to be transparent in places it was all of a light beige impossible to tell what the original color had been now the skirt had probably once been a sturdy hempen canvas but now was so worn and limp that it hung in soft folds like cheesecloth and was as cool to wear as the most finely woven linen she didnt have a bodice no woman this poor would own one nor did she have a shirt only a shift which if she really was this impoverished would serve as shirt petticoat and nightclothes all one it was sleeveless darned in so many places she wondered if any of the original fabric was left and had at one time been gathered at the neck with a ribbon now it was gathered at the neck with a colorless string tied in a limp little bow she hurried along the streets sometimes following in the wake of one of the watercarts that was meant to clean the streets of debris and wash it all into the gutters in the better parts of town that was probably what it did dobut the streetcleaners were paid by the number of streets they covered and every time they had to go back to the river fillingstation to get more water they lost time so in this neighborhood the water sprinkling the street was the barest trickle scarcely enough to dampen the cobbles and certainly not enough to wash anything into the gutters those few businesses who cared about appearances like freehold sent their own people out to wash the street in front of the building and there were those who lived here who didnt particularly care for having garbage festering at the front door who did the same but mostly she had to pick her way carefully along the paths worn clean by carts and ragpickers as the light strengthened and the mist thinned she got into some better neighborhoods and now she took advantage of the directions her children had given her slipping along alleyways and between buildings following the paths that only the children knew completely even the finest of estates had these little back ways the means to get into the best homes so long as you came by the servants entrance where no one who mattered would see you even the palace they can put gates across the roads and guard the streets all they like but even the palace has to have an alley even the palace has to have a way for people to come and gopeople that the lords and ladies dont want to know exist rat catchers peddlers ragandbone men dung collectors pot scrubbers and floor scrubbers and the laundry women who did the lower servants clothing garbage collectors there was a small army of people coming and going through that back entrance every day people who didnt live at the palace despite the huge servants quarters but who lived off the palace even the garbage from the palace was valuable and there was an entire system of bribes and kickbacks that determined who got to carry away what the church actually got the best pickings of the edible stuff and sent the lowest of the novices to come fetch it every day they carried away baskets of leftovers from the royal kitchens that fed the lords and ladies and the king himself allegedly those went to feed the poor nightingale hadnt seen any evidence for or against that none of these people were good enough to warrant the expense of clothing them in uniforms and housing them in the palace they got their tiny wages and whatever they could purloin and came and went every day at dawn and dusk they never saw a lord or a ladythe most exalted person they would ever see would be a page in royal livery but oh they knew what was going on in that great hive and better than the lords and ladies who lived there each of them had a friend or a relative who did rate quarters above and each of them was a veritable wellspring of information about just what was going on gossip was almost their only form of entertainment so gossip they did till the kitchens and lower halls buzzed like beehives with the sounds of chattering very few of them ever got to hear even a streetsinger no one was out in the morning when they would scamper in to work and by the time they went home in the evening it was generally in a fog of exhaustion sevenday was the day for church services and if one picked the right chapel and began at morningsong and stayed piously on through vespers the priest would see that piety was rewarded with three stout meals no streetsinger could compete with all the beanbread onions and bacon grease to spread on the bread that one could eat and a cup of real ale to wash it down sometimes on holy days there were even treats of a bit of cheese cooked whole turnips cabbage soup or a sweetcake all the more reason to come early and stay late and if one happened to doze off during the sermon well sevenday was a day of rest wasnt it so when a poor musician like tanager showed up looking for a corner to sit in asking nothing more than the leftovers that the kitchen staff i shared she was generally welcomed as long as she didnt get in the way and didnt eat too much her singing would help pass the time and make the work seem lighter and one just might be able to learn a song or two to sing the little ones to sleep with so in the corner tanager sat drumming and singing and between songs listening to the gossip that automatically started up the moment that silence began now the alley was hemmed on both sides by high walls walls with tantalizing hints of trees and other greenery on the other side nightingaleor tanagerjoined the thin stream of other threadbare tiredlooking people all making their way up this long dark alley some of them rubbing their reddened eyes and yawning all of them heading for their jobs at the palace there was nothing at the end of this corridor of brickwork open to the sky but a gate that led to the palace grounds by now she was elbowtoelbow with the palace servants none of whom were distinguished by anything like a livery no one ever saw these people but other servants after all she slipped inside the back gate with the others completely ignored by the fat bored guard there whose only real job was to keep things from leaving the palace not from entering it now she saw the first real sunlight shed seen this morning the cobblestoned courtyard and kitchen garden was open to the sky here the sun had already burned away the mist and she squinted against its glare as she stared across the courtyard to the great stone bulk of the palace dark against the blue sky with the sun peeking over it she had no real idea just how big the palace was huge that was all she knew for certainat least the size of several freeholds from all she had been able to gather this was only one building of several all joined by glazed galleries and all as big as this one was it made her head swim just to think about it she paused just a moment to take in a breath of fresh air before she headed for the back door to the servants kitchen the servants of course were never fed out of the same kitchen that conjured up the meals for the lords and ladies in fact there were two kitchens that fed the servants upper and lower upper kitchen was the one that fed the pages the personal maids and valets the court musicians nannies and nursemaids tutors and governesses all those who were not quite real servants but who were not gentry either lower was for the real servants anyone who cleaned cooked sewed polished served food and drink washed mended or tended to animals or plants tanager would never have dared intrude on the upper servants kitchen lower was where she fit in and lower was where she went she needed that breath of fresh air when she got there as usual it was as hot as a priest personal hell in there with all the ovens going baking bread for afternoon and evening meals before it got too warm to keep the ovens stoked breakfast bread had been baking all night of course and tanagers arrival was greeted right at the door by one of the undercooks with enthusiasm and a warm roll that had a scraping of salted lard melting inside it tanager got out of the doorway and ate the roll quickly as would anyone for whom this would be a real breakfast then she hurried across the slate floor and took her seat out of the way off in a corner of the kitchen that seemed to be an architectural accident a bit of brickwork that might have served as a closet if it had been bigger and might have served as a cupboard if it had been smaller and really wasnt right for either before she had come to sing there had been a small table there you could put a stack of towels there or a few of the huge pans needed to cook the enormous meals they prepared hereor tanager there were other places for the towels and pans now the wedgeshaped corner held a stool for her to sit on the kitchen was a huge brickwalled room lit by open windows and the fires of three enormous fireplaces where soup and stew cooked in kettles as big around as a beer barrel there were five big tables and counters beneath the windows where the cooks and their helpers worked no fancy pastry cooks here the fare dished out to the lower servants was the same day in day out soup and stew made with meat left from yesterday sent from the upper servants kitchen bread peaseporridge and oatporridge on special occasions leftover sweets came over from the upper servants kitchen as wellbreakfast sweets came over at noon lunchsweets at dinner and dinnersweets appeared when all the cleaning up had been accomplished by way of a treat and a reward for the extra hours so far tanager hadnt seen any of those tanager thought long and hard as she settled herself on her stool this was the first time she had needed to hear about something specific something as odd as the law of degree was not going to come up in normal conversation and im not going to ask about it myself that leaves only one option ill have to use bardic magic to coax it out of them tanager was a simple girl nightingale was anything but easy in her power and comfortable with it she had been using bardic magic for as long as she had been on her own on the road often she had no choice the use of bardic magic to influence the minds of those around her had sometimes been the only way she had gotten out of potentially dangerous situations living with the elves had refined her techniques since bardic magic was similar to one of their own magics now she scarcely had to think about tapping into the power she simply stretched out her mind and there it was i need a song as a vehicle something that includes nonhumans but nothing too jarring to start with something they would enjoy listening to under ordinary circumstances and it will have to be something with a strong beat as well since i only have the drum to accompany me ah i know that song raven wrote good duke arden it has several verses about arden taking care of nonhumans in his train so she began with that then moved on to other melodies songs that dealt with nonhumans in a favorable light and all the while she sang she concentrated on one thing talk about the nonhumans what the lords and ladies are saying about them she sat and sang and drummed until her wrist and voice tired one of the pot scrubbers with an empty dishpan and nothing better to do at the moment brought her a cup of flat ale tanager pretended to drink it but it really went down a crack at her feet and while she drank she listened there was nothing at all in the gossip about the law of degree but there was something that made her sit up straight in startlement la delia did ye see th lad wi all the snowwhite hair him an his coach with no horses come in yestereen asked one of the undercooks faith tis all msister her as is chambermaid t lord pelhams nannies can talk about lad with all the hair coach with no horses dear lady that cant beoh surely not coo ye shoulda seen what came w him said another one of the chief cooks tis a great bird man twas w wings an all an a great evil beak like a hawk i the middlev his face an claws i wouldn want t get on the wrong side uv him tanager sat frozen her hands wrapped around her empty cup it was it was harperusand with him tfyrr it must be but why here and why now ah but ye havent heard the best of it said a third girl knowingly my second cousin is best friend t lord atrovels secretarys valet an this birdyman like to set the whole court on its ear as tanager sat in stunned silence the girl gleefully told the entire story while the rest of the kitchen worked and put in a word or two of commentary according to the girl a nonhuman who had to be a deliambren from the description and another who was either tfyrr or another of his race had come in yesterday afternoon to court they had been announced as some kind of envoy and at that point for a reason that the girl either didnt know or couldnt explain the birdman broke into song from there her version differed slightly from the ones offered by a few others the others claimed that the birdman had challenged the kings musicians to a contest and had won it the girl maintained that he had simply begun singing as a sample of what he could do at any rate when it was all over the king had appointed the birdman to be his chief musician the others claimed laurel bard the rest of the court musicians were furious no one differed on that and most of the kings advisors were beside themselves over the fact that the king had overruled them ah but if the first girl was to be believed the king had not only appointed the haspurfor it must be a haspur even if it wasnt tfyrras his chief musician he had appointed him directly to the royal household made a sire out of him and installed him in a suite in the royal wing of the palace i only hoped to hear something about the law of degree tanager thought dazedly not this could it be tfyrr and old owl she didnt know of any other haspur and deliambrens traveling together but why would they come here why am i here whoever these strangers are it is for the same reason surely now she was very grateful that she had been so careful to keep her real identity and purpose here a secret with two sets of agents blundering about it would have been appallingly easy for them to trip each other up now i need only watch for them and avoid getting entangled in whatever scheme they have going oh yes need only if it is harperus that will be like trying to avoid the garbage in the streets hes more clever than twenty gypsies in his own way and encompasses everyone he meets in his grand plots in some way or another ah well at least he doesnt know im here i just hope he doesnt get tfyrr in trouble somehow she managed to pull herself together and continue singing and playing for the rest of the morning that was all the time she ever spent hereand that was reasonable for tanager mornings were fairly useless for a streetmusician the afternoon meant better pickings and tanager would now presumably go on to whatever street corner she had staked out as her own there she could expect to earn hard currency for her work pins mostly with a sprinkling of copper coins and some food as usual she spread out a threadbare napkin and the chief cook filled it with her paymostly leftover bread with a bit of bacon and a scrap of cheese some of last nights roast from the upper servants kitchen that was too tough and stringy to even go into soup today tanager thanked her with a little bobbing curtsey tied it all up into a bundle and slipped out the door just in time to avoid the lunchtime rush she always hurried across the cobbles to the gate but today she had more reason to halfrun than usual she wanted to find out if anyone in the city had heard anything about the birdman or the law of degree and to that end there were two places she needed to go first as nightingale the chapel of saint gurd second the square just down the street from freehold where she generally met maddy and the rest of her army of urchins just after lunch surely between them father ruthvere or the children would have heard or seen something and at the moment she was not certain whether she wanted to hear more about the law of degree ortfyrr if that was who the feathered wonder was nightingale slipped back into freehold by the back door feeling quite frustrated there had been nothing worth bothering about in the way of news at the chapel the priest father ruthvere had heard nothing about a law of degree but he promised nightingale fiercely that he would do his best to find out about it father ruthvere was something of an odd character and nightingale never would have trusted him with her true bardname if it had not been that he had recognized her free bard ribbons during one of her visits not as tanager and had asked her how master wren and lady lark were faring it turned out that he had some sort of connection to that cousin of talaysens who was also in the church he had been promoted to his own chapel here and he had promised priest justiciar ardis when he was sent on to lyonarie that he would keep an eye out for free bards and help them when he could that in itself was either an example of how small a world it truly wasor that there was something in the way of fate dogging her footsteps the convoluted twists that this little mission of hers was taking were beginning to make her head spin for the meantime however father ruthvere was an ally she was only too glad to have found he was one of the faction that followed the we are all brothers faith and that made him doubly valuable to her and vice versa he knew what was going on to a limited extent within the churchshe had her information from the street and the court together they found they could put together some interesting wholes out of bits and pieces maddy and her crew hadnt come up with anything either though as usual they were glad enough for her bag of leftovers and the pennies she gave them all the only thing that one of the boys knew was that his brother had actually seen the horseless wagon on its way to the palace it had not been pulled or pushed by any beasts and from the description it could have been the wagon that harperus used but then again she thought to herself as she scrambled up the staircase wouldnt any deliambren wagon look like any other i dont know for a fact that harperus is the only one traveling about the countryside but would any other deliambren have a haspur with him she slipped down the hall making certain first that there was no one around to catch her in her tanager disguise then unlocked the door to her room and whisked inside i dont even know that its a haspur she told herself thinking out loud there is more than one birdrace and most of them would match the description that girl gave it could be anyone in fact its just not likely that its harperus and tfyrr but as she changed out of her tanager clothing and headed for the bathroom for a needed sluicing she couldnt help but think thatgiven the way that things were goingthe fact it wasnt likely was the very reason why it would turn out to be her friends she drifted down the stairs in one of her rainbowskirts the blue one this time today lyrebird was in a casual mood and had dressed accordingly actually today lyrebird was ravenous and wanted to be able to eat without worrying about delicate dagging and fragile lace she had missed her lunch in order to fit in a stop at father ruthveres chapel and shed given all those leftovers to the children without saving even a roll for herself not that she had been hungry enough for stale rolls and stringy beef her stay here had spoiled her there had been plenty of times when those leftovers would have been a feast well plenty of times in the long past when she was between villages and her provisions had run out maybe nightingale had never been so poor a musician that shed had to sing for leftovers this hour was too late for lunch and a bit too early for dinner only a few of the eating nooks were open and operating and all of those were on the ground floor lyrebird went to one of her favorites where the cook was a merry little man with no use of his lower limbs because of an illness as a child not that he let it get in the way of his work he was a cook after all and he didnt need to move much he plied his trade very well from a stationary seat within a halfcircle of roundbottomed pans all heated on deliambren braziers to the sizzling point you picked out what you wanted from a series of bins of fresh vegetables and strips of fowl fish and meat in bowls sunk in ice and brought it to him in your bowl he would quickfry it in a bit of oil spice it according to your taste and serve it all to you on a bed of rice scooped out of the huge steamer behind him if he wasnt busy he was always happy to talk nightingale was always happy to talk to him and this time of day she was often his only customer well lyrebird youre eating like a bird indeed todaytwice your weight in food youre eating like dear little violetta he winked at that most of the staff found violetta amusing the name was female and surely the little misfit dressed like a woman but there wasnt a person on the staff who was fooled no matter freehold was full of misfits and if violetta wanted to dress in fantastic gowns and gossip like one of the servingwenches no one here would ever let her know that they had seen past the disguise skip your breakfast derfan asked eyeing the size of the bowl she had picked up at the start of the bins and lunch she confirmed bringing him her selection and taking a seat on one of the stools nearby to watch him work he had the most amazingly quick hands she would have scorched everything or herself but derfan never spoiled a meal that she had ever heard and he never once burned himself either he pursed his lips and shook his head at her thats very bad of you youll do yourself harm if you make that a habit i should think youd be ready to faint dead away what was so important that you had to skip two meals that business with that new law people were so upset about last night she replied casually since it had been the talk of freehold there was no reason why she should not have been out looking for confirmation i know a good priest who keeps his ear to the ground and hears a great deal but hes halfway across the city and derfan prompted dashing in bits of seasoning and a spot of oil while he tossed her food deftly on the hot metal he hadnt heard a thing she told him im halfway convinced now that it was a rumor being spread so that our good leaders can slip something else into law while we are out chasing our tails over this could be could be derfan agreed nodding vigorously it wouldnt be the first time theyve done things that way the jovial man grinned infectiously as he ladled some juices here and there but weve got enough excitement right here in freehold to keep everyone stirred up for the next few days and never mind some maybeso maybeno law out there she shook her head as he handed her the bowl full of rice and stirfried morsels i havent been here remember she said fanning the food to cool it and daring a quick bite it was too hot and she quickly sucked in cool air to save her tongue our leaders shown up derfan raised both eyebrows at her she wrinkled her brow unable to guess his meaning our real boss derfan elaborated the one kyran works for he sighed when she shook her head blankly tyladen the deliambren the owner of freehold hes here she stopped blowing on her food and looked up at him sharply no she said i thought he never came here oh this is too much she thought as derfan nodded and shrugged not one but two deliambrens showing up in the space of a single day what is this a conspiracy is everyone around here involved in some kind of plot it isnt that he never comes here its just that he doesnt do it often derfan told her as she applied herself grimly to her food again maybe hes decided he ought to seeing as theres been all that law talk maybe its about time he did toohes the one with all the money precious little you and me could do if the high king decides to make trouble for our friends but deliambrens have got the stuff that the high and mighty want and that means they have money and a reason for the lords and ladies to listen to em theyve used that kind of influence before ive heard well if he wants to have any customers hed better get involved i suppose she agreed mildly now what what happens if he recognizes me i didnt recognize his name but that doesnt mean he doesnt know me ive met a lot of deliambrens and i dont remember half of them damn the last thing i want is some wealthy fuzzyfaced halfwit breathing down my neck right now watching everything i do and wanting to know why i havent found out more as if to confirm her worst fears derfan had even more news about tyladen word is derfan said in a confidential tone that tyladens going to make the rounds of the whole place tonight look in on all the performers the cooks and all see how theyre doing see how many customers theyre bringing in well you have no worry on that score nightingale pointed out derfan blushed but nightingale spoke nothing but the truth derfans little corner was always popular since his customers always knew what was in the food he fixed for them some of them like the mintak were herbivorous and could not digest meat in addition the food was ready quickly and if you were very hungry you didnt have to spend a lot of time waiting for someone to prepare your dinner the way you did in some of the other little nooks you dont either from what ive heard he countered youre very popular she shrugged usually i would agree with you but any musician can have a bad night it would be my luck that tonight would be the one derfan snorted i doubt it he began a bad night for you is a terrific night for some other people around here and he interrupted himself turn around there he is out on the dance floor looking up at the lightrigs on the ceiling she turned quickly and got a good view of the mysterious tyladen as he stood with his hands on his hips peering up at the ceiling four floors above and to her initial relief she didnt recognize him he was much younger than she had thought although age was difficult to measure in a deliambren the skin of his face was completely smooth and unwrinkled even at the corners of the eyes and mouth he was dressed quite conservatively for a deliambren in a onepiece garment of something that looked like black leather but probably wasnt with a design in contrasting colors appliqued from the right shoulder to the left hip and down the right leg his hair was relatively short no longer than the top of his shoulders and so were his cheekfeathers although she could have used his eyebrows for whisk brooms he dropped his eyes just as she took the last of this in and she found herself staring right into them for one frozen moment she thought she saw a flash of recognition there but if she had in the next instant it was gone again he waved his hand slightly in acknowledgement of the fact that he knew they were both watching him and they were his employees then went back to staring at the ceiling ignoring them but now she was so keyed up she even read that as evidence that he was going to try to interfere in her careful and cautious plans she finished her dinner quickly thanked derfan and hurried up to the oak grove certain that tyladen was going to show up there and demand an explanation but as the evening wore on and nothing happenedother than violetta showing up as if derfans earlier mention of her had conjured hershe began to feel a bit annoyed granted she really didnt want some deliambren meddling in her affairs but she wasnt sure she liked being ignored either when tyladen finally did show up it was during the busiest part of her evening and she was in the middle of a set she didnt even realize he was there until she looked up in time to see him nod with satisfaction turn and walk out the door just that that was all there was to it her shift came to an end without anything more happening and none of her customers had any more information about either the law of degree or the mysterious birdman at the high kings court not even violetta who knew or at least pretended to know something about everything had anything to say on either subject on her way upstairs she stopped at a little nook that sold prebaked goods and got a couple of meat rolls and an apple tart to take up to her room half expecting to be intercepted between her room and the oak grove no one materialized though and no one was waiting in her room she ate and cleaned up and finally went to bed feeling decidedly odd she was just as happy that she wasnt going to be interfered with but after getting herself all upset about the prospect to find that she was being ignored was a bitannoying but thats a deliambren for you she decided as she drifted off to sleep if they arent annoying by doing something theyre bound to annoy you by not doing it tfyrr checked the tuning on his small flatharp nervously for the fifth time he had decided this morning what he was going to perform for this his first private concert for the high king and he was going to need more accompaniment than even his voice could produce the flatharp would be ideal though for the songs he had selected were all deceptively simple he had wanted to do something to remind the king of his duty he had found he thought precisely the music that would he had modified one of those songs about the king himself for his first piecenot changing any of the meaning just perfecting the rhyme and rhythm both of which were rather shaky but from there he would be singing about duke arden of kingsford a series of three songs written since the fire by a free bard called raven the first was the story of the fire itself describing how the duke had worked with his own bare hands in the streets side by side with his people to hold back the fire while not the usual stuff of an epic it was a story of epic proportions and worthy of retelling let him hear that and perhaps it will remind him that a rulers duty is to his people and not the other way around if nothing else it might remind the king of duke ardens straitened circumstances better than a cold report would that might pry the help out of him that the duke had been pleading for that will make the lord seneschal happy at any rate the second was a song about the first winter the city had endured a saga as grueling though not as dramatic as the fire it described the lengths to which arden went to see that no one died of hunger or lack of shelter that season the third and final song described not only arden but his betrothed the lady phenyx asher a love story wound in and around what the two of them were doing with their own hands to rebuild the city actually it is more about the lady than about the duke raven truly admires her and his words show it the next songs were all carefully chosen to do nothing more than entertain and show off tfyrrs enormous range a couple of them were not even from human composers at all and the last song was another designed to remind the king of his dutiesfor it had been written by another high king on his deathbed and was called the burden of the crown though sad it was a hopeful song as well for the author had clearly not found the crown to be a burden that was intolerable merely one that was a constant reminder of the people it represented if that doesnt do it nothing will tfyrr thought then sighed well i suppose i should not expect results instantly i am not a gypsy with magic at my command if he only listens to the words it will be a start he had been given nothing whatsoever to do except practice and wait for the king to send for him he hadnt especially wanted to venture out of his suite either not until the king had heard him play at least once he had spent all his time pacing exercising his wings and practicing nob had enjoyed the virtuoso vocalists practice but the pacing and wingstrokes clearly made him nervous he had sought his room when tfyrr suggested that he might want to go practice his reading and writing for his daily lessons with the pages tutor finally the summons had come this afternoon and nob brought tfyrr to this little antechamber to the kings personal suite a room with white satin walls and furnished with a few chairs done in white satin and gilded wood there he was to wait until the king called for him it seemed he had been waiting forever at last when he was about to snap a string from testing them so often the door opened and a liveried manservant beckoned tfyrr rose to his feet harp under one arm and followed him the tension of waiting replaced by an entirely new set of worries as it happened it was just as well that he had not set his expectations unrealistically high for the king did not show that the songs affected him in any wayother than his delight and admiration in tfyrr as a pure musician he asked for several more songs when tfyrr was through with his planned set all of which tfyrr fortunately knew one of them gave him the opportunity to display his own scholarship for he knew three variants and asked which one theovere preferred that clearly delighted the king even further and when at last the time came for afternoon court a duty even the king could not put off theovere sighed and dismissed the haspur with every sign of disappointment that the performance was over you will come the same time every day the stonefaced manservant said expressionlessly as he led tfyrr to the door this is the high kings standing order tfyrr bobbed his head in acknowledgement and privately wondered how he was going to find his way back to his own quarters in this maze he had no head for indoor directions and more than a turn or two generally had him confused it didnt help that all these corridors looked alikeall white marble and artwork with no way of telling even what floor you were on if you didnt already know to his relief nob was waiting for him just outside the door passing the time of day with the guard posted outside the kings suite this was another of those dangerous looking bodyguards but this one seemed a bit younger than the ones actually with the king and hadnt lost all his humanity yet thought you might get lost the boy said saucily with a wink at the guard whose lips twitched infinitesimally tfyrr shrugged it is possible he admitted not likely but possible i suppose this is a large building the guard actually snickered at that little understatement and nob took him in charge to lead him back to their quarters i admit i wasnt entirely certain i knew the way tfyrr told the boy quietly once they were out of the guards earshot the hallways seem to be the same the arts different nob told him gesturing widely at the statues this one the statues are all of high kings see we turn here and the statues are woodnymphs nude human females sprouting twigs and leaves in their hair so that is a woodnymph no wonder the shepherds in my songs are so surprised i dont imagine that it is every day that a nude female prances up to the average shepherd and invites him to dance we turn again here nob continued blissfully unaware of tfyrrs thoughts and the statues are all shepherd couples oh indeed if one expects shepherds to be flinging themselves after their sheep wearing a small fortune in embroidery and lace this is as likely as nude women frolicking about among the thistles and thorns and biting insects i suppose then this is our corridor and the statues are historical women nob stopped in front of their door here we are between lady virgelis the chaste and the maiden moriah between someone so sour and dried up no one would ever want to mate with her and someone who probably didnt deserve the title of maiden much past her twelfth birthday tfyrr interpreted looking at the grimvisaged old harridan on his left who was muffled from head to toe in garments that did not disguise the fact she was mostly bone and the ripely plump sloeeyed young wench on his right who wasnt wearing much more than one of the woodnymphs he wondered if the juxtaposition was accidental probably not he had the feeling that very little in this palace was accidental so he said as nob opened the door and held it open for him to get to the kings suite i goright through the ladies to the shepherds left through the shepherds to the woodnymphs left through the nymphs to the high kings and right through the kings to where the guard is perfect nob lauded you have it exactly right the page closed the door behind them and tfyrr decided that he might as well ask the next question regarding directions now he said if i wanted to go into the city how would i get out one of the socalled supervisors in charge of expelling rowdy customerswho elsewhere would have been called peacekeepersintercepted nightingale on her way upstairs after her performance the second night after the deliambren tyladen arrived to take over management from kyran tyladen wants to see you in his office the burly mintak said shortly and nightingale suppressed a start and a grimace of annoyance tonight soon as you can right she said shortly and continued on up to her room to place her harp in safekeeping so he recognized me after all or someone warned him or he got a message back to the fortresscity with my description or even my image and theyve told him im supposed to be doing some investigation for themshe clenched her jaw tightly and closed the door of her room carefully behind her making certain she heard the lock click shut i could deny it all of course and there is no way that he can know that i am nightingale unless i admit it still even if i deny it hell be watching me trying to see if im doing anything likely getting underfoot or sending someone to follow me oh bother why did i ever even consider this in the first place i must have been mad every time i get involved with deliambrens theres trouble she fumed to herself all the way down the stairs and even more as she wormed her way through the crowds on and surrounding the dance floor that was no easy task at this time of the night the dance floor was a very popular place special lights suspended from the ceiling actually sent round focused circles of light down on the dancers the circles were of different colors and moved around to follow the better dancers or pulsed in time to the music some folk came here just to watch the lights move in utter bemused fascination many spectators watched from the balconies of the floors above nightingale was used to such things but for most people this was purest magic and they could not for a moment imagine what was creating these fairy lights it was easy to see why freehold was such a popular place there wasnt its like outside the fortresscity and not one person in ten thousand of those here would ever see the fabulous deliambren stronghold the lights made nightingales head ache especially after a long hard day and she was less than amused at being summoned now she wanted food a bath and bed in that order she did not want to have to go through a long session of deception and counterdeception with some fool of a deliambren fortunately she was tall for a woman and hard to ignore one or two human customers more inebriated than most attempted to stop her all it took usually was a single long cold stare directly into the eyes of even the most intoxicated and they generally left her alone quickly a touch of bardic magic a hint of elven coldness delivered with an uncompromising glarethat was the recipe that said leave me alone in a way that transcended language she finally reached the other side of the dance floor with no sense of relief the offices were down a short corridor between one of the eateries that catered to strict herbivores and a bar that specialized in exotic beers made from all manner of grains from corn to rice the corridor was brightly lit which was the best way of ensuring that people who didnt belong there werent tempted to investigate it somehow the adventurous never wanted to explore anything that was lit up like a village square at noon on midsummer day it wasnt very inviting anyway just a plain whitewalled whitetiled corridor with a couple of doors in it there were two doors on the corridor to be precise the nearest was kyrans office she tapped once on the farthest and entered there wasnt much there except for a desk and a couple of chairs although the deliambren sitting at the desk quickly put something small flat and dark into a desk drawer as she closed the door behind her she guessed that whatever it was she wasnt supposed to see it or know it existed more deliambren devices i suppose she thought sourly more deliambren secrets as if any of them would be useful to me but she schooled her face into a carefully neutral expression and said shortly you wanted to see me tyladen no sir she was quite annoyed enough with him to omit any honorifics but he didnt seem to notice the omission or if he did he didnt care he smiled nodded at the nearest chair and put his hands back up on the empty wooden desktop i did lyrebird is it at her nod he smiled again good name appropriate for a musician quite well he laughed and she had to wonder if he was as foolish as he seemed at this moment probably not seems youre very popular here at freehold he waited for an answer and again she nodded cautiously as she dropped gracefully into the chair it didnt look comfortable but to her surprise it was id like to think so she added making a bid for an appearance of modesty oh you are you areone of our most popular musicians among the nonhumans thats a fact he continued to smile and she waited with growing impatience for him to get to the point what was he after did he want to know why she a human musician should be so popular among those who were not of her race was he going to challenge her and demand that she reveal her true identity he just waited and finally she came up with another short answer for him thats what they tell me she shrugged again trying to appear modest well they tell you true he nodded like the childs toy they called a headbobber still giving her that silly smile i know that deliambrens have a hard time relating to humans and their emotions but this is ridiculous i can see why he has kyran acting as manager here most of the time he doesnt know the first thing about interacting with us i know he cant be stupid but he certainly projects himself as a prime silly ass of course he could be trying to soften her up for the confrontation he could be hoping to make her think he was an idiot so that she would underestimate him and let something slip well if that was what he was waiting for hed be here until the building fell to pieces around him yes they tell you true he said head still bobbing vigorously so im going to have to move you oak grove isnt big enough and some of the customers cant get up all those stairs anyway i want you down here on the ground floor silas wants to join the dinnertomidnight dance group they want to have him and that frees up the rainbow and thats where i want you the rainbow her mind babbled the biggest performance room in freehold me take over from silas me as she sat there in stunned silence he added as if in afterthought ohand youll be getting what silas was if thats all right two royals a night twotwo royals me nightingale has he got the right person oh thats quite fine she replied in a daze and he reached his hand across the desk thank you thank you very much without thinking she leaned forward to take it as a token of her acceptance done then well see you down here tomorrow night then lyrebird he took her hand shook it once awkwardly and let it go then he waved his hands at her as she continued to sit there blinking shooing her playfully out the door you need sleep if youre going to open in the rainbow tomorrow my lady off with you she rose opened the door in a daze and walked back out into the noise and the music the rainbow it was the biggest performance room in freehold the only other venue larger was the dance floor itself silas was another humanor so he claimedwith an inhumanly beautiful face and body a waistlength mane of golden curls and a voice like strong bronze powerful and compelling silas liked to display that body in clothing much like tyladen had worn that first day except that silas skintight garments were real leather he was extremely popular with both male and female customers and by reputation distributed his favors equally between both sexes she had heard rumors that he wanted to join the dance group and she could certainly see why he would be able to concentrate on singing and choose the powerful and rhythmic music he preferred instead of the ballads that a performance room demanded his guitar playing was the weakest part of his act now he wouldnt need to worry about it with an entire ensemble to back him and the dance floor will be more crowded than eversilas is bound to sing fast music which will make people thirsty which will sell a great many drinks it is a good bargain all around even at continuing to pay him his current salary or above butme the rainbow who am i im not gorgeous like silas i know im good but i dont have a fraction of his charisma im just a gypsy streetplayer a good one but nothing more than that how can i ever fill the rainbow she found herself on the staircase with no clear memory of how she had crossed the intervening floor the rainbow room was easily three times the size of the oak grove how could she ever justify being put there who would come all those people who wait for seats now whispered an elated little voice in the back of her mind all those people who stand crowded into the back wall and all those who want to hear you but cant climb three flights of stairs you know there are plenty of those derfans said as much lady of the night now derfan can even come listen to you well that was true many of the folk who crowded into freehold of a night were the human misfits of the city those who like derfan were not sound of body by everyday measure out there they were cripples in any other tavern in the city they would still be cripples here they were no stranger than anyone else and their only limitations were how far up the staircases they could getand there were plenty of nonhumans who couldnt manage that kyran and tyladen spoke vaguely of putting in some sort of lifting system to accommodate them but apparently there was some problem with getting it to work reliably there were hoists for food and drink for the various tiny kitchens but they were all powered by the muscles of mintaks and other strong creatures and not really practical for hauling people up and down besides the worst that happened if a hoist failed was the loss of a little food and profit the worst that could happen if a lift full of customers failed was not to be contemplated that was why the most popular acts were all on the first floor where everyone could see them that wanted to can i do it she asked herself and forced herself to think about it dispassionately yes she decided on sober contemplation i think that i can but she had to stop on the way up and bespeak a pot of very hot water from one of the tea vendors mingled excitement anticipation and stagefright were beginning to build inside her at the prospect of facing the largest audience at the greatest rate of pay she had ever in her life warranted if she was going to be able to do anything tomorrow she was going to need to get some sleep tonight as tyladen had pointed out fortunately she had packed a number of herbal remedies in her panniers and one of them was for sleeplessness and tonight she was going to need it the excitement was almost enough to drive her real reason for being here out of her mind almost as she reached her room again shut and locked the door behind her and began to prepare for bed her mind went back to what tanager had heard at the palace today the haspurand if the mysterious new court musician wasnt a haspur he was of some race so like them that it made no differencewas the sensation of the court and had inspired some of the most envious hatred in the kings musicians she had ever heard of some of them were threatening to pack up and leave the kings service others swore they would get rid of the interloper nightingale was not particularly worried about the ability of the court musicians as individuals to get rid of their rival they were guild bards after all and as a group guild bards were singularly ineffectual at doing anything of a practical nature the trouble was that they all had been placed where they were by someone they must have powerful allies and those allies might decide to take an interest allies and patrons of that sort had access to all manner of unpleasant things from simple thugs to sophisticated poisons they might consider the new court musician to be too trivial a problem to bother withbut in a court ruled by a high king with an obsession for musicians that was not as likely as it would otherwise have been in fact the new musician might be considered as deadly a potential rival as any of the grand dukes and court baronsand one with fewer protections did the haspur know this i hope so she thought slipping into her nightshift and preparing her pot of soporific tea oh i hope so i hope he is finding himself some equally powerful allies because if he doesnthes going to find himself wingclipped and surrounded and that lovely position he has earned himself will be no more than a beautifully gilded trap like most of the other performance rooms in freehold the rainbow room lived up to its name but not in the way that anyone who had not seen it would have expected it was not decorated in many colors nor worse festooned with painted rainbows like a childs nursery the rainbow room was the plainest simplest performance room in the building its walls and ceiling painted a soft white the floor and tables some seamless substance of a textured matte black the booths and chairs upholstered in black as well something as soft and supple as black suede leather although nightingale was fairly certain that was not what it was it would have cost a fortune to cover that much furniture in black leather and not even a deliambren had that much to spare on furnishings in a performance room no it was when the lights were dimmed and the special performance lighting lit that the rainbow room lived up to its name for there were crystal prisms hidden everywhere in the ceiling fixtures in the pillars supporting the ceiling set into the leaded glass windows that divided the room itself from the dance floor when the performance lighting was illuminated those prisms caught and refracted it into a hundred thousand tiny rainbows that flung themselves everywhere and since many of the prisms were free to move with air currents the rainbows moved as well in a gentle dance of color with that as a backdrop no performer needed anything else silas had shown himself to advantage here and nightingale hoped to emulate him to that end she had chosen her black elven silks for this first performance in the new room and in fact she was beginning to think farther ahead than just the next few days or even weeks if she could sustain her popularity herewhy go anywhere else why go back on the road once she had collected the information that the deliambrens the free bards and the elves all wanted she didnt particularly have a sense of wanderlust the way some gypsies did she simply had never found a place she wanted to stay for more than a few months at a time why not stay here granted she hated cities but she couldnt avoid them altogether and if she was going to have to endure them why not do so where she was guaranteed a level of comfort that she would never get anywhere else where else would she have her own room with her own bathroom heated and cooled to perfection where else would she get her choice of foodstuffs so that she could go all month and never eat the same meal twice and where else would she find a performance venue like this one and to that endif she stayed she would need new costumes many new costumes all of the same quality as her silks the elves would owe her once she got their information back to them she could send word back with her own messages that she needed new dresses and ask for specific colors and designs she shook herself out of her reverie as the doors of the room opened and people began to make their way in concentrate on whats going on right now foolish woman she scolded herself deal with what you have before you worry about far into the future when you know you will have that kind of future outside on the dance floor silas and the other musicians were setting up she saw them clearly through the window he must have sensed her watching for he turned toward the rainbow room and waved grinning broadly then gave her the gypsy sign for wellwishing she smiled back and did the same knowing that he could see her as easily as she saw him he looked particularly wonderful and outrageous tonight and his tight leather costume would give most church priests heart failure it was cut out in unexpected patterns that allowed his goldentan skin to show through and unless she was very much mistaken he was wearing a leather codpiece with a red leather rose appliqued on the front showoff but she smiled as she thought it it was impossible not to like silas he went out of his way to be kind to even the lowliest of the waiters and cleaners and encouraging to the worst of his fellow entertainers there wasnt an unkind bone in silas body unfortunately there wasnt a chaste bone in there either promiscuous did not begin to describe him and nightingale feared he would meet an early end either torn to pieces among a dozen jealous lovers each of whom was sure he or she was silas only true love or worn away to nothing by the exertion of all his love affairs silas one faultand it was a bad onewas that he had a habit of telling his lovers whatever they wanted to hear that had gotten him into trouble in the past and he had never learned better perhaps silas unconsciously feared the same early end that she suspected for him he seemed to be trying to pack a lifetimes worth of experience into months rather than years but for now at least hes having a fine time as far as i can tell still it wouldnt be my choice to burn up like a falling star for the sake of a single spectacular bout of fireworks i would rather leave a carefully crafted and large legacy of music behind me this new venue was only going to give him more trouble in the popularity department now he was free to move about the stage as he sang instead of being pinned to a stool behind a guitar that was only going to make him more attractive so far as his admirers were concerned up until now theyd had no reason to suspect silas danced as well as he sang well this wasnt the time to worry about silas and his troubles her harps were in perfect tune and the place was about as full as it was going to get until and unless word spread tonight that her performances were not to be missed so so its time to start creating a performance that is not to be missed foolish wench she ran her hands over her harp strings and the quiet murmur of talk died away as the lights above the stage brightened and the ones out in the room dimmed slightly she took a deep breath mentally ran over all of her options and decided to begin with something she hoped would impress even the most difficult critic she chose an elven piece and backed it with the appropriate bardic magic meant to enhance the moods called up by the song after that all of her attention was bound up in her music and the reactions of her audience it seemed to her that the listeners were impressed they were quiet when she wanted them to be nodded or tapped along in time when she played or sang something lively and responded to the subtle textures she added with the bardic magic she wove into the fabric of her songs in this incarnation the magic was only meant to enhance an experience not to manipulate anyones thoughts that was how the elves generally used it among themselves the room continued to fill as she played until at the end of her first set there were not too many tables or booths empty and this was at supperonce people were finished eating the audiences should grow larger the lights came back up as she signaled the end of her set she stepped off the stage and went into the back of the room where a cleverly concealed door led into a small closetlike affair this was where another of the nonhumans a fellow whose race she didnt even know sat doing arcane things with a board of sliding bits and buttons xarax was a likable fellow though he didnt speak much to anyone he looked as human as nightingale until you got close to him and saw that his eyes were exactly like a goats with an odd sideways kidneyshaped pupil and his skin was covered with tiny hexagonal scales she didnt know if he was completely hairless but his eyebrows were nothing more than a darker pattern of scales he had no sign of a beard and he always wore a shirt with a hood and kept the hood up he was the one in charge of the lighting here he worked this room for nightingale now as he had worked it for silas before that was perfect she told him warmly i couldnt have asked for anything better his thin lipless mouth stretched in a smile excellent he replied with no hiss at all to his words you are a more subtle performer than silas i hoped i would match that subtlety the audience likes you the exquisite violetta actually came here to listen to you before she went off to the dance floor that is a good omen and proves that the customers like you they do she replied knowing she sounded pathetically eager as eager as any green child in her first appearance and knowing it would not matter to xarax oh i hope so tyladen did not choose you wrongly to take silas place the nonhuman assured her even reaching out with one threefingered hand to pat her on the shoulder in an awkward gesture of reassurance he was half minded to choose another exactly like silas but i told him that would be a mistake for such a choice would only invite comparison and unwelcome rivalry i said to him to choose someone as unlike silas as possible someone whose emphasis was on the music rather than the performerand here you are and you prove me right and tyladen who chose you that was the longest speech she had ever heard out of xarax and he abruptly turned back to his buttons and boards as if embarrassed by the outpouring of words she knew better than to be offended at his abruptness she thanked him again and left him alone with his beloved machinery when her break was over most of the people from her first performance were still in the room sipping drinks they had ordered from waiters during the interval and many more had arrived to fill up the rest of the seats as the lights dimmed again she saw the dance group had ended its first performance and the dance floor had emptied silas and his group would be taking a longer break than she didtheir work was physically more demanding for a while at least the music in here would penetrate onto the open dance floor and might attract more people here and even as she began her first song of the second set she caught sight of someone who startled her so much that for a moment she faltered then she recovered so quickly that she doubted anyone in her audience noticed or thought the break was more than a dramatic pause but out there striding across the empty dance floor wings swept dramatically back behind his shoulders was tfyrr it had to be him it was not just the wings the feathered body the raptorial headit was the costume the way that closely wrapped fabric fell in particular folds that she remembered the color of the fabric itself it was also the color of his feathers a rich greybrown with touches of scarlet on the edges of his primaries and tail feathers nightingale had a peculiarly good color memory she was able to match even greys and beiges without having a swatch of the fabric in question with her she knew from all of her years as an observer of nature that no two birds were exactly colored alike there were subtle shadings of tone that enabled someone who watched them a great deal to tell them apart surely that was the same with the haspur and yet he looked through the window of the rainbow room straight into her eyes and showed no sign of recognition her hands played on a peculiar haunting gypsy song it was one she was certain that tfyrr could never have heard and it had been a gypsy melody that had brought him to her in their first meeting surely he could not have resisted a second such song but although he must have heard the music he paid no attention to it or to her he was looking for someone however and in a few moments as kyran brought tyladen to him it was obvious just who he was looking for the two nonhumans strolled together in the direction of tyladens office and were soon out of sight leaving nightingale puzzled and a bit confused it cant have been tfyrr tfyrr would never have gone past without at least greeting me it must have been some other haspur but how many haspur were there and how could another haspur look so exactly like tfyrr the lighting is odd out there maybe i mistook his coloring i saw tfyrr in shadowed daylight under trees the light out on the dance floor is a lot dimmer than that and there are all those colored lights to confuse things maybe sobut in every other way this haspur looked enough like tfyrr to have been his twin and i only saw him for a day or two i could be wrong it feels as if his image has been branded into my memory but i could be wrong all she really knew if it came down to it was this there was a haspur in this building who had come looking for a deliambren there was a birdman with a deliambren who had arrived at the high kings palace these two might even be the same as that pair in a way she hoped so this city was no place for someone like tfyrr right now and the position that haspur held at court was no position for tfyrr to be in if there had to be a haspur in danger she would really prefer it wasnt one she knew one she cared for so why she asked herself as she started on her next song am i still so certain it is himboth here and there and probably in danger in both places nobs directions were exact to the last detail and he had not been at all surprised that tfyrr wanted to visit the tavern called freehold pages arent allowed to go there hed said wistfully but as soon as im old enough as soon as it is possible i will take you there tfyrr promised and the boys eyes lit up if it is as wondrous as i have heard it would be a crime not to let you see it and with that armed only with directions and a bit of money secreted in his bodywrappings he ventured into the city he was not particularly worried about being attacked not in broad daylight at any rate he had trodden the streets of worse neighborhoods than freehold was in with perfect safety most wouldbe attackers took one look at his foottalons his handtalons and his beak and realized that he was better armed than the worst bravo he wanted to reach freehold now before he needed to go so that he knew the way if nobs directions proved misleading or erroneous in any way he wanted to know now when he had the leisure to ask for better directions still there was always the chance that he would be followedand he really didnt want to walk the entire way so once he was out of the palace and onto the grounds he did the obvious he took to the air his shadow passed over the guards at the gate and they gaped up at him as he flew overhead they had heard of him by now of course but hearing about him and seeing him in the air were obviously two different things his eyesight was good enough to see that their hands tightened on their weapons as he passed them but they did not make any kind of threatening gesture butprobably when he returned he should come in on foot and show them his proper safeconduct from the king no point in giving them a target for arrow practice he was quite glad that he had decided to fly when he saw how crowded the streets below him were it would be hot down there too another reason to put off landing until he had to on the other hand im not exactly inconspicuous anyone who wanted to know where im going need only climb into the nearest church tower and watch me to see where i land but if he was being followedthat might not occur to someone who didnt himself fly well whats done is done no use closing the coop door after the pigeons have flown it wasnt at all difficult to follow nobs directions from the air and in a remarkably short period of time he landed in a square next to a fountain about three blocks away from the building that housed freehold it took him longer to walk those three blocks than it had to fly the rest although foot traffic tended to part before him the streets were still crowded and there werent too many places for other pedestrians to move in order to get out of his way he suspected that he was indeed being followed when he was two blocks from the place and only then did it occur to him that it probably didnt matter if he flew or walked this as harperus had pointed out was a logical destination for him all anyone had to do was to leave a watcher near the place and sooner or later he was bound to show up if id had any sense i would have sent a message to tyladen that i was coming and would land on the roof he told himself angrily but no i have no more sense than an unfledged eyas and this is all for no reason i dont have anything at all to report other than to make tfyrr the very visible symbol of his new policy of tolerance for nonhumans the king literally had not done anything since tfyrrs arrival at least he hadnt done anything that tfyrr had witnessed he left everything in the hands of his underlings just as he had that very first day and those underlings were making very certain that tfyrr was given nothing whatsoever to do when the king wasnt requesting private performances other court musicians regularly played for the humans gathered at various places during the day not tfyrr someone was being very careful to see that tfyrr stayed out of sight tfyrr on the other hand was making very sure that he stayed visible attending every open court session that he couldbut he really hadnt learned anything new well it was too late to do anything about followers now he walked up to the front door of freehold as if he hadnt a care in the world and presented himself to the doorkeeper with casual aplomb he did enjoy the way the mans eyes widened at the sight of his wings and talons but when he asked to see tyladen the man did not ask why or claim that the deliambren was busy instead he directed tfyrr to go inside and said that he would tell tyladen to come meet him tfyrr followed the humans directions but once inside the door his senses were assaulted in a fashion that left him momentarily dazed by the barrage of light and sound peoplenot only humans but other peopleswere everywhere music pounded at his ears from the center of the room and echoed down off the high ceiling a space in the middle of the room was full of creatures dancing to a wild reel above the gyrating bodies was the group responsible for the highvolume fastpaced music itself they were all humans but they played as if they were the demons that the church claimed tfyrr had represented a moment or two later to his relief and gratitude the music ended the bronzemaned human singer threw back his hair acknowledged the applause of the dancers and indicated that he and the group were about to take a rest tfyrr sighed in gratitude it would have been impossible to cross the rapidly emptying floor with it full of dancers and he wasnt certain he would have been able to maintain his equilibriumliterallywith that much music pounding into his ears as the dance floor cleared tfyrr started across it sweeping his glance across the many odd alcoves and glassfronted rooms surrounding the open space harperus and nob had both described freehold to the best of their abilities but both descriptions had come up rather short of reality if he had not been so concerned about those who had followed him he would have been happy to explore the place and then as he glanced into a rainbowlaced room with a single performer upon the stage his heart and footsteps faltered for an instant no but yes it was nightingale not the nightingale he remembered from that single memorable afternoon but a more elegant and exotic version of the same woman she wore a nightblack gown that flowed about her body like a second skin of feathers and her hair had been left to flow down her back in a single fall of darkest sable but it was herit was her and if he acknowledged her whoever was following him and watching him would want to know why he had done sowould want to know how she had met him and where and what she was to him if those followers were from any of his enemies at court she would not be safe not even here her only safety lay in his pretending that she was as much a stranger to him as anyone else here yes they would see him meeting with the deliambren tyladenbut the deliambren could take care of himself beautiful fragile nightingale could not so he allowed his eyes to brush across hers with feigned indifference and pretended not to see the shock of recognition in her face instead he waited until he caught a glimpse of a deliambren hurrying toward him from a nearby corridorwho could only be tyladen the owner of this place he gave all of his attention to his host and as tyladen hurried him into a back room he did not even spare a second glance for the musician in the room of rainbowshowever much his heart yearned for a welcoming smile from her im glad you came the deliambren said as he closed a reassuringly solid door behind tfyrr and turned a chair around so that the haspur could lean his arms on the back and have his tail and wings unencumbered i was hoping to be able to catch you up on news from the fortresscity before things get to a point where they are critical the listening devices are no replacement for regular contact we can hear you just fine but unfortunately we cant tell you what it is wed like you to talk about something new tfyrr asked the deliambren shook his head not exactly newjust that there is some information we need to help us fill in some holes in our knowledge you know that we still want to map all of alanda of course that hasnt changed i didnt think it would tfyrr rumbled with a little reluctant amusement once you people get a direction in your heads youre as hard to sway from it as a migrating goose tyladen smiled weve run into some obstacles there are some of the human kingdoms that have decided they dont want any part of us and in order to carry out the expedition properly well have to cross their lands the high king can override their objections so now we need his blanket permission in order to get the expedition underway tfyrr blinked as the conversations of several of the past few court sessions hed sat through played in his head he had made a point of going to every single open court that he knew about not only to have something to do but to make himself visible as an act of defiance against those advisors who were trying to make him vanish none of them seemed to realize just how good his hearing really was hed overheard a lot that he wasnt supposed to both on the dais and among the courtiers once you knew the factions and who belonged to what you knew where to listen in addition he had been present at several private meetings between the king and his advisors in his capacity as the kings personal musician hed heard quite a bit there too he just hadnt realized that it meant anything i believe i know what you need he said there are several of the kings advisors who are against the expedition but they have not been showing their hands openly yes tyladen exclaimed and we couldnt tell how the king himself really feels about it tfyrr coughed oh the kingwell he is very enamored with your technology though he refers to it as deliambren magic he would like to have still more of your little wonders and as long as he has that desire he will be swayed in favor of letting you have anything you want within reason howeverthe advisors are not the only problem you have to deal with they arent tyladen looked puzzled you forget tfyrr said trying not to sound bitter how much these people are herded by the opinions of their religious leaders there are several of them who are not happy with your magic and are quietly lobbying the king against it they are not necessarily the ones who are against nonhumans by the way the deliambrens eyebrows rose sharply ah i see yes the religious leaders who hate and fear nonhumans are depressingly easy to recognize but i had not realized that there were others who might be against technology tfyrr snorted think about it your ways have the potential to prove some of their assertions are a pile of mutes and castings and that would be bad for their business of course they fear you now since i know what it is that you need let me name you some names he closed his eyes and brought up faces and attitudes in his minds eye then began to recite all that he knew in the background he was vaguely aware of a faint hum that was probably one of the recordingcrystal devices at work and of a steady tapping which might mean that tyladen was taking notes in some other way he was rather surprised at the sheer volume of information he had really it wasnt only the kings advisors who were important it was also the factions with whom they were involved all of those factions were represented by people and all of those people had names descriptions attitudesweaknesses that could be exploited perhapslikes and dislikes he had to stop rest and enjoy some cool water more than once in the course of his recitation it all took a very long time even for someone like him his people relied on oral history before they met the deliambrens and as a consequence they were very good at organizing their memories still it took time to get everything out and when he was finished he was well aware that it was very late that was fabulous tyladen said with admiration as he tapped a few more things into some sort of device on his desk and slipped the device itself into a drawer you are going to prove to be a lot more useful than you thought im sure of it this is all information none of our human agents were high enough to obtain i hope you are correct tfyrr told him sincerely i was not as sanguine about this position of mine as harperus was i simply did not see what a simple musician could learn that would make any difference to all of us it was the deliambrens turn to snort well most simple musicians cant hear a mouse squeak five hundred sdaders away either youre overhearing far more than anyone has any reason to believe dont let them know that whatever you do i wont tfyrr hastened to assure him my safety lies in that as i know all too well dont think for a moment that i am not aware of that good tyladen pushed himself away from his desk i need to go into the back and transmit all this home can you see yourself out ohyou can feel free to stay a while if you want i left orders that whatever you ask for is no charge after all thathmph i should hope so then tfyrr chided himself for the uncharitable thought and thanked his host perhaps i will right now i should like just a drink of something for my throat and then i will look around a little perhaps whatever the deliambren opened a door in an apparently blank wall enjoy yourself he slipped inside and the door closed behind him leaving again an apparently blank wall evidently tyladen literally meant for tfyrr to show himself out and evidently he trusted tfyrr not to snoop around in the office either not that it was any kind of a temptation no more than it had been a temptation to snoop in harperus exotic travelwagon if this had been a library full of music recordings perhaps but there was nothing likely to be in this office that would hold even a hint of interest for tfyrr not unless there is something on the personal records of the musicians here no no he would not try to look up nightingale to see what had brought her here that would be rude but he could go out and at least listen to her sing without revealing his presence that wouldnt hurt anything or anyone maybe if the opportunity presented itself he could find a way to contact her discreetly privately a note or a message perhaps so with that thought in mind he opened the door and walked out into the main room which was once again crowded with dancers preoccupied with the idea of seeing his friend again and a little surprised at the pleasure that gave him chapter six it cant be tfyrr but how can it not be it must bebut how can it be him the thoughts circled one another in her head mutually antagonistic for a while nightingale was so taken aback by the appearance of a haspur who could be tfyrrs twin that she didnt pay a great deal of attention to the customers as people only as her audience that is she reacted to them and paid attention to the way in which they reacted to her but as a group not as individuals and she also wasnt watching them for potential trouble she used to keep a careful eye on every person in her audiences when she was on the road because she never knew who or what was going to cause a problem for her sometimes trouble came from someone who just happened to be offended by the lyrics of a particular song sometimes it came from a more obvious source a drunk or a person who had arrived with his own set of prejudices riding his shoulders like a pack she had gotten out of the habit of looking for problems in her audience since shed been here and maybe that wasnt such a good thing it wasnt until her second set was over that she shook herself out of her reverie and began that kind of watching that was normally second nature and due entirely to a free bards healthy sense of selfpreservation even when trouble erupted around a free bard it generally came to include the free bard even if it hadnt been intended to she scolded herself for neglecting that here in freehold perhaps her instincts had been convinced that this was a kind of safe place like a waymeet or a gypsy campafter all there was someone else watching out for trouble and troublemakers here many someone elses actually most of them mintaks or extremely large humans of the fairestrongman variety the peacekeepers generally kept the peace very effectively their mere presence was enough to keep some types outside the doors but where the haspur who was the kings chief musician was showing upgiven that the possibility of two haspur in the same city was vanishingly smallthere might be someone following no there would be someone following the only question would be if it was a friend or a foe and the chances of the freehold staff recognizing that sort of trouble if it walked in the door were remote a friend would be finea guard assigned to protect the kings musician discreetly but a foewell anyone following the haspur would be hired by someone attached to the court and he would not be the kind to catch the notice of one of the peacekeepers he would not be drunk nor rowdyin fact he would take pains not to catch anyones attention unless the haspur showed up again but this was not the first time that nightingale had needed to watch for that sort of trouble free bards were always acquiring enemies among bardic guild musicians for instance and the bardic guild had plenty of coin to hire experienced ruffians so as she took her break between sets she got herself something to drink and began to stroll the floor watching the customers seeing who didnt quite fit in there was a general feeling about the customers at freehold no matter how well or poorly or oddly they dressed they all acted pretty much the same they were here to have a good time in a place where very few people were going to make any judgments about them that engendered a certain relaxed air even those who were here for the first time generally succumbed to that allpervasive mood after a while this was especially true of the crowd around silas and the dancefloor that was why the three men sitting at one of the tables near the entrance struck her watchful instincts immediately they were not here for a good time they had drinks and they watched the dancers but there was nothing relaxed about them they werent even paying any attention to silas and that in itself was unusual she let her barriers down just a trifle and her immediate reading was confirmed by the state of alert slightly nervous tension she read in them the edginess showing they were prepared to do something physical and soon these men were here on some kind of dirty business and they didnt want anyone to notice them she also had the feeling that she had seen them before but not in this part of town there was a nagging something about them their clothing was wrong somehow they didnt match the clothing that was it it was just a little too new a trifle too expensive and they were not comfortable in it still that edginess the waiting feeling could just mean they were here to meet a lady of negotiable virtue or someone elses wives just because they were here and on edge and they werent regulars that really didnt mean much maybe then again they didnt show up until after the haspur did and they wouldnt have gotten through the door in time to see where he went now theyre down here near the entrance just off the dance floor in a spot where anyone arriving or leaving is going to have to pass them she took her own drink to a table nearby where she could see both the corridor leading to the offices and the table holding the three men she watched them out of the corner of her eye feeling rather put out this was one of silas better performances and she wasnt able to give it more than a fraction of her attention silas always needed one set to warm up and by the fourth or fifth of the night he was beginning to tire making his second and third sets perfect for someone who really appreciated seeing him at his best and tonight was his first night with the dance group making him doubly eager to do his finest nightingale would have liked to be able to sit back a little and enjoy it although silas wasnt really her type the sensuality he radiated tonight was enough to stir a corpse and that skintight leather outfit of his made it very clear that however else silas indulged himself he did not neglect his physical health what was even more annoying was the simple fact that she couldnt sit here forever she had her third set to do shortly and she would have to leave she was debating whether or not she should ask one of the peacekeepers to keep an eye on the three for her when the haspur finally emerged from the office corridor and one of the three men caught sight of him and sat straight up as if someone had stuck a pin in him then he quickly slumped back down but not before nightingale had seen his sudden interest and not before she saw him lean over and say something quickly to his two companions no more than a heartbeat later one of his companions calmly got to his feet and reached out onto the dance floor for one of the dancers he just seized whoever was nearest it happened to be a human male dressed as many of silas followers did in a carefully crafted imitation of one of silas outfits the dancer turned toward the man who had grabbed him in bewildermenthe started to say something and the stranger calmly slung him around toward the tables and punched him in the face hard enough to knock him backward he knocked over two tables as he fell and landed on a third collapsing it those tables overturned and their occupants scattered more than a few of them getting to their feet and looking for the cause of the trouble with fire in their eyes another heartbeat later and that entire corner of the room was involved in a freeforallwhich quickly spread in the haspurs direction peacekeepers converged on the brawl from every part of freehold nightingale spotted them making for the stairs and pushing their way through the dancers most of whom were not yet aware that there was anything wrong but more violence erupted along a line between the strangers table and the haspur with fighting breaking out spontaneously and spreading like wildfire soon an entire quarter of the room was involved in the brawl and fists were flying indiscriminately fights were not all that usual here especially not one of this magnitude it was almost as if there was someone going through the crowd provoking more violence instigating trouble and moving on before it could touch him nightingale was still outside of the fighting though many people around her had abandoned the dancing or their tables and were peering in the direction of the altercation she jumped up onto her chair then stood on her table and scanned the crowd as the fight converged on the openly startled haspur and engulfed him intuition and a feeling of danger warned her that the strangers must be in there somewhereand if the haspur was their target they would be moving in on him now her flash of intuition solidified into certainty as she spotted them widely separated in the crowd there they were all right converging on the haspur from three directions as he tried to extricate himself from the brawl without getting involved himself and as for the haspurs identitythere was no glass between her and him now and she had a good look at his head and face at the way he moved it was tfyrr it had to be if it had been a stranger she might have been tempted to let the peacekeepers handle it well it wasnt and damned if i am going to let these ruffians go after a friend her harp was safe in the rainbow room she was no barbrawler but she hadnt been playing the roads for all these years without learning a few tricks she jumped down off the table and began slithering through the crowd of struggling fighting customers as long as you knew what you were doing and what to watch out for it was actually fairly easy to wade through a fight without getting involvedor at least without suffering more than an occasional shove or steppedon toe she made her way to the spot in the milling mob where shed last seen tfyrr fairly quicklybut she actually got within sight of one of the men that were after him before she saw the haspur that was when she knew that tfyrr was in danger real danger and that these men werent just planning on roughing him up after all if these people werent after him why would this one be carrying a netwhy carry a net into a place like freehold at all lyonarie was not a seaportfreehold might offer a lot of entertainment but fishing wasnt part of itand this lad didnt look anything like a fisherman she looked around frantically for something to make his life difficult before he got a chance to use that net if he caught tfyrr in it he could entangle the haspur and no best not think about that find a way to stop him there she darted out of the fight long enough to seize a spiky piece of wroughtiron sculptureor at least tyladen alleged that it was sculpturefrom an alcove in the wall it wasnt heavy but it was just what she needed she slid back into the crowd nearest the fellow with the net just in time to see him back out of the crowd a little himself and spread the net out to toss it she heaved her bit of statuary into the halfopen folds just as he started to throw it he lurched backward unbalanced for the moment by the sudden weight of iron in the net he was quick though he whipped around to see if someone had stepped on the net and when he saw how the spikes of the sculpture had tangled everything up his mouth moved in what was probably a curse he pulled the mess to him since no one seemed to be paying any attention to him and began to untangle it moving out of the crowd completely for just a moment that was when nightingale slipped up behind him and delivered an invitation to slumber with a wine bottle shed purloined from an overturned table he dropped like a felled ox net statue and all nightingale dropped the bottle beside him after giving him a second lovetap to ensure that he stayed out of the conflict for a while there was no longer a background of music to the brawl silas and the rest had probably deserted their stage before the fighting engulfed it she moved around the periphery of the fight looking for tfyrr and finally spotted him again as his wings waved above the crowd momentarily she worked her way in toward him but as she got within touching distance of him she saw that another of the bullyboys was moving in on him and the weapon he carried was like nothing nightingale had ever seen before in fact she wouldnt have known he had a weapon at all if she hadnt seen the blade glint briefly in the light it was needlelike probably very sharpand poisoned dear lady who knew it might very well be she was too far away to do anything she opened her mouth to shout a futile warning as the man lunged toward the haspur but tfyrr was not as helpless as he looked somehow he spotted his attacker coming from an angle where no human would have seen him moving he grabbed a chair whirled with the speed of a striking goshawk and intercepted the weapon as the man brought it down toward the point where his back had been a heartbeat before with all the noise there was no sound as the man drove it into the chairback but he staggered as he hit the unyielding wood instead of the flesh and feathers he had been aiming for it must have embedded too deeply in the wood of the chair to pull free for he abandoned the weapon and leapt back looking around for help but there wasnt any help to be had the third man had either seen nightingale fell his partner or simply had noticed that he was down instead of dealing with his part of the attack the third man was helping the semiconscious netwielder to his feet and dragging him out of the fight toward the door there was no doorkeeper at this point and he was not the only person helping an injured friend out theyre going to get away and i cant stop them damn it the man with the stiletto took another look at tfyrr who had tossed the chair aside and with wings mantling in rage was advancing on him he gave up faster than nightingale would have believed possible he had eeled his way into the brawl and out of tfyrrs sight and reach while tfyrr looked for him futilely nightingale saw him reappear at the side of his two companions taking the unconscious mans free arm draping it over his shoulder and hustling both of the others toward the entrance and out before she could alert anyone to stop them she cursed them with the vilest gypsy curses she could think ofbut she couldnt follow them with anything more potent than that with the peacekeepers converging on the fight wholesale and no one around trying to keep it going the battle ended shortly after that peacekeepers didnt even try to sort out who started what they simply separated combatants and steered them toward the entrance suggesting that if there was still a grievance after the cool air hit them they could resume their discussions outside there didnt seem to be anyone with any injuries worse than a blackened eye either and a good threefourths of the people involved had only been trying to keep themselves from getting hurt by the few folk actually fighting nightingale had seen it all before people who either drunk or simply worked up over something would take any excuse to fight with anyone who wanted to fight back the three bravos must have known something like this would happen too and had counted on it which unfortunately argued very strongly that they were professionals in the pay of someone with enough money to hire them while the peacekeepers dealt with the mess nightingale picked her way through the overturned tables and chairs toward tfyrr there was an uncanny silence beneath the dance lightsas she had thought silas and his crew had decided that discretion was better than foolhardiness and had abandoned their platform for the safety of one of the performance rooms she saw them across the empty dance floor with silas in the lead making their way cautiously back toward their stage but at the moment she had someone else she wanted to talk to the haspur stood so quietly that he might have been frozen in placebut there was a faint trembling of his wing feathers that told her he was locked in some kind of emotional overload better break him out of it hello tfyrr she said calmly touching his arm lightly and projecting peace and a sense of security at him he jumped in startlement and she saw still floating in that strange detached calm that exercising her power brought her that he extended his talons for a moment before he recognized her and he did recognize her that tiny touch was all she needed to read the recognition and dismay flooding through his mind and heart he looked for one short moment as if he might still try to pretend that he didnt know her but she kept her eyes fastened on his and he finally shook his head hello nightingale he replied in that deep rumbling voice she knew so well the tension in the arm beneath her hand told her he was still caught up in the fighting rage the attack had stirred up in him but he spoke to her calmly enough to have fooled anyone but her or someone like her ii am sorry i did not greet you but i was afraid that something like this might happen i did not want anyone following me to know that i knew you she nodded it would be time enough later to find out why he was being followed and what in the world had brought him to lyonariepresumably with old owl since that was the last deliambren she had seen him with right now there were other things she needed to do bring him calm for one thing and help him convince himself that the danger is over for now i saw them there were three of them one never got close to you one had that stiletto knife and one had a net his eyes widened at the mention of the word net well that certainly touched a nerve whoever they are theyre gone now she pointed out quickly i saw them leaveunfortunately i wasnt in a position where i could get someone to intercept them he took a deep breath i would rather that they escaped than you got yourself involved in my troubles he replied she only shook her head i have to start my next set she said instead changing the subject completely why dont you join me he blinked at her slowly as if he didnt quite understand what she had just said do you mean to listen he asked or to participate either she told him both it will do you good to think about something else for a little until your thoughts get organized and you have a chance to calm yourself down i know how good your memory is surely we both know enough of the same music to fill a set i also know how good you areand there is no one else i would rather share a stage with i would love to have you join me unless youd rather not but he took a deep breath and let it out slowly as if her reply had answered some need of his own there is nothing i would like better he said his voice now a bit more relaxed if you would care to lead the way by the time the two of them reached her little stage nightingale noticed that xarax had altered the lighting to suit both of them she gave tfyrr her stool and took a chair for herself after a brief consultation to determine some mutually acceptable music they began the rainbow room had emptied as the brawl began now it slowly filled up again with customers who were shaken by what had just happened while fights were not unheard of in freehold there had never been one of this magnitude and the regular customers were still asking themselves how and why the violence of the outside world had intruded on this place they had considered immune to it nightingale could have told them of course when powerful people are determined that something will happen no place is safe that has not been warned and has not created specific defenses against the weapons that they can bring to bear powerful people have the means to make things happen no matter what anyone else might want but that was not what these people wanted to hear and at the moment that was not what they needed to hear either they needed to be soothed and since that need matched tfyrrs that was what nightingale gave them all as she played and sang and wove a web of magic to hold them all in a feeling of safety and security she opened herself cautiously to tfyrr reading a nonhuman was always a matter for uncertainty but she thought that she knew him well enough to have a solid chance at getting a little beneath his surface do i it is an intrusion but he is in needits like the ache of an unhealed wound could i see him wounded physically and not help no this is something i must at least try to help with she closed her eyes set part of herself to the simple task of playing and the rest to weaving herself into the magic web opening herself further to him letting herself slide into his heart there is fear that is the surface singing seemed to ease him somewhat but beneath the obvious concernsanxiety over being followed remnants of fear from the moment when he had seen an attacker targeting him more fear for what the attack really meantthere was some very deep emotional wounding something that went back much farther than the past few hours or even weeks she sensed that but she did not touch it not yet we are too much alike more than i knew if i go deeperhe will have me she felt that old unhealed ache of her own the scars from all of those others that she had given herself to who had in the end only seen that she knew them too well and fled if i had known he would be anotherbut she had not known she could pull herself back and not give what he needed to him there was still time to retreat i cannot retreat he is my friend he was trying to protect me by pretending he did not know me i owe him enough to venture deeper so she did slipping past the fear the anger ah the fear and the anger are related he fears the anger there was pain dreadful pain both physical and spiritual more fear and with it a residue of selfhate deep and abiding doubt and a soulwounding that called out to her there was nothing to tell her what had caused all this what had changed the confident happy creature she had met in the waymeet to the tfyrr who doubted even despised himself and sought some kind of redemption here in lyonarie she could only read the emotions not what caused them but being nightingale now that she knew the hurt existed now that it was a part of her there was no choice for her either she had to find out what it was that troubled him and why and help him if she could the hurt was hers the soulpain was hers now as she had known it would be that was the curse that was also her gift once she read a person this deeply she was committed to dealing with what she found which was one of the reasons why she preferred to spend as much time in the company of those who were not human as possible it was difficult to read nonhumans harder still to read them to that extent very seldom did she find those whose hearts called to hers for help the concerns of the elves were either only of the moment or of the agesshe could help with neither the deliambrens were as shallow streams to her for they simply did not understand human emotions other nonhumans either could not be read at all or their needs were so alien to her that their pain slipped away from her and vanished into darkness before she could do more than grasp the fact that it was there not so with tfyrr she braced herself against the pull of his needs and his hurts but only to keep herself from being devoured by them his aches were hers now and would be until and unless she helped him to heal them the bond between them might even last beyond that moment it was too soon to tell and too late to call it back and say no wait she brought her awareness back to the here and now her hands playing of their own will despite the new hurts in her heart the hurts that were not hers and yet were now a part of her she felt as she always did on these occasions as if the pain should somehow manifest itself physically as if she should bear bleeding wounds on her hands and breast as if she should look as bruised and broken outside as tfyrr was within but of course there were no such signs nor was it likely that tfyrr had any notion what had just happened he sang on finding his momentary release in music just as she herself often did ah lady of the night we are more alike than i had thought with the readiness if not the ease of long practice she walled as much away as she could inside herself and smoothed over the pain that she could not wall away eventually it would all be dealt with or not but for the moment it was this moment that counted and there were more duties that she owed than this one she had her duty as a musician as well as a healer and it was as a musician that she was operating now she sang and smiled played and probed the needs of her audience and answered those needs and eventually the set was over lets go somewhere quiet for the break she said once they had taken their bows and left the stage we have a great deal of catching up to do and as the skin around his eyes twitched she added quickly unless you have somewhere you need to go i dont want to get in the way of anything that you are already committed to no he said after a moments awkward silence no i dont have anywhere to go and no one is expecting me i had hoped to get back before darkness fell but darkness had already fallen by the time you left tyladens office she pointed out and he sighed i thought as much he said it in a discouraged but unsurprised tone i suppose i can fly in the darkness there is enough light coming up from the streets she interrupted him feeling more than annoyed at tyladen for not taking care of this himself it was tyladens fault that you were here longer than you wanted to be and tyladens faultor so i suspectthat you were caught here by those men tyladen can damn well arrange for you to be taken toahwherever it is you need to go in some kind of protected conveyance and ill tell him so myself she actually started in the direction of tyladens office when tfyrr laughing selfconsciously intercepted her by the four winds now i see the nightingale defending the nestling he said catching her arm gently so fierce a bird no wonder nothing dares to steal her young no no my friend i can fly at night i am not night blind like a poor hawk and i will be far safer flying above your city at night than i will be in any kind of conveyance on the ground she let herself be coaxed out of going to confront the owner of freehold he was right after all it would be difficult if not impossible for a marksman to make out a dark moving shadow against the night sky but that did not make her less wroth with tyladen for his sake if i didnt dare let him know that i am working for the deliambrens i would give him a real piece of my mind the wretched stupid man oh how id like to she forced herself to remain calm even tyladen could not ignore this nights nearriot and when she told him what she had seen well he just might decide to take a little better care of his agent she hesitated then offered her invitation then if you can stayand want to stayi have one more set after its over we could go up on the roof its quiet up there and no one will bother us and no one will know if you leave from there if i dont tell them he pondered a moment then agreed but she sensed not only reluctance but resistance he knew somehow that she was going to try to get him to talk about what had happened to him and he was determined not to do so and being nightingale of course this only ensured that she would be more persistent than his determination could withstand just wait my poor friend she thought as they spoke of inconsequentials that he apparently hoped would throw her off the track just wait i have learned my patience from the elves who think in terms of centuries if i am determined to prevail you cannot hold against me tfyrr sat through nightingales last set as part of the audience watching those who were absorbed in the beauty of her music and the power that she put into it she held them captive held them in the palm of her hand there was no world for them outside of this little room and every story she told in melody and lyric came alive for them he saw that much in their dreaming eyes their relaxed posture the concentration in their faces was this that mysterious bardic magic at work if so he couldnt see any reason to find fault with it she wasnt doing anything to hurt these people and was doing a great deal to help them they listened to her and became caught up in her spell losing most of the stress that they had carried when they entered the door of her performance room how could there be anything wrong with that he only wished that he could join them he was shaken by the fight more than he wanted to admit the entire incident was branded with extraordinary vividness and detail in his memory and there was no getting rid of it if he closed his eyes he could still see the stiletto and the man holding it the man with the cold eyes of someone who does not care what he does so long as he is paid for it the eyes of high bishop padrik padrik had looked that way the one time he had really looked at tfyrr he had weighed out tfyrrs life in terms of what it would buy him and had coldly determined the precise way to extract the maximum advantage from killing the haspur tfyrr had been nothing more to him than an object and not even an object of particular value as much as by the memory of his attacker he was shaken by the memory of his first instinctive reaction i lost all control no one knows it but me but i did i could easily have murdered again granted this time my victim would have been someone who was attacking me directly without provocation but it would still have been murder rage had taken him over completely a dreadful killing rage had engulfed him a senseless anger that urged him to lash out and disembowel the man only luck had saved the man luck and the ability to get out of sight before tfyrr could act would he have felt that same rage a year or more ago he didnt think so singing with nightingale calmed him simply sitting here listening to her sing alone calmed him even more but he was still shaking inside that was as much the reason why he had decided to stay here for a bit as was his desire to talk to nightingale lyrebird i must remember that she is called lyrebird here i wonder why in fact paired with his desire to talk with her was his fear of resuming their interrupted friendship i cannot place her in jeopardy and she will be in as much danger as i am from my enemies if they learn that we are friends i am not certain that tyladen will be willing to protect her even if i warn him after all she is nothing more than an employee to him and he knew with deep certainty that he was in danger from at least one enemy who was willing to hire bravos to come after him he had known even before nightingale told him that there were at least two people in that staged brawl who had been targeting him and perhaps three or more being thwarted once would not stop them they would only seek him somewhere else or seek some other way to reach me than the direct route if he came and went via the sky there would only be two places where they could ambush him within the palace grounds or within freehold both places had their own protections and both had people who would protect him but nightingale had no wings she could not travel except on the ground he knew her kind she was a gypsy and it was not natural for her to stay in one place for long she would not stay here even if he warned her that it wasnt safe to leave if his enemies knew that he valued her they would not hesitate to use her against him he sighed and sipped at the iced herbal drink someone had brought him while nightingale sang and played one of her strange gypsy songs i wish that i knew who my enemy was and why he sent men after me it could be one of the other court musicians who wishes to be rid of me it could be one of the advisors or one of their allies who thinks that i have too great an influence with the king he sighed if only i did but that doesnt matter as long as someone believes that i do it also could be someone who simply does not wish to see a nonhuman in a position of such importance and visibility or it could be for none of those reasons for a cause i cannot even think of it could also be that someone in this city possibly with the church had recognized him as the demon who killed a church guard since that killing could not actually be proved this might be their own way of seeing that justice was done all of those people would have ample reason to try to use nightingale even someone connected with the church and high bishop padrik that might be worst of all for her he had seen the shadowed fear in her eyes on the single occasion when they had spoken about the power of the churchthe idea of nightingale in the hands of a sadist like padrik left him cold and shaking he would not have been happy until he had forced her to confess to some awful crime so that he could have her done away with in a way that brought him more power he would have done it as casually as swatting an insect and i know that there are more men like him in this human church i have seen them watched them as they watch me in the court their eyes full of hot hatred or worse cold and calculating indifference like padrik others are important to them only as the means to power or the taking of power from them he was so lost in his own bleak thoughts that he didnt realize nightingales last set was over until she came to his seat and tapped him on the shoulder he started and stared up at her lets go up to the roof she said not commenting on how jumpy he was youll feel better up there with open sky above you now how did she know that or was it simply logical deduction for a creature with wings whatever the cause it shows a sensitivity that i had not expected from a human he followed her up several flights of stairs down a corridor on the fourth floor that she said was part of the staffs area and up a short set of ladderlike stairs she pushed open a hatchway and climbed up he followed her to find himself once again under the open sky but now it was quite dark with stars winking through thin high clouds she shut the hatch quietly there are probably a few more people up here she said quite softly but they wont bother us and i know where they are likely to be she beckoned to him and he followed her a gracefully moving shadow lightly frosted with silver from the half moon overhead she took him to the very edge of the roof and patted the raised rim of kneehigh poured stone that kept people from walking right off the edge this makes a perfectly good bench if you arent afraid of heights she told him laughing a little at the absurdity of the idea of a haspur with no head for heights he echoed her laughthough it sounded a bit feeble to himand joined her on the improvised seat a warm thermal rose from the pavement below still heated from the afternoons sun i come up here nearly every night except when i am very weary she told him as she looked out over the city below then up at the moon and stars above its very peaceful im sure freehold is a wonderful place but if you work here you get very tired of it especially if you arent particularly used to cities i dont like cities very much myself i prefer the countryside id trade a hundred freeholds for one good faire at kingsford he had more than his share of questions that he wanted to ask her about that what in the world was she doing here for one thing why here and why now the last time he had seen her she had been going in the opposite direction of lyonarie there were no free bards here at least none that he knew of and probably not many gypsies either so what had possessed her to come here and what had possessed her to take a position as an entertainer in freehold of all places the trouble was if he asked questions she would be as free to ask questions of him i was rather surprised to find you working here he said finally trying to find a topic that would not lead back to the weeks he did not want to discuss only a few weeks really not very long at all to turn me into a rabid murderer not half as surprised as i was she replied dryly i have been wondering if i should tell you thisbut given what happened tonight i think perhaps id better if she should tell himshe gave him no chance to collect his thoughts our mutual friends the deliambrens wanted me to come here to ferret out information for them she said surprising him all over again nightingale working as a deliambren agent but them among others that is she added and coughed i have many friends among the nonhumans and they seem to have a high regard for my ability to observe things they asked me to come here and try to discover what i could aboutoh i know this sounds ridiculous but there are reasonsabout the high king he used to be a great leader but now it seems that there are other people making all the decisions i was besieged on all sides when it came down to it i had at least three different people ask me to come here and simply keep my eyes and ears open why you tfyrr finally asked she tapped her fingers on the balustrade to be honest im not certain i have done similar things in the past buttfyrr it was never something like this they have more faith in my limited abilities than i do i suppose she shook her head as it happens they are all people to whom i owe somethingloyalty favors respect i did listen i understood why they were asking me i knew that there were indeed some things i could learn even with my limited abilities much to their disappointment i refused to promise anything and i hope they are not even aware that i made it here he felt his beak gaping in shock at her words not just that the deliambrens had tried to recruit her as an agentbut that she was going along with it without any of the help she would be getting if she had agreed to aid them but whywhy are you doing this alone he asked isnt it more dangerous uncertain one of my friends told me that they had already sent people in who had been uncovered and had to leave it seemed to me she continued idly tapping out a rhythm on the stone that if even one person that i didnt personally know and could count on became aware that i was here and working as a deliambren agent that was one person who might betray me either on purpose or inadvertently thats why i call myself lyrebird hereand i have yet another name out on the street if i find anything of substance i will tell those who wanted me to come here but not before and not until i am out of lyonarie he reflected ruefully that it was too bad he could not have done the same it is a little more difficult to hide a pair of wings a beak and talons he replied by way of acknowledgement that he was doing the same work as she ah she listened for a moment but he could not tell which of the street sounds or night sounds had caught her attention i take it that you are the new court musician that everyone has been babbling about and that our dear deliambren friends talked you into promising what i wouldnt he did not bother to ask how she knew if the deliambrens had tried to recruit her as an agent she must have ways of gathering information that he had not even guessed and here he had been under the impression that she was nothing more than a simple musician the more she revealed the more mysterious she became and the more attractive and the more he was determined to protect her from the danger following him it was harperus idea he replied he seemed to think i might have some kind of influence for good on the high king he was certain that i would at least be able to overhear things that would be useful hmm he wished he could see her face so that he could tell what she was thinking and have you had influence on the high king that is i assume you would not have come here tonight if you hadnt already learned some things that were useful not that i have seen he said honestly then added greatly daring but then i have not got the magic that some of you free bards do if i did perhaps i could actually do something to influence king theovere now let me see if that shakes loose an admission of magic from her do we she retorted sharply well if i had magic what do you think i would use it for if i were in your position to get the high king to listen to what i am singing he replied feeling the pain and frustration he felt at seeing the king acting the fool building up in him yet again the king still has his moments when he does things that are not only wise but very very clever he was a good ruler and not that long agoyet now now he delegates all his power to people who abuse it and wastes his own time with musicians and deliambren toys she finished for him i know ive heard all about it from the palace kitchen no one there knows why though or what caused the change he hasnt been ill he hasnt had an accident and theres no record of this kind ofof loss of mental power running in his family is he being drugged or has he simply been listening to the wrong people for so long that he no longer thinks clearly or pays heed to the warning signs about him i dont know either he admitted deflated and if anyone else knows they havent confided in me nightingale turned toward him in the darkness and made a little soundnot quite a chuckle but full of irony they wouldnt now would they after all you are only a lowly musician one of the very things that the king is frittering away his time with why should anyone who wants to restore theovere to what he was trust you he felt his talons scraping along the stone of the balustrade as he clenched his fist in frustration he said nothing though and she did not press him i heard she began again tentatively and he sensed she was going to change the subject i heard that you had been traveling with harperus all this time that you were somewhere around gradford last fall at around the time robin and kestrel were there too too near the bone he shied away quickly i dont remember all the places we were he lied knowing the lie sounded clumsy after all given how precise his memory was how could he forget where he had been harperus wagon travels faster than beasts can pull it if he chooses to make it so we have been too many places to count i thought for certain i heard harperus say the two of you were heading for gradford when we parted company though she persisted and he had the feeling that she was trying to probe for something didnt you even tell me yourself that you were going to meet robin and kestrel there he winced this time and was glad that it was too dark for her to see it i dont recall he lied again its been a year at least after all and a great deal has happened between then and now she replied but then she stopped pressing him except perhaps to me i didnt do very much in the time since you left me i spent most of the time i passed among humans in very small villages where nothing much ever happens my audiences are small my recompense smaller but it is enough to keep me that is all the news that i have for you i fear it took a moment for that statement to sink in and when it did he was astonished why would she do that look how she fills rooms here where there are all sorts of entertainers why would she choose places where they could never understand what a great musician she truly is but he fumbled for words that would not sound like an insult but you are a superb musician you should be performing in places like freehold all the time why do you spend your time your talents among people who can never appreciate them never he heard the irony in her voice again but one of those people not that long ago was our own little lady lark there are hidden treasures in those tiny villages tfyrr now and again i come upon one with the musichunger in him and i wake it up and show him that he does not have to remain where he is and let it starve to death for that alone it is worth the days and weeks among people who would not care how well i played so long as i could play the huntsman twenty or thirty times running and from the tone of her voice that was probably precisely what happened in those tiny villages she claimed to like so much there must be other reasons there are other reasons she admitted as if she had read his thoughts if some authority has a grudge against free bards or gypsies i generally know it the moment i set eyes on the people there and i can keep moving that is better than thinking that i am safe and suddenly finding an angry mayor or priest with a mob come to drive me out of town and at any rate i try not to spend much time actually in those villages there are other places where i am welcome such as with the elves perhaps hadnt harperus said something about that at a time when he was trying to distract tfyrr from his depression he hadnt been paying as much attention as he wished he had now something about nightingale being considered odd fey he said even among her own people that she spent more time among the elves and other nonhumans than among her own kind that sounds uncannily likemyself is there something that she is trying to avoid i wonder even as i is that why she spends much time among those who care little about her and much about her music there was a great deal that she was not saying and he found himself wondering what it was she had her secrets too if that was the case would she understand him and his guilt as harperus had not he was tempted to unburden himself sorely tempted but resisted the temptation he really did not want to drag anyone else into his troubles or his dangers and he did not want to burden her of all people with the knowledge of his guilt she had enough to bear i suppose i should go he said finally and glanced at her out of the corner of his eye she nodded reluctantly he thought but nodded i have work tomorrow and so do you she saidthen hesitated i dont suppose that you might be free tomorrow afternoon though would you normally the king does not need me in the afternoon he said cautiously and at the moment i believe i have learned all that i am likely to for a while from the afternoon court why because id like to guide you in the city to give you some idea what places are safe for you she replied unexpectedly and there is someone i would like you to meet well more than one person actually but there is one person i particularly want you to meet someone i think will surprise you very pleasantly i know he would like to meet you if youd like to come along with me that is he struggled with his misgivings for some time before answering he was so lonelyhe hadnt realized just how lonely he was until tonight but the few hours spent with nightingale had forced him to see just how much he needed a real friend not someone like the lord seneschal nor like nob the former was using him and tfyrr was using the seneschal and both were aware and comfortable with the arrangement the latter was a child and no real companion or equal but nightingale was different even among all of the people he had met since leaving the mountains she was comfortable with him when he was with her sometimes he turned to her and blinked to see that she did not have a beak and feathers the only humans that comfortable among the haspur were the ones who lived among them sharing their mountaintop settlements and their lives in a way those people were as much haspur as human ii think i would enjoy that he said finally letting his hunger for companionship overcome his misgivings shall i meet you here on the roof perfect she said just after noon now youd better go while the moon is still up he noddedthen impulsively reached out with a gentle talon and touched her cheek she placed her own hand on the talon and brushed her cheek and hair along the back of his hand in a caress of her own then she released himand afraid of doing or saying anything else that might release his pentup emotions he turned away from her abruptly without stopping to make a more protracted farewell he leapt to the top of the balustrade and flung himself over the edge of the roof snapping his wings open and catching the rising current of warm air coming from the pavement below in a moment he was too far from freehold to see if she was still there watching him but he sensed her felt her eyes somehow finding him in the darkness as he winged his way back to the palace and he wished that he could turn and fly back to her in deference to nightingaletanager he reminded himself on the street she is tanagerin deference to tanager they were afoot but this section of the city was not as crowded as the streets around freehold and as before crowds seemed to part before them anyway it was hot he held his wings away from his body in a futile effort to cool himself and his beak gaped a bit as he panted tanager looked comfortable enough although there were beads of moisture on her brow and running down the back of her neck she wasnt wearing much by human standards although her costume revealed less than that of some of the humans hed seen in the palace many of the people here were wearing similar clothing anyway perhaps in deference to the heat they had foregone some of that silly human body modesty he would have been more comfortable doing without his bodywrapping but nob had advised against such a move where are we going he asked dodging around a child playing in the middle of the walkway oblivious to the foot traffic around her i told you i want you to meet someone but first i want you to hear him speak she said as she threaded her way along the narrow stonepaved streets slipping skillfully between pushcarts and around knots of playing children youll understand why i want you to meet him once youve heard him at that moment she darted across the street with him in tow and trotted up the worn steps of a fairly nondescript grey stone building it wasnt until they were almost inside the door that he suddenly realized the building had a steepleit was in fact a church building a chapel as they called them here he started to balk but changed his mind just as abruptly as tanager slipped inside the open door i have heard her express fear of church priests i have seen the trouble that some of these men have caused her people as well as me she would not bring me here if she did not have a very good reason was this the place where she intended to have him meet that special person she had spoken of last night could itcould it be her lover for some reason his chest tightened at that thought and he wanted passionately for that person to be anything anyone but a lover be sensible she said nothing about a lover and why would she meet a lover in a church building he followed her noting with relief that it was much cooler inside the building than it was in the street she seized his hand as they entered the sanctuary itself gestured that he should be silent and pulled him into a secluded nook at the rear of the sanctuary they stood beneath the statue of a kindfaced grieving man out of the way where his wings would be lost among the shadows the chapel was relatively full for a midafternoon service and the first thing that tfyrr noticed was that not all of the people here were human there were at least two mintaks and he noted a felis a caniden an entire family of caprinsheads too oddly shaped to ever pass as human poked up among the caps hoods and uncovered hair of the human attendees nor did the humans seem to care he quickly turned his attention to the priest presiding from the pulpitfor the priest of such a congregation must be as remarkable as the congregation itself he was a middleaged man if tfyrr was any judge the hair of his head had thick strands of grey in it and the hair of his beard boasted the same he was neither short nor tall and his build was not particularly memorable his square face had the same kindly look to it as that of the statue they sheltered under and his voice though soft was powerful with pleasant resonances but it was his words that caught and held tfyrr just as they held everyone else here perhaps not the words themselves for it was evident that the priest was no writer of superb speeches as bishop padrik had been but the content of the sermon was something that tfyrr had never expected to hear from the lips of a human priest for this priest standing before humans in a chapel built by humans was preaching the brotherhood of all beings and citing examples of the humanity of nonhumans to prove his point tfyrrs beak gaped open again and not because he was overheated the more the priest spoke the more confused tfyrr became bishop padrik had used his churchs holy book to prove that any creature not wearing human form was evil this priest used the same bookalmost the same wordsto prove the very opposite he was sincere tfyrr could not doubt it he was devout there was no doubt of that either but he was saying and clearly believed the very opposite of what the high bishop of gradford swore was true how could this be he was still gaping in surprise when the priest finished the service and the congregation happily filed out leaving the chapel empty but for the priest himself and the two of them the priest turned to the altar putting away the implements of the service and cleaning it for the next service tanager remained where she was and tfyrr stayed with her you can come out now tanager said the priest over his shoulder as he folded and put away a spotless white altarcloth and your friend too im glad you came tanager laughedher laugh had a different sound than nightingales laugh it was lighter and somehow seemed to belong to a younger person tfyrr could only marvel at her ability to assume or discard a persona with a change of the costume i persuaded my friend to come here to meet you but he didnt know he was coming to a church service father ruthvere she said banteringly i havent had a chance to ask him if he was bored or not the priest put the last of the implements away and turned stepping off the dais and descending into the main body of the chapel i hope he wasnt my dear child father ruthvere said chuckling but i make no claims for my ability as a speaker i never won any prizes in rhetoric as he moved forward so did they and as tfyrr came out of the shadows father ruthveres eyes widened and then narrowed with speculation there cant be more than one birdman in this city he began with hesitation in his voice but i have to wonder what this gentleman is doing here rather than on the palace grounds tfyrr glanced down at tanager who nodded encouragingly i am the only haspur in all of this kingdom that i know of sir he replied gravely i am pleased to make your acquaintance father ruthvere i can assure you you did not bore me coming from the high kings newly appointed personal musician that is quite more praise than i deserve father ruthvere responded just as gravely i hope you know that i meant every word and i am not the only priest in this city who feels this way he held out his hand and tfyrr took it awkwardly i should be very pleased if you might consider me a friend sire tfyrr the priest continued then twinkled up at him i think though despite the message of my sermons it might be a bit much for me to ask you to consider me as your brother that surprised a laugh out of tfyrr perhaps he agreed and cocked his head to one side he decided to try a joke if i were to present you as such my people would be much distressed that you had featherplucked yourself to such a dreadful extent father ruthvere laughed heartily that is a better joke than you know sire tfyrr i have a pet bird that unfortunately has that very bad habitand my colleagues have been unkind enough to suggest that there is some resemblance between us tanager smiled she was clearly quite pleased that tfyrr and the priest had hit it off so well for that matter so was tfyrr they exchanged a few more pleasantries before tfyrr and tanager took their leave the priest hurried off to some unspecified duty while they left the way they had arrived surprised tanager asked when they reached the street again i was the first time i heard him and hes telling the truth hes not the only priest preaching the brotherhood of all beings hes just the one with the chapel nearest freehold it is a movement that seems to be gaining followers i am trying to think of some ulterior motive for him and i cannot tfyrr admitted perhaps attendance falling off perhaps a gain in prestige if he somehow converted nonhumans to your religion neither and therere more problems associated with attracting nonhumans than there are rewards tanager told him as i told you i was just as surprised and i tried to think of some way that this could be a trick i couldntand information i have assures me that father ruthvere truly deeply and sincerely believes in what he was preaching tfyrr picked his way carefully among the cobblestones and thought about the way that the priest had met his own direct gaze it was very difficult for humans to meet the eyes of a haspur for very long just as the gaze of a hawk direct and penetrating often seemed to startle people the gaze of a haspur with all of the intelligence of a haspur behind it seemed to intimidate them father ruthvere had no such troubles no i believe you he said finally and i find him as disconcerting as you humans find me he is one of my sources of information she said as they turned into a street lined with vendors of various foods and drink we share what weve learned he tells me whats going on inside the church and i tell him the rumors ive learned in freehold and in the palace kitchen tfyrr nodded she had already told him about her clever ploy that got her into the lower servants kitchen every day well i can add to that what i learn he said though i am afraid it will be stale news to him she shrugged maybe maybe not ohlook down that street that might be a good place for you to go if youre caught afoot and need to get into the air she pointed down a deadend street that culminated in a bulbshaped courtyard unlike the rest of the street there were no overhanging second stories there he nodded and made a mental note of the place she continued to guide him through the narrow twisting streets pointing out flat roofs and protruding brickwork where he could land then climb down to the streetfinding places where he could get enough of a running start that he could take off again and all the while she was showing him these things she was also questioning him she was so subtle and so good at it that he didnt really notice what she was doing until he found himself clamping his beak down on a confession of what had happened to him in gradford it was only the fact that he made a habit of reticence that saved him the words tried to escape from him he put a curb on his tongue and still his heart wanted to unburden all of his troubles to her so he distracted both her and himself with a description of what the high king had done that day or more accurately what the high king had not done and how troubled he was by it all there is something fundamentally wrong with the way theovere is acting he said finally my people have no equivalent to his office butif you allow yourself to take advantage of great privilege and great power should you not feel guilty if you do not also accept what obligations come with it should that not be required in order to enjoy the privilege tanager sighed youd think so wouldnt you she replied i know that i would feel that way the kings advisors do not he told her they continue to tell him that the most important thing that a king must learn is how to delegate responsibility they praise him for shirking his most important tasks for ignoring the pleas of those who have nowhere else to take their grievances and concerns i do not understand tanager looked very thoughtful at thatand more like nightingale than she had since they had begun their tour of the streets i think that perhaps i do she finally said lets go back to freehold i want to talk about this somewhere i know is safe from extra ears that placesomewhere safe from extra earsturned out to be her own room in freehold supplied as part of her wages tfyrr examined it while she took a change of outfit into the bathroom and turned from tanager to lyrebird there probably had not been much supplied with the room other than the furnitureand it was unmistakably the deliambren notion of spare but nightingale had put her own touches on the place the bench and bed were covered with dozens of delicately embroidered and fringed shawls and there were extra cushions on both the walls had been draped with more shawls and she had hung a small collection of jewelry on hooks fastened there as well her harps sat in one corner out of the way and a handdrum hung on the wall above them id begun to wonder about something lately nightingale told him her voice muffled a little by the closed door and what you just told me confirmed it she emerged gowned in the dark green dress she had taken in with her and settled herself on the chest leaving the bed to him humans are odd creatures she said finally we often go out of our way to justify things that we want to do and do it so successfully that we come to believe the justifications ourselves he nodded waiting to hear more take king theovere she said after a pause he was working hard very hard he was certainly one of the best high kings that alanda has seen for awhile and he solved four of the most terrible problems the twenty kingdoms have seen all in a very short period of time she held up a finger the baydenanders border dispute a second finger the grain smut and the resulting famine a third finger the kindgode incursion and the fourth and final finger the black barons revolt all four of those took place within a single decade any one of them would have been enough for a single high king to fail at or solve tfyrr nodded although he hadnt heard anything about three out of the four problems she mentionedbut then again he had just begun to scrape the top of the palace archives and he didnt imagine there was much about a grain smut that would make a good ballad your point he asked theovere would have every reason to be tired bone tired by the end of that time and when his advisors began to tell him that he had done enough that he should rest that he deserved to take a rest he listened to them she tilted her head to one side and stared up into his eyes waiting for him to think about what she had said but he did deserve to take a rest tfyrr pointed out at least he deserved some rest if those problems were as weighty to solve as you say of course he did she exclaimed im not saying that he didntbut the point wasnt that he didnt deserve to rest the point is that he couldnt rest she licked her lips clearly searching for an explanation he is the high king he could and probably should have reorganized his duties so that he had some time to recuperate but he could not abandon his duties do you see what im saying i think so tfyrr said hesitantly there really isnt anyone who can do what he can who can be the ultimate authority so when his advisors started telling him to rest to delegate important business to someone else they were telling him what he wanted to hear but not the truth she finished for him when he groped for words he could arrange to take more time in solving those problems that wont get worse with time he can ask for help from any of the twenty kings he can look to his allies for some help he cannot tell someone else to solve them for him tfyrr shook his head it is easy to feel sorry for him he said thinking back to theovere and realizing that he had seen signs of strain that he had not noticed at the time perhaps even those temper tantrums were a sign of that strain it seems like too much of a burden for one man no one should be expected to bear that much nightingale spread her hands in a gesture of bafflement theres no good answer she admitted there is a reason why the high king has the privileges that he has why he lives in a place that is second only to the fortresscity in luxury why virtually anything he wants is given to him since his duties cant be made easier his life is made easier but do you see what our answer might be tfyrr thought it all through before he answered theovere was tired his advisors told him what he wanted to hearthat he needed to stop working so hard he needed to rest he needed to give over some of his responsibility to others so he followed their advice and found that he liked the new lifeand his advisors only reinforced his feelings when they told him that he was doing the right thing it probably began with very little things but by nowby now it has built up to the point that theovere is actually doing very little in the way of his duty and the advisors are still telling him what a wonderful leader he is nightingale nodded emphatically as she put her hair up into a complicated twist furthermore since they are not letting anyone in to speak to him who is likely to tell him something that contradicts what they are saying he believes that everything is exactly as it was when he was in his prime he wants to believe that and the sycophants are only too happy to tell him so tfyrr fanned his wings a little in the breath of moving air from the ventilator grille it will be difficult to turn that trend around he offered diffidently i have been tryingi have been inserting songs with a particular theme that great power demands the acceptance of responsibility into the performances that the king has asked me to give but as i told you i have not seen any evidence that he has paid any more attention to them than to the story ballads or the love songs nightingales hands stopped moving for a moment her eyes took on the expression of someone who is looking deep into her own spirit and tfyrr wondered what she was thinking then with an abrupt motion as if she had suddenly made up her mind about something she put the last twist into her hair and folded her hands on her lap tfyrr who told you that some of the free bards havemagic she asked harperus he replied promptly harperus told me that you have it in fact well not magic as suchhe told me that many of you have some sort of power that he and his people could not weigh or measure but that observation would prove existed he said that you could influence peoples minds among other things he suspected that you couldwell see into the future he said that some deliambrens believe that you can influence events as well as minds provided that the influence need only be very small he has real evidence that you can heal people in ways that have nothing to do with medicine as he knows it she bit her lower lip and looked away from him for the first time i am not really supposed to admit to this she said finally especially not to someone connected with the deliambrens she looked back at him with a wan smile harperus and his kind are driven mad by things they cannot measure and if they knew we really did have abilities such as you describe they would be plaguing us constantly to find out what it is we do and how we do it tfyrr nodded but said nothing only waited quietly for her to continue there isthere is a power in music properly performed she said after another long moment of silence broken only by the sound of the air in the ventilators and the distant murmur of all the sounds of freehold below them you might call it magic certainly the gypsies and the elves do and so does the church although the churchmen have no idea how great or little that power really is ill put it to you briefly some bards are mages andamong other thingswe can influence the thoughts of others through our music some of us can do the other things you described as well but it is that one particular power that pertains to our situation now sometimes not often we are powerful enough to make others act against their will most of us confine ourselves to very minor acts ofwell it is manipulation and as such it could be considered improper most of the time all we do is to enhance our audiences ability to appreciate the music but you can do more tfyrr stated he had no doubt that she personally could do much more she nodded reluctantly this might be a case where doing more is justified would you care to add me and my magic to your performances for the king all you need do is bring me in as your accompanist and i can do the rest between the two of us we may be able to reawaken his sleeping conscience and rouse his slumbering sense of duty but i wont lie to you this is interference in someones mind his thoughts before you take me up on this you need to think about thatand if you would appreciate having something like this done to you if your situation and his were reversed now that she had put it baldly and offered her services and now that she had admitted that this magic was as much a form of manipulation as the overt form that theoveres advisors were doing the idea wasnt as attractive as it had been in point of fact the notion made him feel rathershaken up inside did he want to do this if he were the kingif he were in theoveres place if he were thinking clearly thinking as his old self he might but doesnt this preclude his thinking clearly wouldnt we be clouding his mind as much as all that bad advice it is a great power nightingale said softly this is why we so seldom use it it is far too tempting to misuse it he took a deep breath it is also too great an issue to decide on impulse he told her firmly i need to think about this at length and i wish there was someone anyone who i could ask for advice he was afraid that nightingale would be annoyed with him for prevaricating after she had taken the great step of not only admitting she had this power but offering to help him with it but she only nodded as if she had expected him to say something like that you should see what you can do on your own she told him you havent been doing this for very long you may be able to stir the kings conscience without any outside influence that would be betterfor him and for you i think she did understand i promise i will think about this the morality of it he told her and grimaced it may well be that the morality of manipulating one persons mind to rid him of bad influences is of less moment than the welfare of all the people human and otherwise in the twenty kingdoms there is that she agreed but i am not the one in the position to make the decision you are and i will not make your decisions for you but what would you do if you were in my place he askedno begged she sighed and shook her head if i were in your placei have traveled the roads of several of the kingdoms and seen some of the worst places in this one i can see what i think are unpleasant trends that are only going to continue if the high king remains neglectful i am prejudiced the people most immediately affected are friends of mine my own people and the free bards there are other people who will prosper if things go as i believe they will and they would certainly not thank us for interfering she smiled a little this is a long explanation for a short answer so that you can see why i feel the way i do in your place having weighed all the options and outcomes i would use the magic and see what happened you may not come to the same conclusion if you do not i cannot and will not fault you for it silence hung between them for a long time she broke it first it may be that by using the magic this way we are making ourselves into worse monsters than even the church believes us to be the next time we are tempted we might not resist and the time after that for something purely selfish we might be able to justify it to ourselves as easily as the king justifies his current neglect that is the danger he could see that oh how easily he could see that i understand he said very softly she rose and i must go to the legitimate uses of my magic she said lightly although he thought she was covering a heavy heart with her light tone you know the way to the roof i do he replied and then formed his beak into something like a human smile but i have time enough to let you work some of that magic on me before i go he thought for a moment that he had startled her but it might only have been a sudden shadow as she moved in the next breath she looked as serene as always well then shall we go down she asked i should be happy to include you in the spell perhaps one day i shall ask you to weave a magic for me alone he said playfully opening the door for her as she picked up her harp to carry it down the stairs once again that startled look came over her face but this time when she turned to look at him her expression was not as serene there was a shadow there and a hint of speculation perhaps you shall was all she said andperhaps i shall oblige you tfyrr looked up from his reading as someone rapped on the door to the suite but he did not rise to answer it he knew better now after several sharp lectures from nob about the propriety of the kings chief musician answering his own door nob answered the summons instead he spoke briefly with someone there and came back to tfyrr with a message in his hand theres someone to see you tfyrr he said with a grin that deliambren who dresses like a tailors worst nightmare he handed the small piece of paper to tfyrr who found it was simply a note from harperus asking if he was free shall i tell the page to bring him up certainly tfyrr replied absolutely at the moment he couldnt think of anyone he wanted to see more except nightingale perhaps he shook the thought away the one person he dared not think about was nightingale not now not with harperus around while she hadnt exactly sworn him to secrecy about her magic she had certainly told him in no uncertain terms that she did not want the deliambrens to know she was in the city if he thought about nightingale he might let that fact slip and she would be justifiably angry with me it was a pity since harperus for all his faults was the one person he wished he could discuss this morality of magic business with but he couldnt do that without revealing who would actually be working the magic well i will just have to deal with this on my own it had occurred to him more than once that this just might be the chance he had hoped for the act that would expiate his crime of murder the only question waswhich act would be his redemption the act of using the magic or the act of not using the magic the choice was almost as difficult to deal with as the aftermath of the crime tfyrr harperus exclaimed breaking into tfyrrs thoughts as nob let him into the room youre looking well let us say the high king does not stint his servants tfyrr replied rising to his feet and clasping harperus hand in his claws and you what mischief have you been up to old owl a great deal of mischief harperus replied but soberly and switched to deliambren actually i am now officially and with absolute truth the appointed envoy to the high king from the fortresscity i am here with a direct request from the deliambrens for theovere we absolutely need his blanket permission for the mapping expedition so the last attempt at local negotiations broke down tfyrr nodded and replied in the same language and you need from me advice harperus told him we know more about the advisors than we did he glanced at one of the sculptures to make his point but we still need to know the best time and place to approach theovere on this tfyrr closed his eyes and thought hard technically this was not a problem that the king needed to call a council about he knew that much now from all of his listening it was also not something that needed to be brought up at official court it was in fact in the nature of a personal favor and well within the high kings purview if of course theovere chose to see it that way everyone except the seneschal is going into lyonarie in two days in the afternoon he said slowly returning to the human tongue there is some sort of processionalreligious i think it is apparently important for them to be seen attending and many of them have made some elaborate arrangements for viewing stands and the distribution of alms and largesse in the kings name of course harperus said smoothly tfyrrs nares twitched of course he agreed theovere himself has been advised not to goit is going to be very hot and it would require standing in the direct sun for many hours it has been deemed inadvisable for health reasons so he and the seneschal will remain at the palace i have been asked to perform for him thenbut there will be an informal sort of court at the same time harperus eyes narrowed what sort of court he asked sharply tfyrr shrugged with elaborate casualness very minor the presentation of some gifts the requesting of personal favors that sort of thing i would not be performing if it were anything important but it strikes me that you just might have a gift with you that you meant to present to theovere i just might harperus smiled and stroked the hair on his cheekbones i know how much he enjoys our little gifts too much tfyrr thought a little sourly but he didnt say that aloud he does indeed and that would be a good time to give him such a gift without disturbing those members of his court who dont approve of deliambren craftwork true enough harperus suddenly stretched and all of the tension ran out of him like water from a broken jug he glanced around looking for a piece of purely human furniture and threw himself into a chair with casual abandon so old bird he said cheerfully what have you been up to more than you would guess tfyrr replied with perfect truth for one thing i have visited that fabulous freehold place that you recommended two days later tfyrr was unsurprised to hear harperus name announced during his performance at the informal court theovere had been playing a game of sires and barons with the lord seneschal but he readily abandoned it as harperus came into the lesser throne room holding a small package in his hand tfyrr brought the song he was singing to a polite close so that the king would not be distracted by the music and if nightingale were here we would be singing instead of staying silent harperus theovere said what brings you back here so soon his delight at seeing the deliambren was obviousin fact tfyrr didnt think he even noticed that harperus was carrying a package two things theovere harperus said genially this for one he handed the package to one of the bodyguards to open one of my people came up with a rather delightful little starprojectorah you simply put it in a dark room and it will mimic the patterns of the night stars on the ceiling and walls very soothing to look at orient it to the north and it will follow the stars in all the changes of the seasons build a room shaped like a dome and it will mimic the sky perfectly really theovere took the lumpy little device from the guard and examined it with interest why you wouldnt have to go outside to cast a horoscope would you harperus had the grace not to wince the deliambrens were usually very vocal in their scorn for astrology and astrologers no he agreed you wouldnt the purpose is mainly entertainment though well its a delightful gift theovere told him with a real smile now what is the other reason i have to assume that since you brought a gift youre going to ask a favor everyone else does it that way tfyrr winced that was a little too cynical even for theovere but harperus only laughed now who am i to go against the trend yes we do need a favor but its a minor one it wont cost you or anyone else a clipped copper and its mainly just to take care of some rather stubborn folk who think were demonspawn theovere sat back in his chair wearing a widening grin oh i know the type youre talking about so what is this favor we need your blanket permission to cross the twenty kingdoms with a rather large vehicle harperus told him were going to map all of this continent of alanda accurately well supply you and any other government with maps of your own territories of coursetheyll be detailed down to the nearest furlong we can do maps more detailed than that but theyd fill a room this size if we gave you maps of all of the kingdoms theovere looked thoughtful at that we might need something that detailed he said finally you ought to have some copies made up for the archives here if nothing else then he grinned again oh i know why those old goats dont want you crossing their kingdoms and it has nothing to do with what you deliambrens and your machines are or are not it doesnt harperus raised both his eyebrows in feigned surprise as if you didnt know the reason too old owl it occurred to tfyrr that theoveres cynicism was contagious of course not theovere glanced at his seneschal for confirmation they know that once i have accurate maps im likely to find out theyve been adding to their territory an inch or two at a time for years and of course once i have maps like that i have to send my personal surveyors out to make certain that the borders are marked correctly dont i the lord seneschal nodded his lips compressed into a thin line though whether from tension or because he was trying not to say something he shouldnt tfyrr wasnt certain i believe you ought to give the deliambrens that blanket permission your majesty the lord seneschal said after a moments pause you really dont have to call a council on it any more than you had to call a council to add sire tfyrr to your personal household it is in the nature of a favor from you to lord harperus after all tfyrr held his tongue though it was difficult it was very clever of the seneschal to have brought up the stormy council session that ended with his own appointment to the kings personal household theovere was still steaming over that oneand the reminder of how recalcitrant most of his advisors had been was exactly what harperus needed theovere would see this as a multiple opportunity now he could do harperus who he liked a favor he could do the deliambrens a favor that might earn him more little toys like the starprojector he could thwart the council taking revenge for the way they had tried to block his appointment of tfyrr he could obtain maps that would help him to solve disputes between the kings between the barons between the sires he could enforce decisions on the strength of those maps and he can prove that he is still the high king perhaps my music is working this will harm no one your majesty the seneschal urged and it will be of great benefit to many theovere did not think it over for more than a heartbeat after that fine he said and gestured to three of the royal scribes consider it done he leaned his head back for a moment and rattled off the appropriate language for the official document the scribes took it all down as fast as theovere recited feebleminded i dont think so tfyrr remarked to himself not when he can do that without even blinking when they finished they presented all three copies to the seneschal who made certain that they were identical then handed them on to theovere to sign and seal one of the three he presented to harperus on the spot there you are lord harperus he said with a smile signed sealed and official no one will argue with your little expedition now he turned to the chief scribe and handed him the remaining two copies see that the usual duplicates are made and so on he told the man butsend them along to the councilors with oh the household documents this certainly doesnt have any more importance than an inventory of linen the scribe bowed face expressionless and took himself out the lord seneschals mouth twitched tfyrr knew why theyll take those household accountings and give them to some flunky to file and never look at them theyll never know about this declaration unless harperus has to use it in some way that draws attention to it and by then it will be too late of course oh clever feebleminded no no not theovere now the high king said turning toward tfyrr who was very glad that he did not have a face that was as easy to read as a humans id really like you to hear more of your friends magnificent singing if you have the time for it harperus smiled and took a seat when the king indicated he could i always have time for tfyrr your majesty he said smoothly and i am glad that you have learned that my friend is far more talented than he seems tfyrr only bowed without blinking an eyebut in subtle revenge he began a deliambren courting song full of double and triple dealings and such vivid descriptions of who did what to whom that a human priest would have had it banned on the spot as the vilest of pornography and watching harperus face as he struggled to remain polite was revenge enough for all harperus had thus far inflicted on him chapter seven nightingale waited for tfyrr perched on a metal balcony on the exterior of freehold streetlamps gave all the light she needed to see what lay below her although it wasnt much cooler now than it had been this afternoon tfyrr had told her three nights ago that he wanted to arrive at freehold openly tonight she hadnt been all that sure it was a good idea but apparently harperus and tyladen thought it was best if he were actually seen coming and going now and again but for him to be seen by the maximum number of people he would have to arrive afoot just after sunset and not come flying in to the roof long after dark no one has tried to attack him since the first attempt she reminded herself no one has even dared to enter freehold and so much as look at him crossly we have walked the streets of lyonarie during the day together and no one has tried to ambush us he believes the danger is over so why did she still have misgivings why did she expect trouble when there had been no sign of trouble she sighed and rested her chin on her hand peering between the bars of the railing because i am always seeing danger she admitted to herself even where there might not be any danger isnt that why i am waiting here above the street watching for him im going to extremes because there could be trouble at least she had the night off those who were featured performers got one night in seven to rest silas was playing though and she was looking forward to listening to him with tfyrr the exterior of freehold was festooned in several places with metal balconies staircases and walkways some of which connected the building with others on the block none of which could actually be reached from the ground outside only from special window exits above the second floor or from the roof itself that made them good places to watch the street below many of the staff did just that in their off hours especially in the balmier months this was not a balmy month the heat rising from the street below was enough to bake bread on the balcony and nightingales hair was damp with sweat im going to feel the right fool if nothing happens she thought ironically getting baked for nothing but a stupid feeling that things have been too quiet ah well it wont be the first time that ive made a fool of myself at least there was no one here to see her and from below it was very difficult to tell that there was anyone at all on this secondfloor walkway she had made it even harder since she was sitting crosslegged below the railing and had taken care to wear one of her nondescript tanager outfits nothing clever about that though i just didnt want to get anything nice all sweaty and dirty freehold faced a much newer block of buildings across the narrow street it was one of those blocks with second floors that overhung the street below just about everyone took shelter in the shadowed area under the overhang even at night for one thing people had a bad habit of tossing noxious things out of the secondfloor windows at night even though it was supposed to be against the law for another it was marginally cooler there the pavement hadnt been baked all day long by the sun it wasnt hard to identify people even from this walkway and she amused herself by trying to recognize some of her regulars coming toward freehold movement of something larger than a pedestrian coming up the street caught her eye and she turned to see what was coming odd i havent seen that many horsemen here in a long time at least not all together but she dismissed them from her mind as soon as she saw them for she spotted tfyrr turning the corner at the other end of the block approaching freehold from the shelter of the overhang like everyone else he looked relaxed his wings were not held tightly to his body as they were whenever he was nervous she smiled to see that tiny sign something must have gone well for him today but her smile vanishedfor the horsemen suddenly spurred their beasts into a lurching run scattering the other pedestrians before them and converged on him the horses were quick nimblefooted and used to the city streets cutting tfyrr off before he even knew they were there her heart started up into her throat and her chest constricted with sudden fear there were seven of them whoever his attackers were they werent taking any chances on him getting away they had closed in on him and surrounded him trapping him under the overhang where he couldnt take to the air his talons were of limited use in a situation like this one no one was going to come to his aid not in this neighborhoodthere were a few of her army of children loitering about the street but children could do nothing against horsemen even unarmed horsemen one of the boys rushed toward the door of freehold and began to pound on it frantically but there was no way that enough help would arrive in time from inside in a few moments they could subdue him haul him onto a horse and carry him away but she was a gypsy and a gypsy is never unarmed she pulled the sash from around her waist and dove into her pocket for the pennies left over from her distribution of largesse to the children this afternoon those arent battletrained cavalry beasts those are only common riding horseseven as the first of the riders moved to pull something from his belt she had fitted a penny into the pocket of her sash whirled it three times over her head and let it fly she had kept herself fed many a time with the sling her aim did not fail her this time either with a much larger target than the tiny head of a squirrel her penny hit the rump of the horse with a satisfying smack and more satisfying was the horses natural reaction to the stinging missile it was as she had hoped much worse than the worst biting fly as the first horse reared and neighed wildly completely unseating his rider she lobbed another two pennies at two more of the hapless mounts as the first man landedbadlyon the pavement the next two horses reacted the same way the first one had only instead of simply throwing their riders and dancing around like beasts possessed these two reared bucking their riders off and bolted lumbering into the rest of the horses scattering them for the moment that was enough to give tfyrr the opening he needed he dashed into the gap left when the first horse ran off and launched himself into the air wings beating powerfully further panicking the horses the street was full of neighing dancing horses or so it seemed their riders had their hands full for the moment she didnt wait to see what would happen next if anyone down there suspected that they had been attacked from one of the balconies and happened to look up she could be in serious trouble she ducked inside the nearest window exit getting into hiding quickly before any of tfyrrs assailants had a chance to calm his beast look up and spot her then she ran for the inside stairs heading for the roof that surely would be where he would go freehold meant the nearest point of safety and the roof was the best place for him to land hell be in a panic and once he gets out of the streetlights his eyes wont have time to adjust and hell be flying halfblind he may land hard she burst out onto the roof at the same time he landed as hard and clumsily as she had expected and as he heard her footfall behind him he whirled to face her hands fanned talons extended in an attack stance his eyes were wild black pupils fully dilated his beak parted and his tongue extended as he hissed at her tfyrr she cried its me its all right joyee is getting the freehold peacekeepers at the doorno one is going to get past them she expected him to relax then but he didnt so much relax as collapse going to his knees his wings drooping around him one moment he was ready to slash her to ribbons the next he was falling to pieces himself dear lady she ran to him in alarm he moved to reach for her feebly and when she touched his arm his emotional turmoil boiled up to engulf her making her own breath come short and her throat fill with bile quickly she shunted it away helped him to his feet and led him as quickly as she could to the staircase my room i have to get him somewhere quiet if he panics more she didnt want to speculate he was armed with five long talons on each hand and four longer talons on each foot not to mention that cruel beak this collapse might only be momentary if he thought he was in danger again and lost control of himself well she had seen hawks in a panic they could and did put talons right through a mans hand tfyrr was at least ten times the size of a hawk somehow she got him into her room and shut the door she lowered the bed and put him down on it dimming the lights he seemed to be in a state of shock now he shook every feather trembling and he didnt seem to know she was there all right i can work with that i dont need him to notice me of course not all she needed was to touch himand open up every shield she had on herself but there was no choice and no hesitation she sat down beside him laid one hand on his arm and released her shielding walls it was worse much worse than she had ever dreamed after a time she realized that he was speaking brokenly some of it was in her tongue some in his own but she finally pieced together what he was saying aided by the flood of emotions that racked him he could not weep of course it seemed horribly cruel to her that he did not have that release if ever anyone needed to be able to weep it was tfyrr he had gone to gradford on behalf of harperus and he had been captured and held as a demon by agents of the church they had bound him imprisoned him in a cage so small he could not even spread his wings which had driven him half mad she tried to imagine it and failed take all the worst nightmares the most terrible of fears then make them all come true the haspur needed space freedom needed these things the way a human needed air and light take those awayand then take away air and light as well how did he endure it only by descent into madness but that had not been enough for them then they had starved himwhich had sent him past madness altogether turned him from a thinking being into a being ruled only by fear pain and instinct as familiar as she was with hawks she knew only too well what they were like when they hungered their entire being centered on finding prey and eating itand woe betide anything that got in the way but tfyrr had never been so overwhelmed by his own instincts before he had not known such a thing could happen he retained just enough of his reasoning ability to take advantage of an opportunity to escape provided by the free bards he did not have enough left to do more than react instinctively when one of the church guards tried to stop him he did not realize what he had done until afterafter he had killed and eaten a sheep on the mountainside and remembered with a haspurs extraordinary memory what had happened as he escaped he could not even soften the blow to himself by forgetting he killed he had never killed before other than the animals that were his food certainly he had never even hurt another thinking being before for all their fearsome appearance the haspur were surprisingly gentle and they had not engaged in any kind of conflict for centuries it was inconceivable for the average haspur to take a sentient life with his own talons oh there were haspur who retained some of the savage nature of their ancestors enough that they served as guards to warn off wouldbe invaders or destroy them if they must but the average haspur looked on the guards the same way the average farmer looked on the professional mercenary captain with a touch of awe a touch of queasiness and the surety that he could not do such a thing to discover that he could had undone tfyrr to learn twice now that his battlemadness had been no momentary aberration was just as devastating gradually he allowed her to hold him as he shook and rocked back and forth his spirit in agony he had come close so close to killing again tonight that the experience had reopened all his soulwounds the man who had been nearest him had been reaching for a handcrossbow at his beltand that was how he had been captured the first time with a drugged dart shot by a man who caught him on the ground the horror of that experience was such that he would rather die or kill again than endure it a second time and with her spirit open to his she endured all the horror of it with him and the horror of knowing that he could and would kill as well his throat ached and clenched his breath came in hardwon gasps harsh and unmusical and every muscle in his body was as tight as it could be if he had been a human he would have been sobbing uncontrollably he could notso she wept for him she understood with every fiber of her spirit just how his heart cried out with revulsion at the simple fact that he had taken a life that if forced to he would do so again there was no room in his vision of the world for selfdefense only for those who killed and those who did not she knew deep inside her bones why he hated himself for it he had not stopped had not tried to subdue rather than kill never mind that he was mad with fear pain hunger never mind that the man who had tried to stop his escape would probably have killed him to prevent it the man himself was not his enemy the man was only doing the job hed been set tfyrr had not even paused for a heartbeat to consider what he was doing he had struck to kill and fled with the mans heartblood on his talons and she told him so over and over between her sobs of grief for him just how and why she understood she would have felt the same precisely the same even though there were plenty of people she considered her friends and clansfolk who would never agree with her her personal rulewhich she did not impose on anyone elseforbade killing she knew that she might find herself in the position one day of having to kill or die herself she did not know how she would meet that she tried to make certain to avoid situations where that was the only way out which was why of course she avoided cities death was cheap in cities the more people the cheaper it was at least out in the countryside life was held at a dearer cost than here where there were people living just around the corner who would probably strangle their own children for a few coins all of that flitted through her thoughts as a background to tfyrrs terrible pain and to the tears that scalded her own cheeks but there was a further cost to this ahead for her she had thought that she had opened herself to him completely before but now as she held him and sensed that this would bring him little or no ease she realized that she had still held something of herself in reserve nothing less than all of herself would do at this momentbecause of what he was the haspur had an odd sometimes symbiotic relationship with the humans who shared their aeries and villages most of the time it never went any deeper than simple friendship the kind she herself shared with the elves who had gifted her with her bracelets but sometimes it went deeper much deeper than that she had always known intellectually that she was not the only human to have her peculiar giftor curseof feeling the needs and the emotions of others she had never met anyone else with the gift to the extent that she had it though she had never encountered another human who found him or herself pulled into anothers soul by his pain or his joy never found one who was in danger of losing himself when bombarded by the emotions of others but it seemed that there were many more of the humans who lived among the haspur with that curseor gift their gifts wereat least from what she gleaned from tfyrras formidable as her own and for those who bore that burden a relationship with a haspur could never be simple anything they felt and felt deeply but had no outlet for their extreme emotions at the ragged edge of pain or sorrow or that dreadful agony of the soul the haspur could only try to endure dumbly as their emotions tore them up from within a raging beast that could not break free from the cage of their spirits but humans did have that outletat least the humans he called spiritbrothers could provide it by becoming unhesitatingly one without reservations with their friends and sharing the pain becoming one without reservations giving all and taking all halving the pain by enduring it themselves she had one lover in all her lifeone real lover as opposed to friends who shared their bodies with her she had not known she was so young she had not known that when she gave all of herself the one she gave to might not be able to give in returnthat he might not even realize what she had done she had not thought she was the only one with this curseor giftand had supposed that her lover would surely feel all that she felt he didnt of course he hadnt a clue hed thought she was the same as all the other ladies hed dallied with and she lacked the words the skill the heart to tell him when raven had left her the first time it had felt as if something that was a part of her had been ripped away from her soul she smiled and bled and he smiled and sauntered off with a song on his lips and he had never understood he still didnt not to this day she had learned to accept that and had forgiven him for not knowing and herself for her own ignorance but she had vowed it would not happen again and had never opened herself to another creature that deeply never under any other circumstances until this moment but nothing less would do now but to give everything of herself for nothing less would begin the healing tfyrr needed so desperately she did not know could not know what would come of this perhaps an ending like the end of her love affair with raven and pain that would live in her forever a place inside her spirit wounded and scarred and never the same again but she could bear the pain and she could heal herself again over time she had done it once and she could again tfyrr could not not without her help for he did not truly understand the emotions festering inside his soul great power demands that the user consider the repercussions of actions she had the power she had long ago accepted the responsibility or so she had thought i was fooling myself i should have known that the lady would put this on me but this was no time to have second thoughts really she had made all her choices long before she met tfyrr and this was only the ultimate test of those choices what was it that peregrine had said to her a few months ago she had known at the time that he was trying to warn her of an ordeal to come you cannot speak truly of the path without walking it and she could not not without repudiating everything that she said that she thought that she was so she opened the last of her heart to him opened her souls arms to him and gathered him up inside the place where her own deepest secrets and darkest fears layshe brought him inside and she gave him all that she was and all the comfort that she had tfyrr did not know how he had gotten to nightingales room he did not even realize that he was talking to her until he heard his own voice hoarse and cracking telling her things he had never intended to share with anyone especially not with her she was too fragile too gentlehow could she hear these horrible things and not hate him he knew she was one of the kind who felt things he had sensed that the first time he met her the same as the spiritbrothers perhaps but not the same not with the training or the knowledge surely the idea of murderit would surely send her fleeing him in utter revulsion only harperus knew he had killed harperus had told him that it was an accident something he could not have helped harperus had not even begun to understand the spiritbrothers of the haspur would have been able to help him bear the guilt although it would have meant that he and the brother who chose to help him would have been in debt to one another for all their lives bonded in soul and perhaps in body as well the latter happened sometimes though not often but the spiritbrothers male and female were far away and out of reach and he had no hope of reaching them for years even decades at some point in his babbling it began to dawn on him that nightingale not only understood she felt as he felt she wept for him as a spiritbrother would have wept gave him her tears in an outpouring of release for both of them something in him turned to her as a flower turns toward the sun as a drowning creature seizes upon a floating branch something in her answered that need granted him light kept him afloat he was beyond thinking at that point or he would never have let her do what she did it wasnt fair it wasnt right not for her she was a gypsy a free bard who should be as free as the bird that was her namesake and not bound as a spiritbrother but it was already done before thoughts even began to form in the back of his terrorclouded mind she stayed awake with him until his internal sense told him that the sun was rising comforting and holding him and even preening his feathers as another haspur would a haspur or a spiritbrother he did not understand how she knew to do this he did not understand why he accepted it he was beyond understanding now beyond anything except feeling it was feeling that held him here weak as a newborn eyas simply accepting the comfort and the understanding as an unthinking eyas would accept them finally he slept exhausted when he woke again she was there beside him stroking his wings with a hand so gentle it had not even disturbed his sleep although he had felt it and it had soothed him out of the nightmares he had suffered for so long he blinked up at her astonished that she was still there silence stretched between them he felt as if he must be the one to break it finally he said the only thing that was in his mind you should hate me and he waited to see that hate and contempt in her eyes for what he had done her expression did not change not by the slightest bit how could i hate you she asked softly you hate yourself more than enough for both of us i want to help you tfyrr i hope you will let me he blinked at her again and slowly sat up she shook her hair back out of her face and rubbed her eyes with her hand as she sat up too i think that there is something that you believe you need to do to make up for what you did she said then i will help you if that is what you want i will come with you to the king and stand beside you in your task i will give you my music and i will give you my magic you can have one or both they are freely given and when the king sees again the things that he does not want to see tfyrr asked very slowly will that she nodded deliberately i believe that will be what you need as your duty and your penance it will not be easy and it will not be pleasant he sighed and yet it was not because of a heaviness of spirit somehow in truly accepting this burden his spirit felt lighter rather than crushed further down no penance is he replied somberly somehow in the dark despair of last night he had come to a decisionhopefully it was one of wisdom and not of weakness and expediency theovere was too far down the road of irresponsibility to be recalled by ordinary means i will need your magic if you will give it he said feeling as if he were making a formal request or performing a solemn ceremony with those simple words she nodded and bowed her head a little since you will have it i will give it she said making her words a pledge as well as an answer then she raised her lovely weary eyes to his again and smiled tiredly and you should eatfor that matter so should i we can do nothing halfstarved those words which would have made him wince away less than a day ago only made him aware that he was ravenous and after we eat he asked will you come with me to the palace yes she brushed her hair back over her shoulders it is time that i accepted my responsibilities as well and stopped hiding in corners behind the name of tanager but i will not she added with a warning look in her eyes be nightingale not here and not now i do not trust tyladens friends nor harperus associates they speak too lightly and too often to too many people they can afford to they have many protections i am only a gypsy and far from the wagons of my clan what few magics i have will not protect me if powerful men come hunting as you are far from your people i am far from the aeries of mine he said impulsively laying his hand over hers so perhaps we should fly our pattern together from now on and we should begin now she rose at that and stretched lithe and graceful let me get clean first then lyrebird and tfyrr will eat together and he will take her to the palace to present her as his accompanist or should you go and make some formal request for an accompanist should this be an official perhaps a royal appointment he actually managed a smile at that it would be easiest simply to do so he pointed out just as harperus did with me if the king hears you once he will see to it that the appointment simply happens he is not about to put up with interference from his council a second time over so trivial a matter as his personal musicians they believe it is trivial and it is both unfortunate and our good luck that he does not this one time his obsession can work for us she paused for a moment one hand on the door to the bathroom then nodded i think i see that it is a risk but so is everything we are doing she closed the door behind her and there came the sound of running water from beyond it he lay back down on her bed closing his eyes for a moment intending to plan out the next few hours in detail he would have to get her past the guards first of course but his body had other ideas and he dozed off to awaken again with her hand on his arm she was dressed in one of her most impressive costumes and he had little doubt that the ladies of the court would attempt to emulate her dress before too long he also had a shrewd notion that they would not succeed he got up finding himself less stiff than he would have expected given that he had spent the night in a human bed she sent the bed back up into the wall with a touch of her hand slipped the carrying case over her larger harp and slung it across her back it did not look as incongruous as he would have thought shall we she asked gesturing to the door he led the way she locked the door after them both she disappeared into tyladens office for a moment presumably to tell him where they were going and how long they expected to be gone she is one of their chief attractions she owes her putative employer that much i suppose after a hearty meal in the single eating nook open at this early hour they went out into the street together there was no sign of last nights altercation but the moment they crossed the threshold of freehold his hackles went up and he moved into the center of the street away from dangerous overhangs it did not escape his notice that she made no objection to this that in fact her eyes scanned the mostlydeserted street with as much wariness as his they stepped out together onto the cobblestones of the street both of them dreadfully out of place in this part of the city between his appearance and her costume anyone looking for them was likely to find them immediately well there was no help for it nightingale walked beside him as serenely as if the previous night had never happened as if she did not look like an invitation to theft he tried to imitate her and actually succeeded to a certain extent but there was one thing at least that he was going to do he had coins in his garment plenty of them and he was not going to appear at the gate to the palace with her walking afoot like a pair of vagabonds as soon as they reached one of the more respectable sections of the city he hailed a horsedrawn conveyance an open carriage with two seats that faced each other and gestured her up into it she raised an eyebrow at him but said nothing he took his place beside her although it was dreadfully uncomfortable and he had to hold his wings and tail at odd angles to get them to fit inside now how am i going to get her inside the gate the guards arent going to want to let her pass she hasnt a safeconduct or an invitation he worried at the problem without coming to a satisfactory solution as the streets grew progressively busier and stares more covert this was not the only conveyance on the street but many of the others were private vehicles whose occupants gazed at them with surprise he ignored them trying to think what he could do with nightingale perhaps he could leave her at the gate go in find the seneschal and get a safeconduct for her but that would leave her alone at the gate and anyone who spotted her with me on the way here coulddo whatever they wanted she is with me which makes her presumably valuable to me would anyone dare to try anything under the noses of the guards oh yes they could and would especially if my unknown adversary is highly placed in the court a little thing like a kidnapping at the gate would hardly bother him he could make it a private arrest for instance there was reasonable foot traffic at this hour and the conveyance made excellent time not as good as he would have flying of course but still quite respectable the two horses drawing it were able to trot most of the way they reached the gate long before he had come to any satisfactory solution to his problem but as it happened the solution was waiting for him standing beside the guards with a smaller and far more elaborate and elegant gilded version of the conveyance waiting beside him the palace grounds were extensive enough that there was an entire fleet of conveyances and their drivers available for those who lived here just to ferry them around within the walls nob whats he doing here is that someone you know nightingale asked as his eyes widened in surprise yes its my servantbut how did he know i was coming in this morning and why did he order a conveyance tfyrr asked more as a rhetorical question than because he expected an answer but nightingale shrugged i told tyladen where i was going tyladen probably foresaw the difficulty of getting me inside without waiting around at the gate and sent word to harperus old owl must have exercised some of his diplomatic persuasion and got me an invitation or a safeconduct i expect thats why your lad is here to bring the pass and to get us to the palace in the manner suitable to your rank tfyrr nodded it made sense but nightingale added the one thing i dont want is to run into harperus he knows me on sight and i dont want any of the deliambrens aware that im here he grimaced at this point that was a very difficult request to satisfy i dont know how but she interrupted him i can keep him from noticing me as long as i stay in the background if old owl shows up at all tfyrr you keep him busy please dont let him think about talking to me tell him im shy whatever it takes to get him to leave me alone make up somethingor better yet tell him about the attack last night that should get his mind off me he wasnt at all sure he could do that but he nodded again i can try he said truthfully and then the conveyance stopped in front of the gate and it was too late to discuss anything more nob had indeed brought lyrebirds safeconduct although from here on she would have to come and go through a lesser gate elsewhere she was only a lowly accompanist after all and not a sire dubbed by the high kings own hand nob chattered excitedly at a high rate of speed which kept tfyrr from having to say much and nightingale from having to say anything the safeconduct was from theovere himself old owl had gone straight to the highest authority available he must have described lyrebird in the most glowing terms the king was most anxious to hear this remarkable player from the infamous freehold the bardic guild found out too i dont know how but they had a guildmaster protesting to the high king before i even got the safeconduct nob continued after describing how harperus had come to get him early this morning they tried to get this lady banned from the court because shes a gypsy then they tried to get her barred because she plays at freehold and they have some kind of arrangement about the musicians at freehold the high king just ignored them they were even going to make a fuss so you couldnt be heard but theovere got word of that before it ever happened and told them if they did anything hed have them all discharged so they gave up i guess the high king made her your second do you know what that means tfyrr shook his head nob was only too happy to explain shes more than a servant like me but shes not the high kings musician shes yours so nobody but you can discharge her you see not even theovere if the guild pressures the high king to do it but she doesnt have the immunity you do if she offends somebody at court she can only be arrested by theoveres personal guards though if shes accused of something then ill just have to be certain i dont offend anyone nightingale said in a low amused voice nob giggled the guild people are all pretty disgusted but harperus says not to worry they cant do anything and as long as youre real careful and never let any of them get you someplace without witnesses so they can claim you offended them itll be all right nob finished in a rush he kept glancing over at lyrebird with a certain awe and speculation in his eyes when is theovere expecting us to perform for him tfyrr asked that was the question of the most moment as soon as you get therei mean after you get cleaned up and all nob replied correcting himself with a blush you cant go before the king with dust on your feathers nightingale gave tfyrr an amused look that he read only too easilyshe had warned him something like this might happen which was why she had made her own careful preparations before they left freehold nob hurried them both inside and while nightingale waited in the outer room rushed him through his usual preparations still harried by the energetic nob like a pair of hawks being chivvied on by a wren they hurried up the hallways to the kings private quarters this time will be different this time there will be magic elation and worry mingled in him in a confusing storm of emotion leaving him feeling unbalanced the least little things were unbalancing him after last night after last night what exactly had happened something had passed between them as ephemeral as a moon shadow and strong as spider silk a whisper more potent than any shout that was what it felt like a stillness at the center of a whirlwind as if every feather had been stripped from his body leaving him bare to the winds perhaps it was just as well that they had work to do immediately so that he had no time to think about it he did not want to think about it not now perhaps not ever but you will his conscience told him you will have to eventually he didnt want to think about that either nightingale was too weary to be impressed by the palace the high king or anything else for that matter there wasnt much left of her this morning except the magic and the music she had saved enough of her energy for that and had very little more she felt as if she was so insubstantial she would blow away in a breeze and so tired she could hardly walk it was not the physical weariness although that was a part of it certainly she had stayed up to play for revels all night long and traveled with the dawn a thousand times but this morning was very different but part of me dwells within him now and part of him in me strange and yet familiar a breath of mountain air across her deep and secret forest a hint of music strange and wild a brush of feathers across her breast no time to think about it now time only to enforce her dont look at me glamorie spun with a touch of bardic power and sealed with a hummed nearinaudible tune time only to take her place behind tfyrr in the kings chamber set up her harp tune it with swift fingers and wait for his cues he would have to be the one to choose the tunes she could only follow his lead and try to set the magic to suit theyd had no chance to discuss this to pick specific songs if it is something you dont know ill sing the first verse alone he whispered if we do that enough it will seem done on purpose she nodded and then they began with no time to set what they were to perform with only their past performances together to use as patterns he was not able to choose many songs suited to their intent she was not particularly worried about that not for this first attempt she was far more concerned with setting so good an impression of her ability on the king that he would continue to support tfyrr and indirectly her it would take more than one session of magic to undo all the harm that had been wrought with years of clever advice and insidious whispers it might be just as well that they were not too heavyhanded with the message for the first performance better that they had more songs merely meant to entertain than to carry the extra burden she must impress the king as well as convey the magic after all she knew that she had done that much when the king ceased to play his game of sires and barons with one of his lords and ignored everything else in the room as well closing his eyes and listening intently to the music they made she knew that there was something more than herself at work when the bodyguards faces took on an unexpected stillness as if they too were caught up in the spell of harp and voice when even the lord who had been playing at the game with the high king folded his hands in his lap and simply listened there is something of me in tfyrr as there is part of him in me has he learned to touch the magic through me it could have been raven had his own touch of the magic and she would never have noticed one way or another if he had acquired a little more of it from her after their bittersweet joining so much of her soul was bound up in the magic could she have ever spun it out to wrap tfyrrs if the magic didnt come with it she sensed a terrible weariness in that second man and as sensitive as she was this morning she could not help but move to ease it so when the music chosen did not particularly suit their purposes with the high king she turned her attention and her magic to that weary lord sending him such peace as she could he was not a man who would ever feel much peace his concerns were too deep his worries neverending but what he would take in the way of ease she would give him gladly no one with such weariness on his heart could ever be one of the lot who were advising the king to neglect his duty this could only be a man who was doing his best to make up for the kings neglect the king made no requests tfyrr simply picked songs as he thought of them so far as nightingale could tell finally at some signal she could not see he stopped and it was a long long moment before the king opened his eyes again and set his gaze on the two of them it was another long moment before he spoke i do not ever wish to hear your musical judgment called into question again tfyrr he said quietly but with a certain deadly quality to his words you may bring whosoever you wish to accompany you from henceforthbut it will be my request that it be this gentle lady her safeconduct to this palace is extended for as long as she wishes to come the high king turned to the lord that had sat at play with him what think you of my nightingales lord seneschal he asked but with a tone full of wry amusement as if he expected some kind of noncommittal answer nightingale suppressed a smile at the unintended irony but the lord seneschal turned towards theovere with an expression of vague surprise and a touch of wonder you know that i am not the expert in music that you are your majesty he said with no hint that he was trying to flatter i enjoy it certainly but it has never touched meuntil today he closed his eyes briefly and opened them again still wearing that expression of surprise but today i felt such peace for a moment that if i were a religious man i would have suspected something supernatural i thought of things that i had forgotten of days long ago of places and people then he shook himself and lost that expression of wonderment memories ofold times at any rate your majesty he continued briskly if i were not so certain of the honor of the guildmasters i would have been tempted to say that they were opposed to this ladys performance because she would provide an unwelcome contrast to the performance of the guild musicians nightingale bowed her head to hide her smile the lord seneschals tone of irony was just enough to be clear without being so blatant as to be an accusation against the guild musicians for all that the king had supported her against them he had a long history of supporting them as well at any moment he could spring again to their defense so it was wise of the lord seneschal to be subtle in his criticism nor was that lost upon theovere who answered the sally with a lifted eyebrow let us discuss that shall we he said and tfyrr taking that as the dismissal that it was bowed them both out nightingale parted company from him quickly after that since nob brought word that harperus wanted to speak with him and she most certainly did not want to be there when he showed up she returned unaccompanied to freehold resolving to make her journeys hereafter in something less conspicuous in the way of a costume the elven silks would pack down readily enough and she could change in tfyrrs rooms even if that would scandalize young nob with the safeconduct in her hand the quiet and respectable clothing would do very well for her to pass the gate reserved for those who were higher than servants but less than noble but she should think about spending some of her rapidlyaccumulating monies on other clothing as well granted she could not lay her hands on more elven silk but there were perfectly good seamstresses in the city who would not scorn to sew to her design she needed something appropriate but less flamboyant than elvenmade clothing she was a commoner an outsider and it would not do to excite the jealousy of the ladies of the court in the matter of dress every time she stepped onto the palace grounds she went completely out of her element a songbird trying to swim like a fish there was no point in making herself more problems than she already had she was uncomfortably aware of speculative eyes on her as she made her way to freehold and she was grateful that although the hour tended toward noon it was still too early for any of the more dangerous types to be wandering the streets pickpockets were easy enough to foil she could leave broken fingers in her wake without seeming to do more than brush her hand across her beltpouch but in this particular outfit she was fair game for ransomkidnappers who could legitimately assume she had money or had family with money and she was even more vulnerable to those looking to kidnap for other purposes so she set the dont look at me spell again all too aware that it would only work on those near enough to hear the melody she hummed under her breath if she were less tired she could have included anyone within sight of her but she had just spent all night and part of the morning working the magics of music and the heart and she had scant resources to spend on herself she sighed with relief when freehold loomed into view and she had seldom been so glad to see a place as she was to see that deceptively plain door she took herself straight upstairs fortunately word had not yet spread of her royal command performance and she did not have to fend off any questioners only one of the mintak peacekeepers appeared silent as a shadow to take her harp from herand one of the little errand boys with a tray of food and drink beside him neither asked any questions they simply followed her to her room put their burdens down and left her she ate and drank quickly without tasting any of it she stripped off her gown and lay down in her bed still rumpled and bearing the impression of her body and tfyrrs and the faint spicy scent of his feathers and then she fell asleep and slept like one dead until an hour before her first set of the evening she woke with the feeling that she had dreamed but with no memory of what her dreams had been about she woke in fact a little confused about where she was until her mind began to function again then she lay staring up at the ceiling trying to sort herself out there was a difference a profound and yet subtle difference in the way everything felt but she had known that there would be some of the magichad not precisely left her but it had changed if she sang alone she would still command the same powerbut if she performed with tfyrr it was another story altogether together they would command more than the magic of two people their abilities would work together as warp and weft and the magic they wove would be stronger and firmer than anything she had ever dreamed of so tfyrr shares the bardic magic nowor else i have awakened the magic that was already there not entirely unexpected but certainly welcome for as long as the two of them remained partnered she shoved that last niggling thought away with a hint of desperation she would not think of that the pain would come soon enough she did not need to worry at it until it did come and tfyrr went on his way again without her or until she was forced by circumstance to leave him the road traveled in both directions after all the other changes within her were precisely as she had expectedexcept for the depth to which they ran she did not particularly want to think about that either but she wouldnt have to there was a performance to give tfyrr would probably not be able to comehe could seldom manage two nights in a row a brief stab of loneliness touched her but she had expected it and absorbed it i have been lonely for most of my life i do not expect this to change that was what she told herself anyway being lonely has never killed anyone yet no matter what the foolish ballads say and with that thought to fortify her she finally rose from her bed and prepared to face another night of audiences she made her way across the city with far less of a stir this morning than she and tfyrr had caused yesterday no one would look twice at her in fact in her sober and honest clothing the bundle at her back could be anything unless you knew what a harp case looked like there was no reason even to think she was a musician she presented herself and her safeconduct at the bronze gate the guard there scarcely glanced at it or her except to note the size and shape of the bundle she carried and to order her to show what it was she had when he saw it was only a musical instrument and a small bundle of cloth he became bored again and passed her through she found a page to show her to tfyrrs rooms in plenty of time to use his bathroom and change into the gown she had brought with her he was pacing the floor when she arrived and turned to greet her with relief and disappointment another sign of how we are bound now i know his feelings without needing to try to interpret his expression the relief was because she was early the disappointment he made clear enough theovere hasnt changed he said as she asked him how they had been received yesterday he still hasnt done anything any differently i dont understand before he could say anything any further she seized his hand and drew him into the bedroom away from the odd devices she recognized as deliambren listening devices she did not want the deliambrens to know about the bardic magicat least she did not want them to know that she was exercising it they already knew there was something like it of course and they knew from the results she got that she used it they might put magic and harpist together and come up with nightingale dont be impatient she told him as his tailfeathers twitched a little from side to side and he shook his wings out even with the magic this is going to take time for one thing we didnt have the chance to select songs that would channel his mind in the direction we wanted it to go for another we are trying to change something that took several years to establish we arent going to do that overnight he opened his beak then shut it abruptly as if he had suddenly seen what she was talking about besides you arent in the special council sessions she continued you have no access to the one place where he actually gets things done and issues real orders you have no idea how he is speaking or acting within them if i were the king she let the nebulous thought take a more concrete form then spoke if i were the king and i began to take up the reins of my duty againi would know that i would have to be careful about it the advisors arent going to like the changes were trying to bring about in him and they are powerful people he can oppose them in small things successfully but she shook her head he was a very clever man and i dont think that cleverness is gone he was also a very observant man and he must realize what has been going on if i were the king with my sense of duty reawakened i would start working my will in very small things taking back my power gradually and hopefully by the time they realized what i was doing it would be too late and i would be very very careful that i didnt seem to act any differently tfyrr nodded then in a way since he has let the power slip from his hands theovere has less power than any of them is that what you are saying more or less she moved back into the other room with its insidious little listening devices well more to the point what are we performing today if you have anything that i dont know i can probably pick it up with a little rehearsal which you have cleverly provided time for by arriving early his beak opened in that haspur equivalent of a smile and she warmed with his pleasure in her company and her cleverness well here is the list i had thought we might perform he brought out a written list which was thoughtful of him and was what she would have done in his place armed with that she was able to suggest alternatives to several of the songs she did not yet know which left them enough time for her to pick up the melodies to the most important of the rest this time she was no longer so tired that the white marble corridors blurred one into the other like the halls in a nightmare she had a chance to make some mental notes as she walked beside him his talons clicking oddly on the marble floor did i have a nightmare involving these halls last night something about looking for tfyrr in an endless series of corridors all alike all filled with strangers yes and i kept finding single feathers broken or pulled out at the rootscould you actually do that with feathers that long and strong but i never found him only rooms full of more strangers staring at me and saying nothing she didnt care much for the statuary though it all had a remarkable sameness to it mannered and smug beautifully carved and lifeless rather like the guild versions of our ballads actually was there a sculptors version of a bardic guild from the looks of these statues she suspected there must be theovere wasnt responsible for this though she had seen his suite and knew for a fact that he had better taste than to order anything like this statuary huh a deliambren has better taste than this some other high kingor more likely some other servants of some other high king were responsible the king had probably waved his hand and ordered that the austere corridors be decorated and lo there were statues by the gross he might even have done it for the simplest of all reasons to keep people from becoming lost certainly nob and probably everyone else navigated the endless hallways by the statuary if that was the case the statues didnt need to be inspired just all of the same theme they could have been ordered like so many decorated cakes lets see well have a dozen eachhigh kings nymphs shepherds famous women famous men famous generals famous warriors famous animals dancers musicians saintswhat did they do when they ran out of obvious subjects she amused herself thinking that somewhere there was a corridor decked out in the theme of famous village idiots or famous swinekeepers each with his favorite piggy at his feetshe smiled to herself holding back a giggle as they reached the door of the kings suite well once more into the fray that was enough to sober her there was another potential problem as if they did not have troubles enough she had not told tfyrr about a thought that had disturbed her own dreams last night she did not know that there were people other than the bards and elves who could detect bardic magic at work but there might be after all those who used bardic magic could detect other magics than their own she did not know if the high king had someone with him or watching over him with the intention of catching anyone working magic on the king in the act but it was a real possibility and it was not likely that anyone would bother to ask why they were weaving spells if she and tfyrr were caught at it as they waited for the guards to open the doors now there was the chance that she had been detected yesterday and that they were not going in to a performance but a trap but in all the years she had practiced her art no one had ever accused her in a way that made her think they had proof she used magic nor had anyone else among the gypsies churchmen village heads and guildsmen told wild tales but never with any foundation and never with any truththat was the odd and interesting part in all the times that free bards and gypsies had worked magic there had been no hint that anyone even their worst enemies had a notion that anything of the sort had been done it was only the unbelievable stories that were spread of how impressionable youngsters were turned to demonworship immorality or suicide by one or another particular song they accused the song and not the singer as if it were the song that held the power what nonsense these are stories created by people who want to find something else to blame than themselves for their childrens acts how could words and music lifeless without the life given to them by the performer ever influence anyone against his will or better judgment books could suggest new possibilities to an open mind yes so music could toobut people were not mindless and they had their own wills and it was the mind and the will that implemented decisions the mind that made the decision was ultimately the responsible party she had to assume that would hold true now had to or she would be too apprehensive to perform the task she had sworn herself to she had sworn herself knowing that this might take years that it might cost her not only her freedom but her life if she were caught at it she would not take back her pledge now tfyrr sensed i was making a formal pledge even though i didnt make a ceremony about it interesting the doors opened and the king was waiting and it was time to make good on that pledge now and for as many days as it took to bring the bud to flower if it could be done tfyrr watched nightingale leaving the palace from the balcony at the end of his corridor it was a good vantage point with the formal foregardens spread out beneath him in neat and geometric squares of color divided by walkways of white pavingstone and was even better as a place from which to take to the air he was at least four stories upapparently the higher you were in rank the higher your rooms within the palace he could see all the way to the bronze gate from here and he made a point of watching to see that nightingale got that far she always turned just before she went through the gate and waved at him knowing that he would see her clearly even though she was nearly a mile away she could not see him though so he didnt bother to wave back instead he waited until that distant figure passed between the open leaves of the gate then launched himself into the air wings beating strongly gaining altitude the air above the palace grounds was sweeter than that above the city and cooler yet another example of the difference between those who dwelled here and there they had been at this for two weeks now and although he still had not seen any change in theoveres behavior his advisors were increasingly unhappy with the high king in court theovere continued to act as if he were supremely bored with his duties but the lord seneschal frowned a bit less these days and the rest of the advisors frowned a bit more which argued that in private theovere might be flexing his royal muscles discreetly harperus showed no signs of disappearing the way he had right after he had gotten tfyrr installed as royal musician that should have been comforting having at least one real ally with power and a great many tricks up his capacious and frothy sleeves but it wasnt as comforting as it could have been for one thing the deliambren clearly had his attention and his mind on other things than tfyrr the haspur actually saw the lords seneschal artificer and secretary more than he saw harperus they often arrived to share tfyrrs otherwise solitary dinners the lord seneschal acreon was more relaxed these days though he was very disappointed to discover that nightingale did not reside with tfyrr in his rooms she had impressed acreon profoundly it seemed i think she must have done something for him specifically with that magic of hers i shall have to propose a special concert for himperhaps a dinner concert on nightingales night off we could do worse than have him on our side lord secretary atrovel was his usual acerbic witty flippant self whatever was going on in the private council sessions didnt seem to be affecting him in the least he continued to amuse tfyrr with his imitations of the other advisors and his opinions on everything under the sun lord artificer levan pendleton came less often as he was involved in some complicated project but he was the only one of the three who actually said anything about changes in theovere and only a single comment hes up to mischief the lord artificer had said briefly but with ironic approval as if theovere was a very clever but very naughty boy atrovel was there last night with pendleton both of them flinging insults at each other and enjoying it tremendously i wish nightingale could have been there too i wish she would move into my suite tfyrr suppressed the rest of that thought and used his deepest wingbeats to get himself high into the sky to a carefully calculated point where he would be able to make out nightingale in the street below but she would not see anything but a bird form above if she looked up he was worried about her she told him not to worry but he did anyway they tried to capture me maybe even kill me they havent been successful and it is going to cost them to find someone willing to make a third try at least that is the way tyladen says things are done here he thinks that makes me safe well maybe it made him safe but it did nothing to protect nightingale an idiot could tell that he not only hired her he cared for her she was a single unarmed female much easier to capture than a haspur she was therefore as much a target as he and a much cheaper target at that she had to travel the dangerous streets between freehold and the palace twice a day every day he had volunteered to escort her in spite of the fact that the crowds made him queasy and the streets brought on that fear of closedin places all haspur shared she had refused he had offered to pay for a conveyance and she had refused that as well tyladen seemed unconcerned saying only that gypsies can take care of themselves all very well and good but there was only one gypsy in this city and she would have a difficult time standing up to six armed horsemen for instance so he had started following her himself not only from the air but in the places where the streets were too narrow to make out where she was by descending to use the metal walkways that connected buildings together above the second stories so far nothing whatsoever had happened but that did not make him less worried it made him more worried his unknown enemy could be waiting to see just how high a value tfyrr placed on her before moving in to kidnap her his enemy could also be trying to figure out just where she figured in theoveres altering personality anyone who wanted to ask the bodyguards could find out what they were singing for the high king and at least half of the songs were of a specific kind you wouldnt even need magic to get a particular message across to theovere if he was listening their choice of music alone would alert that enemy to what they hoped to accomplish he looked down spotting her from above by the misshapen bundle of the harp case on her back she was out of the better districts and down into the lowerclass areas of the city the streets narrowed and it was getting harder to watch her from this high on the other hand she was jostled along by the crowd and it would be a bad idea for her to look up now that she was in this part of the city he descended it wasnt time to take to a walkway yet just the point where he should skim just above the roof level people doing their wash or tending their little potted gardens would gawk at him as he flew past but he was used to that now he moved fast enough that their interest didnt alert anyone in the street below and speaking of the street below he fanned his wings open grabbing for a nowfamiliar roost he came to rest on a steeple clinging with all four sets of talons and watched her as she turned the corner into another narrow street he particularly didnt like this one there were a dozen little covered alleys off it places where you could hide people for an ambush this was one of the worst districts she had to cross to get back to freehold too there had been murders committed here in broad daylight with a dozen witnesses present none of whom of course could identify the murderer she was nervous here too he sensed that as his neck hackles rose his beak clenched tight and the talons on his hands etched little lines into the shingles on the steeple she felt that something was wrong and it was three men stepped out of an alley in front of her just as three more stepped out of one behind her they were armed with sticks and clubsand as everyone else sandwiched in between their ranks fled the immediate area without being stopped it was obvious who they were after one of them stepped forward and gestured with his club as nightingale shrank away putting her back up against a building tfyrr shoved himself away from the steeple plunging toward them in a closedwing stoop nightingale knew she was being followed shed known it the moment that her tailer picked her up just outside of leather street he had been following her for the past five days in fact always picking up her trail at leather street and leaving it just before she got to freehold he was good but not good enough to evade someone who could sense a trackers nerves behind her that was why she had paid all of her army of street urchins an extra penny to follow her as well from the palace gate to freehold they might be children but they werent helpless you couldnt live in and on the street around here if you were helpless they had their own weapons tiny fists as hard as rocks the stones of the street slings like her own even a knife or two they had their orders if someone tried to hurt nightingale they were to swarm him give her a chance to escape then run off themselves but she had not expected to be attacked by more than one or two at the most the three stepping out in front of her made her freeze in shock the three closing in from behind brought a cold wave of fear rushing over her quickly as the normal denizens of the street vanished into their own little hiding places she put her back to a wall and reached inside her skirt for her own knife this was no time or place for magic although a nice elven lightning bolt would be welcome right now at that moment the bolt from above did come in wings half furled talons outstretched screaming like all the demons of the church put together tfyrr he raked the scalp of one with his foreclaws as he plunged in striking to hurt and disable not to kill that man was down blood pouring over his face so that he couldnt see he screamed as loudly as tfyrr the pain of his wounds probably convinced him that tfyrr had taken the top of his skull off and not just his scalp with a thunder of wings that sent debris flying and a wind that whipped the ends of her hair into her face he landed beside her and turned to face the rest of her enemies he didnt speak he just opened his beak for another of those earshattering screams but any hope that he might simply frighten them into giving it up as a bad job died when three more appeared behind the five that remained standing nightingales fighting knife was out and ready in one hand a nasty little bit of chain in the other good enough in the ordinary run of street fighting none of those men seemed at all impressed as they closed in she had never been in this kind of a fight before she spent most of her time ducking and the rest of it trying to fend off grasping hands with her knife fear choked her and made it hard to breathe tfyrr panted harshly through his open beak every fiber of her wanted to run but there was nowhere to run to no opening to seize bile rose in her throat she tasted blood where she had bitten her lip one of them kicked at her legs expertly trying to bring her down she ducked head blows but not always with complete success her breath burned in her throat and sweat ran into her eyes and coldly down her back nightingale fought like a cornered alleycat and tfyrr like a grounded hawk but neither of them were willing to strike to kill and that actually worked against them there were too many times when the only option open would have meant killing one of their assailants a glancing blow to her shoulder made her drop her bit of chain as her arm and hand went numb she slashed feverishly at the man whod struck her but he only stepped out of the way and came in again swinging his leadweighted club with the chain she might have been able to get the club away from him were not going to get awayshe swallowed bile again and backed away from the man with the club her stomach lurching with fear suddenly the street erupted in screams the children swarmed fearlessly into the fight screaming their lungs out kicking biting throwing stones hitting and most of all getting underfoot they were too small and agile for the startled attackers to stop them and there were too many of them to catch when one of the bullies actually managed to grab an urchin three or four more would mob him kicking and biting until he let go nightingale spotted an opening at the same time tfyrr did they seized each others hands and tfyrr charged through first knocking one man aside with a wing nightingale hauled along in his wake they ran until their sides ached ran until they could hardly breathe ran until they were staggering blindly with exhaustionand did not stop running until they came to freehold chapter eight i cant believe you didnt break anything nightingale said as she carefully checked every bone in tfyrrs fragileappearing wings she had already checked every inch of his body from feet to sheath to keel knowing from her experience with birds that the feathers could hide a number of serious to lifethreatening injuries and that seemingly insignificant tears in the skin could spread under sudden pressure to an unbelievable extent especially across the breast muscles fortunately his skin proved to be much tougher than the average birds she ached not only from her own injuries but from his i know every bruise every sprain every torn muscle i feel as if i am inside his body this never happened with raven he sighed and rubbed one elbow bruises didnt show on the scaly skin of his lower arms and legs but there was so little muscle there that the bruises went to the bone it feels as if i have broken a hundred bones but i know that i have not it will be days before i can fly again he did not voice the fear that put into him the fear of the winged creature left helpless on the ground he did not have to voice that fear for she felt it as well i was an idiot i should have taken him seriously i should have confronted harperus and demanded some kind of damned deliambren protection i should have confronted harperus and tyladen and moved into the damned palace i was enjoying the anonymity that kept them from manipulating me and enjoying my notoriety as lyrebird too much i was enjoying all the adulation and success i had here in freehold too now hes grounded and its all my fault guilt made her avoid his eyes but she could not avoid the emotions coming from him she sat back on the bed for a moment once she had assured herself that he truly did not have any broken bones she had injuries of her own of coursea badly bruised shoulder bruised shins lumps on her headbut his injuries were far more numerous than hers he had shielded both of them with his wings used the wings as weapons to buffet their attackers and interposed himself between her and a blow she had not seen aimed at her any number of times well at least there is a solution to his injuries if hell take it he might be grounded but not for long tfyrr i cani can heal some of this if you like she offered tentatively it will still hurt but i can sing it halfhealed today and do the rest tomorrow then she frowned i think i can she amended im not sure if the magic will work on a haspur or if it will work the same it should i have not healed a nonhuman before but my teacher nighthawk has and she never said anything about the magic working differently for them his feathers twitched and she felt his relief at the idea that she might be able to give him enough freedom from pain and damage that he need not be caught on the ground please he begged with voice and eyes and clenched talonhands halfhealed will let me fly again you know how the magic works she said and smiled when he shook his head hell find out in a moment no i dont he began then his eyes widened in wonder oh yes i do his voice trailed off as his eyes sought hers seeking answers they were answers she was not prepared to give him yetperhaps never better that he should never know where that touch of magic and the knowledge of it came from if there was to be nothing more between them than there had been between her and raven simply listen for the music and give yourself to it she said and placed both her hands atop his hard sinewy talons it no longer felt strange to reach for a hand and find something all bone and sinew and covered with the tough scaly skin of a raptors feet did it still seem strange for him to touch her and find soft skin over muscle with five stubby little scales instead of talons she gave him no chance to ask all the questions she felt bubbling up inside of him she did not want to face those questions herself the answers in all probability would hurt far too much instead she plunged into the magic that nighthawk had taught herthe combination of bardic magic and gypsy healing all bound up in the tonal chanting that suited nighthawks strong harsh voice better than any song but the bardic song lay behind the chanting and for nightingale the chant turned into something far more musical than nighthawk ever produced the results were the same though as she had when she had tried to ease tfyrrs soulwounds she became one with him and his hurts and felt them as clearly as if they were hers she came between him and the pain in fact shielding him from it as he had shielded her from the blows that had injured him if i had wings and i could fly that was the refrain in many of the songs she and her kind sang to their audiences now she spread wings of power rather than feathers and muscle spread them over him and sheltered him beneath them as he had sheltered her beneath his own she was once again aware of the spicy scent of his feathers and the bitter scent beneath it of sheer exhaustion with her song and the power in the song she drove into each injury speeding the healing that had already begun strengthening the torn muscles weaving reinforcement into the sprains soothing the bruises in the back of her mind she reflected that it was too bad in a way that his skin was covered with feathers nothing she had done would be visible on the other hand injuries will not be obvious either he will appear up to full strength which might mislead other wouldbe attackers she sensed him relaxing as the pain eased sensed his surprise in the lessening of the pain sensed him finding the song she chanted under her breath but then instead of simply opening himself up to the song as she had asked he began to sing too and the power no longer flowed only from her to him but came from his hands into hers as if two great rushing streams ran side by side but in opposing directions her shoulder stopped aching and throbbing as he touched her with that brush of power as warm as the caress of a feather and as light the many points of pain in her skull ebbed as he brushed the power over them as well the quality of the chant changed a little becoming more musical with odd tonal qualities but she was able to follow it effortlessly but she almost lost the thread of the chant in her own astonishment when she realized consciously what he had just done and she felt his amusement and wonderamusement at her surprise and wonder at the thing that had been born between them in the past anytime she had done this when she had opened herself to someone it had been entirely onesided as she had learned to her sorrow with handsome raven even when she limited her openness to the minimum required to heal she had still been open enough to feel the mental anguish that all too often came with injury and always she had felt the pain itself never ever had someone else returned the gift never had someone joined her in the chant to heal her and never had anyone ever opened himself to her heart as she had opened herself to his until tfyrr she knew that he read her soul as she had read his felt the long loneliness and the resignation deeper than despair and just as sorrowful her heart had no more secrets from his for every wound every scar every bruise was laid bare to his raptorial eyes she was so surprised that she could not even react by closing herself off again she could not read thoughtsbut she could read the feelings that came with the thoughts feelings so mixed she could not have said where his wonder began and his own long loneliness ended he began to speak aloud giving her the images the memories that were calling up those feelingsand clearly he knew what she sensed there are humans who live among the haspur he said softly as she continued to sing her healing chant so lost in it now that she could not have stopped if she tried he fitted the words to the music and sang them to her as he sang healing into her body as well most of them are as ordinary as bread but some are granted a rare gift that of seeing into the spirit that is why we call them haspur spiritbrothers for as often as they use that gift with their fellow humans they also use it with the haspur who are their friends and fellowdefenders mostly they provide the simpler gifts healing of the body as you are doing ease of the heart in time of trouble but sometimes once in a very very long time there is need and a compatibility of spirits that binds healer and healed more closely than that that is when the spiritgift of the haspur is awakened and the two become a greater whole than two spiritbrothers are singly they are he sang a long fluting whistle that somehow melded itself into the healing chant without disturbing it there are no words in the human tongue for this they are partnerhealers they are wisdomkeepers they are two souls in two bodies still but bound together in ways that neither time nor distance can change or sever sometimes they are lovers they are the great treasures of the haspur i had not thought to find that potential in myself though every haspur at one time aspires to and dreams of such a thing i would never have dreamed to have found it with you o bird of the night wild winged singer dreamer of beauty and gentle healer of hearts there was more but half of it was in his own language and at any rate nightingale would have lost half of it in her own daze at a single phrase sometimes they are lovers how couldwell she knew how physically they were as compatible as many unlikely human pairings now that she had tended his hurts she knew what was beneath that modestywrap he wore and if he said that his people and humans sometimes became lovers then of course it was possible but how with care of course an impudent mental voice chided her those talons could cause a bit of trouble but on the other hand you probably weigh more than he does so oh it was a very good thing that neither he nor she could read thoughts with her mind and body whirling all unbalanced and giddy she realized that the chant was nearing its end she brought it to a close rounding it in on itself curling it into repose and she opened her eyes to find herself curled in his arms and he in hers her head pillowed on the soft breast feathers his on her unbound hair nor did either of them care to move for a very long time the immediate effect of the healing chant was twofold both healer and healed were ravenous afterwards and exhausted so weary that even had she been ready to deal with the consequences of what had just happened between them neither of them would have had the strength she had more strength than he for she had more experience at the healing than he it was not the power itself that came from the healer only the directionbut as riding a fractious galloping horse takes strength so did guiding the power she had just enough reserves left to go down the stairs leave a message for tyladen saying that she was indisposedwhich was no lieand order some food brought up he was asleep when she returned and only came halfawake when the food arrived just enough to eat and fall back into sleep she was not in much better shape she really didnt remember what she had ordered and hardly recognized it when it arrived her head spun in dizzy circles as she got up to put the tray outside the door she lay back down again beside him and dimmed the light and that was all she remembered but her dreams were wonderful full of colors she had no names for sensations of wind against her skin and a feeling of unbearable lightness and joy shed had dreams of flying before every free bard did it seemed but never like this this was real flight the sensation of powerful chest muscles straining great wings against the air to gain height until the earth was little more than a tapestry of green and brown and grey below then the plummeting dive with wind hard against the face and tearing at the closefolded wings and the exaltation of the freedom the freedom she woke to find him already awake and watching her a bemused expression in his eyes not now he said before she could speak not now you have never known this was possible you must think you must meditate or you will regret any decision you make in haste she nodded he knew her as well as she knew herself of course he does said that little amused voice and he knows that the outcome is perfectly certain he can afford to wait he knows what you will do eventually and he is patient enough to wait for that eventually however long it takes i want to talk to tyladen she said finally thisi only have two choices that i can see after this last attack i either move to the palace with you or i reveal who i really am and get some of that protection these damn deliambrens were so free in offering my suggestion would be the latter he replied as long as you are openly still lyrebird you have an ear in the city that i do not that no one who is not human would have you would not be able to discuss things with our friend father ruthvere for instance but it is your choice she nodded thoughtfully agreeing with him hes right we need that ear inside the church that father ruthvere provides and he needs the knowledge of the court that we can give him church and court are wound in an incestuous dance these days and if anyone is to break the pattern it will be father ruthvere and those who are with him moving into his suite would have forced me to make certain decisions anyway and im not sure i want to even think about them much less make them things were already complicated enough it was something of a relief to close herself into the privacy of the bathroom and let the hot water from the wall nozzle run over her washing away fatigue and letting her empty her mind as well she didnt have to guess that he might be feeling as uncertain as she that was another complication to this situation it was one thing to imagine finding someone for herself as she sang those love songs of longing and loneliness it was quite another to find herself presented with a resolution and yet hadnt she wanted someone exactly like this well the old gypsy proverb advised be careful what you wish for you might get it she could not have designed a better partner than tfyrr for they were alike enough for joy and different enough for exploration and oh doesnt that open up a number of possibilities one can just imagine she fiercely shoved that little voice back into its corner one thing at a time she told it well take one thing at a time and the most important comes first we must deal with the high king and finish the task we have begun assuming it can be finished tfyrr was all ready when she emerged and he had cleaned up the room and put the bed into the wall too perhaps he felt as uncomfortable with that particular piece of furniture so blatantly on display as she was of course he is hes feeling what im feeling which will ensure that he feels the same oh what a bother no more polite and discreet lies just to salve his feelings if we disagree on something one of us will have to find a way to persuade the other or the bad feelings will chafe between us until we are halfdistracted they went downstairs together to find that they were so early this morning that they were by the standards of freehold still up late the sun was just rising and the lastshift dance group performing its final number so tyladen would still be awake not a bad thing since she wanted first to speak with him she was quite prepared to wake him if she needed to not that she was sure when he ever slept the deliambrens didnt seem to have the same sleep needs as humans did she thought perhaps that he slept in the midmorning hours perhaps a little in the afternoon but never for more than two or three hours at a time of course they dont need to sleep the way we do they dont have to sleep deeply enough for dreaming they express their dreams and nightmares in their clothing tyladen was still awake but looked a bit surprised to have both of them strolling into his office together and at that early hour nightingale shut the door firmly and put her back to it as tfyrr leaned against the wall giving him the advantage of looking down at the deliambren first of all lyrebird was attacked yesterday she was hurt and so was i in trying to help her his face was without expression but nightingale knew that every word was carefully chosen you might take note of the bruises if you should happen to doubt my word nightingale had sent word down at the same time that she had ordered the food that she was indisposed presumably tyladen had found a substitute singer for last night he just nodded mobile face solemn for a change then again there wasnt much he could respond to yet and he didnt know that they were together in more than one sense we have reason to believe that the attack was more of an attempt to gain control over me than because she got in the way of some gang or other tfyrr continued in fact we believe that the same person who was behind the other two attacks on me here was behind the one on her that makes sense tyladen said cautiously looking from nightingales face to tfyrrs as if he was trying to put a number of disparate bits of information together and not coming up with much perhaps she ought to quit her position here then and move to the palace she doesnt precisely need to work here anymore and surely you have tfyrr deliberately leaned over and placed both taloned hands on tyladens desk scoring the surface enough of the nonsense tyladen we both know why i come here its not because im savoring the nightlife nor because i happen to enjoy this ladys playing we both know that i would still have to come here even if the lady moved into my suite at the palace so that i could continue to report to you im your little palace spy tyladen an unpaid spy at that and its about time you and harperus began giving me a bit more protection and you might as well start offering that same protectionno more protectionto lyrebird tyladen didnt bat an eye he simply put on a skeptical expression and said i cant see any good reason why because nightingale interrupted him my name isnt lyrebird its nightingalenightingale of the free bards and the getan gypsies and ive been working here on behalf of the deliambrens without any support since i arrived for the first time in her life nightingale actually saw expressions of shock dismay and surprise pass across a deliambren face and for the first time in her life she saw one caught at a loss for words tyladen sat in his chair with his mouth half open his lips twitched but he couldnt seem to get any words out it would be funny if the situation werent so serious he looked exactly like a stunned catfish nightingale sat down gracefully now she said sweetly about that protection tfyrr smiled for both of us he added coming to stand behind her and putting both his taloned hands on her shoulders tyladen just sat and stared at them both they returned to the palace with a double mintak guard twins or so it was said they certainly looked like twins insofar as a human could tell since this pair had been known to break up fights with their bare hands and now were armed with very impressive axes in their belts nightingale doubted that there would be any more ambushes today in fact their path was remarkably clear of interference even peddlers found reasons to take their pushcarts out of the way as they walked steadily toward the palace her streetchildren slipped up to her one and two at a time pretending to beg but in actuality making certain that she was all right and gleefully recounting their own parts in the melee it made her a little sick to realize that they had seen it as normal quite in keeping with life on the streets perhaps a bit more fun than most of the violent situations they witnessed or were a part of in the course of a month or so she slipped each of them an extra couple of pennies for diligence and quick thinking she would have given them more but that would leave all of them open to robbery or worse no streeturchin dared carry more than a couple of pennies on his person and very few of them had a safe place to cache money i can give them more later i can double their wages i can see to it that they can come to the kitchen door of freehold and be fed and have it taken out of my wages when they neared the palace tfyrr took off into the air much to the astonishment of the passersby leaving nightingale to go on to the bronze gate with her double mintak guard flanking her their presence raised an eyebrow from the gate guard but one of the mintaks grunted and said to him been some trouble for freeholders people roughing up folks as works for us callin em fuzzylovers boss wants his investment protected the gate guard nodded at that and waved her through the inexplicable had been explained in terms he could understand nightingale passed inside and the two mintaks went back across the street took up a station in a nearby cafe that catered to the servants of those who came and went through the bronze gate and set out a tiny portable sires and barons game between them they would be there when she came out again and they might even hear or be told something useful while they were there now all she had to worry about were the dangers inside the palace about which i can do nothing hopefully tyladen or harperus have something that can protect me tfyrr landed beside her in a flurry of wing feathers as she traversed the stonepaved path between two regimented beds of fragrant flowers with her practiced eye she knew by his careful landing that he was still in some pain his wingbeats were not as deep and he landed on both feet rather than one the flowers in these formal gardens werent anything she recognized but then the high kings gardeners had access to flowers found nowhere else inside the twenty kingdoms and their breeding programs could make even familiar blooms unrecognizable she allowed herself to be distracted from her concerns for a moment by their beauty and their perfume but she couldnt be distracted for long among the major concerns there were some minor ones nothing that really mattered in either the long or the short run but somehow they nagged at her one was strictly personal and a cause for some embarrassment would there be gossip about them it was certainly possible it would be the second time that tfyrr had remained out of the palace all night and both times if anyone was keeping track he had been at freehold in her room she found herself blushing at the notion of what people might be thinking which rather surprised her after all hadnt she been willing to move into his suite and live there but that was different oh certainly with a preadolescent boy to act as chaperon it was different indeed she blushed even more this is ridiculous im a gypsy a free bard people have been saying things about me for as long as ive been alive and i didnt care i laughed at them she managed to get her blushes under control before they reached their goal by dint of much selfscolding which in itself was ridiculous but when they arrived at the palace itself and entered the huge selfopening doors they found the place as chaotic as an overturned beehive the great hall at the main doors was full of courtiers and servants and everyone in between all of them chattering and all of them upset people of all stations were standing together in tight little groups rigid with apprehension or rushing aboutapparently with no clear destination in mind pages ran hither and yon on urgent errands their eyes wide and faces pale all that nightingale could pick up was fear fear and excitement and all that those emotions engendered whats been happening she and tfyrr stood just inside the door and no one noticed them which in itself was nothing short of astonishing tfyrr solved the entire question by reaching out and intercepting one of the page boys as he ran past the boy felt the talons close on his shoulder and stopped dead with a little squeak of surprise what is going on here tfyrr rumbled down at his captive what has happened since yesterday why is there all this commotion the page stared at him with wide blue eyes and stuffed his fist into his mouth as he blinked up at them he wasnt very old no more than seven or eightand very sheltered one of nightingales streeturchins would have replied already and been well on his way tfyrr waited patiently finally the boy got up enough courage to speak its the ddeliambren ssire he stammered then seemed to get stuck staring up into the haspurs raptorial eyes exactly like a mouse waiting for the hawk to strike what about the deliambren tfyrr asked with a little less patience i havent been here ive just come in what about the deliambren hheshes been attacked the boy blurted hes hurt they say badly they say someone tried to kill him then as tfyrrs grip loosened with shock the page pulled away and ran off again tfyrrs shock didnt last past that moment he knew where harperus suite was and may the lady help anyone who got between him and his destination he headed off in that direction with a purposeful stride that nightingale had to match by running her mind flitted from thought to thought infected a little by all the fear around her attacked by who is he really hurt badly is heoh dear lady not dead surely the idea of old owl deadno it was not to be thought of surely not he not with all of his deliambren devices to protect him he had outlived her grandfather with no sign of old age how could he be dead but how could he have been attacked how could anyone have gotten in to him past his devices to attack him they ran past rank after rank of statuary taking the quickest path to the deliambren suite past animals past famous generals past mermaidsup the stairs to the fourth floor and past guildsmen past famous bards past farmersoh dear there is one with his favorite piggy at his feet she thought distractedlypast the allies of the twenty kingdoms and there was the door to harperus suite now guarded by a pair of the kings personal bodyguards who let tfyrr and herself past without so much as a challenge tfyrr flung himself inside immediately but she stopped at the door and caught the attention of one of the guards one she thought she recognized from the kings suite what happened she asked shortly he looked down into her eyes his own as flat and expressionless as blued steel finally he opened his thin grim lips and answered someone broke in here last night while envoy harperus was with the high king theythere was more than onewere ransacking the suite when the envoy came in and found them still there his devices had stunned and captured one of them and the others were trying to get him free when the envoy surprised them they clubbed him and fled the envoy is still unconscious the high king has put his own personal servants in place here since the envoys assigned servants have disappeared and might even have been in collusion with his attackers we have the one the device caught in custody the other guard said at last the envoy regained consciousness long enough to tell us what had happened how to free the man and to ask for sire tfyrr and then collapsed again she might have thought she was imagining a faint tone of disapproval that tfyrr had not been here when harperus asked for him except that she sensed the disapproval as well as heard it she simply nodded with dignity and said sire tfyrr and i were attacked by nine armed men in the city last night we were some time in being tended to and unable to send word to the palace it seems that someone would like to harm the high kings foreign allies then she passed on through the doors into the deliambren suite knowing that the bodyguards were far more than mere soldiers and knowing that what she had just said would be recounted with exact tone and inflection to the high kings spymaster and whether that mysterious gentleman served theovere only or served some of the advisors as well there would be no doubt that she and tfyrr were well aware of what their attackers were if not who it was a risk to reveal that but it was an equal risk to seem unaware of their situation perhaps this would make their enemy a bit more wary but for right now she was grimly certain that harperus had better have someone at his side who was his friend guarding him the kings bodyguards might help so long as whoever was after harperus tried to pass the doors but they wouldnt be of much help if an attacker were one of the kings servants or came in by some other means the suite didnt look a great deal different from theirs except in one small detail harperus had none of the deliambren sculptures around the suite that might explain why tyladen didnt know about the attack yet nightingale passed through the reception room and into harperus bedroom where there were two more guards at the door tfyrr had already settled at harperus bedside displacing a servant nightingale bit her lip then reached out to touch the deliambrens bruised brow and hummed a fragment of the healing chant under her breath but she emerged almost immediately from her brief trance with a feeling of profound relief hell be all right she told tfyrr whose tense shoulders and twitching tail signaled his own worry and fear hes healing himself he doesnt even need me to do anything that is why he went unconscious again he has a concussion but when he wakes it will have been taken care of im going to your suite to get something ill be right back tfyrr started up at that and she knew what must be in his mind if anyone got into your suite last night it wont matter she pointed out whoever was behind this was probably behind the attack on us and he knows where we were after harperus was attacked the kings men probably checked all the suites to make sure no one else was hurt so even if the attackers got into yours nob is surely all right he sank back down on his stool and nodded nob is all that i care about he said a bit hoarsely anything else can be replaced and most of it is not mine anyway things can be restored people cannot she hurried out running as soon as she reached the hallways picking up her skirts like a child so that she could run the faster despite what she had told him to reassure himthank the lady we cant read thoughtsshe was by no means sure that she would find either the suite or nob intact in the excitement the guards might not have thought to check nob could be lying with his skull cracked in the bathroom of the suite or in his own room even now but as she pushed the door open nob came flying out of the bedroom with a cry of relief to see her and the room seemed intact tfyrr is all right she said and gave him the short version of the attack in the streetsand then for the benefit of tyladens listening devices a short story of the attack on harperus nob had known that there had been an attack on someone for guards had come checking the other suites as she had suspected they might but he had known nothing more than that one of the envoys had been hurt he hadnt known which one and hed been afraid to leave the suite to find out he hadnt known what to do his training in etiquette hadnt covered this sort of situation and he was afraid to act without orders but now that tfyrr was back he had someone to give him orders which put his world back in place again nightingale gave him the first of those orders on behalf of his master have someone bring tfyrr his breakfast in harperus suite she said then you bring him fresh clothing hell want you to stand guard over harperus while he uses the envoys bathroom he still hasnt had much of a chance to get completely clean after those bravos attacked us nob nodded his eyes were full of questions but he was too welltrained to ask them nightingale was not going to say anything it wasnt her place whatever tfyrr wanted him to know tfyrr would tell him i will perform for the high king as usual she told the boy we will hope he will find me a satisfactory substitute ill be going there as soon as i get my harp in tune as soon as nob was out of the room she locked the door and gave a much more detailed accounting of everything for the sake of the listening devices that is all we know now she said i presume we will find out more when harperus awakens in the meantime she stopped herself after all what could she suggest that was of any real value in the meantime i will substitute for tfyrr with the high king unless i receive orders from the king to the contrary i will not be back to freehold for the next day or so as she took her harp in its case off her backshe was so used to the weight that she hadnt really noticed it even when shed run to the suiteshe tried to calm herself she would not be able to call the magic if she was too tense to hear its melody above her own the trouble was that this second attack pointed all too clearly to an enemy within the highest ranks an enemy who had at least some inkling that she harperus and tfyrr were all working together presumably to bring about changes in the king that this enemy did not want to see occur and depending on how high that enemy was we are already marked we could be doomed and with that cheerful thought in mind she passed out of the doors and into the hall walking swiftly on her way to entertain the king she and tfyrr sat beside harperus turn and turn about sometimes they practiced their music softly but without the addition of the magic their only connection to the world outside the suite was nob she worried briefly about the mintaks she had left presumably someone from freehold would send for the twins but in case tyladen didnt think of it she finally sent nob down to the bronze gate with a note for them letting them know what had happened and that she would not be coming out today if they were thorough they would probably wait to see if this was a ruse and when she didnt show up return to freehold on their own tyladen could confirm her note to them then at any rate they would have passed a fairly pleasant morning and afternoon in congenial surroundings paid for by tyladen there were other things she would like to see him pay for but she was unlikely to see that happen in her lifetime damned deliambrens interfering in our lives and playing at games with us never thinking there might be any real danger involvedafter all were all backward barbarians and how could we be a danger to anyone then the two of them watched over their friend with care and concern thinking no more of the outside world until the outside world intruded on them in the form of the kings physician he did not deign to explain himself to them nor did he pay any particular attention to them he simply breezed past the guards and into harperus bedchamber ignoring them both while this was rude it was not entirely unexpected at least to nightingale while tfyrr theoretically outranked a mere physician it was only in theory and there wasnt much tfyrr could do if this man chose to ignore his rank and even his presence just because he was not human but the moment he ceased doing a simple physical examination and opened up the bag of instruments he brought he found tfyrrs talons clamped around his wrist he had reached out so quickly that nightingale did not even see him move only that his talons were suddenly locked around the physicians wrist he told me once that a haspur can kill a deer with his hands and a buffalo with his feet i hope this physician cooperates he will find it difficult to practice medicine with a broken wrist what do you think you are doing the haspur snarled his beak parted in threat startled the human glanced around for help from the guards but the guards were not disposed to interfere at least not yet tfyrr hadnt done anything contrary to their orders and nightingale doubted that they had any idea just how much pressure those handclaws could exert and if they did they still might not interfere the man made an abortive move to free his wrist and discovered just how strong a haspurs grip was nightingale stayed out of the way and in the background the less she drew attention to herself the better too many people already had her marked as it was she didnt need to add the physician to the list finally the man decided that answering was better than standing there with his wrist in the grip of a giant predatoralthough he tried to look as important as possible that was a bit difficult given that he was also wincing from the pain of tfyrrs grip i am going to wake him the physician said arrogantly oh truly then he is more of a fool than i took him for nightingale thought in surprise if harperus trance had not been selfinduced it would have been very serious indeed it might have been dangerous to harperus to wake himand it might have been impossible and even though the trance was selfinduced and therefore it was unlikely the physician could break down the wall of harperus will trying to wake him could easily interfere with the selfhealing process and just how much do you know about the deliambrens tfyrr all but purred dangerously have you studied deliambren head injuries have you ever had a deliambren patient before well no but the man stuttered surprised into telling the truth he had probably never had anyone challenge his expertise before have you ever had any nonhuman as a patient tfyrr persisted his eyes narrowing his voice dropping another halfoctave so that the purr became a growl have you even studied nonhuman injuries the man blanched and tried to bluff no but that hardly matters wheouch tfyrr had tightened his talons on the mans wrist nightingale winced surely the bones were grinding together by now why then is it so imperative that lord harperus be wakened tfyrr asked when you know that you know nothing of how his body functions and in waking him you might kill him is this on the orders of the king he pulled the man a little closer to him effortlessly and looked down at him with his beak no more than a few inches from the physicians face itnoowits because of the escape you fool the physician was deadwhite now with anger as much as with fear although fear was swiftly gaining the upper hand after all there is a beak fully capable of biting through his spine less than a handsbreadth from his nose tfyrr shook the wrist he held ever so slightly what escape he asked urgently and nightingale felt the hair on the back of her neck rise both in reaction to his dangerously icy tone and in premonition her stomach knotted with tfyrrs both of them with chills of fear running down their backs the manthe man who was caught here the physician stammered unable to look away from tfyrrs eyes he escaped early this evening we need to talk to the envoy to discover if there was anyone he recognized among the rest of his attackers we need to find more of the perpetrators before they have a chance to get away what tfyrr dropped the mans wrist the physician did not even stop to gather up his instruments he fled the suite leaving only tfyrr and the guards tfyrr turned toward the guard nearest him who shrugged i hadnt heard anything sire the man said weve been here as long as you have i can send to find out though do that tfyrr ordered brusquely if the man really did escape there are now at least three people who need to see that lord harperus does not get a chance to identify them all loose in this palace now we dont know who any of them are they could be among the very servants sent here to serve lord harperus you might consider that when you send your message the guards grim face grew a bit grimmer and he himself disappeared for a moment or two leaving his fellow twice as vigilant when he returned it was with his own captain striding by his side nightingale recognized the captain from the high kings suite he was one of the ones usually close at theoveres side i understand you have not heard the latest of our incidents sire tfyrr the captain said with careful courtesy i can tell it to you in brief the palace does not normally hold prisoners normally we send them elsewhere within the city which has better gaols than we this time however it was deemed better to keep the man here in one of the storage rooms in the cellars with a guard on his door not he added with a wry lift of an eyebrow one of us this was merely a palace guard not one of the elite tfyrr nodded and the captain went on i am told that at about dinner time according to the guard left on duty a woman appeared with whom several of the guards were familiar he among them she is ostensibly a maid here and yet no one will admit now to having her in their service at any rate there was supposedly a good reason for her to be in the storage area and when she saw the guard who knew her she flirted with him as she has often done in the past he allowed his caution to slip she was only a woman after all and alone she then incapacitated the guard and let the prisoner escape tfyrr concluded seeing the obvious direction the tale was heading she didnt bloody incapacitate him she knocked him cold with a single punch the captain corrected bitterly a single woman no taller than his chin its unnatural ive never seen nor heard of the like for a woman half a mans size to take him down with one blow even if he didnt expect it nightingale had of course but she kept her peace there was no point in getting suspicion pointed in her own direction the regular guards by now were smarting with the disgrace they would be looking for an easy suspect and she was in no mood to provide them with one it would be all too easy for someone to claim that she had somehow slipped down to the cellar perhaps during one of the brief times she had gone to fetch something for tfyrr from his suite especially since she had been seen in the lower kitchen and could have been mistaken for a maid with a long stretch of the imagination there were cooks and the like who would be perfectly able to identify her as tanager and for a noble there wasnt a great deal of difference between a maid and a streetmusician so the man is gone and we have no suspects whatsoever tfyrr clacked his beak with anger this is not cheerful news captain do tell the man retorted heatedly at the moment our best hope is that lord harperus regains consciousness and can tell us what he saw that is probably why the physician was senti expect it was by the captain of the watch the captains tone turned condescending im afraid that he hasnt had much experience with injuries i am certain he thought a head injury was no more serious than a drunken stupor and could be dealt with in much the same way his tone implied that the watch captain had no combat experience which was probably trueand the scars on his own face and hands spoke volumes for his expertise so your best hope is to keep him safe tfyrr turned the full force of his gaze on the captain i am the nearest you have to an expert on deliambren medicinealthough if you want a real expert there is a deliambren running a tavern in the city a place called freehold his name is tyladen he probably has a great deal more knowledge than i i know the place the captain replied many of my men have been there now and again and they speak highly of the place ive been there myself for entertainment not primarily i warrant probably to see if it was a hotbed of fuzzy subversion but it wasnt and so he permits his men to visit it recreationally tyladen of freehold might be persuaded to come attend to his fellow countrymans needs tfyrr said and nightingale sensed his fragment of ironic pleasure at the notion that tyladen just might be forced to do something besides sit in his office like a spider in a web collecting information at no cost or danger to himself she was beginning to have a very poor opinion of tyladens courage and she knew tfyrr shared it other than tyladen i am your nearest source and i assure you it would be much better to wait until lord harperus wakes of his own accord it could be dangerous to try to bring him to consciousness at this point the captain acknowledged tfyrrs expertise with an unwilling nod ill have that noted sire tfyrr he added politely now by your leave ill take mine tfyrr bowed slightly and the captain walked out at a slightly faster pace than hed arrived tfyrr had impressed him with a level head and good sense at any rate they both returned to their seats beside harperus bed nob had long since closed the curtains against the night and lit a lamp or two turning them low most of the room was in shadow the rest in halflight curtains pulled halfway around the bed to keep the light from disturbing the occupant left the bed itself in deep shadows in which harperus white hair gleamed softly against the pillow the haspur turned to nightingale and touched her hand as lightly as a puff of down with the talon that had just come close to crushing the wrist of the interfering physician she smiled tremulously at him when do you think hell wake he asked her in a tense whisper she closed her eyes and again dropped briefly into the healingspell with three key notes of the chant the song harperus wove about himself was coming to a close winding in and around itself the way that all deliambren music ended in a reprise of the beginning a serpent swallowing its own tail soon very soon she said opening her eyes again within an hour or two at the very most i suspect tfyrr sighed with relief it cannot be too soon for me nor for me she replied i still need to invoke healing on you again and i on you he interrupted and a gentle warmth washed over her as he touched the back of her hand again but we may be sitting here guarding harperus until until what came a weak voice from the shadows until the moon turns blue until the second cataclysm until you wake old fool tfyrr said turning quickly toward the head of the bed by the winds you had us worried not half so much as i worried myself harperus replied with a groan and a sigh as he tried to sit up im too old to be practicing selfhealing it is a bad habit to get into relying on selfhealing too much it is a worse habit to put yourself in situations where you need to practice it nightingale scolded by now the guards just outside the bedchamber had heard the third voice and one had come to investigate he had come in at least twice so far today fooled by tfyrrs mimicking ability while they were practicing their music lord harperus is awake and ready to speak tfyrr told him as the man opened his mouth to ask what was going on while you are notifying those in authority you ought to send a servant to bring some food for lord harperus light food nightingale interrupted suitable for an invalid and make sure it is tested before you serve it to him remember we do not know who attacked him or what positions his attackers hold they could work in the kitchen oh not tea and toast harperus complained but subsided at her glare sinking into the shadows of the bed well all right i suppose you know best nightingale you are healertrained what are you doing here anyway i thought you wouldnt promise to come here i wouldnt she said tartly in the gypsy tongue and this is the reason why ive been here all along im tfyrrs accompanist i just didnt want you delightful people to endanger my safety by telling everyone on the planet that i was your agent none of you deliambrens have an ounce of sense among you when it comes to keeping secrets the deliambren sighed and lifted a hand to rub his head he replied to her in the same language for once i have to agree that you were probably right but in our own defense nightingale we never thought that anyone would resort to a direct attack a direct attack tfyrr said sharply there have been three thus far old friend one on me alone and one on nightingale yesterday that i became involved in that is why we were not here last night what what harperus sat up abruptlytoo abruptly for he sank back down again holding his hand to his head does tyladen tyladen knows all about it since we confronted him about it this morning nightingale replied glad that they had all switched to the gypsy language though she had not been aware that tfyrr knew it then again with all the gypsy songs he learned and has been learning i suppose he would have had to and i know harperus has some sort of machine that puts languages into ones head and since i spent the better part of an hour reciting what happened to you at those listening devices in tfyrrs room he knows about what happened to you too whether or not he can be persuaded to come out of the safety of freehold to do anything to help you is another question altogether tfyrr added and clacked his beak and this open chattering is another reason why nightingale and i have been reluctant to work with youyou may hope that there is no listening post in the walls and that no one else here knows this language but i would not hope for it very hard this is the palace after all and i would wager that the kings spymaster has a man in every room and an expert in every tongue on alanda oh well said my love she applauded mentally it isnt likely that anyone within listening distance actually does know the gypsy tongue but they could very easily find someone to listen now that they know were likely to use it among ourselves since i am a gypsy it is logical to assume that we are using that language harperus shrank down into his pillows i am rebuked he said in a small voice justly rebuked and i apologize for all that has happened so far cease apologizing and start thinking how you can protect us nightingale replied switching back to the common tongue that will be apology enough at that moment both harperus food and the captain of the elite bodyguards arrived and nightingale and tfyrr got out of the way do you think we need to spend the night here she asked him in an undertone he shook his head there is no point in trying to silence him now the haspur replied what would be the point if he saw anyone he knows hell tell the captain i think we can return to the suite and get some rest of our own she licked her lips nervously i wonder she said tentatively if we might leave nob here to take care of him theyve replaced all his servants and id like someone here tonight we can trust he blinked at her and she sensed his speculation and growing excitement as he realized that they would be alone in the suite if they left nob here he was probably wondering if she meant what he thought she did well im wondering if i really mean what i think i do i believe that would be a good idea he replied he beckoned to nob who was sitting in a chair in the corner pretending to read id like you to stay here with lord harperus tonight until we can bring him a bodyservant that we know can be trusted tomorrow tfyrr told the boy soberly nob glowed with pleasure at the implied trust yes sire he said eagerly id be happy to sire were relying on you nob tfyrr added there isnt anyone else in the palace i trust as much as you were leaving his safety in your hands i must count on you to be clever and cautious test his food before he eats itwatch anyone who comes in that is not one of the royal elite bodyguards and if anything seems amiss do not confront the person yourself go get the bodyguards the boy sobered but continued to glow you can count on me sire tfyrr he replied fervently i wont fail your trust tfyrr parted his beak in a smile thank you nob he waited until the captain had finished questioning the deliambren then brought the boy over to harperus bedside well that was a bit of bad news and good harperus said as the captain left the bedcurtains had been drawn back and the bruise on harperus forehead stood out in vivid ugliness the bad news being that my prisoner escaped the good that i knew one of the others by namehe was a common guard id had to complain about to his superior hes likely still on duty or at least in the palace garrison probably doesnt know i have a damned good memory for names and faces theyll have him in a real gaol within the hour were leaving nob with you for the night tfyrr told him resting one hand on the boys shoulder as nob stood straight and tried desperately to look older than his years hes the only one we trust to see to you until we can get tyladen to send someone from freehold that we can rely on whatever you need my lord ill take care of the boy replied earnestly just ask i can do whatever you need to have done harperus looked sharply from tfyrr to nightingale and back again but said nothing except that will be welcome indeed i know what a good bodyservant nob is i have seen his work in your suite tfyrr i appreciate it very much both that you tfyrr are willing to do without his service for one night and that you nob are willing to put in the extra hours and the effort to help me now the boy blushed and dropped his gaze nearly bursting with pride well leave you for now tfyrr said gravely his voice giving no hint of anything but weariness and concern for harperus dont overwork nob old owl harperus smiled winked and waved them both off then turned to nob with instructions for drawing him a bath tfyrr took nightingales hand in his own and the two of them left the suite together he didnt seem inclined to drop her hand when they entered the hall and she didnt withdraw hers in spite of worry the reminders of yesterdays attack in the form of distant aches and the deeply lurking fear the attack on harperus had left with her she was happier than she had been since she was a child in fact the only other time she recalled being this happy was when she had first learned to invoke the bardic magic that wasoh too many weary years ago when the world was all new and shining all music was a delight and every day brought only new adventures the world is new again all music is pleasure and there are more possibilities in each new day than i can count she knew what she was doing oh do i well she knew what she was doing but the consequences did she know that as well could she even guess at the consequences they passed through the statuelined hallways in silence and met no one it was the dinner hour most of those who lived on this floor were in the great hall dining in the presence of the high king and his advisors perhaps by now the word that harperus had identified another of his attackers had made its way to the hall perhaps it had not no one would know until tomorrow that she had stayed in tfyrrs suite but once again she blushed she did not want his name and hers in the mouths of these idle courtiers who would speculate and gossip maliciously just out of sheer boredom some would use the gossip to further damage their cause with the high king others would use it to create whatever damage they could elsewhere there were church laws about the congress of humans and those who were notbased on holy writ forbidding the congress of humans and demons only now was she recalling those strictures only now that there was a moment of leisure was she able to think of them her earlier embarrassment had probably been because in the back of her mind she knew that there could be trouble over this oh it was just because i knew there would be gossip hurtful gossip and that someone in this vast hulk would use that gossip to cause trouble for us i doubt that anyone will believe that you and i are partnering he murmured quietly for her ears alone once again he had guessed what she was thinking from the emotions her thoughts engendered most of these folk hawk for game in the game preserve you know most have falcons and other raptors and know something about them how do you tell a male raptor from a female by the size usually she replied vaguely unable to guess what his meaning was then it occurred to her and she bit her lips to cover a giggle ohoh of course you cant tell a male from a female by sight unless they have different feathercolorations they dont havewhat you have precisely tfyrr said dryly humorous only nob knows that i am not like a hawk in that respect and he will take that secret to his grave if i ask it of him the rest assume i am as externally sexless as a saints statue i have heard as much through nob he is very good at listening and reporting what he has heard and no one pays any attention to the pages so he had discovered that for himself had he it was an echo of her own observation that no one ever paid any attention to the children once again their minds ran on parallel tracks she squeezed his hand by way of reply and he squeezed hers in return just as they reached the door of his suitewhich now also had a pair of the royal bodyguards standing watch outside tfyrr bid them both a grave goodnight and they returned his salutation when they closed the door of the suite behind them and locked it tfyrr paused and looked around the room someone had already been here leaving the lamps lit and food in covered dishes on the sideboard that was probably standing orders since he had mentioned more than once that he was not welcome to dine in the great hall she wondered for a moment what he was frowning at until she saw his eyes resting on each of the sculptures in turn have you any idea how sensitive those are he asked her quietly could they hear into the next room do you think she had to shake her head i havent a clue she admitted well then since i do not believe that tyladen is entitled to any vestige of my private life and since i believe him to be as enthusiastic a voyeur as he is a coward i think that for one night there will be no listening he took each of the sculptures in turn and buried it under a pile of pillows and cushions thieved from the furniture there he said with satisfaction that should take care of that he turned to her and held out his hand again she took it the dry hard skin feeling warmer than usual beneath her hand i would like a bath he said would you she nodded unable to actually say anything i do warn you he continued i look altogether miserable when wet if your romantic inclinations survive the sight of me with my feathers plastered to my skin they will survive anything she smiled suddenly shy i suspect they will survive she said in a low voice yours may not survive seeing me without a beautiful costume to make up for my otherwise he put a talon across her lips and led her into the bathroom where they discovered that romance survives a great many trials and thrives on laughter chapter nine harperus was still bedridden many days later tfyrr had come to make one of his morning visits he had not been the only visitor but harperus second guest had come as the bearer of bad tidings the captain of the bodyguards left them after delivering his unwelcome news and if a mans retreating back could signal chagrin profound embarrassment and disgust with a situation his did it well should have i cannot believe this tfyrr exploded once the captain was out of the suite and out of earshot harperus shrugged philosophically from the shelter of his huge bed the bruise on his forehead had faded to an unpleasant pale green and brown and on the whole he was doing well but the effects of the selfhealing tranceand the exhaustion of handling what had probably been a cracked skull as well as a concussionwere longerlasting than either of them had anticipated i had actually expected something like this the deliambren said with a sigh i didnt want to say anything lest i be seen to imply that theoveres people are less than competent but i was holding my breath over it if a man can be spirited away from a locked and guarded room in the palace surely the city gaols are no more secure tfyrr only snarled and his talons scraped across the floor as he flexed his feet angrily no sooner had the man harperus identified been arrested taken into custody and turned over to a city gaol than he was free again this time it was nothing so obvious as a guard being seduced no the man escaped from a locked and barred cell and a lace handkerchief had been left in his place it seemed that their mysterious female adversary was not above taunting them damn her whoever she is she had to be someone either in high court circles herself or with connections there there was no other way that she could have known that the man had been arrested much less that he had been taken to a particular city gaol there were three main gaols after all and a dozen lesser ones never mind the many church gaols he could have been in any of them and the king has not called for you once since my attack harperus pursed his lips unhappily he was displeased by nightingale or is he displeased with your performances not at all tfyrr replied bitterly he made a point of thanking her for coming the day after you were attacked no the reason is that he has a new toy to intrigue him i am no longer a novelty i have been subverted it seems by my good friend lord atrovel harperus raised an eyebrow i had heard nothing of this he said what new toy and i thought lord atrovel liked you tfyrr sighed and flexed his feet again he doesbut he cannot resist a challenge and the head of the manufactory guild set him one do you recall that box of yours that plays music the one that theovere has hinted he would like the one that we will not give him because taking it apart would give these people too many secrets we do not want them to have harperus responded only too well why what of it that is what lord atrovel was challenged to reproduce tfyrr told his friend sourly and he did it too as harperus eyebrows shot toward his hairline tfyrr amended the statement it is not a recording device nor is it small enough to sit on a table it would filloh a quarter of the room here it is entirely mechanical mostly of clockwork so far as i can tell entirely humanmade and requires a page to push pedals with his feet around and around to power it he brooded on his mechanical rival i suppose it is a kind of superior musicbox it has more than one instrument though and three puppets to simulate playing them there is an enameled birdmuch prettier than ithat sings the tunes accompanied by a puppet harpist flute player and a puppet that plays an instrument made of tuned bells it is all instrumental of coursewhich means no awkward lyrics to remind theovere of much of anything youve seen it then harperus asked how not it was presented in open court two days after your injury with more ceremony than you made with me tfyrr stopped flexing his feet he was cutting gouges in the floor it plays exactly one hundred of theoveres favorite songs which he can select at will harperus looked impressed in spite of himself i had not thought they had that much ability tfyrr only ground his beak it was pointedly said during the presentation that the device will always play exactly whatever song is desired and play it in precisely the same way every single time this i suppose to contrast it with me who may not cooperate in the choice of music who sometimes sings things that make theovere uncomfortable and who never sings the same song in the same way twice in a row harperus pondered the implications of that theovere may be tiring of the novelty of working against his advisors he may be recalling that responsibility is work and he may be weary of hearing me sing about those who take their responsibilities seriously tfyrr sighed i did not want to tell you about this but since theovere still seems enamored with his toy i am afraid that i have been supplanted for the foreseeable future i have not precisely been demoted from my rank but i am no longer a novelty even with nightingale to accompany me i have not been called for in more than a week harperus rubbed his temple for a moment his face creased with worry i am not certain that i care for the timing of all this within a day of the attacks on both of us the manufactory guild presents theovere with a new toy does that indicate anything rather nasty to you that they thought either one or both of us might be removed from play and had their own distraction ready tfyrr countered of course it occurred to me it could simply be good timing on their part howeveror they could have been holding this toy back waiting for the best opportunity to present it there is no point in assuming a conspiracybut there is no point in discounting one either i wish that you were in place to collect court gossip it would be nice to know one way or another harperus picked fretfully at the comforter covering his body and here i am incapacitated trust me tyladen is doing all he can he has responsibilities you are not aware of he is not a coward he simply cannot do his job and mine as well i will believe it if you say it tfyrr told him finally though i doubt you would get nightingale to believe it she is not terribly fond of tyladen and has called him a spider sitting snug in a safe web more than once i am not sure she cares for deliambrens at all right now tyladen hasnt done much about the troubles in lyonarie either i have more bad news from outside the palace i am afraid there is more unrest in the city the situation is deteriorating for nonhumans more beatings slogans written on the walls of nonhuman homes and businesses vandalism gang ambushes outside freehold more attacks harperus started to get up and fell back against his pillows again turning a stark white damn he swore with uncharacteristic vehemence why must i be confined to my bed at a time like this tfyrr only shook his head i have been spending more and more time in freehold with nightingale we have been trying to do what we can with the tools at our disposal at least there we can do some good our music is heard and the message in it you are preaching to the choir harperus reminded him no one goes into freehold that is not on the side of the nonhumans tfyrr could not reply to that he knew only too well that it was true but the message he and nightingale were placing in their music was a complicated one and one he thought would have some effect on those who might otherwise not take a stand but would rather stand aside he hoped anyway there were plenty of those visitors to freehold out of curiosity or those who only came occasionally it may be that what they need is a leader and one has not stepped forward thus far i had hoped tyladen would be that leader but i fear he is a weak branch to land that eyas on harperus would but he is not physically able which leavesus i could do with a better prospect i must go he said finally ill probably be staying there tonight again its safer than flying back even after dark ill tell nob to come here and help you as usual at least nob would be safer with harperus than alone in tfyrrs suite especially now that harperus had raided his travelingwagon for more protective devices tyladen had actually ventured out of freehold to fetch the mechanisms and to set them up in harperus roomwhile old owl was well enough in mind and spirit after his ordeal he needed someone to look after him so nob could be useful and protected by staying with the deliambren right now tfyrr would be much happier if he were working alonebut since that was impossible better to get those who were not flying the attack under cover of the trees thank you harperus said with real gratitude the boy is an endless help im thinking of checking where he came from and offering to purchase his services if he hasnt any parents about we can use young humans like him in the fortresscity what in yourah what did you call it the exchange program tfyrr asked getting up from his stool hed be good there he has an open mind and a clever one and i have to keep restraining him from taking apart your devices to see how they work harperus held up a hand just as tfyrr began to walk toward the door wait a moment please you and nightingale he began what is he going to try to interfere there now i think not tfyrr shook his head and began an annoyed retort but harperus waved his hand before he could begin to form it no no i dont mean to tell you to leave her alonedear stars thats the last thing id want for either of you tfyrr relaxed a little at that and harperus continued with an expression of concern on his face i just want to know ifif you are weathering these stresses as a couple i want to know that the two of you are still together and not being torn apart by the situation better than we would alone tfyrr said softly much much better than we would alone she is the one unreservedly good thing that has happened to me since i came here i tell her so at least twice a day harperus smiled his odd eyes warming with the smile good good i feel rather paternal about both of you you know i have known her for most of her lifeand if it were not for me you would not be in the twenty kingdoms at all he hesitated a moment as if deciding whether or not to say something then continued i want you to know that whatever i can do for both of you i will you have both been involved in situations you would never have had to deal with if it were not for me i am very very pleased that the two of you have found happiness in each other tfyrr looked down on the deliambren sensing nothing there but sincerity i think i knew that he said finally but thank you anyway he shook himself rousing all his feathers and bits of fluff and feather sheath flew through the air now i must go nightingale is waiting and we have work in the city even if i have none here harperus nodded and tfyrr took himself out via harperus balcony it was safer that way he no longer trusted even the corridors and hallways of the palace he no longer made a target of himself by flying low over the city he gained altitude while he was still over the palace grounds taking himself quickly out of the range of conventional weaponry he would drop down out of the sky in a stoop once he was directly over freehold landing on the roof though never twice in exactly the same place he hoped that this made him less of a target for projectiles from the other roofs although a skilled hunter could probably track him in and hit him he tried not to think about that he was no longer the only target in this city he had not wanted to worry harperus further by giving him details of the troubles in lyonarie but it was no longer safe for most nonhumans to walk alone in certain districts even by dayand by night they must not only go in large groups but they must go armed with such weapons as the laws permitted them some of them had gotten immensely clever with weighted clubs tough leather jackets and things that could legitimately be considered their tools they were harassed and attacked by pairs and large gangs of bravos armed with clubs there had been no deathsyetbut at least a hundred males two dozen females and a handful of children of various nonhuman races had wound up with broken bones or concussions that was not even detailing the beatings that left only bruises or simple harassment or vandalism nor was harperus attacker the only escapee from justice in the kings gaols even when attackers and vandals were identified and brought to justice the very next day they would no longer be in the gaol some were released by accident some released when other parties posted bonds and some simply slipped away there were ugly rumors in the streets making even ordinary folk look angry whenever nonhumans were mentioned one of those rumors claimed that the manufactory guild planned to release all of the human workers and import nonhumans since they were not subject to the laws of the church as miserable as working conditions were inside those buildings apparently having any job was better than being out of work and the folk who filled those mills and tended the machinery were looking blackly at any nonhuman who crossed their paths other rumors were wilder less believable yet some people believed them that the nonhumans had a new religion that required each new initiate to sacrifice a human child and eat it that they were spreading diseases deliberately among the humans to weaken or kill them softening up lyonarie for future conquest that the deliambrens were going to bring in a huge invulnerable flying ship and from it lay waste to the twenty kingdoms turning each of the kingdoms over to a specific nonhuman race and making the humans into slaves as if wed want humans as slaves theyd make poor slaves not as strong as a mintak not as versatile as a jrrad not as obedient as a fenboi they are too selfdetermined strongwilled and clever to be slaves the spirit that makes them poor slaves is what makes them good friends tfyrr reached the top of his arc turned and plunged downward again his goal a tiny speck among the rest of the rooftops below him wind rushed past his face tore at his feathers thundered in his ears he brought the nictating membranes over his eyes to protect them at this speed striking a gnat or a speck of dust could bring much pain and temporary blindness that last rumor was interesting since it had just enough truth to supply a seed for the falsehood the deliambrens were bringing in a huge flying ship the platform from which they were doing their intensive survey it wasnt armed couldnt be armed in fact nor was it invulnerable it leaked air like a sieve and couldnt go much higher than treetop level but it did exist and to the ignorant it must look frightening enough it was certainly larger than most villages and many small towns and the vast array of nonhumans swarming over it might be taken for an army the strange surveying instruments often looked like weapons and the engines that bore it up in the air did sometimes flatten things below that was one of the reasons for getting the high kings blanket permission to mount the expedition to keep people from panicking at the sight of it thinking it was a military operation as for turning humans into nonhuman slaves now that was a clever twisting of the truth since that was precisely what some of the humans were trying to do to the nonhumans in their midst the law of degree would do that very nicely the rooftop of freehold rushed up toward him filling his vision he flared his wings at the last possible moment and the air wrenched them open as if theyd been grabbed by a giant and pulled apart he flipped forward in midair extending his legs toward the rooftop as he flared his tail as an additional brake his feet touched the surface he collapsed his wings and dropped down into a protective crouch glaring all around him for possible enemies as usual there werent any as usual he was not willing to take the chance that there might be some neither was nightingale she slipped out of the shelter of one of the cowlings covering some of freeholds enormous machines but stayed within reach of other such machinery as she joined him but for one transcendent moment all caution and fear was cast aside as they embraced as always ah my bright love my singing bird my winged heartshe could not hear the endearments he whispered to her in his mind but he knew she certainly felt the emotion that came with them whatever happened they had this between thema joy he had never expected to find if tomorrow a hunters arrow found him he would go to the winds with a prayer of thanks for having had this much anything new he asked into the sweet darkness of her hair more of the same she replied into his breast feathers ill tell you inside they sprinted for the door to the roof hand in hand but ducking to remain out of the line of sight of possible snipers once they were safely on the staircase she sighed and gave him the news outright sabotage this time she said three incidents all uncovered this morning someone burned down a lashanowned bakery the printing presses at kalian bindery were smashed the page proofs and manuscripts there were burned and the type cases overturned all over the floor and the furnaces at the new ursi glassworks werejust blown up they say that no more than two bricks out of every five will be salvageable how tfyrr asked astonished that doesnt sound like anything a human could do she shrugged tyladen has some theory about pouring water into the furnaces while they were hot i dont know but do you see a pattern there he nodded living at the palace as he was he would be the first to see it the glassworks was in the process of making a special telescope for theovere as a presentation piece on behalf of the deliambren expedition kalian bindery was putting together a library of nonhuman songs in translationas a presentation piece for theovere and the bakery makes those honeyspice cakes he likes so much that his own cooks at the palace cant seem to duplicate all three places with projects on behalf of theovere or meant to impress him and gain his favor she agreed as they wound their way down the stairs toward the ground floor his talons clicking on the stair steps and only someone at court would know that just as you have been saying he ground his beak thinking the man harperus identified escaped last night as well and everyone who has escaped has done so from the high kings city prisons not the church prisons or the city gaols she turned to look at him with her eyes wide whythats right the few criminals we have managed to hold onto were all in the city gaols that argues for more than an informant he said his eyes narrowing with concentration that argues for cooperation at the very least from an official probably a high official likely an advisor she didnt groan but he sensed her spirits plummeting how can we possibly counteract someone with that much power she asked in a small voice he felt her fear she was not used to opposition at so high a level she had always been the one to run when opposition grew too intense he understood that and in the past it had made sense for her to do that she was a gypsy she could go anywhere so why remain someplace where an authority wanted to make trouble for her but she could not do that nowand more importantly neither could all the nonhuman citizens not only of lyonarie but of the twenty kingdoms if they were going to do what he had decided must be doneto give the nonhumans here the leader they so urgently desperately neededhe had to put some heart in her he stopped seized her by the shoulders and looked deeply into her eyes think nightingale think of how much damage has been done in the past few daysas if our enemy was desperately trying to do as much damage as he can before he is caught or rendered ineffective i think he is desperate that although theovere may be wrapped up in his new toy the novelty of it cant last forever sooner or later he will grow tired of the same songs played the same way and look for us again what is more i think the magic we set in motion is still working and theovere is coming back to himself whether or not he likes the fact and i think our enemy knows that too i believe he is at the end of his resources and hes hoping to overwhelm us now before theovere recovers she nightingale said our enemy may be a female remember the lace handkerchiefs left in cells the woman who seduced the guard a womans been seen in other places as well just before things happened she then he or she or they it doesnt matter much there may be two working in collusionwhoever it is i sense the desperation of a hunterturnedhunted he waited for nightingales reaction it was slow in coming but gradually the fear within her ebbed and she nodded now lets get down to the street collect tyladens friends and go about our business tfyrr continued after first embracing her father ruthvere is waiting for us it is time for us to act instead of waiting for something to happen to us and reacting to that what are you thinking of she asked sharply we need to provide these people with more than a message he told her slowly thinking things out as he spoke we need to give them something more than words tyladen wont do it and harperus cant youre saying they need a leader she said and to his relief she did not seem as upset at that as he had feared she would be i had a feeling you were finally going to decide thatand i was afraid you would decide it should be us she shivered a little then shook herself im also afraid that youre right if no one has come forward yet no one is going to it will have to be us or no one she looked up into his eyes standing quite still making no secret of the fact that she was afraid but also making it very clear that she was with him he embraced her impulsively great power he reminded her yes is great responsibility she sighed i think i would prefer being a simple musicianbut on the other hand this may be the payback for all those times i charmed my way out of trouble she leaned into his breast feathers for a moment then pushed herself gently away well if we are going to do it lets get it over with he smiled and took her hand leadership once assumed cannot always be released are you willing to accept that as well lover nightingale nodded again eyes suddenly clear of worry as readily as i accepted you into my heart and soul three days later tfyrr stood in a most unfamiliar placethe pulpit of father ruthveres chapeland surveyed the closely packed faces below him there was no room to stand in the chapel people were crowded in right to the doors roughly half of those faces were not human but it was the human faces among the rest that gave him hope that this might work he cleared his throat and the quiet murmur of voices below him ceased behind him nightingale sent a wordless wave of encouragement to him which held him in an embrace that did not need arms or wings they were going to try something different today bardic magic without a melody a spell of courage and hope meant to reinforce his message and give them the strength to take advantage of the leadership he promised them with luck it would work with none we will fall flat on our faces i asked father ruthvere to call some of you here on my behalf he said slowly allowing his eyes to travel over the entire group assembled below some of you are friends or patrons of freehold some are simply merchants and workers all of you are people of good will and open minds i ask you all to open your minds a little further for i have a message that may shock you there is an enemy of all of us human and nonhuman working in this city and he is working to enslave us he waited for a moment for them to take that in then continued our enemy is skilled cunning and devious our enemys weapons are clever the chief of them is fear he spreads rumors to increase that fear and divide us each rumor carefully calculated to prey upon the things that we all fear most he looked directly into the eyes of a clutch of human manufactory workers fear of poverty he said to them fear of failure fear of a future full of uncertainty and he knew that he had struck home when he saw their eyes widen he turned toward a group of families human and not who lived near the chapel the terrible fears that all parents of whatever race have for their children this bolt too struck the heart as the hands of fathers tightened on their childrens shouldersmothers arms closed protectively around their babies he swept his gaze over them all these fears divide us each from the other he told them they make us fear each other and keep us from talking to each other let me tell you who are human what rumors have been circulating among our homes and workplaces he told them about the law of degree about the other rumors flying wildly among the nonhuman communities he added some he had heard elsewherehow a demonworshiping human sect had sprung up whose initiates must murder and eat a nonhuman child and how the humans were planning to descend on the homes and workplaces of nonhumans on a particular night to burn and pillage them killing adults and making children into pets and slaves he added the rumors of drugs in the water supply that would kill or incapacitate nonhumans but were harmless to humans and the stories that there were those within the church who planned to declare all nonhumans to be demons or descended of demons he saw by the startled looks among the humans that they had heard nothing of these talesand as he and nightingale wove their web of courage and clarity he saw that they were all beginning to think comparing the rumors and finding them suspiciously similar do you see what is happening he asked them can you see the hand of one source behind all of this how could these tales be so similar and yet so cleverly tailored to match our darkest nightmares and how else could someone keep all of us from even speaking to one another except by making us fear one another then he challenged them can you think why someone would do this what would he have to gain ask yourself thatfor there is gain to be had here in making us fear each other in keeping us hiding in the darkness of our homes and listening only to rumors and wild tales he chose his next words with care for all that i am strange to you who are human i am a student of your history i have seen this pattern repeated beforein your history and in our own for we are not as different from you as you may think we have had our tyrants our exploiters our wouldbe dictators here is what i have seen over and over again when people are divided against one another there is always a third party standing ready and waiting to profit when both sides have preyed so much upon each other that they cannot withstand the third sometimes it is another land another people but i do not think that is the case here he took a deep breath and made the plunge i think that the third party here is a single person a person who would see both humans and nonhumans enslaved to his purposes first he drives fear enough into the humans that they grant him the power he needs to make slaves of the nonhumans then he turns that power upon those who gave it to him and enslaves everyone there were a few nods out there only a few but that much was encouraging the rest would need time to think about what he was saying ponder this if you will he finished how soon would it be before something like a law of degree was applied not only to those who do not look human but to those who do not meet some other standard when have any of you ever seen a law that took away the freedom of one group used only against that group how about if our unknown enemy convinced you all that it should be applied to the indigentstreet trash beggars and the like it sounds reasonable does it not and who would really choose to have beggars and slackards sleeping in doorways if they could be out doing useful workand at least as slaves they would not be drinking robbing causing trouble in the street but how if after a delay of time to make it comfortable it was then applied to those whosaydo not own property after all if you do not own your home are you not indigent what if it were applied to those who did not have a business were not in a guild or happened not to have a job at a particular moment after all if you have lost your job are you not indigent startled looks all around the room showed him that he had not only caught their attention he had brought up something they had never in their wildest dreams thought of very probably the majority of the humans here only rented their tiny livingquarters from someone elseand every manufactory worker lived in fear of losing his job before you dismiss these truths as fantasy remember that every one of you who has been robbed cheated or rapedor knows someone who has human or nonhumanknows that there are those in our world who are capable of such evils remember that it is fear that makes all this possible he concluded fear which keeps us from organizing from questioning to find out the truth which keeps us divided human from nonhuman men from women those who are prosperous from those who are not remember that go and think and talk and ask questions and then if you will come back to father ruthvere he is a man of caring and courage and he has tasks that need doing to make certain that this enemy does not take all our freedom away from us he stepped down from the pulpit then in an aura of stunned silence and father ruthvere stepped back up into it then the talk broke out an avalanche of words as those of the chapel and those who were not cast questions up to father ruthvere and he answered them as best he could his best was fairly accurate since he nightingale and tfyrr had been talking about this for the past three days gathering all the information they could and putting this little meeting together they had decided that father ruthvere and not tfyrr should be the putative leader of this group he was human and would be trusted by the humanshe was a man of the church and presumably honorable and above reproach not that the real leader would not be tfyrr or rather the real target i am the obvious target leaving father ruthvere to do his work fortunately the father was honorable and above reproach and he was trained to be a leader of his flock he had the skills tfyrr did not tfyrr had the skills of rhetoric that he did not perhaps rather than the leader i should style myself as a figurehead or perhaps an organizer oh no i believe i like nightingales term better rabblerouser but standing behind the pulpit and filling the choir loft was another group that tfyrr and nightingale turned to faceas many of father ruthveres fellow churchmen as could be gathered together here at such short notice tfyrr had not had a chance to look them over before he stepped up to make his speech but now he saw that among the grey black and brown robes there were two men dressed in the red robes of justiciars two men and a woman in the deeper burgundy of justiciar mages and one ironfaced individual in the white and purple robes of a bishop his hackles rose for just a moment at thatbut a heartbeat later he smoothed them down while the face of this man might be implacable his eyes were warm and full of approval he had heard tfyrr out and he seemed to like what he heard he knows the truth when he hears it he is hard and cannot be shaken but he is no fanatic he knows reason he does not let fear blind him and he is no ones tool or fool it was this man who approached them first while nightingale swallowed and groped for tfyrrs hand he clasped it reassuringly the bishops eyes flickered down to their joined hands as the motion caught his attention then they returned to tfyrrs face with no less warmth in them than before and he sees nothing wrong with a human and one who is not being together that alone shows more of an open mind than i had dared to hope for you are a remarkable speaker musician the old man said in a surprisingly powerful and musical voice your command of rhetoric is astounding tfyrr bowed a little acknowledging the compliment it is not just rhetoric my lord bishop he said in reply every word i spoke was the truth all of it information gathered not only across this city but across the twenty kingdoms that is what makes it astounding the bishop said with a hint of a smile rhetoric and the truth seldom walk sidebyside much less handinhand and that was what i wished to ask you for some of those rumors i had not heard in this city so the poison spreads elsewhere tfyrr nodded and the bishop pursed his lips thoughtfully that seems to match some things that i have observed within the church he mused andi believe i agree with you and your friends there is a force moving to destroy our freedoms a secular force but one with fingers into all aspects of life including the church would you not agree ardis he called over his shoulder the woman in the robes of the justiciar mages stepped forward regarding tfyrr with eyes that were remarkably like that of a haspurclear direct and uncompromising i would agree my lord bishop she said in a challenging voice as remarkable as the bishops that in fact was why i was visiting my friend ruthvere his letters indicated to me that there were some of the same elements moving in lyonarie as had been at work in kingsford just before the fire that destroyed our city i wanted to see if that was the case and do something to prevent a similar tragedy if i could a thread of excitement traced its way down tfyrrs back but it did not come from him but from nightingale she knew something about this womansomething important he would have to ask her later but then the woman turned her eyes toward nightingale and said in a tone as gentle as her voice had been challenging before please tell my good cousin talaysen that i miss his companyand far more than his company his wisdom and his gentle wit and if his king can spare him for a month or two i have need of both in kingsford it need not be soon but it should be within a year or so nightingale bowed her head in deepest respectsomething tfyrr had never seen her do before to anyone i shall my lady priest she replied i believe that i can send him word that will reach him before the month is out i will tell him to direct his reply to you with all speed the justiciar mage smiled i had thought as much she said and turned back to the bishop my noble lord are you satisfied now that ruthvere and i told you nothing less than the truth more than satisfiedi am in fact convinced that there is more amiss than even you guessed he extended his hand to tfyrr who took ita little confused since he was not certain if he was to shake it or bow over it the bishop solved his quandary by simply clasping it firmly with no sign that the alien feel of the talon disturbed him sire tfyrr i thank you for your courage and your integrityand your dedication rest assured that there are enough men and women of god in the church to take the reins of the situation there and bring it under control i wish that i could promise you help in the secular world as well but i fear it will be all our forces can muster to cleanse our own house at least you need not look for attack on one front he let go of tfyrrs hand then and turned toward the rest of the priests my brothers and sistersit is now our task to go and do just that let us be off with that he strode through the group which parted before him and formed up behind him and led the way to the priests door at the rear of the choir loft they were remarkably well organized and regimented within moments they were all gone with no milling about or confusion he glanced over at nightingale what was that business with the woman all about he asked nightingale shivered but not from any sense of fear more of a sense of awe a reaction he had not expected a priest to invoke in her lady ardis is master wrens cousin she said quietly talaysen trusts her more than anyone else in the world i think i knew she was a priest but i didnt know she was a justiciar mage they may be the strongest mages in the twenty kingdomsand i know that they are the best schooled could you hear the power in her now that he thought about it there had been a deep and resonant melody about her though not of the kind he associated with bardic magic not precisely droningmore like the kind of chant that he recalled from nightingales healing magic but stronger richer with multiple voices he nodded ive never heard anyone like that nightingale continued never with power like that she doesnt need rank in fact high rank would only get in her way exultation crept into her voice and shes on our side oh tfyrr this is the best thing that could have happened to us father ruthvere turned his head toward them for a moment between ardis and the lord bishop we do not need to worry about the church aiding our enemy i think he said his voice sounding more relaxed and confident than in the past several days as the bishop said this means one less front to guard it means that i have leave to do whatever i can to help you including offering you the sanctuary of the church if you need it and it means one less ally for our enemy tfyrr added but father ruthvere was not finished i do have another concern that lady ardis presence reminded me of there is one other thing i believe you have not made accounting for he said and worry entered his voice again magic our enemy has not been able to silence you by direct attack or by indirect that leaves magic ardis and her companions cannot stay for they will be needed in kingsford and there are no justiciar mages in lyonarie who can devote themselves to your protection magic that was one thing he had not counted on he had witnessed so little magic in his life and most of it was of the subtler sort the kind that nightingale used but what can they do he asked puzzled surely anything magical can be countered but nightingales hand had tightened on his own spasmodically they can do quite a bit tfyrr she said hesitantly if they have a powerful enough mage i have seen real magic the kind that the deliambrens do not believe exists if i told you some of what i have witnessed you would not believe it either i think perhaps i had better call in someone i had not intended to ask favors of he shrugged unconvinced if you will he said you know more about this than i do but in the meantime i will not be stopped we have momentum now and we must keep it going any hesitation at this moment will bring everything to a standstill father ruthvere nodded agreement and turned his attention back to the assembled group below the crowd had thinned somewhat but those remaining were the leaders of their own little coteries and all of them human and nonhuman seemed inspired to work together we need to get back to freehold tfyrr said in an aside to nightingale as the bells in the tower overhead chimed the hour we still have the meeting there this afternoon that will be as much your meeting as mine she knew the folk of freehold the customers the staff she knew them the way he never could for she had been reading their feelings for the past several weeks he might be able to make a fine speech to rouse those who were unaware of what was going on around them but for those of freehold who knew only too well the rumors circulating the harassment and the sabotage it would take another skill to rouse their courage and show them that they must work togetherthat they literally dared not stand aside at this moment she squeezed his hand i think father ruthvere has this end well in hand she agreed lets go perhaps tfyrr didnt realize it but nightingale knew only too well how much of a target he had made himself he was the obvious focal point of this new organization he was the kings personal musician the one who came and went from the palace who presumably had the kings ear at least part of the time on his own he had no more power or wealth than any of the denizens of the neighborhoods around freehold but they didnt know that the folk of the streets saw only that here was a powerful courtier a sire no less who was urging them to stand up for their freedom and their rights against the nobles the fearful or uneducated and this unknown enemy and ruthvere had been absolutely right their enemy had tried every other way to eliminate tfyrrs influence and that had been before he went on his campaign to organize the nonhumans and their human supporters and friends now he was not only an influence he was a danger he reminded them all that the twenty kings the court and the high king himself ruled only as long as the people permitted it those were frightening words to someone whose ultimate goal was surely more power if there was one thing that the powerful feared it was that those they sought to rule discovered that ultimately the real power lay only in their own acquiescence to be ruled lions can only be convinced that they are sheep as long as no one holds up a mirror to show them their true faces all attempts to silence tfyrr open and covert had failed but their foe had not yet tried magic if ever there was a time when he or she nightingale reminded herself yet again or she would use magic it was now they had a little time before the freehold meeting and nightingale used it tfyrr was in the bathroom and he was a most enthusiastic bather he would be in there for some time giving her a space all to herself she settled herself crosslegged on her bed as tfyrr splashed water all over her bathroom and laid her right wrist in her lap the thin band of elven silver gleamed beneath the lights of her room a circlet of starlight or moonlight made solid she had been given a gift she had thought could it be that it was not a gift after all but a promise the elves had a flexible view of time sometimes their vision slipped ahead of human visionseeing not what would be but all of the possibilities of what might be and sometimes when one was markedly better than the rest they would move to see that it came to pass no one with ambition for ruling all the twenty kingdoms could afford to let the elves live in peace she thought soberly they are too random an element unpredictable and unreliable and most of all ungovernable whoever this person is he cannot allow the elves to remain within human borders so perhaps that is why the second bracelet came to me she laid her left hand over the warm circle of silver and closed her eyes as she held her mind in stillness listening she caught the distant melody of elven magic so utterly unlike any other music except that of the gypsies she added her own to it brought it in and strengthened it it must carry her message for her and it had a long long way to travel she sang to it deep within her mind weaving her words into the melody to be read by every elf that encountered it the more that knew the better first her name which was more than just a name it was the signature of her own power her history and her place among her elven allies bird of song and bird of night she sang healing hands and eyeless sight bird of passage elven friend walks the road without an end pass the wall that has no door sail the sea that has no shore no one but the elves would know what threefourths of that meant it was all in riddles and allusions and if there was anything that the elves loved it was the indirect there was more of it and she sang it all one did not scant on ceremony with the elves especially not with their high king he might have been her lover oncebut that had been a long time ago before he became their high king it had been nothing more than a moments recreation for him and scarcely more for her he had been the ease after ravena physical release she had beenamusement later she became more than that once he learned of her power and heard her play that was what had made her an elven friend not the idyll amid the pillows of his most private bower but that was part of her history with them and she could not leave it out without insulting him when she came to the end of her name she began the message first a condensation of everything she had learned here beginning with the fact that it was the elves who had asked her to come here in the first place and lastly her request a simple one it was couched in complicated rhyme but the essence was not at all complicated i may need you and your magic and if i do my need will be a desperate one you know me you know that i would not ask this frivolously if i call will you come she had not expected an answer immediately she had no idea after all how far this message would have to travel or how many times it would be debated in the elven councils before a reply was vouchsafed her she had most definitely not expected a simple answer she had never gotten a simple answer more than a handful of times in all the years she had known them so when she sent the message out and sat for a moment with her mind empty and her hand still clasping her bracelet it was not with any expectation of something more than a moment of respite before tfyrr emerged from his bath but she got far more than she had reckoned on the spell of music and message she had sent out had been a delicate braided band of silver and shadow the reply caught her unawares and wrapped her in a rushing wind spun her around in a dizzying spiral of steelstrong starlight surrounded her with bared blades of ice and moonbeams and sang serenely into her heart in a voice of trumpets and the pounding sea and all of it a simple single word yes when tfyrr emerged from the bathroom he found her still shaking with reaction and the certainty that if their reply had been so ready and so simple there must be a reason so she sat and trembled and she could not even tell him why she could only smile and tell him it was nothing to worry about she moved through the day holding onto each moment savoring every scrap of time with himbut trying her best to act as if nothing had changed between them he knew there was something wrong of course but she was able to convince him that it was only her own fears getting the best of her she told him that she would be all right and she bound herself up in the rags of her courage and went on with all their plans but when the blow came as she had known it would it still came as a shock he had spent the night at the palace hoping for a summons from the high king but not really expecting one she was expecting him in midmorning as always she sensed his wild surge of delight as he took to the air and went to the roof to await his arrival she shaded her eyes with her hand and peered upwards into the blue and cloudless sky even though she knew she would never see him up there it would take the eyes of an eagle to pick out the tiny dot up there if shed had a hawk on her wrist it might have looked up and hunched down on her fist feathers slicked down in fear all of its instincts telling it that a huge eagle flew up there nothing less than a hawks keen senses would find tfyrr in the hot blue sky until the moment he flattened out his dive into a landing but she always looked anyway she was looking up when the blow struck her heart and she collapsed onto the baked surface of the roof breath caught in her throat mouth opened in a soundless cry of anguish it was pain the mingling of a hundred fears a wash of dizziness and a wave of darkness she could not breathecould not see she blacked out for a moment but fought herself free of the tangling shroud of unconsciousness and dragged herself back to reality with the sure knowledge that her worst nightmare had come to pass they had taken tfyrr snatched him out of the sky by magic and there was nothing that anyone could have done to prevent it for the sky was the one place where they had thought he was safe tfyrr was gone youre sure tyladen said for the tenth time she bit her lip and said nothing shed already told him everything there was to say at least three times over but harperus who had a listening device of his own growled at both of them from his room in the palace his voice coming through a box on tyladens desk of course she is sure you fool didnt i just tell you that he left here an hour ago he went straight from my balconyand he was going directly to freehold if nightingale says he was kidnapped then you can take it as fact bbut magic tyladen stuttered how can you kidnap someone with something that doesnt these people believe that what we do is magic child harperus interrupted if you must assume its a different technology for all we know thats exactly what it is just accept it and have done nightingale what can we do if anything she had thought this out as best she could given that her stomach was in knots her throat sore from the sobs she would not give way to and her heart ready to burst with grief and fear i dont know yet she said honestly im not certain how you can combat magic i have to do something myselfi was promised help from the elves and im going to get that help when i am through talking to you i think that i can find tfyrr myself or at least find the general area where hes being held after thati may need some of your devices if there are any that could find exactly where he is in a limited area she had some vague notion there were devices that could probably do that some deliambren equivalent of a bloodhound but that those devices probably had a limited range they couldnt scour the whole city for her but if she could give them a small area they might be able to narrow down the search to a specific building i do need someone to watch the high king and the advisors around him father ruthvere will provide sanctuary if we are being hunted from the palace or by someone connected with the palace but i need to be warned if someone comes up with a charge against us if you can think of anything i will take care of it harperus promised nowyou go do what you can i will then her voice did break on a sob as she told him the one thing she did know old owl wherever he is hes hurt hes hurt badly i dont know how badly but all i can feel from him is pain harperus swore in his own language a snarl of pure rage she had never heard him so angry in her life go he urged this youngster and i will work together she rubbed at her burning eyes with the back of her hand got up from her seat pushed open the office door halfblinded with tears and fled up the stairs to her room she had not yet called in her promise from the elves and she needed to prepare the room before she could do that the elves did not care for the human cities and did not like to walk among the artificial buildings but it seemed that for her sake they would put their dislikes aside she put the bed up into the wall and pushed all the furniture out of the way she put her harps in the bathroom she swept every vestige of dust and dirt from the floor so that it was as white and shiny as the day the surface was laid only then did she lay ready the circle with a thin trickle of blue sand on the white floor inscribing a pattern that the elven mage she had been pledged service from would be able to use as a target then she stood outside the circle clasped her hand around her bracelet and let her heart cry out a wordless wail of anguish and a plea for help the air in her room vibrated with a single deep tone like the groaning of the earth in an earthquake the floor sang a harmonic note to the air the walls a second the ceiling a third the whole room humming with a fourpart chord of dreadful power then the blue sand exploded upward in a puff of displaced air she did not recognize the elven mage who stood where the circle had been blinking slowly at her with his amber eyes slitted against the light his hair was as amber as his eyes his clothing of deep black silk a simple tunic and trews without ornamentation or embroidery of any kind by that she knew he was more powerful than any elven mage she had ever yet met only a mage of great power would be confident enough to do without the trappings of power tell me bird of night he said as calmly as if he had not appeared out of thin air in her room so alien to his kind as serenely as if he had not heard the tears of her heart calling tell me what you need of me she told him in the same words that she had told tyladen and harperus and it did not get any easier to bear for the retelling he nodded and waited for her to answer his second question from you my lord i need protection she said protection from the spells of human mages for myself and for the one who once wore this she handed the elf a feather shed only yesterday from tfyrrs wing he took it and smoothed it between his fingers a magemusician with wings in truth he said as his eyes took on the appearance of one who is gazing into the far distance but he is in a place that is dark to me i cannot find him i can find him she said promptly but i cannot protect myself from the magics that stole him nor can i protect him from the spells of our enemy once i find him i can the elven mage replied with a lifted brow there is no mortal born who can set a spell that can break my protections if those protections are set with consent she nodded understanding his meaning with consent the mage was not limited to his own power in setting a protection he could draw upon the strength of the spirit of the one he protected as well you have mine she promised him instantly and you will have his once i reach him then i will be away the mage replied and as she widened her eyes in alarm he smiled thinly fear not i do not desert you nor shall i travel far but i must go to a place more congenial to my kind your walls and metals interfere with my working i have his feather you have your silver that will be enough when you need the protections clasp your hand about the band of silver and call me he regarded her with an unwinking gaze and then added i am fioreth she bowed slightly acknowledging the fact that he had given her part of his name enough to call him with it was a tremendous act of trust on the part of an elf he bowed in return then the room hummed a fourfold chord of power once more and he was gone now there was only one thing left to do find him the pain in her heart had a direction north and a little east she needed to follow that someone pounded at her door and before she could answer it the door flew open lady gasped one of the younger serving boys panting with the effort of running up four flights of stairs lady there are guards at the door and they want you they say they have a warrant what colors are they wearing she asked instantly the boy blinked at her for a moment obviously thinking that she was crazy green and blue but then they arent the high kings men theyre someones private guards she replied they cant have a warrant they probably just have a piece of paper to wave counting on the rest of us not to know it has to be signed and sealed since im tfyrrs second they would have to have a warrant signed by theovere directly and he would have sent his own bodyguards tell tyladen to demand the warrant and if it isnt signed and sealed with theoveres seal it isnt valid that should delay them and tell him to tell harperus before the boys scandalized eyes she stripped off her skirts give me your breeches she ordered what he gasped your breeches i cant climb in skirts now she put enough of the power in her order that he obeyed her blushing to the roots of his hair and she pulled his breeches on leaving him to look frantically for something to cover himself with which is ridiculous hes wearing more now than some of the male dancers wear on stage go she snapped at him running for the stairs to the roof tell tyladen what i just told you she didnt wait to see how he solved his embarrassing quandary time was not on her side the king cant know about this that means that this arrest is on a trumpedup charge at worst that means i wont have to dodge every guard in the city only the ones in blueandgreen livery they would probably bully their way inside and might even get as far as her room before tyladen called in enough help to throw them out again and i left my harps but tfyrr was worth all the harps in the world the elves could make her a new pair of harps all the universe could not make her a new tfyrr she scampered across the roof in a bentover crouch in case someone was watching from one of the other rooftops when she got to the edge she scanned the area for a lookout there was one but he wasnt very good she spotted him before he saw her and commotion down on the street caught his attention long enough for her to get over the side away from him and down onto one of the walkways she paused just long enough to coil up her hair and knot it on top of her headthen from a distance she was just a gangly boy not a woman at all she stood up and shoved her hands in her pockets and strolled in a leisurely manner along the walkway until she got to the building across the street no shouts followed her and she did not sense any eyes on her for more than a disinterested few heartbeats she took care not to seem to be in any hurry she even stopped once to look down with interest at the milling knot of guards at the side door of freehold one or two of them looked up then ignored her then she reached the haven of the next building and threw her leg over the side of the roof there climbing up onto it rather than going down to street level just as if she had been sent on an errand over to freehold and was returning when she was reasonably certain that no one was watching her she sprinted across to the other side of the roof there was another walkway down the side of the building there and this one went all the way to the ground if you knew how to release the catch on the last staircase all freeholders of course did she careened down the metal staircase knocking painfully into the handrails and slipping on the steps in her hurry she tumbled down to the dropsteps hit the catch and let her weight take the steps down into the noisome alley below then at last she was in the street and it would take a better tracker than a nobles guard to find her chapter ten i had not known it was possible to hurt so much tfyrr had always thought that when you were injured you lost track of the lesser pains in the face of the greater evidently i was mistaken he thought far back in the fog of pain and background fear odd how it was possible to think rationally in the midst of the most irrational circumstances probably that ironic little mental voice would go right on commenting up until the moment he died since it seemed more likely that he would die of his many wounds rather than maddening hunger so tfyrr cataloged every pain every injury working inch by inch over his abused flesh in his mind he had to it was the only way he could keep himself sane as long as he had something to concentrate on in the face of darkness fear and the absolute certainty that not only did he not know where he was no one else did either he could stay marginally sane whoever had plucked him out of the sky at the height of his climb had known exactly what they were doing they were ready for him the moment he tumbled sick and disoriented onto the floor of the room they had brought him to he had not been able to raise so much as a single talon in his own defense magic they caught me in a magic net and dragged me down to their hiding place and to think i was laughing in my heart at nightingales irrational fear magic could do nothing to me of course it has no power over the physical world i wonder if i will get a chance to apologize to her before he could move four burly men had swarmed over him trussing him up like a dinnerfowl but they had more surprises in store for him they hooded me they hooded me like an unruly falcon the hood had to have been made to order as well there were no hunting birds out there with heads as large as tfyrrs maybe they were willing to kidnap him by magic but they werent counting on magic to keep him docile and someone somewhere made them a hood to fit a haspur not them i think they do not strike me as the sort to be falconers or they would know that hooding a raptor does not make him deaf or unconscious so someone somewhere probably in this city made them a hood that someone will know who they are if i can get free if i can pursue justice against them then to add insult to injury they had put some sort of contraption over his beak that kept him from opening or closing it completely a bit he thought combined with a muzzle it was somewhat difficult to be sure since they had put it on him after they hooded him padriks people only starved and beat me at least they didnt torture me like this they had already pulled all of his primaries the feather sockets ached any time he moved his wings they were working on the secondaries theyd clipped his talons until blood flowed in order to collect that as well this in addition to bruises and aching bones correction they werent exactly torturing him technically since that wasnt their intention whoever they are in fact he wasnt supposed to be alive at all the mages hired to steal him from the sky had been ordered to kill him on the spot theyd had a little argument about it while he lay there bound and hooded and helpless one of them had been in favor of carrying out their orders as stated but the rest had overruled him thank the winds for temptation and those unable to resist it he had heard them talking every word they might have been under the impression that he couldnt understand them rather than thinking that he was like a falcon and would go to sleep when deprived of light it seemed he was very useful to these mages and a source of much profit my blood and feathersand the talon bits too i supposeare valuable but only when taken from a living creature and therefore i am more valuable alive than dead i doubt their employer knows of this little trade on the side why bits of him should be useful to a mage he had no notionbut then again this situation was frighteningly similar to a rumor circulating about human mages who were capturing nonhumans and sacrificing them what if there were human mages who were capturing nonhumans but using bits of them for magic the idea would have made him sick if hed had the leisure to be sick do they do this to their own kind i wonder or is this reserved for lower creatures they were so indifferent to the amount of pain and damage they inflicted as they collected their trophies that he could well imagine they were not above kidnapping fellow humans and treating them the same way which might account for the rumors of nonhumans who captured humans and sacrificed them and would certainly account for the expertise with which hed been trussed up why was it that humans were inclined to spawn both the best saints and the worst villains among their numbers was it just that humans were inclined to the extremes his mind was wandering ignoring his urgent need to find a way out of his bindings and escape and meandering down philosophical paths that had nothing to do with what he wanted it to think about how long have i been here he wasnt certain they never took off the hood and although they hadnt been feeding him he had heard the music of magic near him several times as if they were nourishing him that way instead of by conventional means he wasnt thirsty or hungry at any rate which was different from his captivity at the hands of padriks men but closed inside the hood with his body racked with pain there was no way of telling how much time had passed it could have been hours or days there was an escape open to him a realm of illusion and hallucination that would at least take him out of his pain and current fear all he had to do would be to give in to the beckoning grinning specter of madness as he had when the church had held him and i will not go mad i will not lose heart nightingale was out there somewhere he sensed her a tugging in his soul that actually had a physical direction she was as racked with grief for his loss as he was with pain but she had not given up to despair yet he could not tell what she was doing but he knew that much at least she is trying to find me trying to find a way to free me i must believe that she has those damned deliambrens to help her and maybe more help than that she must come she will come but it was hard to hold on to hope when his strength drained away steadily i have made some difference in the world he told himself defiantly i have redeemed myselfand i have had love even if i die no that was the way of despair he shied away from the thought with violence i will not die he shouted against the darkness i will not i will fight every step of the way with everything at my command which at the moment was not a great deal voices muffled by a wall grew nearer they were coming again he waited wild with rage at his own helplessness as a door opened and two men entered still talking probably another week or so one was saying i dont know how these creatures replace blood loss but were draining him fairly quickly he felt hands fumbling at his restraints this time they didnt seem to have brought any of their bravos with them could he he tried to lash out at them as they freed his arms tried to leap to his feet if i can injure one the other will run and i can hold the injured one and make him take off the hood visions of escape flashed across his mind he flung out his taloned hands with a strength only slightly less than that of an unfledged eyas he got as far as his knees before he threw himself off balance and tumbled in an ungainly sprawl across some hard surface the men both laughed as he sought for a reservoir of strength and found it empty i see what you mean said the other stillwe cant keep him around for too long or our client is going to hear about the new artifacts in the market and is going to wonder where all those vials of blood and feathers are coming from he gave us permission to take what we wanted the first man argued but you dont get fresh blood from a weekold corpse the other reminded him artifacts tfyrr thought miserably as the two men threw him on his stomach pinned his wing and arms effortlessly and plucked another handful of secondary feathers i am nothing to them but an object to be used at their pleasure they harvest me as if i were a berry patch each feather as it was pulled invoked a stab of exquisite pain he squawked involuntarily as his tormenters extracted them finally they left him alone they were only after feathers this time not blood just as well every talon ached where they had cut each one to the quick to collect blood now i know how human victims must feel why they deem having nails pulled out to be such a torment if he got free he would not be able to walk comfortably for weeks and i will not fly for months until the feathers grow again shall we truss it back up again the first man asked when they finally left him alone for a moment and he decided that they were done with him for the nonce well be gone all evening with no one here to watch him the second one prodded him with a toe and all tfyrr could do was groan i dont think so he said he isnt going anywhere all those bindings were breaking feathers anyway we need to get as many perfect feathers from him as we can only the perfect feathers are any good magically now that makes me wonder thoughwe need to do some research and see if the down and body feathers could be used for anything the sounds of their feet receded considering what were getting for feathers and blood can you imagine what the heart and bones will be worth the first one said greed and awe in his voice not to mention the skull and the talons we will be able to purchase mansions and titles at the very least the second chuckled over the sound of a door opening and as many the door closed cutting off the end of the sentence the heart the skull his people did not have much in the way of ceremony to mark ones passing but the idea that he would be parceled out in bits to the highest bidder made him so sick to his stomach that he started to gag and that was when the despair he had been holding off finally swooped down on him and took him i am going to die here alone in the dark halfmad and utterly forgotten nightingale will never find me i will never see her again he couldnt sit up he was too weak and dizzy he could only curl into a shivering ball and clutch his legs to his chest shaking with despair no one would ever find him there was no rescue at hand probably no one had even bothered to make the attempt no one cared no i can feel her out there i know she hasnt forgotten me if no one else tries she will she will come to me by herself if she must but it was hopeless how could one woman however resourceful find him hidden away in this hive of a city how could anyone find him even with all the resources of the king lyonarie was too big too impersonal for anyone to search successfully even clever nightingale there were too many places even she could not go he could not weep but his beak gaped as much as the muzzle would permit and he keened his despair into the uncaring darkness oh i would rather that tyladen were doing this the moon shone down on rooftops encrusted with ornamental false towers and crenellations on chimney pots shaped like toadstools flowers trees tiny castlesanything but a chimneypot nightingale crouched in the lee of a chimney bracing herself on the slanted slate roof and took harperus device off her belt holding it before her like a handcrossbow she braced herself a little more then cupped her hand around it to shield it as she would have shielded a lantern and felt for the little raised bump near where her thumb fell magical guards above and physical guards below if this was not where tfyrr was being held then there was something very peculiar going on in the old mansion upon whose roof she now perched less like the bird she was named for than a chimney swift a square area lit up inside her shielding hand giving off a dim red light it represented a square space twenty feet on a side with herself in the middle the little bright dot that was supposed to represent tfyrr was just a little to the left of centera dot that had not appeared on this screen the other times she had used the device she smiled tightly he was here getting him outwell she would save the rejoicing for the moment that happened she pressed the thumbpoint again and a set of numbers appeared roughly fifteen feet below her that would put him in the top floor just below the attics that made sense they were probably thinking of him as a big bird they wouldnt want to put him in a basement where he might catch a chill and die of shock in these town mansions unlike those in the country the master and mistress had their private rooms at the top of the house where you might get a breath of a breeze in the summer and where all the heat rose in the winter in a town mansion like this the rooms at street level next to the kitchens were ovens themselves in the summer and in winter no amount of fuel kept them warm her heart had led her here it had once been a wealthy district with huge homes showcasing the wealth of their owners now the area was shabbygenteel at best and whoever lived here was usually out of favor the tagend of a onceprosperous family now running out of money or the last of a long line dying out as the homes were lost to their original owners they were bought by other less genteel folk she knew of at least three brothels here and more ominously one of the houses was rumored to belong to a dealer in illegal goodsvery illegal because someone had to die in order for those particular goods to come on the market she had hoped she had the right district when she realized that mages tended to need buildings with a great deal of space to practice their art she knew she had the right district when her streeturchins traced the blood and feathers showing up on the magemarket to this very area people really didnt pay any attention to what children overheard if we survive this perhaps i shall set up an information service and live off the results of that that was when she sent maddy to tyladen for one of the devices she had asked for she herself had not gone back to freehold since the guards arrived freehold would be watchedbut she had a secure hiding place in father ruthveres steeple and others scattered elsewhere across the city she had money sewn into the money belt she never took off except to sleep and then kept beneath her pillow she could look like whatever kind of woman she chose and she was familiar with the bad parts of lyonarie no guard or militia from the palace could find her here if she did not want to be found the child returned with this a set of closely written instructions and the other child that nightingale had asked her to find that was all she had been waiting for she had waited until dark then began scaling the walls and getting onto the rooftops of every likely building in the areawith help she was not a thief and she could not have done this alone but she had the help of someone who was more at home on the rooftops of lyonarie than beneath them it was safer to operate this thing from above than from below there was less chance of being seen for one and she really didnt want to be caught loitering out in the street with this bizarrelooking thing in her hands i dont believe i can claim it is a musical instrument thanks to the fact that even here there was very little space between the buildings and to the fact that her accomplice had some quite remarkable climbing and bridging devices at his disposal she had mostly been able to scramble from roof to roof that further limited her time on the ground a good thing even if it was hairraisingly risky to pick her way across strange rooftops in the middle of the night she put the device away and considered her options he is in the middle of the building probably in a closet as far as possible from a window now how do i tell what room that closet belongs to a scrabbling of tiny hands and feet across the slates signaled the arrival of her partner in crime and guide across these heights e ere whispered tam the chimneysweep a boy about thirteen years old but as thin as one of his brushes and with the stature of a nineyearold right below me just about she whispered back im certain theyre keeping him in a closet but how do i tell which room its in he chuckled easy mum by chimbleys this un like drops down inter th room ye want he patted it fondly the way a driver would pat the neck of his horse these big ol ouses they got fireplaces fer ever room wants i should go look before she could stop him he had clambered nimbly up the side of the chimney and slid down inside it she waited numb with shock expecting at any moment to hear the commotion from below that meant hed been spotted and seized nothing then off to the side a faint whistle the song of a nightingale she eased her way over to the edge of the roof where the whistle had come from and looked cautiously down tams sooty face looked up at her impudently his teeth and the whites of his eyes startlingly bright in the moonlight empty room lots uv scratches on the floor got a locked closet ere mum be a mort uv them scratches there goes to tother side uv door mebbe some blood too she didnt hesitate a moment longer she lowered herself down over the edge of the roof feeling for the window ledge with her feet as her arms screamed with outraged pain tam caught her ankles deftly and guided her feet to secure places she caught hold of decorative woodwork and eased herself down to the window itself she wanted to fling herself inside but she didnt dare make that much noisebut she nearly wept with relief when she was safe on the floor inside i am not a thief i am not a hero i am only a musician i am not supposed to be crawling about on rooftops and we are leaving this place by the stairs and no other way the room itself was completely empty not even a single stick of furniture just as tam said the moonlight coming in the windows revealed that there were traces of painted diagrams on the wooden floor though and she guessed that it was sometimes used for magical ceremonies all the more reason to get him out of here she went straight to the closet door that tam pointed to and saw that what he had mistaken for blood was nothing of the sort it was only spilled paint the scratches could have come from anythingdragging a heavy piece of furniture to the closet for storage for a moment her heart sank then she heard the faint scraping of talons beyond the door and the whimpering keen of a bird of prey exhausted and near death im gone mum tam declared and slipped back up the chimney that was fine shed already paid him for his help and she had told him that she didnt want him around if things began to get dangerous since that had suited the boy just perfectly the bargain had been easy to strike it had been much harder to persuade maddy and her little army of partisans to stay behind the loyalty of children ran deep and somehow she had earned it only promising them that they could stand guard over the chapel when she and tfyrr were safely inside had kept most of them from following her and tam over the rooftops she turned back toward the door expecting a complicated lockperhaps even a magemade lockand strained her senses for the music that magictouched things held within them silence nor was there any other sign of a lock complicated or otherwise in stunned surprise she tried the doorknob automatically it turned easily and swung open without so much as a creak there wasnt much light but there was enough for her to see the crumpled feathercovered figure lying on the floor of the closet head enveloped in a giant scuffed hood a surge of grief and rage enveloped her and she flung herself down on her knees beside him fearing she was too late the head turned blindly toward her as she reached for him iale came a whisper a mangled version of her name as spoken from around the cruel device they had clamped on his beak iaoo its me ive come to get you out of here the fastenings on the gag and the hood werent even complicated she had the former off and flung into a corner the hood followed it and she gathered him into her arms with her throat constricted with tears he was so weak he had no primaries at all and few secondaries he wouldnt have been able to fly out of here even if hed had the strength ill worry about how to get him out of here after i get him under protection and to do that she needed his permission tfyrr she said urgently i need to put barriers against any more magical attacks on you may i he wrapped his own arms weakly around her and nodded too spent to even ask her what in the world she thought she was doing she reached both arms around behind his back and clasped her silver bracelet with her free hand under cover of the embrace and concentrated hard for a moment with a silvery glissando the elven protections she wore slithered over him as well wrapping him in a cocoon of power identical to hers now just let the mages try something theyd waste their time trying to crack this shell and if she knew elves that mage would take malicious pleasure in tracking the attack to its source anddealingwith it hopefully those same mages hadnt sensed the power shed brought here that was supposed to be one of the protections but who knew it was elvenwork and chancy at best constrained only by what this particular mage felt like doing at the time can you stand she asked in an urgent whisper glad that she could not clearly see all the damage that had been done to him we have to get out of here before the magesare gone he interrupted her breathing as hard as if he had been flying for miles at top speed i heard them saythey were leavingfor the night well that put another complexion on it entirely they were as secure here as they would be anywhere and as likely to remain undisturbed with only the guards belowwho with the absence of their masters would be slackening their vigilance at the least and with luck would be getting drunk on the masters winethere was no one to disturb them i can heal you again tfyrr enough to get us both out over the rooftops you can still climb cant you a feeble chuckle only if you can heal my talontips beloved i would not be very silent otherwise i can do that she replied her heart swelling he said it he called me beloved there had been times in the dark of the lonely nights waiting for word of him that she had been certain when he came to his senses he would be revolted by her love for him she could have misinterpreted what hed said about the spiritbrothers he could have mistranslated but but he would not use those words so casually unless unless they were so real to him that he could use them casually as casually as flying then let me work the magic on you beloved she said with a joy so great it eclipsed fear and this timedont try and help me he only chuckled again a mere wheeze in the darkness and let her work her will on him the trip back over the rooftops had been nightmarish but not such a nightmare as trying to get out past the guards would have been she had been able to give him strength enough to climb and had been able to heal the tips of his talons so that they didnt bleed every time he moved a hand or a foot but there hadnt been enough time to do more than that every time she thought she heard a door slam below or footsteps in the hall she had been jolted out of the trance the return trip was easier than it might have beenshe didnt have to make side trips over every roof in the district to check her device for his presence some of those charming ornamental rooftops had been the purest hell to get across the first time why do people pitch their roofs that steeply doesnt it ever occur to them that someday someone is going to have to climb all over it replacing slates and cleaning chimneys evidently not perhaps that was why this district had deteriorated the charming manses were impossible to keep in repair she was able to pick out a path that while not precisely easy or gentle at least avoided the worst of the obstacles but it was a long time before they came to one particular abandoned house at the edge of the district and were able to slip down through the holes in the roof that had let her and her accomplice have access to the roofhighway in the first place they felt their way along staircases that shook and groaned alarmingly with every step they took and down halls that must have been ankledeep in dust by the amount they kicked up but they reached the street level without mishap and just inside the front door nightingale stooped in the darkness and felt for the bundle she had left there it wasnt anything anyone would be likely to steal this neighborhood hadnt deteriorated so far that a bundle of rags was worth anything a tattered skirt for her to go over her black trews and black shirt a bedraggled cloak and an equally tattered greatcloak for him big enough to completely envelop him it was as threadbare as the skirt and wouldnt have done a thing to protect him from the wind or weather but that wasnt the point here she said and sneezed handing him the cloak she pulled the skirt on over her head and wiped the roofsoot from her face and hands with the tail of it he fumbled the cloak on after a moment of hesitation wont i look just as odd in this he asked as he tied the two strings that held it closed at the throat yes and no she told him there are plenty of people who go cloaked at night even in the worst heat of summerand anyone who does is probably so dangerous that most people deliberately avoid him someone who doesnt want you to notice him is someone you likely dont want to notice you she picked up the second equally tattered cloak flinging it on and pulling up the hood better to broil in this thing than to have her face seenand she could not rely on her own magic to work properly inside this elven protection and two people together cloaked in this heatthey are twice as unlikely to be bothered they waited until the street was empty of traffic and stepped out as if they belonged in the house they had just left on the chance that someone might be looking out a window thieves and escaped prisoners were not supposed to stroll out like a pair of downattheheels gentry it was a long weary walk to the chapel and they had to stop often so that tfyrr could rest but when they got within a few blocks of the chapel they were swarmed but not by guards looking for them nor by the mages men but by nightingales pack of children tam had taken word ahead which nightingale had not expected him to do and the children must have been waiting watching along every possible route to the chapel a wheelbarrow appeared as if conjured the children coaxed the haspur into ithe had no tail and very little in the way of wing feathers to get in the way of sitting nowand a team of a dozen rushed him along the street faster than nightingale could run she caught up with them at the entrance to the chapel her side aching but her heart lighter than shed had any reason to expect when she had set out a few hours ago father ruthvere was waiting for them he opened the door to the chapel just enough to let them inside and shut it again quickly theyve been here looking for you he told nightingale they have warrants for you and tfyrr both his thin face was creased with worry and exhaustion and her heart sank warrants already how could they have gotten legal warrants past the king a warrant for tfyrr she said incredulously but hes in the kings household how could they get a warrant out on him its part of the original warrant for the men who attacked the deliambren the priest told them his mouth twisting into a grimace as he led them into the sanctuary the king already signed it theyve altered it to read humans or nonhumans and theyre claiming that tfyrr set up the attack in the first placethat the deliambren envoy recognized him and that was why he kept asking for tfyrr when tfyrr made a growl of disgust nightingale only shrugged fatalistically it figures i shouldnt have been so surprised it doesnt have to be logical she pointed out it only has to be legal and since the king has already signed it and probably initialed the change its legal and me youre supposed to be the mysterious female who freed the attacker the deliambren caught father ruthvere sighed and shook his head i havent a clue how theyre managing to get past the fact that youd have had to be two places at the same time if they have their way it would never get to a trial where theyd have to produce proof she pointed out bitterly feeling a surge of anger at high king theovere who had probably just signed the warrants without ever reading them once he was told what they werevaguelyabout when criminals can escape from locked dungeons or walk away legally it doesnt take any stretch of the imagination to see that two more criminals could be murdered during an escape attempt and we dont have any friends in high places or awkward relatives who might ask questions tfyrr drooped despondently i had hoped that we had awakened theovere to his sense of duty enough so that things like this at least could not happen i thought he she took his arm hoping to give him comfort to have gone through all he had only to be hit with more bad news seemed grossly unfair never mind father ruthvere said firmly you have sanctuary here for as long as you like and no one can pry you out of it since the bishop is behind you you can stay until youre stronger or your feathers have grown back and fly out but what about nightingale tfyrr asked instantly she actually had an answer to that one although she wouldnt bring it up in front of father ruthvere well an elf who can appear in my room and disappear as well can certainly manage to take me with him she knew how he was doing it of course opening up doors into underhill wherever he chose it took a tremendous amount of magical power but but they might do it just to tweak the noses of the human leaders and prove that the human mages are no match for them i can find a way to safety love trust me she said and patted his arm reassuringly i found you didnt i tfyrr still looked stricken and she felt his despair enveloping him like a great black net she tried to think of something anything to sayand swayed with sudden exhaustion catching herself with one hand on a pillar just before she fell father ruthvere took over his expression mirroring his relief at having something immediate he could do never mind all that now he said soothingly tomorrow everything may change before anything can happen you both need to rest recover your strength he made shooing motions with his hands in the direction of the belltower go he said the bishop will be sending his own guards to make sure you arent taken from sanctuary by force you wont need to stay awake to avoid arrest all you need to do is get your strength back nightingale sighed with relief and let down her guard weariness came over her then so potent it left her dizzy fortunately they were not supposed to go up to the top of the belltowerfor one thing when the bells rang they would have risked deafness or even death up there no there was a wellinsulated tiring room at the base of the tower that they would be living in for the next few days at the very least it had a staircase that led directly up to the top of the tower so that once tfyrr grew his feathers backa matter of two or three weeks at a guesshe would have free access to one of the better takeoff points in this district if he had to fly out and he left at night no one would ever know the two of them staggered into the tiring room to find that father ruthvere had been there before them laying out bedding wash water and a basin even food one set of bedding but by the time they reached the doorway they were so tired that all they cared about was the bedding they literally collapsed into it nightingale only a fraction of a heartbeat behind tfyrr and curled up together in a comforting tangle of limbs she pulled the blankets up over them both as much to hide the sad state of his feathers as for warmth he was asleep first she listened to his regular breathing and allowed herself to weep very quietly with relief and joy not many tears but enough that she had to wipe her face with a corner of a blanket before she was through that released the last of her tension she had only two thoughts before slumber caught her we are as surely in prison here as in the gaol we cannot leave without being taken by our enemies we have been caged at last it doesnt matter as long as we are together tfyrr would never have known how long he slept if father ruthvere hadnt told him three days he said incredulously three days the priest nodded and tfyrr shook his head i believe you but well you woke up long enough to eat andahem father ruthvere said blushing but other than that you slept nightingale too he added as an afterthought though she stayed awake a bit longer than you did probably healing me that would account for how well i feel and the memories of music in my dreams tfyrr sighed and roused his feathers well what has been happening are we still under siege he asked or are our enemies satisfied to have us bottled up and out of the way father ruthvere played with his prayer beads the latter i suspect he said after a moment you obviously cannot press charges against your captors since you are a fugitive yourself and as for nightingale he shrugged the nonhumans are in an uproar but there is no one to lead them and theovere and theovere is near death they all turned as one tfyrr feeling the blood draining from his skin and leaving him cold everywhere there were no feathers harperus stood in the door to the tiring room face drawn and as pale as his hair his costume little more than a pair of plain trews and an embroidered shirt thank the stars youre awake at last he said without preamble as both nightingale and tfyrr stared at him trying to make some sort of sense out of his first statement theovere was attacked and is in a coma his physicians are baffled he held up his hands as tfyrr mantled what was left of his wings in anger wait let me tell this from the beginning tfyrr subsided make it short old owl he rumbled none of your damned deliambren meanderings harperus nodded shortly then the marvelous music box broke down completely this morning and no amount of fiddling by lord levan would get it working again the high king sent pages looking for you and found me instead and i gave him an earful the deliambren crossed his arms over his chest his dour expression reflecting a smoldering anger beneath the stoic surface i told him about your vanishing the warrants that he had signed the attacks and the kidnapping i told him that now that the warrants had been signed by his hand neither you nor nightingale had any protection or rights under the law he was verystunned tfyrr only growled he had lost all patience with the oncegreat high king about the time his captors had pulled out his third primary i am not entirely certain i even want to help him now i told him the church had you in sanctuary harperus continued convinced that both of you were innocent of any wrongdoing and i showed him how all those things that you had been hinting at were true all the abuses of nonhumans all the things that had been happening to human and nonhumans alike i guessed that he might have been so thoroughly shaken up that he might actually listen instead of dismissing it all well was he tfyrr asked it would take a miracle but evidently that miracle had occurred enough to issue orders immediately revoking the warrants on you two and to take the seneschal and a gaggle of secretaries into a corner and start drafting interkingdom edicts granting basic rights to all peoples of all species harperus said with a note of triumph but his triumph faded immediately that was when according to the seneschal that mysterious woman struck he called for breakfast it arrived and with it a lace handkerchief and a message theovere picked it up opened it and read it before any of the bodyguards even thought to look at it firstand he collapsed on the spot harperus shook his head i looked at him and im baffled theres no contact poison i know of that would work that way and he shows no other signs of poisoning other than being in a coma no one can wake him from tfyrr looked aghast at nightingale who only nodded her lips compressed into a thin line if our enemy can hire mages to pluck tfyrr from the sky she can certainly hire a mage to write a notespell to try to disable or kill theovere there was nothing on the note when they looked at it right right harperus replied looking at nightingale with respect and a little awe but it didnt kill him it doesnt have to she pointed out if he is in a coma he could stay that way indefinitely the advisors can reign as joint regents on the pretense that someday he might wake up this could go on for years come to think of it thats better than killing him for their purposes if a new high king was selected theyd all be out of their positions but what can we do tfyrr asked puzzlement overlaid with despair nowwe have no choice nightingale and i may have a day or so to escape while our enemies obtain new warrants for us but what of all the nonhumans in the twenty kingdoms what is there left for them but to gather what they can and flee we are not physicians and even if we were surely the kings own doctors know best what is good for him the kings doctors are as baffled as i am harperus replied and i am baffled by the message i received less than an hour ago he raised his eyebrows and looked straight at nightingale as if he suspected her of some duplicity the messenger seemed human or deliambren but hadunusual eyes and ears and he spoke in riddles the corner of nightingales mouth twitched go on she said that sounds like an elf to me i happen to know theres oneahin the area in answer harperus handed her a piece of paper she took it and read it aloud for the benefit of tfyrr and father ruthvere tell the bird of night and the bird of the king that the high king can be sung back from the darkness in which he wanders if the guarddog is released to return to his home half of the futures hold theovere high half of them hold him fallen if the two birds should sing to him as one hearts bound wrongs remembered but not cherished their enemies may be confounded no elf nor human mage nor brightlyconceited artificer can command the power to accomplish this for this is the magic of the heart and the sight im not certain i care for that brightly conceited part harperus muttered under his breath nightingale must have heard him anyway for she treated him to an upraised eyebrow does this mean that nightingale and i havethe ability to sing him out of this tfyrr said incredulously but how it was accomplished by magic nightingale pointed out its possible that magic can undo it there might even be a mage somewhere inside his mind holding him unconscious if thats the case bardic magic could reach theovere in a way no other magic could duplicateor block tfyrr thought about that for a moment and nodded i believe that i see he said and roused what was left of his feathers with a hearty shake before straightening up and holding his head high those in a coma are said to understand what happens around them we must go of course wait a moment harperus objected blocking the door i havent told you the rest of it if you flee now youll be outrunning warrants that wont ever have a chance to catch up with you before you cross a nonhuman border if you stay try and dont succeedthe advisors are spreading the rumor that nightingale is the female assassin and in the hire of tfyrr theyre saying as proof of this that there was no trouble until tfyrr arrived at court if theovere dies youll dieand if he simply remains in a coma youll die anyway someone has decided that you two are the obstacles that need to be removed for the advisors to have a free hand again nightingale dropped the paper at her feet that doesnt matter she said steadily and glanced over at tfyrr i was wrong to discount theovere he can be reached he was nearly his old self before they struck him down we must help him for his own sake and for the sake of all those who are depending on us his heart swelled with pride and love for her she is right he agreed it does not matter our enemies are counting on our cowardice we must teach them better and he hesitated for a moment as the last of his anger with theovere washed away and the high king needs us he concluded if we desert himwe are no better than they perhaps we are worse we will try for nonhumans and humans alike harperus wordlessly stood aside and the two of them walked out of the tiring room through the chapel and out into the street high king theovere needs us and he is the twenty kingdoms for better or worse with luck on our side perhaps we can make it for better nightingale settled at the high kings side next to tfyrr the haspur looked very odd with patches of downfeathers showing where coverts had been taken with his wings denuded with reddened visible scars and with not even a stump of a tail no one could deny his dignity however a dignity that transcended such imperfections that dignity had gotten them past the bodyguards to the captain and from there to the one person tfyrr thought might still back them the seneschal the captain and the lord seneschal had been skeptical of their claims to be able to reach theovere by musicbut they were also no friends of the kings physician the seneschal simply didnt trust someone who was often in and out of the suites of the other advisors the captain just didnt trust him period it was his opinion that there had been too much talk of purgings and bleedings and not enough of things that would strengthen rather than weaken a patient so the captain of the kings bodyguard chose a time when the advisors were all huddled together in council threw out the physician and smuggled them in now what tfyrr asked her as she surveyed theoveres bed theovere was in it somewhere in the middle hardly visible for all the pillows and feather comforters piled atop him and lost in the vast expanse of it the bed itself was big enough to sleep three gypsy families and still have room for the dogs do we need to have physical contact with him i dont think so she replied as the captain moved a little in silent protest to that suggestion he might not trust the physician but he also made no bones about the fact that his trust for them was very limited no theres nothing we can do with a physical contact that we cant do without it she turned to the captain then as something occurred to her you were there when he collapsed werent you the beefy man nodded face red with chagrin and anger at himself and why i didnt think youre not at fault she interrupted gently there should have been no way for a note to get to the king that hadnt been checked for problems first unless he looked sharply at her unless unless that note was put on the tray by one of the kings advisors and had the seal of the council on it she said and got the satisfaction of seeing his eyes narrow with speculation now i know if i were an advisor to the high king knowing that the king wasnt getting any younger and suspecting that a successor might be named soon who would want his own advisors in place she let her voice trail off and raised an eyebrow significantly the captain nodded his face as impassive as a stone wall but his eyes bright with anger i take your meaning and its one i hadnt thought of nightingale shrugged pleased that she had planted her seed in fertile ground but the captain was not yet finished lady i she sensed him groping for words through a fog of grief though there was no outward sign of that grief on his features i served theovere all my life ive seen him at his best and at his worst and he stopped and shook his head unable to articulate his own feelings she held her hands tightly together in her lap holding herself tightly braced against the wash of his emotions as strong as the tide at its full now she knew why every man in the bodyguards was so fanatically devoted to the king he could inspire that devotion once lady grant we make it possible for him to do so again she caught his eyes and nodded gravely once then turned back to the enormous bed and its quiet occupant if we succeed captain it will be for the good of alland if we fail then at least we will have been able to give theovere a parting gift of the music he loved so much nightingale tfyrr said suddenly in the gypsy tongue didnt you tell me that there might be aa spirit of some kind holding theovere away look over there he pointed with his beak rather than draw the attention of the captain and nightingale stared in the direction he pointed there is a shadow there where a shadow has no business being it hovered just above theoveres head but it did not feel like theovere it felt hungry cruel petty what is it whatever it was she knew at that moment that they would have to deal with it before they could bring theovere back to himself i think its occupied tfyrr whispered his voice shaking a little i thinki think it might be tormenting theovere odd that sounded familiar a little like like the ghost that rune fiddled for that robin and kestrel helped to free it had been bound to a pass by a malicious magician and had taken out its rage on those who tried to cross the pass by night if you had something like thata lesser spirit perhapsand bound it to your service then you might have something that you could set on a man simply by sending him a note to which it had been attachedsomething that could drive the soul from his body and keep it there you would have something that would become more and more bitter and malicious the longer it stayed bound which meant it was half in this world and half in the next and wasnt that the definition of those with the sight she had itshe just hadnt used it much not when her greater power lay with the heart rather than the soul and the elven message had clearly said this is magic of the heart and the sight elves simply didnt get any clearer than that well the first thing to do is get its attention i havent invoked the sight in a long time she put her hands on the strings of her harp and began to play quietly humming the melody under her breath as she slowly sharpened her focus out of this world and into the next she sensed tfyrr following her lead and wondered if he would share her sight or if he had a touch of it himself the room grew grey and dim and faded away at the edges as she moved her vision into that other world where shadows were solid and restless spirits dwelled she could still see theovere but now now there were two of him one was in the bed the other standing at the foot of the bed an expression of fear and frustration on his face and hovering above the theovere in the bed wassomething it wasnt human not precisely there was a certain odd cast to the face as if the structure of the skull was subtly different from a humans the red eyes were slanted obliquely toward the temples the fingers were too long and there were seven of them the limbs looked oddly jointless it had the pointed ears of an elf but it wasnt an elf either at the moment it was watching theovere and it was enjoying his plight can you see anything she whispered to tfyrr and she described what she saw out of the corner of her eye she saw him shake his head only the shadow he replied i will trust you to know what to do i only wish i did she thought but they were in it now and there was no turning back whatever it was it didnt seem to be paying any attention to her or her music it also wasnt doing muchexcept to keep theovere from reentering his own body which meantwhat that its probably not all that powerful that im not reaching it but im not really trying think nightingale what do you do when you have to reach an audience and you dont know what they want you try something so beautiful they cant ignore it she heard it speaking now faintly it taunted theovere with his plight and his helplessness playing with the symbols of his power that it conjured up into its own hands it didnt have the real crown rod or sword of coursebut theovere didnt know that her hands moved of themselves on the strings plucking out the first chords of the waterfall one of the most transcendently beautiful songs she knew she didnt do it often because she didnt have the range to do it justice but tfyrr did she poured her heart into the harping and he his soul into the musicand it snapped its narrow head around affixing them with its poppyred eyes as the ephemeral objects of state vanished into the nothingness from which they had been conjured it said nothing though until after they had finished the song what are you doing here it asked in a voice like wet glue she started to answerthen stopped herself just in time to answer it might put herself in its power its primary ability must be to drive a spirit from the body then keep that spirit from reentering it might be able to do that to more than one person at a time but the laws of magic were that it could not do so if it did not know her it must have been fed what it needed to take theovere but she was a stranger to it it needed a connection with her to find out what tormented her so instead she started a new song hard on the heels of the waterfall and followed that one with a third and a fourth i have to make it go away and i cant do that by driving it away its already here by coercion the longer it stayed silent listening to her the more she sensed those shadowbindings deeper into the shadowworld than it was that kept it blocking theoveres return but the bindings were light ones it could break them if it chose so it was here because it liked being here it enjoyed tormenting people well so had the skull hill ghost but rune and then robin had tamed the thing showing itwhat all the good things of the human spirit all the things that give life joy instead of pain and her hands moved into the melody of theovere and the fortyfour one of the songs that she and tfyrr had used to try and wake the high king up to his former self it was a moving tale of courage and selflessness all the more moving this time because the theoverespirit listened too and wept with heartbreak for what he had been and no longer was he was in a place and a position now where he could no longer lie to himselfand very likely that was one of the things his captor had been tormenting him with the truth bare and unadorned and equally inescapable he has looked into the mirror and seen a fool she sensed tfyrr pouring his own high courage into the song the courage that had sustained him while captive the courage that made him go out and try to do something to remedy the ills he saw around him and while she did not think that courage was particularly her strong suit she added her own heart twined around his she saw its eyes widen saw the maliciousness in them fade just a little and moved immediately to good duke arden the theoverespirit continued to weep bent over with its face in both its ephemeral hands and the shadow softened a little more but she sensed just a hint of impatience change the mood its getting bored she moved through the entire gamut of human emotions laughter courage selfsacrifice simple kindness sorrow and loss always she came back to two love and courage and with each song they sang she and tfyrr with their spirits so closely in harmony that they might have been a single person with two voices it softened a little more lost some of its malicious evil until finally there was nothing of evil in it anymore just a weariness a lack of hope that was not quite despair and a vast and empty loneliness that was when she thought she knew something of its nature it was a mirror that reflected whatever was before itor a vessel holding whatever was poured into it it was as changeable as a chameleon but deep inside it did have a mind and heart of its own and she seemed to be touching it her hands were weary and her voice had taken on that edge of hoarseness that warned her it was about to deteriorate and under tfyrrs brave front she felt bonetiredness if ever we can drive this thing awayno lead it awayit must be now so she changed the tune right in the middle of aerie to one of the simplest songs she had ever learned the briars of home it was the lullaby of an exile to her child singing of all the small things she missed all of them in her garden the smell of certain flowers in the spring the way that the grass looked after the rain the taste of herbs that would not grow where she was now the leaves falling in autumn the snow covering the sleeping plants in winter the songs of birds that would not fly in her new garden the feel of the soil beneath her hands and the joy of seeing the first sprouting plants and the homesickness the bittersweet knowledge that she would never experience any of those tiny pleasures again for all that she was happy enough in the new land and last of allhow she would give all of the wealth she possessed in the new place for one short walk in her own garden at home and as the last notes fell into silence it spoke to her for the second and last time i have a garden and with those four words it snapped the coercions binding it and vanished but theovere did not return to his body instead he stood there staring at it emptyeyed and hollow he looked old terribly old he stood with hanging hands stoopedover and defeated whats wrong why wont he wake she stretched out her already thin resources to him trying to sense what was wrong but she had nothing left she could not touch him and her own spirit cried out in frustration tfyrr began to sing softly at first a song she did not recognize initially until she realized that he was singing it in a translation so that theovere would understand it it was not from any of the twenty kingdoms and she doubted that anyone here had ever heard it but herself before this moment it was a song tfyrr had told her had been written by and for the spiritbrothers what is courage its chorus askedand the song answered it is to give when hope is gone when there is no chance that men may call you a hero when you have tried and failed and rise to try again it asked the same of friendship answering that the friend stands beside you when you are right and all others despise you for itand corrects you when you are wrong and all others praise you for it there was more much more and the more tfyrr sang the more the theoverespirit took heart in a strange way these definitions intended to guide the spiritbrothers of the haspur as they endeavored to help their own kind and their adopted brothers were equally applicable tosaya high king with the words came the feelings not only the ones called up by the definitions but the painfilled emotions the things that both of them had endured over the past several years at the hands of those who hated and feared anything that did not fit their own narrow definitions of appropriate the theoverespirit took those in too wincing more than a little as he was forced to acknowledge that this was due to his own neglect but accepting that as well he is looking into the mirror againbut this time he is seeing not only what is but what was and what may be again she simply followed the music with her harpsong as her heart this time followed his when it was over the theoverespirit stood up straight and tall looking many years younger than his true age his eyes bright again with light and life a sword appeared from nowhere in his hand he swept it silvery and bright and used it to salute both of them and then he faded away into a bright mist ohno nightingale dropped back into the outer world with a violent shock she stared at the bed certain that the figure in it was no longer alive her eyes blurred with exhaustion as what seemed to be a hundred people suddenly poured into the room she shrank away waiting for them to seize her seize tfyrr haul them both off into the gaols never to be seen again and theovere slowly sat up with a firm determined smile set on his face the bodyguards shoved the interlopers rudely away from the bed and she realized that there werent a hundred people there werent even twenty only the advisors and who had told them what was going on most of them seemed to be shouting at the captain and the seneschal both of whom were shouting back her eyes blurred again and she slid a little sideways into the comforting embrace of tfyrr what happened she asked im not sure he held her closely his own arms trembling with fatigue you did something and made the shadow go away then we sang theovere back like the elves said to dohe woke up and spoke and then all the advisors began pouring in im not sure how they found out that we were doing anything here its a good thing they didnt get in until we were done she said a bit grimly as theovere gained enough strength from somewhere to outshout all of them silence he bellowed enough the babble ceased and he glared at all of them we have he said clearly and succinctly his eyes shining with dangerous anger a traitor among us the note that held thecall it a cursethat felled me was sealed with the council seal out of the corner of her eye nightingale saw the captain of the bodyguards go momentarily limp with relief but she saw something else as well heading up a contingent of his own private guards and standing at the back of the room was someone who looked oddly familiar to her who is that she whispered to tfyrr under the sound of the kings furious but controlled questioning of his guards and his advisors he looks familiar somehow he glanced in the direction she was looking thats lord atrovel he said but you cant have seen him before he never leaves the palace and you never encountered any of the other advisors except the lord seneschal just at that moment the odd little man moved into a wash of shadow that darkened his hair she saved herself from gaping at him only by a strong effort of will she had seen this lord atrovel beforebut not here in freehold and he had been violetta thats violettaone of the great lords of stateand the biggest gossip in freehold someone who was in a position to know everything that was going on in the kings chambers in his private correspondence and in freehold and who had the knowledge and the means to sabotage all of it and ill bet he wasnt leading those guards here to protect us if we failed to bring back the king tfyrr she whispered clutching his hand and turning her head into his feathers to make certain her voice didnt go any further put long black hair on lord atrovel and tell me what you get she knew by the tension in his muscles that he had seen the same thing that she had violetta he whispered then he stood up abruptly and she scrambled out of his way she had never seen him like this beforebut she had seen a hawk about to attack an enemy violetta he roared lord atrovel startedbut so did all the other great lords but none of the others had that look of panic in their eyesand none of the others had been making his leisurely way toward the door as the king continued to question his advisors tfyrr launched himself at lord atrovel in a fury and nightingale was only a second or so behind him lord atrovels guards scattered but the kings bodyguards came pouring in from the room beyond alerted by tfyrrs scream of anger tfyrr reached the traitor first he seized the little man in his talons and picked him up bodily his beak was parted in fury his eyes dilated and all nightingale felt from him was a flood of red rage oh lady noif he kills the man hell never forgive himself no one moved no one could tfyrr held the man for a moment longer then flexed the muscles of his arms and gently set lord atrovel down right into the welcoming arms of the elite bodyguards i believe that this is the man you have been looking for tfyrr said so gently that he might have been soothing a child he frequented freehold under the name and disguise of violetta and likely other places as well i believe he owns a house in the firemare quarter where you will find two or three mages in his employ who held me captive and maimed meone of them probably set the spell that nearly slew his majesty hunt through his private papers his suite and question his servants and you will probably find a trail of sabotage and evil as vile as the man himself and you will likely find lace handkerchiefs that match those left by the mysterious gaolraider as well as a he coughed remarkable selection of female garments made in his size which should explain the missing maid who freed that first captive the captain took custody of lord atrovel himself and fired off a burst of orders as the rest of the lord advisors scattered like so many frightened quail tfyrr ignored them all turning back to nightingale the terrible rage inside him was gone she went weakkneed with relief as she saw his face and sensed the calm that now lay within him he doesnt need revenge i dont need revenge he said softly echoing her own thoughts taking her hands in his i have you and i have love vengeance is a waste of valuable time she smiled up at him tremulously it is isnt it he touched her cheek with one gentle talon i know that you dont like cities he said wistfully butcould you consider making your home in one a home is where the people you care for are she told him impossible joy beginning to bubble up inside her and if the people i care for live in a cityor the high kings palacethen that is where my home will be i think i will survive living in this one he laughed then and gathered her to him for a long embrace together they turned and walked back to the side of high king theovere who watched them with a truer smile than any he had worn in nightingales memory theovere clasped the hand of the captain of the elite bodyguards and the stalwart soldier smiled as broadly as his king with the glint of a tear in one eye welcome back my king was all he said and then he turned to face tfyrr and nightingale he nodded still smiling and as he walked away to tend to his duties nightingale heard with some surprise that he was whistling a gypsy melody of how all was right with the world
