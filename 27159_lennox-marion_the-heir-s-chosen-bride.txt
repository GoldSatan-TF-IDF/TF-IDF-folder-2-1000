whereabouts of dougal douglas or direct descendant brother to lord angus douglas earl of loganaich contact solicitors baird and oshannasy dolphin bay australia for information to your advantage mr douglas youre an earl hamish groaned he was hours behind schedule the harrington trust committee was arriving in thirty minutes and his perky secretaryintraining was driving him nuts just sort the mail but this letter says youre an earl you gotta read it like i read emails from nigeria offering to share millions all i need to do is send my bank account details jodie you know better of course i do she told him indignantly honestly he was being a twit but she forgave him who wouldnt hamish douglas was the cutest boss shed ever worked for jodie had been delighted when marjorie had retired and shed been given the chance to take her place at thirtythree hamish was tall dark and dropdead gorgeous he had ruffled black curls which fought back when he tried to control them he had deep brown twinkly eyes and the most fantastic smile when he smiled which wasnt often hamish might be one of the most brilliant young futures brokers in manhattan but he didnt seem to enjoy life maybe hed smile when he realised he really was an earl this ones different she told him honest mr douglas you need to look if youre who these people think you are then youve inherited a significant estate a significant estate in lawyer speaki bet that means a fortune ive inherited nothing its a scam whats a scam is jodie bothering you with nuisance mail uhoh jodie had been rising but as soon as the door opened she sat straight back down marcia vinel was hamishs fiancée trouble jodie had overheard marcia on at least two occasions advising hamish to get rid of her shes a temp from the typing pool surely you can do better but i like her hamish had replied much to jodies delight shes smart intuitive and organisedand she makes me laugh your secretarys not here to make you laugh marcia had retorted no jodie thought shoving the offending letter into the tray marked pending lifes too serious to laugh lifes about making money whats the letter marcia said with a sideways glance at jodie to say she didnt appreciate jodie knowing anything about hamish that she herself didnt is it a scam jodie knew when to turn into a good secretary she tugged on her headset paid attention to her keyboard and didnt answer whats the letter marcia said again this time directly to hamish its some sort of con hamish said wearily and jodies not bothering me any more than anyone else is hell marcia i have work to do i came to tell you the harrington delegations been delayed marcia told him their flights two hours late from london relax he did but not much that meant rescheduling and ill rearrange your appointments jodie emerged from her headset and he cast her a look of gratitude only i do think you should read the letter she mightnt like marcia she decided but at least marcia would make hamish look at it he went back to frowning jodie get real letters saying im an earl and ive inherited a fortune are the stuff of a kids fantasy but it doesnt say send bank account details it says contact a solicitor that sounds fusty rather than scammy real let me see marcia decreed and put out an imperious hand marcia was a corporate lawyer working for the same company as hamish she was the brains he was the money some people saidbut hamish had earned his money with his wits and there was a fair bit of crossover the two were a team jodie handed it over there was silence while marcia read the letter was on the official notepaper of an australian legal firm it looked real jodie thought defiantly she wasnt wasting her bosss time and marcia didnt think so either she finished reading and set the letter down with an odd look on her face hamish do you have an uncle called angus douglas in australia no he frowned ori dont think so surely you know your uncles jodie said and got a frown from marcia for her pains she subsided but she didnt replace her headset my father migrated from scotland when he was little more than a kid hamish told marcia there was some sort of family rowi dont know what he never told my mother anything about his family and he died when i was three you never enquired marcia demanded astounded as if such disinterest was inexcusable about what about his background whether he was wealthy he certainly wasnt wealthy he migrated just after the war when every man and his dog was on the move from europe he married my mother and they had nothing he hesitated all i know all you know is what said marcia still staring at the letter while i was at college my roommate was doing a history major i went through some shipping lists he was using just to see if i could find him i did apparently my father left glasgow in on the maybelline there was no other douglas on the passenger list so i assumed he was alone maybe he had a brother who migrated as well marcia said thoughtfully maybe his brother went to australia instead honey this letter says someone called angus douglas earl of loganaich died six weeks ago in australia and theyre looking for relations of dougal douglas your father was dougal wasnt he hamishs face stilled what marcia said and jodie watched her face change she knew that look shed seen it when marcia was closing on a corporate deal the look said she could smell money there probably arent that many dougal douglases hamish said slowly butmy fathers address on the shipping manifest was loganaich id never heard of the place i looked it up and its tiny i thought some day i might go find it but but you got busy marcia said approving he certainly had hamish had been one of the youngest graduates ever to gain a firstclass commercelaw degree from harvard after that had come his appointment with one of the most prestigious broking firms in new york and hed whizzed up the corporate ladder with the speed of light at thirtythree hamish was a full partner and a millionaire a couple times over thered been no time in his fastmoving history for a leisurely stroll around scotland hamish this means you really might have inherited this is cool jodie beamed forgetting her dislike of marcia as imagination took flight the letter says theyre not sure whether they have the right person but it does fit it says your father was one of three brothers who left scotland in the oldest two went to australia and your dad came here he can read it for himself marcia snapped and handed it over to hamish itll be a scam read it marcia snapped and jodie thought whoa dont do that lady if hamish was my guy i wouldnt talk like that but hamish didnt notice its probably nothing he said at last but dismissal had made way for uncertainty but with the loganaich connection maybe we should check ill make enquiries about this law firm marcia said ill get onto it straight away theres no need there certainly is jodie breathed oh mr douglas the letter says youre an earl and youve inherited a castle and everything how ace would that be a scottish earl you might get to wear a kilt no ones seeing my knees hamish said he grinnedand then the phone rang and a fax came through that hed been waiting for and he went back to work castles and titles had to wait they think theyve found him susie douglas née mcmahon was sitting on a rug before the fire in the great hall of loganaichcastlethesecond playing with her baby rose douglas was fourteen months old shed been tumbling with her aunts dog boris but now baby and dog had settled into a sleepy snuggly pile and the women were free to talk the lawyers have been scouring america susie told her twin now they think theyve found the new earl as soon as he comes ii think ill go home but you cant kirsty stared at her twin with horror this is your home its been great susie said staring round the fantastically decorated walls with affection the two suits of armour guarding the hallway were wonderful all by themselves she talked to them all the time good morning eric good morning ernst but i cant live here for ever it doesnt belong to me i agreed to stay until angus died and now he has she took a deep breath ive been marking time for too long kirsty love eric and ernst belong to someone else its time i moved on you mustnt yet there was a part of kirsty that knew susie was right this moment had been inevitable susie had come so far after the death of her husband rory susie had fallen apart suffering from crippling depression as well as the injuries shed received in the crash that had killed her husband in desperation kirsty had brought her to australia to meet rorys uncle lord angus douglas earl of loganaich it had been a grand title for a wonderful old man in the earl theyd found a true friend and in his outlandish castle susie had recovered shed given birth to her daughter and shed started to look forward again to home susies home was in america her landscaping business was in america now angus was dead there was nothing keeping her here but while susie had been recovering kirsty her twin had been falling in love with the local doctor kirsty and jake now had a rambling house on the edge of town kids hens dogthe whole domestic catastrophe kirstys home was solidly here i dont want you to go kirsty whispered angus should have left this place to you he couldnt i dont see why not this castle was built with entailed money susie explained after the original scottish castle burned down the family trust made money available for rebuilding angus managed to arrange it so he rebuilt the castle here in australia but he still couldnt leave it away from the true line of the peerage if id had a son itd be different but now it goes to a nephew no one knows it belongs to a hamish douglas an american she said an american in a tone of such disgust that kirsty burst out laughing you sound as if americans are some sort of experimental bug she said just remember you are one susie douglas i hardly feel american any more susie said sighing rose rolled sleepily off boris and susie scooped her baby daughter up to hug her i have my own little australian half american half scottish born in australia but she belongs here you see im not sure any more susie said sighing again angus has left me enough to buy a little house and live happily ever after here but i need to work and theres not a lot of landscape gardening to be had in dolphin bay theres me kirsty said defensively and susie smiled you know that counts for a lot but not everything i need a job kirsty rorys been dead for almost two years my injuries from the crash are almost completely resolved i loved caring for angus but without him the castle seems empty the only thing keeping me occupied is the upkeep on the castle and the garden and once the new earl arrives when is he arriving i dont know susie told her but the lawyers say theyve found him and told him hes inherited if you were told youd inherited a title and a fortune wouldnt you hotfoot it over here kirsty gave a bleak little smile at that so much sorrow had gone into this fortune this title i guess i would she admitted once he arrives theres nothing for me to do susie told her twirling the curls of her almost sleeping daughter maybe he wont come kirsty said trying not to sound desperate she wanted her sister to stay so much or maybe hell want you to stay as caretaker and leave it earning nothing what would you do if you inherited this place susie asked sell it as a hotel kirsty said bluntly and though she added a grimace it was no less than the truth angus had built this place when his castle back in scotland had burned to the ground the old mans whim had led him to rebuild here in this magic place where the climate was so much kinder than scotlands but nowthe castle seemed straight out of a fairy tale it was far too big for a family angus had known it could be sold as a hotel and his intention was surely about to be realised it feels like a home kirsty added stubbornly and susie laughed right fourteen bedrooms six bathrooms a banquet hall a ballroom and me and rose even if you and jake and the kids and boris came to live with us wed have three bedrooms apiece its crazy to think of staying but you cant go back kirsty said again and her twins face grew solemn i think i must at least stay and meet the new earl maybe hell have some ideas rather than selling maybe he could employ you to make the garden better we both know thats a pipe dream but you will stay until he gets here thats what angus would have wanted i miss angus so much susie said softly and her twin moved across to give her a swift hug oh love of course you do the new laird might not even grow pumpkins susie said sadly and kirsty had to smile unforgivable sin weve got the biggest this year susie said brightening did i tell you the night before angus died i snuck into ben boyces yard and measured his its a tiddler in comparison angus died knowing he would definitely win this years trophy there you go kirsty said stoutly the new earl just has to collect his pumpkin and take over where angus left off the lawyers say hes some sort of financier an american financier valuing a prize pumpkinyou have to be kidding im not kidding kirsty said youll see hell come and hell fall for the place and want a caretaker and landscape gardener extraordinaire and pumpkin pie for dinner for the rest of his life he wont at least wait and see kirsty begged please susie you must give him a chance holiday hamish glared at his secretary in stupefaction you are joking im not joking your holiday starts next weeksir oh by the way im quitting youre not making sense hamish was late for a meeting hed been gathering his notes when his unconventional secretary had burst in to tell him her news youre having three weeks holiday starting next week jodie repeated patiently and im quitting he gazed at her as hed gaze at someone with two heads you cant quit he said weakly and she grinned yes i can im only a temp i came here two years ago on a twoweek agency placing and no ones given me a contract but people dont just leave well why would they when the moneys brilliant jodie acknowledged but have you noticed that people do leave this firm they start taking time off because they cant cope theyre constantly tired they forget things they stop being efficient and then theyre bumped so all im doing is leaving before im bumped why do you think marjorie retired so young listening to you and the girlfriend made me think me and marcia you and marcia shes as pleased as could be about your new titleshe cant wait to get married so shell be lady marcia douglasbut as for agreeing you dont have time to go see a castle its a fake castle he said faintly a castle is a castle and it sounds cool jodie declared just because its not six hundred years old doesnt mean its not a real one and marcias idea of putting it on the market without seeing it is ridiculous anyway i was talking to nick and he said nick my partner she said with exaggerated patience the man i share my life with hes a woodworker he was a social worker with disadvantaged kids but the work just wore him out he loved it but it exhausted him hes almost as cute as you and i talk about him all the time not that you listen hamish blinked he hesitated and glanced at his watch then he carefully laid his papers on the desk in front of him jodie was a great if unconventional secretary and itd be more efficient to spend a few minutes now persuading her to stay rather than training someone new dont do this to me jodie begged youre scheduling me into your morning and i dont intend to be scheduled im working on changing your life here not the next halfhour pardon you see nothing but work she told him the typingpool gossip is that youve been blighted in love that explains marcia but its none of my business all i know is that youre blinkered youve been given the most fantastic opportunity and youre throwing it away hamish sat down this is impertinent she told him and beamed i know but someone needs to tell you nicks been given a contract to rebuild the choir stalls at a gorgeous old church up in new england were both going to move thats why i need to quit so then i thought if i was quitting i should try to save you first nick agrees spending your whole life making money is awful owning a castle and not visiting it before you sell it is madness so ive cancelled every one of your appointments for the next three weeks starting the minute youve finished with the harrington committee i havent just crossed them out of your diary but ive contacted everyone and rescheduled jobs done as of next week im out of here and if you have the brains i credit you with so will you be i cant yes you can she told him your lordship jodie yes she was beaming as if shed just played santa claus ive booked flights for you from jfk to sydney and theres a hire car waiting so you can drive straight down to dolphin bay if you want to take marcia theyre holding two seats but i told them youd probably cancel one marcia wont come no but you will she told him youve been in this job for nearly ten years and no one can remember you taking a holiday oh sure youve been away but its always been on some financial wheeler dealer arrangement dealing with swiss bankers with a little skiing on the side a week on a corporate yacht with financiers and oilmen not a sniff of time spent lying on the beach doing nothing isnt it about time you had a look at life before you marry marcia and she paused and bit back what shed been about to say and settle down i cant he said again but suddenly he wasnt so sure ive cleared it with all the partners everyone knows youre going and they know why youve inherited a castle everyones asking for postcards so youre going to look pretty dumb sitting round this office for the next three weeks doing nothing or telling everyone that ive lied about you needing a holiday and youre not taking one yah boo sucks pardon he said again and her grin widened thats not stockbroker talk she told him its street talk real talk which ive figured you need if youre going to go from sharebroking to aristocracy maybe you need a small wedge of real life in between look you dumb worm if you dont get out of there youll be concrete susies hair was escaping from her elastic band and drifting into her eyes she flipped it back with the back of her hand and a trickle of muddy water slid down her face excellent this was her very favourite occupation digging in mud susie was making a path from the kitchen door to the conservatory the gravel path had sunk and she needed to pour concrete before she laid pavers but first she had to dig shed soaked the soil to make it soft and it was now oozing satisfactorily between her fingers as she rescued worms rose was sleeping soundly just through the window the sun was shining on her face and she was feeling great she needed to get these worms out of the mud or theyd be cactus im just taking you to the compost she told them in her best wormreassuring tone the compost is worm heaven ooh youre a nice fat one a hand landed on her shoulder she was wearing headphones and had heard nothing she yelped hauled her headphones off staggered to her feet and backed away fast a stranger was watching her with an expression of bemusement he might be bemused but so was she the stranger looked like hed just strolled off the deck of a cruising yacht an expensive yacht he was elegantly casual wearing cream chinos and a white polo top with a discreet logo on the breast he was too far away now to tell what the logo was but she bet it was some expensive country club a fawn loafer jacket slung elegantly over one shoulder he was wearing cream suede shoes cream shoes here she looked past the clothes with an effortand there was surely something to see beside the clothes the stranger was tall lean and athletic deep black hair good skin good smile great smile shed left the outer gate open there was a small black sedan parked in the forecourt with a hirecar company insignia on the side shed been so intent on her worms that hed crept up on her unawares he could have been an axe murderer she thought a little bit breathless she should have locked the gate butmaybe she was expecting him this had to be who she thought he was the new earl maybe she should have organised some sort of guard of honour a twelvegun salute youre the gardener he asked and she tried to wipe mud away with more mud as she smiled back she was all the welcome committee there was so she ought to try her best a spade salute i am the gardener she agreed plus the rest general dogsbody and bottlewasher for loganaich castle what can i do for you but his gaze had been caught solidly distracted he was staring at a huge golden ball to the side of the garden a vast ball of bright orange about two yards wide what is that he said faintly she beamed a pumpkin her names priscilla isnt she the best i dont believe it youd better shes a dills atlantic giant we decided on replacing queensland blues this yearwe spent ages on the internet finding the really huge suckersand went for dills instead of course theyre not quite as good to eat actually theyre cattle feed but whos worrying not me he said faintly the only problem is we need a team of bodybuilders to move her our main competitor has moved to dills as well but he doesnt have the expertise well walk away with the award for dolphin bays biggest pumpkin this year no worries no worries he repeated dazed thats australian for no problem she explained kindly or you could say shell be right mate this conversation was going nowhere he tried to get a grip is anyone home in there he waved vaguely in the direction of the castle im home me and rose rose my daughter are you im hamish douglas im looking for a susie douglas oh he really was the new earl there was a moments charged silence she wasnt what hed expected she thought but then he wasnt what shed expected either shed thought hed look like rory he didnt look like any of the douglases shed met she decided he was leaner finer boned finertuned he was a porsche compared to rorys land rover she decided limping across to greet him properly she still had residual stiffness from the accident in which rory had been killed and it was worse when shed been kneeling but the pain was nothing to what it had been and she smiled as she held out her hand in greeting then as she looked at his face and realised there was a problem her smile broadened she wiped her hands on the seat of her overalls and tried again susie douglas would be me she told him gripping his reluctant hand and shaking hi hi he said and looked at his hand its almost clean she told him letting a trace of indignation enter her voice as she realised what he was looking at and its good clean dirt only a trace wormy wormy earthworms she said exasperated this wasnt looking good in terms of longterm relationship in terms of longterm caring for this garden worms that make pumpkins grow as big as priscilla here not the kind that go straight to your liver and grow till they come out your eyeballs umfine he was starting to sound confounded im transferring them to the compost she told him deciding shed best be patient im laying concrete pavers to the conservatory and how awful would it be to be an earthworm encased in concrete do you want to see the conservatory umsure i might as well show you while were out here she told him youve inherited all this pile and the conservatorys brilliant it was falling into disrepair when i arrived but ive built it up its almost like the old orangeries they have in grand english houses youre american he said on a note of discovery but youre im the castle relic she told him hang on a minute i need to check something she limped across to the closest window hoisted herself up and peered through to where rose snoozed in her cot nope still fine whats fine he asked more and more bemused rose my daughter she gestured to the headphones now lying abandoned in the mud you thought i was listening to hiphop while i worked i was listening to the sounds of my daughter sleeping much more reassuring she turning and starting to walk toward the conservatory relics are what they used to call us in the old days she said over her shoulder theyre the women left behind when their lords died and your lord was rory she told him your cousin he was scottishaustralian but he met me in the states i dont know anything about my cousins she was limping toward a glasspanelled building on the north side of the house moving so fast he had to lengthen his stride to keep up with her you dont know anything about the family i didnt know anyone existed until i got the lawyers letter saying you were an earl she chuckled how cool its like cinderella you should have been destitute living in a garret she glanced over her shoulder eyeing him appraisingly but they tell me youre some sort of financier in manhattan i guess you werent in any garret it was a pretty upmarket garret he admitted they reached the conservatory doors and she swung them wide so he could appreciate the vista wow it is wow she said approving it certainly was the conservatory was as big as three or four huge living rooms and it was almost thirty feet high it looked almost a cathedral he thought dazed the beams were vast and blackened with glass panels set between hundreds of glass panels the beams came from st marys cathedral just south of sydney susie told him st marys burned down just after the war when angus was building this place he couldnt resist he had all the usable timbers trucked here for the last few years he didnt have enough energy to keep it up but since ive been here ive been restoring it i love it he knew she did he could hear it in her voice she didnt look like any relic hed met before susie was wearing mens overalls liberally dirtstained she was shortish slim with an open friendly face she had clear brown enquiring eyes and her auburn curls were caught back in a ponytail that threatened to unravel at any minute a long white scar ran across her foreheadhardly noticeable except that it accentuated the lines of strain around her eyes she was still young but her face had seenlife her husband had been murdered he remembered thats what the lawyers had told him back in new york it had seemed a fantastic tale but suddenly it was real bleakly real do you know about the family she asked as if shed guessed his thoughts and knew he needed an explanation very little he told her id like to hear more angus was the last earl he died childless your husband rory was his eldest nephew and he and the second nephew kenneth are both dead im the youngest nephew i never knew angus i certainly didnt know about the title and im still trying to figure things out am i right so far pretty much angus and my father and another brotherrory and kenneths fatherleft scotland just after the war apparently the family castle was a dark and gloomy pile on the west coast of scotland she told him the castle was hit by an incendiary bomb during the war and it burned to the ground as far as i can gather no one grieved very much the boys had been brought up in an atmosphere that was almost poisonous angus inherited everything the others nothing and the estate was entailed in such a way that he couldnt do anything about it after the fire they decided to leave angus said your father was the first to go he boarded a boat to america and angus never heard from him again and angus andwhat was the other brother calleddavid angus was in the air force and he was injured toward the end of the war while he was recuperating he met deirdre she was a nurse and her family had been killed in the london blitz so when he was discharged they decided to make their home in australia david followed she hesitated the relationship was hard and the resentment followed through to the sons i dont understand a situation where the eldest son gets everything and others get nothing is asking for trouble she walked forward and lifted a ripening cumquat into her hands she touched it gently and then let it go again releasing it so it swung on its branch like a beautiful mobile there were hundreds of cumquats hamish thought still dazzled by the beauty of the place did one eat cumquats hed only ever seen them as decorator items in the foyers of fivestar hotels angus rebuilt his castle here she said it was a mad thing to do but it gave the men of this town a job when things were desperate maybe it wasnt as crazy as it sounds he and deirdre didnt have children but david had two rory and kenneth i married rory they told me that kenneth murdered rory he said flatly it had to be talked about he decided so why not now she pushed her cumquat so it swung again and something in her face tightened but she didnt falter from answering there was such hate she said softly angus said his brothers hated him from the start and kenneth obviously felt the same about rory rory travelled to the states to get away from it he met me and he didnt even tell me about the family fortune but of course it was still entailed rory was still going to inherit and kenneth wanted it enoughenough to kill then when he wasfound outhe killed himself which is where i come in he said softly trying to deflect the anguish she couldnt disguise she took a deep breath which is where you come in she said and turned to face him welcome to loganaich castle my lord she said simply i hope youll deal with your inheritance with anguss dignity and i hope the hate stops now i hope youll help me im going home she told him ive had enough ofof whatever is here its your inheritance rory and angus have left me enough money to keep me more than comfortable im leaving you to it chapter two this was where he took over hamish thought this was where he said thank you very much can i have the keys the whole thing was preposterous he should never have let jodie insinuate her crazy ideas into his mind the thought of being left alone with his very own castle was almost scary lets not do anything hasty he told susie ill get a bed for the night in town and well sit down and work things out in the morning youre not staying here she asked startled this has been your home he said im not kicking you out we do have fourteen bedrooms he hesitated how do you know im not like kenneth she met his gaze and held youre not like kenneth i can see she bit her lip and turned back to concentrate on her cumquat bitterness leaves its mark its not fair that i inherit angus and rory between them left me all i need thank you very much she said and there was now a trace of anger in her voice no one owes me anything im not due for anything and i dont care about fairness or unfairness in terms of inheritance thinking like that has to stop i have a profession and ill return to it to kill for money but if your baby had been a boy he would have inherited he said softly its unjust you think that bothers me im sure it doesnt fine she said flatly so thats settled you neednt worry the escutcheon is firmly fixed in the male line so theres no point in me stabbing you in the middle of the night or putting arsenic in your porridge toast he said i dont eat porridge she blinked this conversation was crazy but maybe that was the way to go shed had enough of being serious you dont eat porridge she demanded mock horrified what sort of a laird are you im not a laird oh yes you are she said starting to smile or you probably are fancy clothes or not you have definite laird potential i thought i was an earl youre that too she told him and of course youll stay that as long as you live but being laird is a much bigger responsibility i dont even know what a laird is the terms not used so much any more she said it means a landed proprietor but its more than that its one who holds the dignity of an estate angus was absolutely a laird im not sure what sort of laird rory would have made kenneth would never have been one but you hamish douglas will you make a laird that sounds like a challenge he said and she jutted her chin a little and met his look head on maybe it is he hesitated not sure where to take this not at all sure that she wasnt just a little crazy herself maybe id best stay in town he said ill come back in the morning to organise things theres not much to organise she told him but you need to stay here theres only the black stump pub and thursday is darts night theres no sleep to be had in the black stump before three in the morning anyway if anyone moves out it should be me its your home now not mine but you will stay he said urgently i need to learn about the place what do you intend to do with it there was only one answer to that sell her face stilled can you do that ive checked actually marcia had checked if i put the money into trust then yes the capital needed to stay intact but the interest aloneplus the rent rolls from the land in scotlandwould keep him wealthy even without his own money you dont need me to help you sell it she snapped and then bit her lip im sorry i know selling seems sensible butbut she took a deep breath and suddenly her voice was laced with emotionand pain ill stay tonight tomorrow ill pack and go stay with my sister until i can arrange a flight home susie theres no need there is a need she said and suddenly her voice sounded almost desperate but why because i keep falling in love she snapped the desperation intensifying i fell so far into love with rory that his death broke my heart i fell for angus and now ive fallen for your stupid castle for your dumb suits of armourtheyre called eric and ernst by the way and they like people chatting to themfor your stupid compost system which is second to none in the entire history of the western worldive even fallen for your worms i keep breaking my heart and im not going to do it any more im going home to the states and im going back to landscape gardening and rose and i are going to live happily ever after now if youll excuse me i need to finish my work bring your gear in you can have any bedroom you like upstairs the whole top floor is yours rose and i are downstairs but i need to do some fast digging before rose wakes from her nap dinners at seven and theres plenty to spare ill see you in the kitchen and without another word she brushed past him out of the conservatory and back into the brilliant autumn sunshine she grabbed her spade shed left leaning against the fence and headed off the way theyd come her back was stiff and sether spade was over her shoulder like a soldier carrying a gunshe looked the picture of determination but he wasnt fooled hed seen the glimmer of unshed tears as shed turned awayand as she reached the garden gate she started stiffly to run kirsty hes here the new owner susie had been crying kirsty could hear it in her voice and her heart stilled sweetheart is he horrid is he another kenneth ill be right there i dont need you to come there was an audible sniff then whats wrong hes going to sell susies sister paused shed known this would happen it was inevitable but somehowsomehow shed hoped susie had come so far dreadfully injured in the engineered car crash which had killed her husband susie had drifted into a depression so deep it had been almost crippling but with this place with her love for the old earl with her love for the wonderful castle garden and her enchantment with her baby daughter shed been hauled back from the brink for the last few months shed been back to the old susie laughing bossy full of plans anguss death had been expected a peaceful end to a long and happy life but kirsty knew that her twin hadnt accepted it yet hadnt moved on kirsty was a doctor and shed seen this before loving and caring for someone to the end watching them fade but never really coming to terms with the reality that the end meant the end so she said at last cautiously and susie hiccuped back a sob im going home back to the states tomorrow um i suspect you wont be able to get travel papers for rose by tomorrow i have a passport for her already there are only a couple of lastminute documents i need to organise can i come and stay with you and jake until then sure kirsty said uneasily mentally organising her house to accommodate guests they were extending the back of the house to make a bigger bedroom for the twinsand for the new little one she hadnt quite got round to telling her sister aboutbut theyd squash in somehow but why whats he like hes gorgeous silence isee kirsty turned thoughtful so why do you want to come and stay at our house dont you trust yourself its not like that no no susie snapped its just hes not like rory and hes not like angus and i cant bear him to be here justowning everything he doesnt even know about compost i said we had the best compost system in the world and he looked at me like i was talking swahili normal in fact hes not normal he wears cream suede shoes right dont laugh at me kirsty cameron when have i ever laughed at you all the time can i come and stay not tonight tomorrow ill air one of the new rooms and see if i can get the paint fumes out you can surely bear to stay with him one night orwould you like me to come and stay with you no i meanwell he offered to stay at the pub so he must be safe enough i said he could stay would you like to borrow boris fat lot of good boris would be as a guard dog hes looked after us before kirsty said with dignity ok boris was a lanky misbred overboisterous dog but hed proved a godsend in the past faint laughter returned to her sisters voice at that he did hes wonderful but im fine ill feed lord hamish douglas and give him a bed tonight and then ill leave him to his own devices the smile died from her words oh but kirsty to see him sell the castlei dont see how i can bear it the castle was stunning while susie finished her gardening hamish took the opportunity to explore and he was stunned it was an amazing overthetop mixture of grandeur and kitsch the old earl hadnt stinted when it came to building a castle as a castle ought to be builtto last five hundred years or more but into his grand building hed put furnishings that were anything but grand hamish had an aunt molly whod love this stuff he thought of molly as he winced at the truly horrible plastic chandeliers hung along the passageways at the plastic plants in plastic urns at the cheap gilt louis xiv tables and chairs and at the settees with bright gold crocodile legs it was so awful it was brilliant then he opened the bathroom door and queen victoria gazed down at him in blatant disapproval from behind an aspidistra he burst out laughing but he closed the door fast a man couldnt do what a man had to do under that gaze hed have to find another bathroom or head to the pub more exploring he found another bathroom this one fitted with a chandelier so large it almost edged out the door the portrait here was of henry the eighth ok he could live with henry he found five empty bedrooms and chose one with a vast fourposter bed and a view of the ocean that took his breath away he decided staying here was possible susie was still digging in the garden below he watched her for a minuteand went back to thinking staying here was fraught with difficulties what had she said shed fallen in love with a castle a compost bin the worms she was digging out of the mud right now shed cried the set look of her shoulders said she might still be crying he didnt do tears the smile hed had on his face since hed met queen victoria faded he put susies emotion carefully away from him he sorted his gear hanging shirts neatly jackets neatly lining up shoes he had enough clothes to last him a week otherwise hed have to find a laundry marcia called him a control freak marcia was right almost involuntarily he crossed to the window again susie was digging with almost ferocious intensity taking out her pain on the mud he saw her pause and wipe her overalled arm across her eyes she was crying he should stay at the pub darts or not that was dumb fleeing emotion what sort of laird did that make him he owned this pile he was lord hamish douglas ridiculous if his mother knew what was happening shed cry too he thought and then winced too many tears for the first part of his life tears had been all hed known when hed been three his father had suicided that was his first memory too many women too many tears endless sobbing the tears hadnt stopped his mother had held her husbands death to her heartover his headfor the rest of her life she held it still her voice came back to him in all its pathos wash your knees hamish your father would hate it if he saw his son with grubby knees oh i cant bear it that he cant be here to see tears do your homework hamish oh if you fail tears or as hed shown no signs of failing your father would be so proud and the sobbing would continue endlessly his mother her friends his aunts thered been tears every day of his life until hed broken away fiercely among floods of recriminationsand more tearsand made his own life hed taken a job in manhattan far away from his californian home far from the tears he hated the cryingthe endless emotion hated it his job now was an oasis of calm where emotions were the last thing he needed marcia was cool calm and selfcontained nary a tear that was his life he shouldnt have come he thought this title thing was ridiculous hed never use it marcia thought it was great and if she wanted to use the lady bit then that was fine by him marcia would never cry hed call her he decided retrieving his cell phone manhattan was sixteen hours behind here four in the afternoon here made it midnight back home marcia would be in bed reading the longwinded legal briefs she read as avidly as some read crime novels she answered on the first ring hamish fabulous youre there then should i address you as lord douglas cut it out marcia he said uncomfortably and she backed off in an instant that was the great thing about marcia she never intruded on his personal space im sorry did you have a good journey fine thank you there was a moments pause marcia was expecting him to say something else he knew but he was still watching susie under his window susie was digging as if her life depended on it whats it like marcia said eventually all patience the castle crazy queen victorias in my bathroom who queen vic its ok ive changed to one with henry the eighth what are you talking about portraits in the bathroom the place is full of kitsch queen victoria is a trifledistracting oh she sounded annoyed for heavens sake hamish just take it down thatd be sensible he thought hed take all the portraits down hed send them to his aunty molly as soon as susie left was there anyone there to meet you rory douglass widow the lawyer told us about rory douglas he did she said and he could hear her leafing through documents till she found what she wanted ive got the letter here he was murdered by his brother which is why you inherited whats she like emotional a lachrymose widow she said with instant sympathy my poor hamish how awful will she be hard to move what do you mean if shes been living thereshes not a tenant for life or anything is she you can still sell she offered to move out tonight thats great i can hardly kick her out tonight he said and heard her regroup well of course not will you need to use some of the inheritance to resettle her do you think does she have somewhere to go shes american shes coming home not entirely silly then marcia said with approval she has plans what about you how long do you think itll take to put the place on the market ill paint a for sale sign on the gate tomorrow be serious she told him hamish this is a lot of money if the place is full of kitsch youd best clean it out so it doesnt put potential buyers off will it sell as a potential hotel that much he knew yes then there are specialist realtors international hotel dealers ill get back to you with names fine was it fine of course it was fine what marcia suggested was sensible he thought about posting queen victoria to his aunt molly he watched susie steak and chips hamish had only partly opened the kitchen door when susies voice announced the menu he blinked gazing around the room in something approaching awe this room was built to feed an army it had huge overhead beams a wonderful flagstoned floor an efficient gas range as well as an oldfashioned slow combustion stove how do you like your steak she demanded she was being brisk she wasnt crying emotion had been put on the backburner and she was being fiercely efficient medium rare he said and she smiled great then her smile faded just a little medium rare eh is that a problem it might be she said cautiously it depends on what on how it turns out i was planning on beans on toast before you arrived much more dependable you know where you are with a bean he agreed and she looked at him with suspicion dont you give me a hard time kirstys bad enough kirsty my sister she and her husband are the local doctors kirsty said i have to give you something good to celebrate your first night here she dropped off the steaks a few minutes ago she would have stayed to meet you but she has evening clinic and was in a rush but she left boris just in case you turn nasty boris wasapparentlya nondescript brownish dog of the heinz variety who was currently lying under a high chair a toddlera little girl about a year oldwas waving a rusk above the dogs head and the dog had immolated himself upside down all legs in the air waiting with eternal patience for the rusk to drop the dog hadnt so much as looked up as hamish had entered every fibre of his being was tuned to the rusk some guard dog what will boris do if i turn nasty he asked and susie grinned hell think of something hes a very resourceful dog she produced a fryingpan and then looked doubtfully at the steaks the steaks lay in all their glory on a plate by the stove they looked magnificent how are you planning on cooking them hamish asked ill fry them she said with a vague attempt at confidence that doesnt sound too difficult youre cooking chips theyre oven fries she confessed kirsty brought them as well you put them in the oven you set the timer for twenty minutes and you take them out again even i cant mess that up probably she was making a huge effort to be cheerful he thought and hed try to join her tell me youre not responsible for queen victoria he said and she grinned she had a great grin he thought he was reminded suddenly of jodie jodie would love loganaich castle aunty deirdre is responsible for queen vic susie told him angus gave her carte blanche to decorate the castle as she saw fitbut he also gave her a very small budget i think she did great she surely did he said faintly susie brushed past him on her way to the fridge and he started feeling even more disoriented shed showered since hed last seen her or since hed last smelt her she was wearing clean jeans and a soft pink tshirt tucked in her hair was still in a ponytail but it was almost controlled now and she smelt like citrus fresh and lemony nice mama the little girl said mama sweetheart susie said and that was enough to slam reality home his mother always called him sweetheart when she was trying to manipulate him he stopped thinking how nice she smelt and thought instead how great it was that he had his marcia and his whole life controlled and hed never have to cope with this sort of messy tearful existence susie was carrying a tub of dripping to the stove she scooped out a tablespoon or more into the frying pan then looked at it dubiously what are you doing he said faintly and she raised her eyebrows as if hed said something stupid cooking deep frying or shallow frying is there a difference he sighed yes but with that amount of fat in the pan youre doing neither the chips are already in the oven yes how long have they been in five minutes how do you have your steak any way i can get it then youll have it medium rare as well and i have five minutes before i start cooking can you find me an apron youre kidding no gee she said stunned but willing not only to hand over cooking but to be admiring while she was at it you really can cook i can cook steak would you like to make a salad too her voice said she knew she was pushing her luck it was almost teasing i can mix up chopped lettuce and tomato but anything else is problematic he sighed i can make a salad but i do need an apron an apron she said as if shed never heard of such a thing something to cover i know what an apron is she said with dignity she looked down at her faded workworn clothes i just never use one but ill bet that deirdre was an apron lady she turned and searched a capacious drawer by the door hey she held up something that took hamishs breath away bright pink with purple roses bib and skirt the garment had flounces all round the edge and a huge pink ribbon at the back good old deirdre susie said in satisfaction i knew she wouldnt let me down youll look great in this yeah right he could just see the next front page of the financial review there were guys back home whod kill to see this and he was well known enough to hit the social pages of the tabloids he eyed susie in suspicion mobile phones could also be cameras if you wore an apron like this you trusted no one you have a washing machine he demanded trying not to sound desperate i have a washing machine then ill make do without the apron some things were nobrainers just this once thats big of you she told him laying the frills aside with regret why are you tipping out the dripping that was half an inch of fat and if you thing im spoiling my first australian steak you have another think coming ooh she said in mock admiration bossy as well as a good cook watch your fries he told her disconcerted hey well get on fine she said happily you can cook i cant a marriage made in heaven then she realised what shed said and she blushed the blush started from her eyes and moved out and he thought shes lovely shes just gorgeous rose chortled from her high chair and hamish allowed himself to be distracted he needed to be distracted whew rose was a chubby toddler dressed only in a nappy and a grubby tshirt reading my aunty went to new york and all she brought me was one lousy tshirt she had flamecoloured curls just like her mother and huge green eyes that gazed at him as if expecting to be vastly entertained it was very disconcerting to be gazed at like that hed never been gazed at like that in truth hamish had never met a toddler this situation was getting out of hand rosie chortled again raised her hand and lifted her rusk it fell on the floor beneath on his back boris did a fast curving slide so his mouth was right where it needed to be the rusk disappeared without a trace rose and her motherand hamishall gazed at boris boris gazed back up at rose in adoration and then opened his mouth wide again hamish laughed susie stared what he said disconcerted and she flushed and turned away nnothing something its just for a minute she took a deep breath the douglas men she said angus and rory had the same laugh low and rumbly and nice and its here again in this kitchen where it belongs for a moment neither of them spoke did she know what power she had to move him he wondered hed never known his father oh he had a vague memory of someone being there a grey silent ghostlike presence but that was all hed seen faded photographs of a man who didnt look like him he had no connection at all and suddenly he did he didnt do emotion im hardly a douglas he said more sharply than hed intended my father died when i was three and ive had no contact with anyone but my mothers family but you are a douglas in name only you dont want to be a douglas not if it means all this emotion he thought but he didnt say it move over he told her instead its time to put the steak on four minutes either side which gives me time to whip up a salad but theres no time for idle chat you dont do idle chat no ill concentrate on my chips then she told him and proceeded to sit on the floor flick on the oven light and watch which was distracting all on its own i know when to butt out where im not wanted i didnt mean to be rude neither did i she told him but maybe thats the way we have to be you dont want to be a douglas i cant bear to be near one so lets get tonight over with and then we can both move on in the direction we intend to go chapter three she woke to singing she must be dreaming she decided and closed her eyes but a moment later she opened them again ill be true to the song i sing and live and die a pirate king it was a rich deep baritone wafting in from the window out to the garden straight out of gilbert and sullivan hamish it was early too early shed had trouble getting to sleep rosie was still soundly sleeping and she didnt have to get up yet she didnt want to get up yet she closed her eyes it is it is a glorious thing to be a pirate king she opened one eye and looked at her clock six am the man was mad she decided singing in the vegetable garden at six in the morning it was a great voice ok shed just look she rolled out of bed crawled across the floor under the level of the sill then raised herself cautiously so she was just peeking he was digging her path her path the window was open and the curtains were drawn before shed even thought logically shed shoved her hands on the sill and swung herself out what do you think youre doing hamish paused in middig he was wearing shorts and boots nothing else this wasnt a stockbrokers body susie thought as he set down his spade and decided what to say the man had a serious sixpack he was tanned and muscledas if hed spent half his life on a farm rather than in a stockbrokers office he had great legs oh for heavens sake whose boots are they she demanded and then thought what a ridiculous question to ask but the boots were decrepitsurely not carefully brought over from new york i found them in the wet room he told her looking like he was trying not smile theres a whole pile i figured if i inherited the castle with contents included then at least one lot of boots must be mine theyre a size or two big but im wearing two pairs of socks what do you think will i take manhattan by storm he raised a knee to hold up a boot for inspection boris had been supervising the pathdigging lying down now the big dog rose put out a tongue and licked the specified boot just tasting it was such a ridiculous statementsuch a ridiculous situationthat susie started to giggle then she suddenly thought about what she was wearing and stopped giggling maybe she should hop right back in through the window but hed already noticed nice elephants he said politely and she thought yep the window was a good idea she was wearing a pair of shortvery shortboxertype pyjama bottoms and a top that matched purple satin with yellow and crimson elephants there was a story behind these elephants susies two little stepnieces had wanted pyjamas with elephants on them harriet from the post office had been in sydney for a week to visit an ailing sister and had thus been commissioned to find pyjama material with elephants what shed found had been royal purple satin with yellow and red elephantsthe lot going much cheaper by the roll harriet had been so pleased that shed bought the entire roll and every second person in dolphin bay was now sporting elephantcovered nightwear theyre homemade susie managed i know the seamstress she managed a smile and hamish thoughtnot for the first timewhat a lovely smile she had shell make you some too if you like no thank you he said hurriedly and she grinned you could really take new york by storm with these i dont think manhattan is ready for those pyjamas there was a silence she was trying not to look at his sixpack he looked like he was trying not to look at her pyjamas what are you doing she asked as much to break the silence as anything though it was obvious the garden was in the full fruit of late autumn the fruit trees were laden the lavender hedge was alive with earlymorning bees everything was neat and shipshape and the only discordant note was the path shed started digging shed dug the first twenty yards twenty yards had taken her two days hamish had dug another fifteen i assume you wanted the rest dug he told her she bit her lip i did its just ive put the soil in the compost area he told her guessing her qualms ive left it separate so you can mix it as you want one question answered and the worms are in the yellow bucket he told her answering her second he was laughing at her hed done what represented over a days work she should be grateful she was grateful but he was laughing worms are important she said defensively and he nodded ive always thought so but not the kind that come out of your eyeballs theres no need to mock im not mocking more silence you dont get muscles like those sitting behind a desk she said tentatively she felt she shouldnt mention those musclesbut she was unable to stop looking at them i work out you use a gym theres a gym in the building where i live of course more silence while she tried again not to concentrate on muscles oh ok shed look guys looked at goodlooking women all the time she could do a little payback so im not doing the wrong thing he prompted when the silence got a bit stretchedand she hauled her thoughts together and tried to think what she ought to be saying what she should be looking at ofof course youre not im very grateful what are you planning on doing once youve dug i have a pile of pavers under the lemon tree she pointed there he looked and winced they look like they weigh a ton you were going to lay them yourself of course i was but youve been injured he said the lawyer told me im fine you limp i dont limp much im fine she took a deep breath moving on not that it matters theyre your pavers now susie do you have to leave so soon i im here for three weeks he said urgently i had a phone call this morning from the states thats why im up early a combination of jetlag and a phone call at four the best way to sell this place do i want to hear this susie thought but she hardly had a choice is via a realtor who specialises in selling exclusive country hotels he comes assesses potential and if he likes what he sees then hell put this place on his list of vendors and promote the place internationally hell be in australia next week marcia thinks i should persuade you to stay till then marcia susie wondered but she didnt ask why do you want me to stay you know the history of the place the agent holds that important if people come to an exclusive location they want the personal touch theyll want to know about angus and the family and the castle back in scotland all its history ill write it out for you ill sell the place for more if youre here to give a guided tour hamish said flatly widow of the incumbent earls heir if you think youre going to play on rorys murder to get your atmosphere i didnt say that you didnt need to she told him and glowered but will you stay ill pay you why will you pay me well he considered you could still pave the garden he eyed her assessing and guessing her weakness you would like to get this path finished i would she admitted and bit her lip then im happy to pay landscape gardening hourly rates think about it he saidand went right back to digging leaving her to think about it which slightly discomposed her shed expected moreargument staying on here was dumb she thought more than dumb she looked at hamishs broad bare back and she thought that staying could be unsettling would be unsettling she hadnt looked at another man since rory had died and of course she never would but there was that about hamish which made her very solid foundations seem just a little shaky round the edges she didnt want her foundations shaken her world had been shaken quite enough for one lifetime so she should go immediately but then she and rose had lived here for over a year shed started packing after angus had died but her efforts had been desultory to say the least she needed to get organised todays deadline might not be actually feasible she thought about it for a bit more she watched hamish dig some more hed have blisters she decided seeing him almost inconspicuously shift the spade in his hands she knew what he was doing shed done it herself often and often he was finding unblistered skin to work with he was strong and willing but he wasnt accustomed to this sort of work he was a manhattan moneymaker the locals would hate the idea of the new laird being such a man but that started more ideas forming hamish was asking a favour of her maybe she could ask one of him anguss death had left such a void maybe they could have a laird one last time she thought maybe ill do it but not for payment she called out and he looked up surprised as if he hadnt expected to see her still to be there youll stay yes she grinned ill even cook more fries i can do toast too and porridge if youre game he smiled at that and she thought yep there it was again the douglas chuckle and the douglas smile in a body that wasnt a douglas body at all it was a body she knew nothing about and wanted to know nothing about she had to get those foundations steady i look forward to meeting your toast but not your porridge mrs douglas he told her formally and she managed to smile back and then thought maybe smiling wasnt such a good idea he didnt have enough clothes on she didnt have enough clothes on it was too early in the morning he was a douglas tomorrows the dolphin bay harvest thanksgiving fête she told him as he started digging again we need a laird pardon he bent to separate some worms and then dug a couple more spadefuls the laird opens the fête its traditional no ones doing it tomorrow because everyones still mourning angus but not having anyone there will be awful maybe we should do it in stages maybe we could use you tomorrow as the last of the douglases his spade paused in mid airand then kept digging you know i might not be the last of the douglases he said cautiously the douglas clan appear to be quite prolific in fact if i give you the phone book you might find almost as many douglases as smiths greens and nguyens no but as far as i know youre the only lord douglas in this neck of the woods which leaves mewhere opening the fête tomorrow another pause in the digging another resumption which involves what exactly saying a few words just i now declare this fête open after the bagpipes stop bagpipes he said even more cautiously and susie thought the man wasnt as silly as he looked actually he didnt look the least bit silly and hed guessed where she was headed she could see the suspicion growing and she almost giggled its a very nice kilt she said he set down his spade and turned to her in all seriousness dont ask it of me susie i have knobbly knees she did giggle then i can see them from here theyre very nice knees i only show them to other douglases me you mean you and my mother notmarcia marcia has the sense not to look he told her id never have exposed them to you but you woke unreasonably early normally i have huge signs out caution exposed knees so that lets me out of fête opening then im off to pack susie this is a business trip he said and there was suddenly more than a trace of desperation in his voice im not an earl im not lord douglas in this day and age it doesnt make any sense i wont use the title ill sell the castle and ill get back to my ordinary life you sound afraid she said and he cast her a look that said she wasnt far off the mark thats dumb why would i be afraid its not so scary standing in a kilt and saying a few words people will expect theyll expect nothing she said softly the people here loved uncle angus he was their laird you wont know the story but this castle saved the town after the war the men depended on the schools of couta to make their livinggreat long fish you catch by trawling in relatively shallow water but some diseaseworms actuallyhit the couta and the men didnt have boats big enough for deepsea fishing everyone was starting to leave it was either leave or starve but then along came angus he saw this place fell in love with it and realised the only thing that could keep it going was another industry so he persuaded the guardians of his family trustyour family trustto let him rebuild his castle here the men worked on the castle while they gradually rebuilt the fishing fleet the people here loved angus to bits and his death has caused real heartache you wearing a kilt tomorrowno it wont bring angus back but maybe itll fill a void that for many may seem unbearable emotion hamish thought more emotion but susies chin was tilted upward she was defiant rather than lachrymose throwing him a dare open a fête it was a dumb emotional thing to do it had no foundation in logic and he should run a mile why are you digging my path she asked i was bored what are you going to do until this assessor gets here ill go through the castle books ill get rid of some kitsch he thought but he didnt say it marcia was researching a place where he could hire some decent antiques to make the place look firstclass maybe queen vic could stay queen vic was in a plastic gilt frame shed been a cheap print and was a bit frayed around the edges keeping queen vic would be a dumb emotional decision and he needed to stay tight here the castle books are in the hands of the executors susie told him mr oshannasys the local solicitor but his office is always closed fridays that means you cant start work until monday which leaves the weekend free for fair opening i have a path to dig its my path she said almost belligerently and then stopped i mean no emotion its your path until you leave he said hurriedly which is today unless you open the fête why is it so important i just dont want the stage to be empty its a sentimental gesture whats wrong with that im a businessman you can be a businessman again when you leave here be lord douglas for a bit its your title enjoy it i would have thought lords enjoy themselves byi dont know holding lavish banquets driving lamborghinis you can have porridge and toast for breakfast well put marmalade on top of the toast banana on top of the porridge and call it a banquet and ill drive you to the fête in anguss old ford it has four wheels same as a lamborghini whats your problem i dont have a kilt he said backed against a figurative wall but still fighting no her face grew thoughtful and anguss would be too small he was a much shorter man she hesitated he saw the telltale wash of emotion cross her face and he flinched but she had hold of herself again my husband used to come here often beforebefore he went overseas and we were married angus had a kilt made for him from the family tartan youre almost the same size great hed go to a fête wearing the kilt of this womans dead husband but shed read his expression im not asking for sympathy here she told him and there was suddenly anger flooding her voice you can stop looking as if youre expecting me to burst into tears and tell you youre just like my rory i never he had i dont need you she snapped of course you dont need me its just the townso many of the old peopletheyll come tomorrow and angus has only been dead for a few weeks and theyll see the empty stage and itll stay with them and spoil their fête if you get up in your kilt and open the thing and wander round for a bit and dont tell people youre selling just say youre not exactly sure whats happening then the locals will have a splendid talking point instead of a focus for grief the fête was threatening to be dismal you have it in your power to retrieve things i dont want you want whats right for the castle she snapped you want the best monetary outcome you told me yourself you can get that if i stay on until the assessor comes so use your head and not your heart hamish douglas wheres the sense in refusing she had a point but i dont think i want to he said weakly and she cast him a look that contained pure triumph she had him and she knew it ill go look out the kilt she told him youre skinnier than rory we may need to adjust it and quit the digging you have more blisters than you need already breakfast in half an hour eryes the first of your many banquets here my lord she told him she grinnedand went to find her lord a kilt hes like a fish out of water actually he was in water hamish was in the shower his bathroom was right above susies and as shed dialled her sisters number hed started singing the pirate king was being given another airing and a good one hes here to make money out of the place she told kirsty hes going to sell i should hate him but she hesitated its like hes some big new york financier but theres someone else underneath someone nice he sings susie explained and held the receiver out so kirsty could hear umgreat kirsty said back on the line after a moments bemused listening theres lots of testosterone in that there baritone are you interested some questions were dumb why would i be interested susie demanded anyway im just ringing to tell you that you can come and take your dog back im quite safe and hes agreed to open the fête tomorrow hes agreed there was a moments stunned silence and then something that sounded like a sniff from the other end of the line hes opening the fête wearing the douglas tartan wearing the douglas tartan oh susie you wont weep on him will you susie asked becoming nervous and kirsty sniffed again no but everyone else will theyd better not hell run once hes opened the fête he can run all he wants kirsty said directly that empty stage was going to seem awful but for the opening to go to another douglas itll almost seem like a happy ending yeah well its not susie said suddenly breathless orwell i guess it is an ending and its better than it might be thisll be something like closure but hes really nice kirsty demanded and susie flushed she was kirstys twin and she knew where her sisters thoughts were headed often before kirsty did she knew where they were headed now and she had no wish to go there my daughter is attempting to climb onto the back of your dog she told her sister with what she hoped was dignity i need to go and she replaced the receiver on any more conjecture things were formal at breakfast hamish was dressed again as he might dress for a casual stroll down fifth avenue understated expensive cool susie had dressed in shorts and a tshirt which stayed pristine until she gave rose her first piece of toast and rose gave it back she was therefore decorated with a raspberry streak centre front not so cool no matter there was a small glitch when hamish refused porridge susie thought this was one of the few things she could cookand what sort of a douglas was he if he didnt eat porridgebut she finally decided magnanimously to overlook it they ate their toast with only social pleasantries expressed between mouthfuls hamish appeared not to notice rosie and boris doing their best to make him laugh he didnt comment on susies raspberry streak he appeared to have switched into another mode one where he was polite and courteous but otherwise remote fine she could handle this she decided a nonporridgeeating douglas they finished eating susie wiped off her small daughter then somewhat at a loss she offered a full tour and her offer was accepted this was good susie thought as she led the way through the castle she carried rose boris following behind as she opened room after room and explained the contents formality would get them through the next few days it was only when hamish stopped being polite and grinned that her insides started doing funny things this is bedroom number seven i saw this yesterday hamish said politely all by myself you looked through the bedrooms by yourself i was choosing one you told me i could any on the first floor theyre your bedrooms she said and flushed am i boring you its a very nice castle im boring you what about the beach he asked the sea was right out every northfacing window tantalising with its sapphire shimmer theres a track just over the road she told him when the place is turned into a hotel you may need to build an inclinator its a bit steep but the track leads to the beach yes a swimmable beach very much so youre going to offer to show me you can find it yourself you can scarcely miss it head north and when it feels wet youve reached the sea do boris and rose like the sea i yes keep it formal keep it formal ill go and see it by myself then shall i if you like keep quiet dummy its safe for swimming its great for swimming ill get changed then he said ill be back for lunch keep quiet keep quiet she couldnt keep quiet i cant get down to the beach by myself she said sense disappearing and desperation taking over this had been the hardest part of living here with rose with her weak legs the track was too steep to negotiate carrying a baby and to live so close and not have access almost killed her she could only go to the beach when someone was there to help carry rose not with say it she told herself say it ii have a bbad leg she stammered he paused he looked at her formality took a slight backward step you cant get down to the beach not carrying rose but you like the beach i love the beach so does boris and so does rose we all love it so if i carried rose to hell with formality we could all go she said enthusiasm taking over i could pack a hamper we could take an umbrella and a rug for rose to snooze on when she gets tired how long are we staying he demanded startled hours and hours she said happily if im leaving this place for good in a few days then i need all the sea i can get when this place is a luxury hotel itll be beyond my reach for the rest of my life so all i have to do is carry rose and the hamper and the picnic basket and rug you may have to take two trips youre a manipulator the beach is worth it chapter four he carried the hamper the beach umbrella and the rug down to the beach and left them there boris accompanied him bounding down the track with the air of a dog about to meet canine heaven when hamish returned for the next load boris bounded up again panting with expectancy seeming as anxious as susie was that his pseudomistress wasnt left behind susie was waiting dressed in a pale lemon sarong her arms full of rose and roses necessities hamish will take us to the sea susie told rose handing her over and the little girl beamed leaned over and wrapped her arms around hamishs neck he froze the feel of a babys arms feltweird really weird hamish had never held a baby in his life and hed expected itherto cry or at least hold herself rigid instead of which she clung happily to his neck and started crooning ee ee ee she hasnt quite got the hang of s susie told him and rose giggled as if her mother had just made a wonderful joke youre ok to get down yourself he asked and susies smile turned to a glower in an instant ive got down under worse conditions than this some ill tell you about it you take rose and ill follow so he did but he carried rose slowly not wanting to get too far ahead of roses mother aware that the climb was a struggle for susie and she hurt more than she admitted he thought suddenly that what he really wanted to do was scoop her up in his arms and carry her down but even if he hadnt been carrying her child he knew that shed swipe away any such effort but finally they reached the sand boris was off chasing seagulls the little cove was deserted susie lifted rose from his arms and started undressing herand hamish had time to look around him and take stock hed never seen a beach like this it was a cove sheltered from rough seas or winds by two rocky outcrops reaching three or four hundred yards from either side of the beach the little cove was maybe two or three hundred yards longno more the sand was soft golden and sunwarmed there were two vast eucalypts somehow emerging from the base of the cliffs to throw dappled shade if you wanted to be in the shade there were rock pools toward the end of the cove the waves at one end of the cove were high enough to form low surf but at the more sheltered end there were no waves at all here the water sloped out gently making the sea a nursery pool to beat the finest nursery pool anyone could ever imagine you see why i cracked and asked for help susie asked she was kneeling on the rug removing rosies nappy and plastering her with sunblock i cant bear not to be down here why did you have to crack before you asked she hesitated i dont like to ask for help its more than that isnt it he said youre afraid of me no i what did my cousin do to you its not that tell me she flinched carefully she replaced the tube of sunblock in her holdall and then set her naked daughter on the sand rose started crawling determinedly toward boris seeing boris was chasing gulls in circles here was an occupation that was going to take some time hamish waited giving susie space finally she sat back on her heels and gazed out to sea they were both your cousins she whispered kenneth and rory kenneth killed rory so hed inherit all thisand when he discovered i was pregnant he tried to kill me as well he hauled me and my twin kirsty onto a boat right here in this cove and tried to drive us onto rocks she shivered but then gave a tentative smile but were tough no one messes with the mcmahon twins youre a twin yep and proud of it kirsty fell for the local doctor and they married last year she now has two little stepdaughters and is fast becoming a local but you want to go home my life is in the states its time to get on with it you either get on with life or you die she said simply i was a mess for a while but ive come out the other side so why are you afraid of me im not afraid i think you are rose needs a swim she said almost angrily its too good a day to mess with by talking about whats past i agree he told her i could use a swim too the wave end is better for swimming she told him rose and i use the end without waves different ends now how did i know you were going to say that just swim she snapped enough with the psychoanalysis this might be the last time i swim in this place and i intend to enjoy it susie spent the next hour in the shallows and she was aware of hamish every single minute she took rosie up to her knees in water then sat with the little girl on her lap while the wavelets washed over them rosie splashed and cooed and giggled and susie giggled with herbut still she watched hamish he was a strong swimmer she decided he used a clean efficient stroke that said hed been properly trained and he wasnt out of practice he took no chances in an unknown environment not going deeper than chest depth but stroking strongly from one end of the cove to the other and back again when he wearied of swimming he bodysurfed catching the white breakers with an ease that said hed done this too he was glorying in the water in the sun and in the day just as much as she was she thought she watched his lithe body slicing through the water with something akin to jealousy he looked free he was free to live in this place if he wanted he didnt want he intended to make money from it and leave finally rose started wearying she curled into her mothers lap and snuggled and susie struggled upright and carried her daughter up the beach to dry her off and give her lunch she fed rose and gave her a bottle while she fed her daughter hamish still didnt come near instead he threw driftwood over and over into the waves for boris boris would take as much of this as anyone would give him and hamish gave him a lot but as rose snuggled down and closed her eyes in satisfied sleep hamish came jogging up the beach to join them he looked fantastic susie thought wide shoulders tapering to narrow hips not an ounce of spare flesh on him his tanned skin coated in a fine mist of sand his black curls flopping forward making him look almost endearing cut it out she told herself urgently get your hormones back where they belong there are sandwiches here she managed rose and i have eaten would you like some food he fell to his knees like a man who hadnt seen food for a week and as he bit into her sandwiches susie had another of thosemoments watching him enjoy the food shed prepared there was nothing sexy about it at all she told herself crossly but she knew that she lied you swim well she told him and if she sounded stiff and formal there wasnt a blind thing she could do about it i was raised in california he told her im an original beach bum ive never seen a beach as good as this though youre still tanned i have a penthouse with a sunroof and a heated pool oh of course youre just a paddler he asked polite as well she thought drat him how dared he put her in this state of she didnt know what i like swimming you werent swimming he pointed out and she flushed right like i can swim when i have an attached fourteenmonthold youd like to swim he asked and she bit back another angry retort im fine rose is asleep you could swim now i dont like leaving rose on the beach by herself shes not by herself he said gently shes with me so she was her baby was soundly asleep she wouldnt wake for a couple of hours hamish was offering her freedom and shed really really like a swim but something was holding her back not distrust exactly more she couldnt put a finger on it you can trust me he said forcing her to try i know youll be able to see her all the time youre swimming go on susie you know youd love to she would whats stopping you nothing swim he told her or ill lift you up and hurl you into the waves with my bare hands id like to see you try i wouldnt he confessed i might have inherited a title but big bad sir brian blipping villagers on the head is a far cry from a wimpish stockbroker who values his back it was only hamish who was making her nervous swimming didnt susie did this often whenever kirsty brought her twins over theyd take turns to play childminder while the other took off into deep water and gloried in the freedom the water allowed it did allow freedom the car accident that had killed rory had damaged susies spine slowly slowly she was recovering from the damage it had caused but she wasnt free to walk and run as shed like stiffness and residual pain held her back but in the water shed always been better than kirsty in the water shed captained her juniorhigh waterpolo team shed been selected to play for the state and only the fact that her life had got busy had stopped her going further but for susie swimming was an extension of breathing now she walked stiffly into the water stood for one lovely lingering anticipatory momentand then knifed forward into an oncoming wave gorgeous just gorgeous the moment she was through the breaker she felt her other life kick in the life shed known before the accident before rorys death before motherhood she was a girl again free her body whole and healthy and ready for whatever the day should bring it almost gave her the courage to face the future she turned to the beach and hamish was watching even from here she could see that he was tense he was sitting on the sand with boris beside him his arm was draped over the dog rosie was curled up close by sound asleep in the shade but hamish was still in the sun he should be lying on the sunwarmed sand and snoozing she thought but he was bolt upright watching he was playing lifeguard she thought suddenly recognising his tension for what it was if she got into trouble hed be down here in a minute surging to her rescue she waved he waved back but the tension didnt ease she grinnedand then the smile died she liked it she realised she liked it a lot that he was playing lifeguard for her whod play lifeguard for her when she went back to the states you wont need a lifeguard she told herself fiercely youll be fine dont even think that you might still need someone youve been depressed before and youre not getting depressed again she turned to face the other end of the cove she put her head downand she swam hamish watched as susie limped down to the shoreline and wasastonished she was beautiful he thought gorgeous but she was also damaged she was wearing a bikini that showed off every lovely curve but it also revealed a wide jagged scar across the small of her back was this the back injury that caused her limp shed lost a husband she was raising a baby on her own he was kicking her out of her castle something inside his gut clenched as he watched her walk into the waves emotional decisions were not appropriate here he told himself fiercely this castle was worth a small fortuneno a large fortuneand to keep a woman and a baby here in perpetuity was ridiculous the lawyers had told him shed been well provided for and shed reiterated that herself she could go back to america and get on with whatever life shed had before shed met this rory character and been dragged into this makebelieve fantasy of titles and castles andemotion he continued to watch as she stood thigh deep in the waves seeming to simply soak in the sun she gazed about her as if taking in the sheer beauty of the cove though she must have seen it so many times she stilled then knifed forward into the oncoming wave and he forgot about the beauty of the cove she simply disappeared her dive into the wave produced nary a splash her body became a streamlined torpedo slicing down and under and it was as if shed never been there she didnt surface he was standing up startling boris whod had his ears resting on his knees boris barked expecting adventure but hamish had his eyes shaded he was moving forward trying to see she surfaced finally fifty yards from where shed gone under one breath a slight turn and then down under again and he was searching once more wherewhere twenty yards this time only twenty yards and she was moving along the cove rather than out to sea another breath hardly perceptiblethe break of her head above water could hardly be seenand then under again swift and sure like a sleek young seal surfacing to breathe but all economy of effort underwater hed never seen anything like it he thought he was a good swimmer but she was magnificent hed run a few steps in those first panicked seconds and boris was bouncing around his legs barking expecting excitement he lifted a piece of driftwood and threw it into the shallows pretending to any unseen onlooker that hed stood specifically to do this that he hadnt panicked that the sight of susie moving with such economy of actionwith such beautydidnt have the power to move him only of course it did have the power to move him he felt he didnt know how he felt boris came streaming back up the beach hauling his driftwood for another throw the stick was laid at his feet and the big dog shook sending a spray of sand and sea hauling hamishs thoughts back to reality to at least some semblance of normality im going back to babysitting he told boris im not watching boris put his head on the side and gazed at him in mute enquiry well im hardly a lifesaver he muttered sitting on the beach hugging the dog and staring out to sea she can swim better than i can theres nothing i can do for your mistress boy except sit with her sleeping baby and give her a few more moments freedom she waved from behind the breakers and he waved back freedom she was glorying in her freedom he thought and suddenly he remembered his office back in manhattan it was a magnificent office he had plateglass windows that looked all the way to the statue of liberty in new york harbor there was still plate glass between him and the sea its just because youve never had a holiday that youre thinking like this he told himself suddenly angry get over it cut it out with the emotion douglas you know where that gets you and you dont want to go there he lay back on the sand and closed his eyes then he half opened one then he shrugged and sat up hed just watch it had been a fabulous swim susie came out of the water laughing with delight pleasure and sheer wellbeing ok she was leaving this place but its memories would stay with her for ever and one of them was this day she shook herself like boris holding her hands out and wiggling her whole body so a spray of water went everywhere boris whod bounded down the beach to meet her backed off as the water hit him and she laughed with delight at her neat reversal of roles she looked up the beach and hamish was watching her she switched back shed had her time out back to being the castle relic she walked up the beach and he rose to meet her holding out her towel she hesitated for a moment just because the gesture seemed curiously intimate which was dumb it meant nothing how many times had kirsty done the same thing she took the towel and retired behind it enveloping her whole face so she didnt have to look at him best beach in the world he said softly and she let her towel drop to her shoulders and tried to smile it is youll hate leaving it i will but ive had it for over a year its time for someone else to enjoy it her smile became a little more determined or many someones all the people wholl come to your hotel its the sensible thing to do to sell it it is you will be all right ill be fine she told him determined thank you for looking after rose ive never babysat before never no no family no brothers or sisters an older cousin who was a creep i think thatd be awful she said being an only kid being a twin was wonderful he thought about that and looked down at her sleeping baby another only kid rose ill surround her with kids she said determined how was she going to do that she didnt have a clue she was going home to juggle baby career life she was not going to let it get her down your sisters here yes she has kids yes why dont you stay here and be dependent on kirsty for the rest of my life no thanks very much independence can be hard i suspect youre a master of it she said im just learning but ill manage susie he beganand then paused as the sound of a motor cut the stillness he turned to watch a dinghy puttputt around the cove it was a simple twoperson craft with a small motor that would have been dangerous on a day that was any less calm than this but it was calm and the two people in the boat looked inordinately pleased with themselves a middleaged couplethe man in a loud hawaiian shirt and the woman in a swimsuit that had even more gardenias on than her husbands shirtwere heading straight for them as they came within earshot the man stood up in the boat rocked precariously and yelled ahoy can we land on this beach are there rocks no rocks susie yelled back relieved her teteatete was over they cruised towards the shore a bit too fast neither got out of the boat until it hit sand then they sat in the rocking boat removed their sandals with care and put their toes into the water as if expecting piranhas no piranhas ooh its lovely albert the lady said its not too cold at all she turned to them and beamed a welcome hi they were americans the place was starting to be overrun with americans susie thought hi she replied while hamish said nothing at all we just wanted to take your picture the woman told her beaming still thats right isnt it albert we brought the boat round from dolphin bay harbour and i saw you through the fieldglasses with your baby asleep and your puppy and you all look beautiful i bet that dogs got dingo in him i said and i said to albert id like to take their picture because you remind me so much of what we were at that age and now lifes an adventure and its wonderful but i just thoughtseeing you two her beam faded a little you dont mind do you she asked suddenly anxious that she might have offended the natives if you give me your name and address ill send you a copy albert is a lovely photographer albert looked bashful but combined beam and bashful very nicely were only in australia for a week the woman went on for five of those days albert has a conference but i said i wasnt going home before id met some real australians so i got a pin and closed my eyes and stuck it in a map of places we could get to from sydney and here we are and i know you arent aboriginal or anything but you so look like you belong anyway can we take your picture um susie said with a sideways glance at the silent hamish what do you thinkluv he grinned her drawl had been an attempt to sound australian but she hadnt quite managed it geez darl i dunno why not he drawled and his accent was so much better than hers that she almost laughed out loud we could do with one of them photo thingies to show the kiddies when they grow up she choked albert suddenly looked suspicious they might already have a camera honey wed be very pleased to have our picture taken susie said this was such a glorious morning she was determined that everyone could enjoy it she glared at hamish what mywhat he meant was thatd itd be an honour to have a picture taken by an american thats all right then honey said obviously thinking the same thing can you cuddle i dont suppose you want to pick the baby up shes just gone to sleep susie said enough was enough but then she grinned and leaned down hoisted the wet and sandcoated dog up and thrust him into hamishs arms there you go darl she said you cuddle the dingo the dingo stuck his nose into hamishs face and slurped gee hamish managed thanksdarl just stand behind the baby honey urged so we can get you all in the shot they did bemused put your arm round her albert urged its all i can do to hold the dingo hamish muttered boris was wiggling like the crazy mutt he was ecstatic ill hold the back half susie said and did that catching boriss legs the dog was now upside down his front end held by hamish and his back half held by susie now cuddle your wife albert said shes not cuddle me darl susie said sweetly you know you want to he cuddled her he stood on the sunwarmed beach with a dog in his arms with rose curled up asleep at his feet with a woman pressed against him and with his arm around her and he smiled at the camera as if he meant it it was like an outofbody experience he thought if marcia could see him now shed think he must have an identical twin this was nothing like he was the selfcontained hamish douglas was a world away he should be in his office now with his hair slicked down wearing a suit and tie in charge of his world instead susie was leaning against him she was still cool to the touch after her swim hed been getting hot on the beach and the cool of her body against his was great not just the cool the smell of her the feel of her she curved right where she ought to curve his arm held her close and she used her free arm to tug him even closer the feel of her fingers on his hip the strength of her tugging him close whew he smiled at the camera but it was all he could do to manage it he needed to go home he thought he needed to put this place on the market and get out of here why was he terrified a vision of his mother came back his mother late at night coming into his room putting her head on his bed and sobbing her heart out i never should have loved if id known itd hurt like this i never never would have loved him oh god hamish the pain he withdrew his arm dropped and susie felt it and moved aside in an instant it had been playacting he knew she hadnt meant to hold him to curve against him as if she belonged where shall we send the pictures honey asked aware as they moved apart that the photo session was definitely over there was something in their body language that told her there was no way shed get them back together again do you have a permanent address somewhere we can send a letter susie gazed at her blankly these people think were dole bludgers sleeping in the back of a clappedout ute hamish said and managed a grin at his mastery of the language and the knowledge that went with it uteshort for utility vehiclea pickup truck and dole bludger hed heard the term on the plane theyd been flying over the coast and the man in the seat beside him had waved to the beach below theres a major social security problem in australia hed told hamish the weathers so good and the surfs so good theres an army of kids who refuse to work they go on social securitythe doleand spend their life surfing go up and down the coast looking for good surf sleeping in the back of utes bloody dole bludgersll be the ruination of this country and it was too much for susie he saw the mischief lurking in her eyes and the laughter threatening to explode and he opened his mouth to stop her but it was too late were no dole bludgers she told them in a tone of offended virtue and in truth were not husband and wife ill have you know that this she pointed to hamish as shed point to some mummified egyptian remains is lord hamish douglas earl of loganaich his address of course is loganaich castle dolphin bay and me im the castle relic and gardener and dogsbody besides she motioned to rose at her feet theres always a baby in these sorts of situations she told them but its probably wiser not to ask any more questions you realise theyll still think were dole bludgers hamish said when he could get a grip on his laughter and was attempting to get a grip on reality the couple were puttputting back out of the cove with albert pausing to take one more shot before they rounded the headland and disappeared from view yeah were high on dope ill probably get a visit from social security susie chuckled i should have told them i was an arabian princess we would have just as much chance at belief but weve made their morning hamish said the tension he felt as hed held susie was dissipating changing to something different shared pleasure in the pure ridiculousness of the moment laughter it was a laughter he hadnt felt before he feltfree theyve got more local colour than they bargained for whats the bet they go into the post office when they go back the post office harriets the postmistress and she has a huge sign out the front advertising information collecting and imparting information is a passion if they go in and say theyve met a crazy beach bum who calls himself a lord theyll get told exactly whats what and theyll be back here for more pictures well retire behind our castle walls and pull up the drawbridge if only it were that easy susie said and the laughter slipped a little i maybe we should go up now i want to get some paving done this afternoon i need to do some cataloguing cataloguing marcia says i should make lists of contents sure she eyed him with more than a little disquiet what will you do with ernst and eric who suits of armour um hed seen them of course hed seen them one could hardly miss them i might give them to a welfare shop he ventured if i can find a welfare shop thatll take them ill buy them why on earth he said cautiously would you want two imitation suits of armour that stand eight feet high and are enough to scare the socks off anyone who comes near when i go home i wont have boris she said with dignity i need eric and ernst besides theyre excellent conversationalists weve reached consensus on most important political points but the ramifications of the kyoto agreement in developing countries still needs some fine tuning he stared at her then he burst out laughing she looked affronted you cant think the ramifications of such an agreement are a laughing matter no he said at once wiping the grin off his face theyre very serious indeed only last week i was telling my potted palm theres no need to mock im not mocking but ernst and eric are yours he told her absolutely who am i to separate a woman from her political sparring partners how are you going to get them home i guess they wont let me take them on the plane you could see if you could get them diplomatic passports i could make a few phone calls eric and ernst born in china and holding views that are decidedly leftwingor i assume theyre leftwing its dangerous to assume anything about ernst and eric she said in a voice that was none too steady i wont ill approach the situation with diplomatic caution but well do our best susie douglas when you leave for america id very much like to see ernst on one side of you on the plane and eric on the other eric is a vegetarian she said with such promptness that he blinked and ernst hates sitting over a wing he choked she was standing in front of him all earnestness the sun glinting on her gorgeous hair the laughter in her eyes conflicting with the prim schoolteacher voice and he felthe felt ill see what i can do he managed but meanwhile i think we should pack up for the day i think ive had a bit too much sun chapter five they were formal for the rest of the day formal to the point of avoiding each other hamish did a bit of cataloguing but there wasnt much point cataloguing imitation chandeliers susie did a bit of packing but her heart wasnt in that either they met briefly for dinner soup and toast susie decreed and hamish didnt argue he ate his soup and toast and then later when susie had gone to bed he ate more toast tomorrow hed have to go on a forage into town and find some decent food he decided then he remembered the next day was the day of the fête and he felt so fainthearted that he stopped feeling hungry and went back to bed and stared at the ceiling for a while he was right out of his comfort zone jodie had told him this was a holiday werent holidays meant to make you feel rested the sounds of the sea were wafting in his open window but the rest of the world was silent after the buzzing background hum of manhattan this seemed like another world it was so silent it soundednoisy the absence of traffic sounds was like white noise he lay and listened and decided he was homesick for manhattan for his black and grey penthouse his austere bathroom without kings or queens watching from gilt frames for his traffic noise for marcia of course for marcia who was he kidding he wasnt homesick he didnt know what he was finally he drifted into sleep where marcia and jodie and susie all jostled for position marcia was silently scornfully watching jodie was standing with hands on hips daring him to be different susie was laughing but while he watched susies laughter turned to tears and he woke in a cold sweat and susie was no longer in his dream she was standing in the open doorway and she was neither laughing or crying she was holding a kilt behold your valet my lord she told him your kilt and all your other various appendages await your noble personage he sat up fast then he remembered he wasnt wearing pyjamas he grabbed his sheetand he blinked at the apparition in the doorway susie was dressed in tartan she wasnt wearing a kilt she was wearing royal blue capri pants stretching neatly around every delicious curve and a gorgeous little top in the same tartan as the kilt she was holding out for him to wear her hair was tied up in some complex knot on top and it was caught up in a tartan ribbon what are you staring at she asked the tartan you might be the head of the clan but im a douglas too this woman was his family he thought dazed move on family was a scary thought his eyes fell to the kilt she was holding out im not wearing that you promised she said with something akin to forcefulness you cant back out now your lordship ive promised as well youve promised well you promised first you said you would and now ive telephoned the organisers and theyve told everyone youre coming theyve trucked in the barram pipe band with an extra piper this year cos last time the piper had a wee bit too much whisky on the bus on the way here and didnt perform to expectation so theres two pipers to pipe you on stage your lordship and a whole pipe band besides and the brownies are doing a guard of honour especially the brownies to say he was hornswoggled was an understatement what on earth are brownies scary little brown persons she said you must have heard of them they sell cookies and do bobajob only now its two dollars and you have to sign forms in triplicate saying they cant hurt themselves when they shine your shoes im lost he complained and she grinned fine stay that way ask no questions just smile and wave like the queen mum you want me to help you to dress no only offering i thought you might have trouble with your sporran an earl he said with cautious dignity especially the ninth earl of loganaich of the mighty clan douglas can surely manage his own sporran tricky things sporrans not to us earls well then she said cheerfully she walked across and dumped a kilt what looked like a small mountain of spare tartan fabric tassles and toggles a purse of some description and a beret with a feather on his bedside chair boris followed behind looking interested there you go your lordship she said happily everything you need to look shipshape come on boris boris can help he said graciously and her grin widened ill leave you with your valet then shall i my lord porridge in the kitchen in thirty minutes toast if youre wearing a sporran you need porridge toast he said in something akin to desperation as the leader of your clan i demand toast she chuckled ooh i love a forceful manin a kilt susie she got her features back under control with difficulty she was back to a grin only your wish is my command she said sir he got a sharp salute clicked heels and she was gone leaving him alone with his valet boris he said cautiously eyeing his pile of tartan as if it might bite what do you think a sporran might be it took him a while it took him close to an hour really but if he was going to do this thing he might as well do it right by the time he had every pleat in place every toggle where it was supposed to be toggling and the feather in his cap at just the right angle he felt like hed done a full days work he gazed in the mirror and thought he had done a good days work he looked unbelievable boris was sitting watching with the patience of all good valets and when hamish finally adjusted his cap and looked at the final result the dog gave a deep low woof as if in appreciation not bad at all hamish told the dog i wish jodie could see me now and marcia marcia couldnt help but be impressed with this he thought but it was jodie he thought of jodie would look at him and whistle and giggle like susie giggled susie and jodie two unlikely women in his life jodie was no longer part of what he did she was making choir stalls with her nick ridiculous how could she make any money doing that and susie in a couple of weeks susie would be a memory as well and hed be left with marcia which was the way he wanted it porridge the yell from below stairs startled him out of his reverie on the table now he crossed to the landing took a deep breath swelled his chest toast he yelled back woman she emerged from the kitchen and gazed upward and froze her eyes took in his appearance from the tip of his shoes his long socks with their tassles up to the feather he felt like blushing wow she said at last on a long note of awed discovery oh hamish wow theyre going to love you who all the ladies of dolphin bay she said simply me too what a hunk do you have everything in the right place i think so he said still trying not to blush and youve got the appropriate attire underneath dont even go there he stepped back from the balustradefastand she chuckled no matter ive never seen such an impressive scottish heroand ive seen braveheart id imagine that those guys might be a bit handier with their weaponry than i am he said still cautious im all froth and no substance you certainly look like substance porridge now sir double helping if you like susie yes sir i thought i made myself clear toast theres a bit of a problem she confessed if id seen your knees before this i might have concentrated a bit more very good at focussing the mind those knees this was ridiculous he wanted his kilt lowered so whats happened to my toast he managed i burnt two lots she confessed i was thinking about angus and priscilla priscilla anguss pumpkin shes going to win today biggest pumpkin on show i ended up with only one slice of bread left and rose wanted that for toast fingers in her egg she took a deep breath and fixed him with a look that told him he was going to get a lecture right now hamish you might tell me you belong in new yorkyou might tell me youre not really an earlbut anyone seeing those knees knows for sure that youve found your home right here youre the ninth earl of loganaich and you just need to forget all those silly ideas of being anyone else including a toast eater and learn to like porridge now enough argument i have a team of men arriving in ten minutes to help load priscilla onto the trailer sowhat do they say save your breath to cool your porridgemy lord she smiled sweetly up at him come and get it while its hot it was like an outofbody experience firstly there was the fairground itself it was nestled between two hills with the harbour and the town on one side and bushland on the other one could stroll around the fairground walk a short distance to the shops or to the boats retreat into the bushas a few young couples showed every sign of doing even this early onor if it all got too hot one could disappear to the beach for a quick swim susie pulled her little car into the parking lot and hamish gazed around stunned it was a fantastic colourful mix of everything everyone grizzled farmers kids with fairy floss old ladies in wheelchairs gorgeous young things kitted to the nines in full dressage gear ready for the equestrian events kids in bathing costumes obviously torn between beach and fair a clown on stilts lurching from car to car and using the bonnets of the cars to steady himself the clown ended up right by them as they parked and he lurched a little more made a rush and hit their trailer by the time they emerged he was dusting himself and staggering to his feet pushing himself up against their pumpkin priscilla was almost as high as he was you hurt that pumpkin and youre dead meat jake cameron susie told him clearly unmoved by clowns tumbling into her trailer if theres so much as a blemish on my pumpkin its disqualified hi susie the clown said removing a bulbous nose great to see you too i didnt know you rode stilts i dont jake said morosely but the kids schoolteacher asked for volunteers and the twins volunteered me its not going to work the kids have been coaching me for weeks and all thats going to happen is that i break my neck whos going to fix me up then i want to know kirstys really good at broken spines susie said and grinned or failing that shes specially trained in palliative care if you die youll die in the best of hands she turned to hamish who was feeling vaguely better that he wasnt the only ridiculously clad person here hamish this is dr jake cameron jakes my brotherinlaw jake and kirsty are dolphin bays doctors hey jake said holding out a redgloved vastfingered paw youre the new earl welcome to dolphin bay mate you want to find a beer beer sounded fantastic to hamishbut susies hand was on his arm and she was holding on like he wasnt going anywhere hamish is due at the opening ceremony in ten minutes no beer until youve done your duty jake said sympathetically but me ive been all round the fairground on these damned stilts risking life and limb at every step ive added local colour for all im worth and im done off duty beer it is so who looks after the kids when they fall off the ferris wheel susie demanded heaven forbid jake said but kirstys official medical officer for the day shes taken the pledge for the next few months so im a free man jake susie said and stopped there was a pause a pregnant pause shes taken the pledge are you saying what i think youre saying jake replaced his nose fast whoops he said backing off no i didnt say that gotta go take care of your earl i will susie said but still looking very oddly indeed at her brotherinlaw wheres kirsty avoiding you i suspect jake said see you and he took himself off like a man hunted what was that about hamish asked watching the very speedy retreat of the scarlet and purple patchwork clown oh if she is susie said how can i go home she caught herself no i must business lets get you to the stage do i really need to of course you need to she said astonished everyone plays their part youre part of this community now hamish douglas like it or not and at least were not asking you to say your speech while youre wearing stilts his speech was astonishing all by itself the sensation of being piped onto the stage of every face in the fairground straining to see him of a gasp of approval as he finally reached the dais and the sound of the pipes fell away susie was right he thought appreciating the drama of the situation if angus had done this for the last forty years this small ceremony would be sorely missedand how much worse it would be because angus was dead times changed the time of having a laird in castle douglas was over and people had to accept it but at least he could do as susie suggested now he could play his part speech he had to make a speech not a take over the company sort of speech not now but something with god help him emotion just this once and in the end the words came i cant replace my uncle angus he told the crowd tentative at first but growing surer as he saw by their smiles that just standing up here in the right tartan was enough to plug the void i cant replace lord angus douglas earl of loganaich i dont want to but the house of douglas has been associated with dolphin bay for so long that the connection will never die as long as castle loganaich stands well remember the link between castle and town well remember the friendship the love the good times and the bad lord anguss death was a low point but he lived a full life with his beloved deirdre both of them surrounded by this town full of their friends he hesitated plus the odd monarch in the bathrooms he added and there was a ripple of delighted laugher most people here had at least heard of queen vic but hamish hadnt yet finished he was on a roll maybe he could be a lord after all anguss legacy remains in the laughter and the camaraderie im seeing here he told them angus would wantangus would insistthat life goes on and that everyone here enjoy themselves to the full so i hamish douglas ninth earl of loganaich make this my first public decree that this fair is officially open and that everyone here proceed to have a very good time and after the pumpkin judging as lord douglas i decree that everyone here take home a slab of pumpkin so i dont get landed with pumpkin pie for the rest of my life hooray hed done it there was cheering and more laughter the pipes started up again and hamish made his way off the stage to find susie smiling at him through tears oh hamish that was wonderful theres no need to cry he said abruptly and turned away drat he was almost teary himself his laughter faded hed almost been enjoying himself but tears always did this they snapped him right back to dreary reality tears in a situation like this were ridiculous and now if susie not only cried but infected him with it no pumpkin judging someone yelled were waiting on the douglas pumpkin ooh susies tears were gone in an instant and she turned to a middleaged lady beside her harriet can you take rose for a bit she thrust her baby forward but rose obviously knew the lady who hamish recognised as the postmistress hed stopped and asked directions from her when hed arrived come on susie was clutching his hand and towing him through the crowd and people were laughing and parting to let them through weve got a date with destinyright now their pumpkin won it was the fairs biggest pumpkin with trophy and certificate to prove it the second biggest was entered by a withered old man who didnt seem the least bit upset about losing or maybe he did he laughed and cheered with the rest of them when the pumpkins were weighed but as the trophy was given to a flushed and triumphant susie the elderly man turned to hamish and an errant tear was rolling down his wrinkled cheek more tears he knew dammit the old man said and he reached out and wrung hamishs hand so hard that it hurt your uncle was the best mate a man could have he knew hed beaten me this year damn him he knew he was a winner i wouldnt have wanted him to go any other way but hell i miss him he sniffed and his wife darted forward and hugged him and led him off to the beer tent susie came down from the dais clutching her trophy and certificate and she watched him go and sniffed again i need a hanky she said helpless with her hands full and hamish was forced to find hisfrom his sporranand then hold her trophy while she blew her nose hard i dont want it back he said faintly and she managed a smile through tears im sorry i know guys hate tears its only ben she motioned to where the old man was disappearing beerwards he was crying too hamish said and if he sounded a bit desperate then he couldnt help it aunty susie aunty susie there were shrieks from behind them and he turned to see two pigtailed urchins bearing down on them two little girls aged about five each liberally spattered with what looked like a mix of fairy floss and chocolate ice cream raced up to them with excitement aunty susie mummys got a baby for you a baby susie stood stock still and the colour drained from her face i knew it i knew whats wrong hamish asked before he could help himself shes pregnant i knew hi coming up behind the twins was a woman who was the mirror image of susie the likeness was so extraordinary that he blinked kirsty i presume he said because susie had retired behind his handkerchief again oh for heavens sake im kirsty a cool firm hand was placed in his she smiled and her smile was the same as susies or maybe not maybe not quite as lovely that was a dumb thing to think at least this woman wasnt crying why is susie crying she asked and he looked exasperated because her pumpkin won i think he expected sympathy and mutual confusion instead kirsty dropped his hand and enveloped susie in a hug oh sweetheart im sorry he couldnt see he did see susie said hiccuping on a sob he knew i told you i snuck into bens back yard before he died and i measured it and angus knew his would be the winner and i bet he can see us now then what the twins they saida baby kirsty let her arms drop she looked exasperated they didnt say a baby they did they meant a puppy a puppy susie lowered the handkerchief and looked out cautiously from behind it ready to retire again at any minute what do you mean this kirsty motioned behind her we want our boris back but weve decided you need a dog a small boy was bringing up the rear he was carrying what was he carrying a puppy the puppy was just about the weirdest dog hamish had ever seen she was brown white and tubby with long floppy ears boriss expressive eyes a stretchedout body with a puddingy tummy a tail that added another twelve inches in lengthand legs that were about three inches long what is it susie asked cautious to say the least this is our gift to you kirsty said expansively and grinned to stop rose being an only child she motioned to the small boy holding the pup susie this is adam and adams pup now shes your pup what shes courtesy of boris she explained sounding exasperated you know jake inherited boris from miss pritchard jake sort of assumedas boris was eight years old and miss pritchard was a civically responsible personthat boris would have been neutered in the long distant past ok he should have checked but he didnt he didnt really think about it until adams dachshund came into season we share a back fence and events took their course even then we didnt realise until daisy dachshund produced one sad pup now that shes a few weeks old the fathers obvious sad pup susie said warily while hamish looked on much as one might look through a time screen to another world well maybe shes not exactly sad are you sweetheart kirsty said lifting the pup from adams hands and holding her up for inspection maybe shes moreloopy shes just won cutest puppy in show pup meet susie susie meet pup hi pup susie said still cautious the pup wagged her tail her whole body wriggled like a cute and furry eel anyway jake and i were watching the puppy judging and it suddenly occurred to us that if youre insisting on returning to america you need something to remember us by and something to guard you what better than a pup we talked to adams parents and amazingly theyre delighted even adams cool with it i dont think this puppy fits what he thinks of as a real boys dog i know therell be issues with quarantine but the dogjudging people say its possible to take pups into the us from here and jake and i will pay susie seemed almost overwhelmed she sniffed oh kirsty i dont have any more handkerchiefs jake said desperate you need a truckload when susies around kirsty said cheerfully what do you think suze oh susie said taking the puppy and holding her close oh i think i hear a beer calling hamish said faintly is jake in the beer tent kirsty grinned at him not unsympathetic were all a bit much arent we but your speech all i had to do was look at you and i got teary susie harriet the postmistress was making her way determinedly through the crowd toward them carrying rose toward her mother i think your daughter needs a nappy change hamish was backing already but he backed a few more feet at that fast i can definitely hear a beer calling he muttered but harriet wasnt about to let hamish escape ooh look at you she exclaimed and thrust rose at her mother who proceeded to juggle toddler and puppy with aplomb the elderly postmistress put an arm round hamishs shoulders and beamed in possessive enthusiasm she was a big lady buxom and beaming with a tight frizzed perm and painted lips that seemed to have a life of their own look at me she crowed me and lord hamish take a picture of us someone so i can put it up on the postoffice wall i need hey but it shouldnt be me harriet suddenly corrected herself whisking herself out of his arms and thrusting susie forward with an air of enormous personal sacrifice it should be you oh susie wouldnt that be something you and the new laird two douglases finally finding their place side by side susie choked but she had no say in the matter shed been thrust next to hamish and cameras were flashing just the same as theyd been yesterday on the beach only worse much worse hamish douglas was suddenly being photographed with mrs douglas rosie douglas and dog things were spiralling out of control here hamish thought desperately and a man had to do what a man had to do he put susieand appendagescarefully away from him and took two more steps back two long steps back i need to find jake he said in tones he hoped were careful and measured and nowhere as hysterical as he felt and then i think its wise if i stop all conjecture about me andme and susie right now im engaged to a young lady called marcia vinel and shes arriving here the day after tomorrow chapter six hamish spent the rest of the day being inspected from every angle susie had been right when shed said his presence would take everyones mind off their loss he could not only hear the buzz his presence was making he could feel it he was whispered about talked about watched i need to get this kilt off he told jake did i ever wolfwhistle a woman for having great legs kill me now i deserve it everyones staring at my knees theyre staring at the whole package jake said and you can forget any sympathy from this direction youre not wearing size twenty purple and red shoes my feet are killing me did susie tell me you were a surgeon in the city before you were married hamish said curiously what on earth made you move here life jake said and hamish looked out over the fairground and shuddered not my idea of life and your idea of life would be control hamish said forcefully knowing what im waking up to every morning i know what im waking up to every morning jake said peaceably chaos i wouldnt have it any other way poles apart hamish said morosely then he thought of another issue and what the hell are you about giving susie a dog hasnt she got enough to cope with shes got to make her way in america get a career going hows she going to handle a dog the heart expands to fit all comers jake said and grinned im a doctor you know thats a very medical sort of diagnosis sure it does hamish snapped susies now been loaded with a mutt who shell have to love whether she wants to or not love isnt the same as provide for jake said looking at him curiously its a bit different sure it means more work but to not accept it youre telling me there are any real advantages in her getting a dog kirstys her twin jake said definitely if kirsty says she needs a dog then she needs a dog shes lonely as hell dogs dont fix loneliness they do a bit jake said anyway the dog wasnt my decision mate kirsty thinks its a good idea and getting between the twins is like dividing the red sea itd take a force bigger than i have at my disposal theyre inseparable but susies going home there is that jake said he surveyed hamish thoughtfully and hamish lifted his beer and studied the dregs if you look at me like that for any more than two more seconds im walking out of here and ill keep walking till i reach america he said softly and jake grinned fair enough youve copped a bit of matchmaking then just a bit the whole fairground had gone into wouldnt it be great mode well it would be great except i like my women selfcontained clever cool and sassy susies clever and sassy four or nothing he said and drained his beer im engaged to marcia shell be here the day after tomorrow jake raised an eyebrow sussing him and grinning first ive heard of it but its no business of mine mate he added pushing himself to his size twenty feet i have two hundred more balloons to disperse before im off duty one more beer and ill let the whole lot go skyward which might not be such a bad thing if i didnt have three womenfolk whod give me a hard time for the rest of my life theyd probably make me blow up two hundred more marcia would never give me a hard time over a balloon lucky you jake said or unlucky you depending on which way you want to look at it but i sure as hell know what way im looking at it ill leave you to your very important phone call my if marcias coming in two days hadnt you better let her know jake suggested if youre arming the battlements its always a good idea to let the armour know whats required what was it about this place hed landed in some chaotic muddle of people who seemed to think they knew him because his name was douglas who seemed to think they knew more about his life than he did which was clearly ridiculous but jake had said he needed to make a phone calland jake was right calculation midday here eight at night there fine marcia answered on the first ring still at her desk then hi she said warmly hows the valuation going im a bit distracted he told her hed emerged from the hubbub of noise within the beer tent hed retreated to the side of the marquee but he could still see the colourful chaos that was the fair our pumpkin just won a major prize there was a moments silence then well hooray for our pumpkin hamish are you feeling well are you absolutely imperatively busy at the moment im always absolutely imperatively busy and if you dropped everything and came here why would i do that the widow he said and his desperation must have sounded down the wire because there was laughter oh darling i did wonder youre the heir and shes the dowager so theres a bit of matchmaking not on our part i meanshe doesnt want it any more than i do but the townspeople do and itd make it much easier to keep everything on a business footing if you appeared there was a moments silence he could imagine her scrolling down the screen of her electronic diary juggling appointments figuring out imperatives i can spare you three days she said at last theres a financial review in hong kong starting next friday i was tempted to attend hong kongs almost your time zone so i could get over jetlag with you i have no intention of being in hong kong if my minds not totally focussed theres some heavy stuff going down oil futures it could be really big so that means ill be with you monday your time ill fly out again on thursday will that solve your problems he stared around him oil futures in hong kong one of jakes twinsalicewas walking toward him carrying a hot dog she was leaving a trail of ketchup in her wake she was beaming and holding it out to him as if it was a truly amazing gift marcia here she had to come he needed grounding fast thatll be great he said weakly ill let you know the arrangements is there anything else you need now im in a rush no then bye click marcias coming he told alice as he accepted her hot dog and she gave him a dubious smile is marcia nice very nice does she like hot dogs i guess my aunty susie says you have to come she said the wood choppings about to start and the laird always has first chop hes a bit of all right the woodchopping had seemed just what hamish had needed his hands were still a bit sore from digging but he put that aside the sight of logs waiting to be chopped meant that he could vent his spleen in a way that didnt hurt anyone except himpity about the blisters didnt involve so much alcohol that hed regret it the next day and got him away from susie the logs were propped as posts the woodchoppers were given a truly excellent axe and told to go to it hamish did his first ceremonial chop then watched the champion woodchoppers with something akin to envy while he watched the woodchoppers the inhabitants of dolphin bay were watching him talking about him clapping him on the backand looking sideways at susie things were starting to get desperate his blisters hurtbut would a real earl be deflected by a few blisters of course not as the novice events started he stripped to the waist and proceeded to chop theres something about a man in a kilt and nothing else kirsty murmured and nudged her sister ooher a fine figure of a man our new laird hes not our new laird susie retorted a trifle breathlessly a new laird wouldnt sell his castle and run he hasnt sold it yet theres many a slip cut it out kirsty susie hes gorgeous kirsty hes engaged to be married so you have noticed hes gorgeous id have to be blind not to notice hes gorgeous the logs had to be chopped into four the way it was done was to chop a chunk out ram a plank into the chunk stand on the plank and lop the top off then lower the plank and start again with a lower chunk hamish was on his second level chunks of wood were flying everywherethere was more enthusiasm than science in his technique his body was glistening with sweat kilts are yummy kirsty said thoughtfully i wonder if jaked wear one im yummy enough without a kilt jake had come up behind them and now he put his arms round his wife and hugged how do you improve on just plain irresistible i liked you better when you were four feet taller susie told him eyeing her brotherinlaw with disfavour and i dont know how it is but the red nose just doesnt cut it it turns kirsty on though jake said smugly and kirsty answered by pulling his plastic nose back to the full length of its elastic holding it thoughtfully for a moment and then letting it go yep i like it better on she said and turned back to her sister now where were we hey jake clutched his nose in pain and susie giggled but there was a part of her there was a part of her that was really really jealous of her sister and her husband she decided shed met and fallen for rory but shed had him for such a short time and then hed been gone his loss still had the power to hurt so much that she almost couldnt bear it the sight of her sister and her husband so happy her eyes turned involuntarily back to hamish hamish smashing through his third the level of wood hamish concentrating every ounce of energy in getting the log through pitting his strength against the wood she thought of how hed been yesterday morning digging her path with just such energy what was driving him what was this marcia like it wasnt her business im going home she said abruptly harriets over under the trees with rosie and pup ill go and collect them i think itd be better if i took pup home now and settled her into her new home before dinner even if that home is temporary she added in an undertone but kirsty heard and winced susie do you mind about the puppy i love pup she hugged her sister but hamishdo you mind that hes taking over well she shrugged i cant not mind but it doesnt make sense to care too much if you two got on we do get on and no matter how much better we got on hed still sell the castle its the only sensible thing to do can you give him a ride home sure jake told her if you really need to go i really need to go he won hamish stood over his four pieces of chopped logs and gasped until he got his breath back this was fantastic much better than any gym workout he was standing bare backed clad only in his kilt and footwear the sun burning on his skin the wash of the sea the background roar to the applause of the crowd his hands were a bit painfulactually very painfulbut what was a bit of pain it felt like hed been transformed into another place another time another life hed won he turned to where susie had been standing and she wasnt there where he started and jake came toward him and wrung his hand well done mate ouch hamish muttered and hauled his hand back wheres susie gone home right suddenly his hands were really really painful this was dumbbut it didnt feel fantastic any more hamish didnt come home for dinner and susie didnt care she didnt she didnt she didnt shed eaten far too much rubbish at the fair to worry about dinnera piece of the inevitable toast was fine she fed the puppy the mix adams mother had thoughtfully packed she popped her to sleep in the wet room and then as the puppy complained she carted her back to the kitchen sat in the rocker in front of the fire and cuddled her im calling you taffy she said i know i had sixtythree other suggestions but they cant tell me what to call my very own puppy taffy looked up at her in sleepy agreement curled into her lap and proceeded to go to sleep susie rocked on me and a puppy and a baby she whispered i have a houseful where will i go she whispered back where will i take my little family shed go back to the house shed shared with rory of course that was the best thing to do the simplest but the thought of going back to the house shed shared with rory itll be empty taf she told the puppy popping her down onto a cushion by the fire even with you its a gorgeous house on the coast it looks out over the ocean its really wild rory worked from home and it was great with the two of us there butbut im not sure you and rosie are going to be good enough company as if in answer to her question taffy said nothing at all susie rocked on shed lit the range more for company than because she needed its warmth but the gentle crackle and hiss of burning logs was comforting not comforting enough i have to go home isnt talking to yourself the first sign of madness she jumped close on a foot when she came down to earth she was breathlessand cross what do you think youre doing coming home hamish said and it was so much an echo of what shed been thinking that she almost jumped again you scared me im sorry its your kitchen she said but she sounded defensive she took a grip and tried for a lighter note youve had supper but she was still flustered he didnt look nearly as together as hed looked that morning he was still in his kilt but hed chopped wood hed been drinking beer with the men hed joined the tugofwar teams he looked dishevelled and tired and frayed like a scottish lord coming home after a hard day at battle youve got a splodge of toffee apple on your cheek she managed a trifle breathlessly and he wiped it away with the back of his hand and grinned ive had a very good time not like manhattan huh not the least like manhattan ive never had a day like this in my life do you want supper are you kidding he was standing in the doorway looking big and tousled his long socks were down at his ankles his legs were bare and there were grass stains on his kilt and his hair had hay in it he lookedhe looked cut it out she told herself desperately dont look ive been judging the cooking he told her still with that grin that had her heart doing those crazy somersaulting things she didnt understand at all they made me honorary adjudicator which means ive tasted scones plum cakes sponge cakesyou name it ive tasted it some of it was truly excellent what makes you a judge its the kilt he told her wisely anyone wearing a kilt like this has to know a lot about cooking a lot about everything really thats why they have the house of lords in england sorry if youre a lord then you get to be an automatic member of parliament he told her i read it somewhere i havent figured out whether it applies to me or not but i guess inheriting earldomship must make me wise in some respects like in judging scones thatd be it he told her and all of a sudden they were grinning at each other like fools the atmosphere had changed and it was somehow different she hadnt felt like this since rory had died she thought and suddenly she felt breathless traitorish no free it was like a great grey cloud which had settled on top of her for the last two years had lifted and she feltextraordinary you dont mind that marcias coming he said and she caught herself and forced her stupid floating mind back to earth with a snap of course i dont this is your house i should have told you there was no need theres plenty of room and as i said i can always move out i dont want you to move outyet good great she thought about it and wondered if she was being entirely sensible i need to go she said a trifle uncertainly rising and moving toward the door to america not tonight she managed a smile but the frisson of something different was still in the air and she felt strange this was crazy this man was engaged to someone called marcia and shed have nothing to do with him after she left here but today today hed made her smile and hed made everyone here smile too she was under no illusions as to how sad a day it would have been for everyone if hamish hadnt been here but hed bounced around the fair having fun charming old ladies eating too many scones and toffee apples looking fabulous in his kilt hed given the locals something to talk about something to smile over and even when he left in a few weeks even though hed sell the castle today had been a gift thank you she said simply thank you for today everyone loved having a laird for the day it was my pleasure really it was he said and there it was again bang like in the comics she thought a little bit helplessly wham bang zing splat good night my lord she said simply and he put out a hand and took hers and winced the gesture had been a friendly goodnight touch but as she took his hand in hers and felt its warmth touched his strength she also felt something else ouch she said turning his palm over and then she saw his palm and she repeated the word with feeling ouch it is a bit he confessed but she was no longer listening oh hamish your hands you dope you blistered them with digging and then to use the axe we earls arent wusses you earls are dopes she told him i might have known angus was just like you you know we had to dress his oxygen canister up in tartan so he could go to his last fair without feeling like a wuss i dont have an oxygen cylinder he said startled and she shook her head in disgust not for want of trying hamish these are awful dont say that she said uneasily ive been trying to ignore them all day right ignoring them why waiting for your hands to drop off my hands are not going to drop off theres ten blisters on this hand she said hauling it closer to get a better look and theres a splinter in this one and another you great dope ill ring kirsty kirsty my sister she said exasperated this needs medical attention ill wash it he said as if granting an enormous concession thatll fix it it wont fix it if you tell me how bad it is one more time ill cry he said like it was a huge threat and she blinked and stared up at him in astonishment really umno i wouldnt blame you if you did i wont i have an aversion to the pastime well dont stick near me then she told him i cry all the time just looking at these makes me teary you great hulking hero hero axing away with all of these she was examining each blister searching for more splinters and the thought of him chopping wood doing it to make the old ladies smile thats why hed done it she thought shed thought hed done it because it had seemed fun but now looking at these hands she thought hed done it because thats what shed asked him to do create a diversion from anguss death give the locals something else to think about it hed eaten scones hed chopped wood hed placed every eye on him and hed made people smile please dont cry he sounded so scared that she stared up at him in even more bewilderment his face was set and he was backing away but she had hold of his hand and she wasnt letting him go anywhere he was a dope but he was a great gorgeous dope and hed done this because shed asked him to thereforeat great personal sacrificeshed choke back tears and be businesslike im not crying she said trying to sound exasperated and not emotional sit sit ill clean them and ill pull the splinters out and then ill put on iodine and well see how much of a man you are you dont cry huh iodine on these will be a real truth test iodine would make an onion howl all by itself so he sat in the old rocking chair in front of the range his free hand soaking in a bowl of soapy water shed rested on his kilted knees while she carefully examined each blister cleaned it lifted out tiny shards of wood with a pair of tweezersand then anointed each one with iodine you should have a bullet to bite on she told him and he looked down at her mop of auburn curls and thought he wasnt even near yelling he was hardly thinking about pain she was intent on his hand she was sosimple he thought but maybe that wasnt the word shed changed from the clothes shed worn at the fair now she was wearing a pair of shorts and a faded tshirt that was a little too tight her legs and her feet were bare she was wearing no makeup her hair was falling forward stopping him seeing what she was doing with his hand but at the same time distracting him nicely she smelt of some citrusy soap he thought shed probably showered when shed come home from the fair maybe she and rosie had bathed together and the vision of her bathing her baby was suddenly whew it was just as well marcia was coming he thought a man could get himself into dangerous territory here and why wouldnt a man want to the thought was so far out of left field that he blinked and almost pulled his hand away she felt the tug and looked up in concern all huge eyes and tousled hair andand susie im trying hard not to hurt you youre not hurting me tell me about your job she said turning her attention back to the splinters as if it was important that she look at anything but him as maybe it was my job youre a financier mmm you love being a financier i guess did he he wasnt sure ive been trying to imagine why she told him i get such a kick out of planting something and watching it grow do you see schemes through to the end like if someone comes to you and says please can i build a bulldozer factory can i have some money does it give you the same thrill that those bulldozers would never have got built if it hadnt been for you ummaybe thats banking he said uneasily so you dont do any handson supplying of money for doing interesting stuff like building bulldozers no so what do you finance i guess most of my work is taken up with futures broking he told her which is figuring out what money is going to be worth in the future and buying and selling on that basis she tweaked out another sliver of wood thoughtful so you buy and sell money it seems a bit odd to me but if it makes you happy did it make him happy hed never thought about it it seemed such an odd concept that he almost didnt understand the question the highpowered finance world was where hed worked all his adult life all he knew was wheeling and dealing the adrenalin rush of vast fiscal deals the knife edge of knowing it was his brains holding everything in place and if he slipped up he thought about his mothers reaction when hed told her that hed been made a full equity partner for once she hadnt cried shed closed her eyes and when shed opened them things had changed now i can stop worrying shed said full equity partner in one of manhattans biggest brokerage firmswell if that was what it had taken to stop the tears then great and he was good at his job it had earned him a lot and he had no time to think about anything else what else was there to think about but work the scent of susies hair that was all he could think about now that and the feel of her fingers carefully working on his hands each blister was being tended with care it was such a strange sensation an intimate sensation would marcia ever tend his blisters how would he get blisters around marcia he wouldnt his biggest risk was of repetitive strain injury caused by using his blackberry too much a cold damp something hit the edge of his bare leg and he hauled himself from his reverie and stared down pup whoops susie said and laid hamishs hands carefully on his kilted knees and scooped up the pup thats good timing taffy if youve woken up you go outside straight away hamish dont touch anything ill be back and she was gone whisking the pup out into the gathering dusk dont touch anything he sat for a bit not thinking anything letting his mind go blank the sensation was almost extraordinary when had he last done this simplystopped there was always something to do always reports to read email to check constant analysis if he didnt keep up then others would get ahead or things could slip by him and hell what was the use of being in the heap if you werent on top his laptop was up in his bedroom hed connected briefly that morning checking things were ok he should go up now and see it was seven at night three in the morning new york time not a lot was happening over there right now the japanese market would be online he decided the yen had been looking pretty shaky when hed left it wouldnt hurt to stay online for a bit and get the feel for susie was out in the garden with taffy from where he sat he could hear the sea he could smell the sea shed told him to stay so he did sort of he walked to the kitchen door and watched while she introduced taffy to the lawn and explained what was required as if the dog could understand theres no hurry she was saying i understand its all a bit strange and new and theres even more strange and new to come but we can take our time me and rose will be the constants wherever you are and well always be able to find you a patch of grass theres not a lot else you need to worry about what about the dow jones hamish thought glancing at his watch and wondering what the financial markets had done in the past ten hours he always needed to worry about the dow jones but maybe not now maybe worrying about financial indices here wasridiculous susie was kneeling on the grass the dopy pup had rolled over onto her back and susie was scratching her tummy she wriggled in delight her ungainly body squirming with ecstasy on the still sunwarmed ground how was she going to cope hamish thought with a baby with a puppy she had a lot to worry about she should be worrying about it right now she wasnt worrying she lay on the grass herself and the puppy climbed on top of her the last flickers of light from the tangerine sunset were soft on her face she was giggling as the puppy tried to lick her cheek from behind he could hear rose chirping as she woke from what he presumed was a very late afternoon nap susie would never get her daughter to sleep tonight but she didnt care he thought she had no sense of order he remembered his mother if dinner was five minutes late shed be almost apoplectic with anxiety he thought of marcia if things didnt run to plan what would marcia do if he gave her a puppy marcia would give the puppy right back and as for a baby marcia letting a baby having an afternoon nap at this hour marcia having a baby the idea was so ridiculous that he grinned and susie looked over and saw him grinning and said what what yourself youre laughing at me im laughing at your puppy theres a difference rose is awake goody she scrambled to her feet put the puppy down and made to go indoors she went to sleep on the way home and wouldnt wake up shell be so hungry i almost woke her but then i remembered theres an english comedy show i like on tv late tonight and its the best fun watching it with rose then as he blinked trying to reconcile latenight comedy and a fourteenmonthold toddler she hesitated as shed started toward the door taffy had followed you havent done what you need to do she told the puppy and pointed to the grass duty first the puppy looked up at her new mistress with adoration and wagged her tail stay here with her while i fetch rose susie ordered hamish and he nodded and put a foot out to stop taffy following her mistress taffy sat down and howled they both looked at taffy taffy looked at both of them opened her jaws and howled even longer whoops susie said what have i let myself in for give her back hamish told her what you dont have to keep her she snatched taffy up and glared what a thing to say dont listen sweetheart youre mine were a family i dont mind the odd howl its an excellent howl and its all your very own i wonder if youll like my tv programme too this was seriously weird there were all sorts of things happening inside hamish that he had no idea what to do with you cant be a family to thatthat that gorgeous pup i can be a family with whoever i want she snapped hauling herself up to her full five feet four inches and glaring taffy needs me out here can you fetch rose what get her from her cot thats the plan just walk in and pick her up you earls have great courage she said obviously trying not to sound sarcastic if you pick her up under the armpits and close your palms it wont even hurt your blisters it wasnt his blisters he was afraid of i cant pick up a baby dont be ridiculous get in there woof said taffy he stared at the pair of them and they stared back challenging he could do this right you earls have great courage right he strode into the house followed the sound of rosies increased indignation and pushed open the door to susies and rosies shared bedroom and paused in astonishment the bed was vast a great fourposter with mounds of eiderdowns and more mounds of cushions there were pinks and purples and almost crimsons and gold it was an amazing bed and the walls deirdres kitsch ornaments had been taken down and susie had covered the walls with printsnot expensive artwork but prints shed obviously ordered because they appealed there were all sorts of prints tree ferns taken from strange angles waterfalls rock formations that was one wall another wall was the seavast curling waves surfers doing all sorts of incredible twisting turns shots of foam a single rock pool a tiny minnow against a vast pier pile the third was people grins people smiling these werent people she knew ancient tibetan grandmothers with gaptoothed grins old men smiling at each other in friendship a group of kids in scout uniform smiling in unison and the last wall was photographs blown up susie as a kid he thought looking at twins cavorting on a beach photographs of a man who was obviously rory a couple in love he looked at them smiling at each other and felt a twist of no dont look you dont need to feel like this it was dumb to put such photographs up he thought this was as kitsch as deirdres efforts but then he thought no its not he thought of his apartment back in manhattan and marcias planned by the same minimalist decorator whod recoil in horror if she saw this but this sort of worked it was a huge collage of life of living of all susie held dear an indignant yell brought him back to earth in the centre of the room was that which susie held dearest the toddler was beaming as she saw shed caught his attention she was holding her hands out and saying up hi he said weakly and she bounced and grinned and held her hands higher up up up he could do this he put his hands under her arms and gingerly raised her she giggled and pointed to the bed dappy she said dappy he thought about it then he realised what she meant um no he made to carry herholding her at arms lengthout the door out to her mother but her yell became urgent he had her agenda wrong dappy dappy dappy you earls have great courage where are your diapers he asked and she pointed an imperious finger to the pile on a side table under the tibetan grandmas dappy ok he set rose down on the floor but she yelled in indignation her routine was obviously to be followed to the letter bed she said and pointed give me a break he said weakly but he was a man under orders he tossed a diaper across to the bed then lifted rose and set her down on the eiderdown she almost disappeared in its vastness she giggled and kicked her feet squirming away from him and burrowing under the cushions this was obviously a game played whenever she woke up the bed smelt like susie the room smelt like susie rose lifted a cushion grinned at him chortled and pulled the pillow back over her head again he considered then put a finger on the small of her back and tickled shrieks of laughter and she squirmed deeper right under the quilt he put his head under the quilt and said boo dappy she said and pushed the quilt away lay flat and waited boo was obviously the magic word and he performed magic as well hamish douglas corporate financier ninth earl of loganaich successfully changed a diaper like climbing annapurna one he told himself setting rose on the floor carrying the used diaper into the bathroom in triumph and thinking of the worlds second most difficult climb a soggy diaper a soiled diaper represents everest then as rose looked thoughtful he tossed the diaper into the wastebin and dived on the toddler to take her out to her mother before she could send him up his second mountain he wasnt ready for everest yet susie was still waiting for taffy to perform she was sitting on a garden seat watching the dark settle over the garden simplywaiting hamish delivered her daughter rose squirmed down onto the grass and she and taffy proceeded to investigate each other arent you going to make her dinner hamish asked and susie smiled down at her puppy and her daughter and shook her head no ones in a hurry it was such a strange concept that hamish blinked you want a seat susie wriggled sideways making room on the bench why would he sit down just to sit maybe ill work on the path with those hands are you out of your mind we earls have great courage you earls need a straitjacket if you work with hands like those just stop hamish rest he sat gingerly it felt weird thank you for today she said gently and he felt even more weird why youve made today happy for a lot of people just by being here just by exposing my knees a thing of beauty is a joy for ever she said serenely and he choked right honest hamish her hand came out to touch his arm lightly resting there was no pressure but the feel of her fingers on his arm was almost his undoing that and the warmth of the night the soft hush of the sea the weird domesticity of pup and baby playing at their feet you were wonderful she said and suddenly she twisted so she could kiss him lightly it was a kiss of thanks no more than that a feather kiss exceptit wasnt people kissed all the time hamish thought they kissed in greeting and farewell or as had just happened to say thank you it meant nothing there was no reason to think that a twentythousandvolt electric charge had just cut off every other circuit in his body why there was no reason he thought dazed or was it because susie was a thousand light years away from any other woman hed ever dated she was a thousand light years from marcia in her faded shorts and tshirt and nothing else nothing to attract nothing at all she smeltshe felt soft and delicious and absolutely imperatively desirable it was just the day he thought hauling back in shock and dazed wonder it had been a day totally out of his experience and he was floundering here because hed never met anyone like this before and there were probably thousands of women who were like this but hed just never met them and he was out of his comfort zone and hey hamish im not planning on jumping you susie said and he jerked back to reality to susie staring at him with eyes that were bemusedand maybe also a little hurt i know its justim engaged to marcia maybe that had been the wrong thing to say i know youre engaged to marcia she said with asperity you really do think im planning on jumping you just because im a widow no you do she said and there was no disguising the anger now she rose and stood glaring at him with her hands on her hips vibrating with fury if your colleague in the next office said goodbye have a good vacation and kissed you what would you have thought nothing of course not it was what had happened hey hamish is off on a vacation can you believe that bye hamish take care kiss it meant nothing but he had to stop thinking sideways susie was in temperon mode but because im a widow everyone looks at me like im encroaching like im just planning how to get the next man into my bed like im every married womans worst enemy even you its so unfair i loved rory like ive never loved anyone im not in the market for another relationship and hauling marcia over here just to protect yourself dont think i dont realise what youre doing hamish douglas there was no inkling from you that marcia would be coming until everyone looked at us like a couple then you started looking like a rabbit caught in headlights its just so dumb dumb dumb dumb she swooped down and lifted rose into her arms come on sweetheart well go make you some dinner and leave his lordship here in solitary splendour in the knowledge that his virtue can remain intact for his precious marcia but know that even if there were a million marciasor do i mean if there werent anytheres no way im interested in you hamish douglas not the least little bit not one skerrick you leave me as cold as a flat dead fish she turned and wheeled into the house hamish was left starting after her taffy looked at up him doubtful id follow he told the pup im a flat dead fish taffy hesitated a bit more but then as hamish remained unmoving she obviously decided that maybe hamish was right flat dead fish were a bit unappetising he followed susie there was absolute silence even the hush of the sea was fading nothing a flat dead fish he should go check his email he should there was a groan from the house and susies head appeared at the kitchen window thanks for sending taffy inside she snapped shes done her business in the hallway over to you your lordship great he rose we earls have great courage even flat dead fish had their uses chapter seven what followed were a couple of very strained days susie and hamish skirted each other with extreme caution they spent the mornings at the beachwell why wouldnt they as the beach was there and gorgeous taffy loved it rose loved it hamish loved it he admitted that to himself but hell it was a strain susie was a small indignant puff of offence and she treated the beach as if theyd put a fence down the middle with strictly segregated his and hers zones when he offered to take care of rose to give her time to swim she accepted graciouslyas if she was granting him a favourbut she flounced out to sea and flounced back and ignored him in the interim i didnt mean to offend you he told her you didnt offend me you merely implied i saw you as husband material as nothing could be further from the truth i believe we need to keep things formal right formal by the time marcia arrived on monday evening he was almost relieved anything to break the formality marcia arrived with jake jake had gone up to sydney for a oneday pain management conference and as the times fitted perfectly hed offered to collect marcia from the airport and bring her down so at eight on monday night hamish strolled out to the castle forecourt to greet his fiancée hi sweetheart he said as she emerged from jakes truck he hugged her elegantly suited body close and kissed herso deeply that he caught her by surprise when the kiss ended she pulled back and looked astonished wow she said touching her lips like they were bruised its only been a few days ive missed you is the widow watching the widow it took him a minute to catch that but realised of course marcia would think he was playing for an audience since hed implied have you warned marcia about our susie jake asked sounding interested and hamish grimaced i havent told marcia anything only that the whole place is expecting you to marry her marcia said smoothly you might as well say it like it is sweetheart keep things out in the open so theres no misunderstanding no misunderstanding jake said blankly right umgood trip hamish said feeling desperate have you two found lots to talk about i slept all the way marcia said she turned to jake and gave him her loveliest smile which was only slightly patronising thank you so much im afraid i was very boring not at all jake told her politely ill leave you to your hamish then shall i that would be kind peasantry dismissed right then jake said and with a wry grin he folded his long body back into the drivers seat of his battered land cruiser gave a salute of acknowledgement and left that was a bit brusque hamish said frowning as jake backed out of the forecourt did you two not find anything to talk about at all honestly darling hes a family doctor i dont even have any bunions to talk about i guess not marcia was out of her territory he thought suppressing irritation she wasnt normally this brittle maybe she was just better among her own kind he was her kind he remembered this was the woman he intended marrying he loved her cool sophisticated humour she was so intelligent so wheres the widow she asked inside ill take you to meet her but she hung back taking a moment to absorb the whole moonlit scene the fairytale castle the mountains behind the fabulous coastline this will sell for a mint she breathed oh hamish imagine this in vogue traveller your own little scottish castle without all those horrid fogs and bogs and midges of scotland theres nothing wrong with scotland he said and startled himself by how fervent he sounded youve never been to scotland no but im a direct descendant she gave a peal of laughter and tucked her hand into his arm youve become the lord of loganaich she said affectionately my very own earl defending the land of his forebears any minute now youll be up on the turrets playing your bagpipes he grinned relaxing a little i do wear a mean kilt this i have to see you need to meet susie first the widow ok lets get the scary part over and then get down to the fun part this place sounded good on paper but in reality wow lets figure what this pile is really worth the meeting between susie and marcia was not an unqualified success susie was in the kitchen cleaning up she greeted marcia with cautious courtesy marcia responded in kindwhile clinging to hamishs arm with proprietorial affectionand then susie excused herself theres steak in the fridge hamish if marcias hungry id cook it but but i do a better steak than you do hamish told her smiling encouragingly wishing she didnt look so tense wishing he hadnt told marcia there was a problem wishing marcia wasnt clinging quite so close ill go to bed then susie said and marcia glanced at her watch astonished its only eight susies recovering from injuries hamish said and then wished he hadnt said that as well as susie flashed him a look of anger im not recovering from injuries im recovered from injuries you limp marcia pointed out and susie glowered a bit and limped her way past them so i do she agreed its my own little idiosyncrasy but i like it im going to bed to read a good romance novel and i dont intend to recover at all hamish you need to show marcia through the castle ill bet shes interested in your inventory and when youve finished marcia could you let me know when this hotel assessors expected as i need to organise myself to leave good night taffy was snoozing by the stove susie scooped her up glared at the pair of them and left have i offended her marcia asked and hamish sighed i guessi mean maybe it wasnt such a good idea to imply there was a problem what do you mean her limp its obvious she cant expect me not to notice that wasnt the problem hed been talking about never mind are you hungry actually i ate on the way here and im very tired maybe the widow has a good idea with early bed she snuggled back against him where are we sleeping ive put you in the bedroom next to mine come and ill show you not yours um no it just seems a bit mean marcia was struggling to understand honey if she really wants you then the faster she comes to terms with reality the better its not like that it just marcia it seems like this is susies home and id like it to stay that way until we leave i thinkseparate bedrooms she raised a cool eyebrow well thats fine with me i have a date with my laptop ive missed so much trying to get here there wont be a romance novel for me in bed tonight hamish slept late hours late by his standards he always woke early in new york to find the latest on the hang seng before he went to work as he was always behind his desk by seven that meant he went to bed in the small hours and he woke in the small hours he couldnt remember a time when hed fallen into bed at ten and slept for more than eight hours but here it was the silence of the place he thought or that there was no desk waiting and jodie had cancelled his imperatives he woke and it was already seventhirty he lay lazily back on his mound of satin pillows and watched the early morning sunbeams flicker through the floating dreamcatcher deirdre had hung at the window jodie had hung a dreamcatcher on the window of his outer office back in manhattan hed asked her what it was and shed explained the ludicrous concept in detail susie might not think it ludicrous he thought jodie hadnt deirdre obviously hadnt he needed marcia to set him right shed be up by now he should go find her but his thoughts kept wandering snagging different ideas like the dreamcatcher was designed to do where was jodie was right now he wondered was she making choir stalls with her beloved nick hed miss his secretary when he went back when he went back when he left here when he left susie susie was leaving first maybe he could keep in touch with susie he thought just to check that she was ok hed tell kirsty and jake that hed keep an eye on her shed throw such an offer back in his face he decided she didnt need anyone to take care of her but he rejected that too of course she needed someone she thought she was strong enough to care for a baby and a dog and a career she was planning on working as a landscape gardener again but anyone could see she had physical problems her legs would never hold her up he could he could he could do nothing it was none of his business more lying on his satin pillows and thinking he was head of the clan he thought lord of loganaich laird it behoved him to care for for the relic the thought of susie as a relic was so crazy he laughed and threw off his covers and headed for the shower he was being dumb hed go and find marcia and show her this crazy castle from stem to stern theyd smile about how ridiculous it was theyd talk about practicalities and then shed bring him up to speed on how the office was coping without him marcia was just what he needed right marcia was already in the kitchen as were susie and rose and taffy quite a party hamish opened the door and they all turned toward him and glared uhoh a more cowardly man would have retreated there were obviously issues abroad here womens issues we have susie said cautiously as if she wasnt sure she could trust her voice no soy milk we have a case of bananas but theyre the wrong sort of fruit cumquats make the wrong sort of juice and the oranges arent ripe yet and marcia doesnt like the idea of eating strawberries that have been lying on mulch if youd warned me marcia was on a lowcarb diet i could have got things in low carbs easy he said cautious as susie and with a wary look at his beloved i mean steaks low carb steak for breakfast marcia shook her head in disbelief honestly hamish just lend me your car keys and ill go fetch what i need from the supermarket its five miles down the road and it doesnt open until nine hamish said cant you have toast the locals eat porridge susie said lifting a pot onto the range i can recommend it its hardly low carb marcia retorted hey marcia its hardly a hotel yet hamish said uneasily it wouldnt hurt to break your diet for a morning id prefer not to break my diet marcia said but she smiled ready to be accommodating its ok guys im not hungry youre too thin susie muttered a woman can never be too thin yeah youd know susie muttered and banged her pan on the range then she took a grip sorry that sort of just came out i was too thin for a while and its scary i have no intention of heading down the eating disorder road marcia said i have too much control im sure you have susie said but the eyes she turned on hamish were suddenly bleak ive made a big pot of porridge do you want some yes please it was the least a man could do in the circumstances he thought but then he saw the sudden gleam behind susies eyes and thought uhoh a porridgeeating laird she said thoughtfully finally im back on toast tomorrow im sure you are there was definitely laughter there now she was like a chameleon he thought swinging from happy to sad and back again he didnt want her to be sad had she been too thin when after rorys death hell he hated to think of what shed been through have you been working up in your bedroom marcia asked and he blinked umyeah did you see the euro dropped almost two cents against the greenback overnight and taffy slept till dawn without howling once susie added it has indeed been a busy night he couldnt keep up with this conversation he gave up and sat and susie placed a bowl of porridge in front of him he ladled honey on top and cream and he sprinkled it with cinnamon as hed seen susie do with hers every morning while marcia looked on with distaste dont look he told her have a coffee at least theres a decent coffeemaker she conceded though where you get good beansyou know thatll drive down the price of this place as a hotel you wont be able to source reasonable foodstuffs im eating my porridge out in the garden susie announced a little too loudly she lifted roses high chairwith rose in itand hoisted it toward the door let me help hamish said getting to his feet but susie was already outside thanks but im fine on my own you will let me help you down to the beach later on she hesitated and he could see her reluctance to accept help warring with her huge desire to swim thank you she muttered that would benice she carried rose further out then dived back for her porridge susie marcia started but susie was back out the door i cant leave rose in her high chair alone i just thought you might be interested in what ive been in touch with the hotel assessors she said theyll arrive tomorrow can you make yourself available susie hardly paused she was carrying her bowl of porridge walking out the door with taffy following loyally behind of course she said with dignity over her shoulder i promised and after that ill go home marcia took her blackberry to the beach hey theres a signal here she announced and was content she lay in her gorgeous bikini and communed with her other world as he should too hamish thought but he was busy watching susie hed swum less than usual this morning coming back to the towels to keep marcia companybut marcia didnt need company she never did she was going to make an excellent partner he decided as he sat next to her beautifully salontanned body she was gorgeous she was clever and she was totally independent she was just what he needed susie was at the other end of the beachof course she was sitting in the shallows with rose rose was perched on her mothers knees kicking out at each approaching wave as if by kicking it she could stop it coming taffy was barking hysterically at incoming waves barking until the wave was almost on her then putting her tail between her legs and scooting up the beach just in front of the white water then she barked in triumph as the wave retreatedonly to have it all happen again hamish discovered he was grinning as he watched them but they werent perfect marcia was perfect what was he about making comparisons ill go over and give susie a break from childminding so she can have a swim he told marcia and she raised her eyebrows in amused query you look after a baby i can change a diaper he said almost defiantly and her smile widened if i were you id never put that on your curriculum vitae its not the sort of ability thatll get you a job in our world our world he looked down at her blackberry right do you want help childminding she asked and it was time for his brows to hike youre kidding she smiled youre right im kidding but if its something i need to do for a smooth transition shed do whatever it took to build a solid financial future he thought wise woman go back to your wheeling and dealing he told her babysittings not an occupation i plan on doing any more in my life but youre right by doing it now im making things smoother for susie not for you only in that he paused only in that it made susie happier only in that it let susie have one of her last swims in this place he couldnt think how to finish his sentence go do it nanny douglas marcia told him deciding to be amused and be careful when you stand up i dont want sand in my keypad then it was his turn to sit in the shallows and entertain rose while taffy barked and susie swam not that rose needed to be entertained shed happily kick waves for the rest of her life he thought were there waves where she was going he didnt know he couldnt care susie disappeared as soon as they got back from the beach retreating to the bedroom with a couple of vast suitcases shed retrieved from the box room and a carton of garbage bags they hardly saw her for the rest of the day im so pleased shes being sensible marcia told him there was hardly any need for me to come i dont think shes the least bit interested in you no you know it really is the most beautiful place she said theyd finished a fairly strained dinnerfish and chips that hamish had gone into dolphin bay to fetch and a bowl of steamed vegetables for marciaand now they were sitting on the balcony looking out at the bay in the fading light it seems a shame to sell it straight away what else would i do with it hamish said shortly hed thought this through sure this was a financial windfall and realistically he didnt need the interest that hed get from its sale hed thought that maybe he could leave susie here as indefinite caretaker but hed known instinctively that shed refuse such an offer it was a dumb idea anyway itd leave her in limbo his indefinite pensioner she needed to move on you surely arent suggesting we live here no but ive been thinking that doing some capital improvements before we put it on the market might get us a better price marcia told him ill need to talk to the assessor tomorrow but come and see what i mean what just come and see why no ones thought of this before this is beyond me she led the way downstairs out to susies vegetable garden with hamish following feeling bemused marcia had only been here for twentyfour hours yet she already seemed proprietorial she was leading him though his very own castle he shouldnt mind he didnt it was just it was just that this was susies place he thought but that was dumb but when he emerged to the twilight and saw susies garden he stopped thinking his idea was dumb and decided that it was right it certainly seemed susies place her garden was fabulous he had no illusions as to whod done the work here for the last twelve months as anguss health had slowly deteriorated susie must have thrown her heart and soul into caring for this place her vegetable garden could feed a small army if this was turned into a hotel the chef would never have to go near a greengrocer but marcia wasnt interested in the garden she was striding purposefully toward the conservatory she pushed open the doors and flicked the light then swore as the light didnt work it was dusk and the place was still lovelysmelling of ripening oranges and overripe cumquats and the rich loam that susie had been using to pot seedlings the lack of light made it seem more beautiful this is what i brought you to see marcia said in the same voice she used when she produced a contract that was hugely advantageous to the firmand to her its fabulous it is hamish said walking forward and touching the same branch of hanging cumquats susie had touched the first day hed met her was it his imagination or could he sense her here this place seemed almost an extension of her we need to take the end wall out so we can get machinery in marcia was saying and he blinked pardon its great cant you see it see what the view from the end wall is right down to the sea the tourists this place will attract will spend most of their time right here why a swimming pool she said with exaggerated impatience i thought about it this morning while i was at the beach the beach is lovely but most tourists dont want to spend much time there why not the sand gets into your blackberry for one thing she said getting even more exasperated hamish when we went to bermuda last year did we spend any time at the beach we were there at a conference exactly we had things to do there was a beach but did we use it there had been a beach hamish remembered he thought back to an intense four days of business dealings he remembered watching the sun rise from his hotel room watching the view watching people stroll on the beachand then fitting in a fast fifteen minutes in the hotel pool before breakfast were the clientele well attract marcia said people who appreciate what luxury really is anyway im thinking we need to heave out every bit of kitsch before we put this place on the market and im also thinking that we should dig a pool into this building honestly hamish buyers have no imagination did you see the potential of this place as a swimming pool no there you go then she said triumphantly ill talk it through with the assessor tomorrow but i think you should hold selling off a little longer while we transform this place she hesitated i dont suppose we could persuade the widow to stay as a transitional caretaker i suspect we dont have a hope she shrugged well theres others maybe we need someone a bit more levelheaded anyway there was a beep from her belt and she lifted her blackberry and peered at the lit screen charles she said in satisfaction he has some figures i need if youll excuse me darling walk through to the end and see if im right a swimming pool and a bar with a view to die for our tourists wouldnt have to move i suspect the pool could double our price and she was off leaving him to his thoughts his thoughts he didnt have any thoughts he decided he was a blank he fingered his cumquat some more and thought it was a great smell it was a great place a luxury swimming pool maybe theyd have a few of these orange trees in tubs round the side youd really chop down all anguss orange trees susies muted voice was so unexpected that his heart forgot to take a beat he stilled trying to think what to say and she came out of the shadows and stood right before him still in the plain faded shorts and tshirt he was starting to get to know still with bare feet her hair was tousled and there was a smudge of dirt on her forehead i didnt know you were here he managed when he got his breath back ive been planting out seedlings into bigger pots i was intending to plant them straight into the vegetable garden but now im leaving ill need to find other homes for them am i supposed to apologise he was still discomfited you could have told us you were here i could have come out of the dark and said i heard every word thats what im doing now i didnt mean to eavesdrop but what marcia was sayingit made me feel she paused but of course its none of my business no there was no way to dress this up he decided shoving his sense of disquiet aside if he was going to sell this place he couldnt be looking over his shoulder all the time wondering what susie was thinking angus was so proud of his oranges she said wistfully and he braced himself someone else will be proud of a swimming pool it sounds like marcia will be proud thats right though its a business proposition shell be pleased if it means we get a good price for this place but she paused if you sell the castle doesnt the money go into trust it does hed looked into this it was a complex inheritance where the castle was a part of the entailed estate to be handed down to the inheriting earl generation after generation it had been made complex by the burning of the original castle meaning the capital had been moved here the trustees would allow sale but the proceeds would return to the trust but hed earn interest on a very sizeable sum will you and marcia have children she asked to inherit i how to answer that he thought about it and decided he didnt have to i have no idea its justwould your son prefer to inherit a castle or a heap of depreciating money hell susie but thats easy isnt it she said sadly thats the choice you made and youve made it really fast what would i do with this place if i kept it you could think laterally she said with sudden asperity instead of thinking whats the best way to make money from this place youre not exactly needy no but but youll chop down these gorgeous orange trees do you know its five hundred miles to the nearest place you can grow oranges from here the locals here eat anguss oranges all winter we have the best vitamin c intake per capita of any place in the country gee he said blankly and she glared at him in the dusk he couldnt see the glare he thought but he could feel it you dont care susie we both need to move on i am moving on she said with irritation youre not moving anywhere as far as i can see youre taking your money and bolting back to your safe hole in manhattan what is it with you and money why is it so important moneys important to everyone to provide necessities yes she snapped even enough to buy the odd luxury when you feel inclined but marcia says what you earn is way out of that league marcia has no right and neither do i she turned her back on him lifting a branch of cumquats heavy with fruit she started plucking the fruit from the loaded branch making a pile on the bench beside her ok ill butt out of whats not my business what are you doing im picking your cumquats she snapped again what does it look like what for they were hardly edible hed tried one yesterday they looked fabulous like tiny mandarins lush and filled with juice but the first bite had seen him recoil theyre great for marmalade you cant cook i intend to learn she said with dignity im leaving here the day after tomorrow and im taking some of anguss cumquat marmalade with me so youll learn and do it tomorrow why not she was fearless he thought a vision of susie down in the cove was suddenly in his head a scarred limping woman diving full on into the white water and heading for the outer reaches of the cove her body strong and sure and determined shed succeed in her landscaping business he thought clients would be lucky to get her she was so so he picked a couple cumquats to add to her pile and her body grew stiffer she had her back to himhe was of no importance to her thanks but i can do this myself you just said you cant cook marmalade neither can you but i have a connection to the internet i bet we could find a recipe so youll find a recipe she said and then decided maybe she was being a bit grumpy thank you ill do them tomorrow the assessors coming tomorrow ill do it after ive talked to him or he can talk to me while i stir the marmalade you need to pack tomorrow im almost packed you need to swim that made her pause she hesitated i you do want to swim on your last day of course but but you also want to make marmalade so lets make it now the stiffness of her back had lessened and she turned cautiously around could we id imagine we need lots of sugar and lots of jars how do you know well the jars are a given he said id guess we cant eat more than half a pint of marmalade tonight i suppose not we will need jars and my aunty molly used to make jam he added so i know we need almost as much sugar as fruit you used to watch your aunt molly cook i did he sounded uncomfortablehe knew he didand he saw her hesitate as if shed ask more she stared at him searching his face in the dim light looking for he didnt know what she was looking for and whatever it was he knew he didnt want her to find it or he thought he didnt want her to find it this conversation was too deep for him way too deep his thoughts were starting to become knotted and untangling them was impossible chop them off and get on with it he thought suddenly savage and he tugged a cumquat branch toward him and started plucking if were to finish before midnight then we start now he said and she waitedand watchedfor a moment longer before deciding to play along rose didnt have an afternoon nap so shes out for the count she said sos taffy i guess if i go to bed all ill do is dream of uprooted orange trees so i might as well make marmalade susie i know theres nothing either of us can do about it she shrugged im being unfair its a very nice offer to teach me to make marmalade i accept with pleasure do you think marcia would like to help chapter eight making marmalade was a tricky business it took sugar cumquats jars a recipe concentration they had everything they needed deirdre had obviously decided the pantry stores needed to be filled just like a real castles would be in case of siegeand as sugar didnt seem to have a useby date and the castle was slightly younger than siege times they were set they found a hoard of a hundred or so empty jars hamish downloaded a recipe from the internet they had a couple buckets of cumquats which left concentration concentration was harder susie had to remove pips from every cumquat hamish was standing right beside her pipping his own cumquats the castle was totally silent taffy and rose were fast asleep marcia was in her room online to the other side of the world werent you supposed to talk companionably as you cooked susie thought wasnt that in the manual he was so big so male he was focussed on each individual cumquat pip as if it was his next milliondollar deal he was justjust she was so so what he didnt know she was pipping her cumquats in silence focussed absolutely on the job in hand she was holding a cumquat half at arms length squinting at it so she wouldnt get hit in the eye by juice as she prodded for the pip her tongue was out to the side just a little bit intense concentration for marmalade shed make a good futures broker he thought she was up to approximately cumquat number ninety and she hadnt faltered intelligence persistence great little tongue cute nose eyes that were so how many more do you think she asked and he hauled himself back to cumquat duty with a start im thinking weve done enough right she eyed the rest of the cumquats theyd pickedin a bucket on the floor and as yet unpippedand shoved them under the bench with her bare toe out of sight maybe she wouldnt make such a great futures broker maybe shed make a better criminal lawyer he started to smile but she was waiting expectant and he had to haul his thoughts together and turn to the recipe ok put the cumquats and sugar together and cook until done just like that thats what it says no skill at all i could do this myself would you like to she hesitated no i wouldnt know what to do at the end it says what to do here great you read and ill stir she said ok so she stirred and he read and he stirred and she read and then they both sat and watched the vast pot of honeygold marmalade until finally finally their test drop formed a skin and hamish announced that it was done their cleaned jars had been sitting in the range for the duration of the cooking slowly warming hamish set the jars out and susie poured and poured and poured until they had thirtyodd jars of cumquat marmalade lined up on the big kitchen table they attached lids they cleaned up their mess and then they turned and looked in satisfaction at what theyd done all evening theyd worked almost in silence it wasnt that theyd meant to be silent or that they were uncomfortable with each other it was simply that words were unnecessary susie thought now as she looked at the golden jars words were even more unnecessary what theyd done this evening shed take this home with her would she eat it maybe but maybe shed keep one jar how long did marmalade last how long did love last where had that come from dumb thought she thought of rory of standing beside the man she loved making her wedding vows shed thought it would be for ever and now she was standing beside this big kindly man who was rorys cousin what she felt for him wasdifferent of course it was different how could she love hamish how could she not but hamishs thoughts were on practicalities well box them up he said softly looking at the pots with the air of a man whod done a difficult job to his satisfaction if we send them air freight theyll get there as fast as you will youll be able to eat loganaich castle marmalade for breakfast every morning will you keep some too sure he eyed the bucket under the bench this was a great new splinter skill how come hed never thought of doing such a thing maybe marcia and i can make some more but do you want all these he asked suddenly uncertain if you eat porridge for breakfast then youll hardly use thirty pots of marmalade i only eat porridge while im here i never eat porridge while im anywhere else he relaxed very wise so if marcia and i make more marmalade we can send it over maybe this is enough itll last for a good long time he grinned trying to tease her to smile he liked it when she smiled the stress lines around her eyes faded making her seem younger more carefree which was how she should be every time you eat it you can think that the cumquat trees havent lived in vain but that was a mistake as soon as the words were out he knew that hed committed an error reminding her the cumquat trees were doomed i guess ill remember theyve been knocked down if you want to be miserable you can think that i dont want to be miserable then dont think about it move on susie stop remembering this place if it makes you emotional yes if i stopped thinking about anything that makes me emotional id be in for a pretty barren existence you stay under control that way which is important of course its important he moved to adjust a marmalade jar which had dared not be in line with the others right he now had thirty perfectly controlled pots but moving hot jam jars was a mistake the jar he moved cracked like a miniexplosion in the stillness maybe the jam had been too hot maybe the jar hadnt been heated up enough whatever the reason there was suddenly jam running over the table spoiling his careful symmetry he moved to shift the nearest jars away from the broken one he lifted one then swore as the heat seared through the cloth hed used to lift it he dropped itand it cracked like its neighbour id just let them settle this among themselves susie said cautiously eyeing the mess with trepidation this might be an instance where lack of control just has to be accepted i never hamish if you lift another jar youre risking allout calamity i do want some marmalade to take home he eyed the jars he looked at his burnt fingers he looked at the mess but if i shifted these susie grabbed his arm and tugged him over to the sink leave it she ordered your poor hands she plunged his hand under cold waterwhich did feel better than trying to pick up more marmalade ill get some burn cream she told him but he shook his head its minor then stay under water for a little longer so he did the marmalade mess stayed untouched he stayedout of control she was so close she was holding his arm forcing his hand to stay under the water she was so susie im really sorry about the trees he managed you dont have to be sorry about the trees she said stiffly if i didnt think what marcia said made sense if i didnt realise that any purchaser will do exactly that chop them down to make way for a pool of course she said and sniffed its totally sensible she sniffed again susie dont cry im not crying of course she was crying tears were welling up behind her eyes threatening to fall at any minute ok we wont do it he said desperatelyand she dropped his hand in astonishment what we wont pull down the orange trees just because i cried she said cautiously i cant bear to see you you cant bear to see me cry so youll do what i want she thought about it and suddenly the tears welled up even more i think i need a slice of your inheritance susie oh i do tears were streaming down her face now i really do and i want you to promise me that youll wear your kilt every third monday of the month for the rest of your life he was backing off dont be ridiculous she wiped her face with the back of her hand turning off the tears like a tap there was dangerous mischief glinting behind the tears its not me whos being ridiculous you he stared at her stunned you turned on those tears at will neat trick isnt it to get what you want i never cry to get what i want you just did believe it or not i didnt if you think i really want you wearing a kilt driving the women of this world crazy then why i was teasing hamish douglas teasing youve never heard of the word by crying can we leave the crying alone its getting boring this was crazy she was standing there glaring at him her eyes still wet marmalade splashed all over her tshirt daring himdaring him i hate you to cry he said sounding dumb but he didnt know how else to sound so im not crying susie what she said almost crossly and she folded her arms across her breasts and glared youre crazy sure im crazy i want what do you want hamish douglas what did he want the question hung he glared at her marmaladestained and rumpled and angry and not crying and suddenly suddenly the mist cleared to make way for one dumb plan there was a myriad of emotions running through his head right now emotions chasing their respective tails but the only thing he could think was a stupid unwise crazy thought but once thought it was not possible to put it aside it was just there it had to surface it did surface i want to kiss you he said there was a moments silence a long moments silence she appeared to consider jutting her chin slightly forward slightly belligerent taking her time to come up with a response and finally she did well why dont you she said what was he doing wanting to kiss susie was he mad he was engaged to marcia marcia could walk in at any minute even though she wasnt possessive to find her fiancé kissing another woman might push her a wee bit far might it would he thought wildly searching frantically for the control he so valued but his control was nowhere to be found for susie was right in front of him battered bruised and beloved susie beloved where had that word come from it was just there as was susie she was right in front of him ready and waiting to be kissed was she mad was she losing her cottonpicking mind to kiss hamish to let him kiss her he was engaged to another woman and the day after tomorrow she was leaving here and shed never see him again in her life which was whywhich was why she was proposing to let him kiss her she decided for there was a tiny part of her brain that said this was all there was this moment this tiny connection that could only last for one fleeting kiss and then be over shed dared him to kiss her and hed do just that or she certainly hoped he would the signs were good he had his hands on her waist he was taking his time lingering looking down into her eyes as he drew her against him he was making sure that he wasnt coercing her he was making sure that she hadnt made some daft stupid mistake when shed agreed to be kissed maybe she had made some daft stupid mistake but she wasnt admitting it not now when he was so near so close not when he was sohamish she was being drawn into him now she was allowing those big capable handsthese lovely strong and battered handsto pull her against him her breasts were being moulded against the strength of his chest his hand shifted to cup her chin tilting her face so her eyes met his things were looking hopeful here very hopeful indeed he smiled down at her then a rueful searching smile that asked more questions than it answered but there was such tenderness in his look suchlove he was asking a silent question but she couldnt respond how could she respond she gazed helplessly up at him and the last vestiges of her laughter faded as she felt her heart lurch sideways as she felt her heart still and then start to race as it had almost forgotten it could race as she fell as she tumbled deeper and deeper in love with the man before her he was engaged to another woman she tried to think that but she couldnt for it simply couldnt matter this was too important she thought hamish intended to kiss her and all she could do was waitand hope or raise her face a little more to meet his kiss or she could put her hands on his face and draw him down to her definitely shed definitely do that she could not think of marcia or rory there was no room to think of anything or anyone but hamish and his kiss she could drown in this kiss what was he doing kissing a woman who wasnt marcia he was doing what was right he decided he was doing what needed to be done he was doing what hed ached to do from the moment hed first seen susie oh the feel of him the strength and yet the tenderness the certainty and yet the hesitation his mouth plundered hers yet she knew that if she pulled backat the slightest hint of pressurehed release her for this was no man claiming his rights he was as unsure as she was as stunned by the strength of feeling between them and the feeling was unbelievably erotic hamish the wild beating of her heart settled and things slipped into place things that had been out of kilter with her world for so long shed thought when rory had died that she could never love againbut the heart expanded to fit all needs she still loved rory shed love him till the day she died but hamish was a different man a different love her new wonderful love his lips were on hers and he kissed her as shed ached to be kissedbut she hadnt known there was this ache within her his lips were tentative tasting her feeling her response feeling by the faint parting of her lips that he was oh so welcome hamish maybe she said his name she didnt know but his kiss moved to her nose gently teasing to her eyelids maybe tasting the salt still left by her tears her fake tears produced to mock but how could she ever mock this man his fingers were raking her hair and the sensation was magic she moaned a little and kissed him back finding his mouth and claiming it tugging his body hard against hers curving into him she lifted his hand and led it to her breast her body was arching against his it had been almost two long years since shed been held by a man shed loved one man and shed thought her body could never fit with another but she was wrong oh she was gloriously wonderfully wrong her hamish marcia was nowhere marcia simply didnt exist but this was no betrayal susie was no traitorous vixen searching for another womans man this had gone way past that hamish belonged to no other woman hamish was simply a part of her she locked his arms behind him then lifted her head to allow him to kiss her as deeply as he wanted he was tasting her neck caressing her shoulders with his tongue and the sensation was so exquisite she thought she must sob with aching pleasure he slipped his fingers under the soft fabric of her tshirt cupping the smooth contours of her breasts making her moan softly with love and desire her hands were locked about his head now deepening the kiss deepening deepening there was such want she hadnt known how alone she was until tonight when suddenly she was no longer alone this man was her man she knew it at some primeval level she couldnt begin to understand and didnt want to try the only place in the world that she should ever be at peace was right here in this mans arms within the arms of the man she truly loved she melted into his kiss with abandon surrendering to the promise of his body to the feeling that here in his arms anything was possible shed never be lonely shed never be alone with hamish beside her she could take on the world susie he whispered and his voice was as unsteady as she felt dear god susie we cant we cant make love she froze at that she froze and thought about it and reality came flooding back awareness of her surroundings awareness of marcia you mean we cant make love right here in the marmalade wellitd be a bit sticky i guess she pulled away a little searching to see his face he looked dazed confused and a little afraid hey theres no need to look scared she said and he shook his head searching for some sort of reality im not scared reality was slamming back fast marcia was just upstairs hamish was engaged to be married to marcia susie was on her own the day after tomorrow she was leaving here hamish had never said he wanted her he never said he needed her yet here she was wearing her heart on her sleeve making herself wantonly available it couldnt be wanton to kiss the man she loved but he didnt love her she could see if his eyes reflected hers theyd be full of love and desire and hed be moving to hug her moving to claim her instead of which he was staring at her as if she were some sort of witch capable of casting a spell i didnt mean it needed only that you didnt mean to kiss me no susie im engaged to marcia somehow she made her voice work of course i look its late and were overtired andand it was only a goodnight kiss after all liar she screamed at herself but he was nodding though his eyes said he knew as well as she did that it had been no such thing we cant susie marcia and i are getting married of course and you and i wed be impossible im so emotional yes he said and there was almost relief in his voice you cry i do she agreed cordially feeling like crying now but there was no way shed cry something was being destroyed that had hardly started to be created he was still looking at her as if he was afraid she wanted to scream she wanted to she didnt know what she wanted of course i cry she whispered and you hate crying i cry all the time happy and sad and you cant stand it an errant tear rolled down her cheek right then and she wiped it away with anger he was rightshe couldnt even stop crying to save herself im not in control she admitted well thats ok thats the state of my existence but for a moment there you werent in control either thats whats scaring you isnt it you hate it well she took a long searing breath searching frantically for the words to say to finish it as it had to be finished she finally found them right or not but the words that had to be said marcias upstairs hamish shes your fiancée shes your future and i need to check on taffy i need to check on rose my baby and my puppy theyre my future and by kissing you im just interfering with the way of the world with the way things have to be from this day forth and before he could say another word shed turned and fled out of the kitchen door back out into the night to the vegetable garden to the conservatory to the beach he couldnt know there were tears welling in her eyes as she turned away he couldnt follow should he go to marcia no he was going to bed alone chapter nine hamish went upstairs he paused by marcias door feeling bad he knocked lightly and opened the door a crack marcia was on the phone her laptop on her knees listening intently to the person at the end of the line and staring at her screen she looked up briefly saw it was him and blew him a kiss using the phone instead of fingers he wasnt wanted he closed the door and went to his own room bed sleep it was nowhere to be found why had he kissed her it wasnt as if he could possibly take this any further it was so unsuitable hell if he married susie shed expect more than a telephone kiss goodnight it could never work he thought of the house hed grown up in a house full of hysterical women who had used their emotions to manipulate everyone around them hed fought so hard to get away from that to catapult himself back into it susie wouldnt try to manipulate him no but she couldnt help it he thought of finishing work and heading home as he usually did exhausted beyond belief collapsing into bed before getting up to do some hard gym work before the next day at the office how would susie fit into that shed hate it hed hate it he wouldnt do it what would he do instead cut it out he told himself fiercely into the night youve spent the last thirty years building up the life you want and to toss it all away for oneone it wouldnt be one he told himself grimly itd be more susie came with attachments rose taffy and more shed want more and theyd all be emotional he thought of taffy sitting on the grass and howling her lungs out because she couldnt get what she wanted he grinned no be serious get up and go see whats marcia working on she wouldnt thank him for the interference she was fiercely independent good great life was fine go to sleep ha he lay for another halfhour or so listening to the soft hushhush of the sea the castle was quiet maybe he could go down and chat to ernst and eric as if on cue there was a knock on the door he didnt have to resort to tinplated armour he thought itd be marcia come in he called and wondered why he felt empty as though marcia coming in was going to expose something he didnt want exposed but it wasnt marcia it was susie peering round the door her face worried in the moonlight sorry to wake you you didnt wake me he was half out of bed whats wrong nothing i just is taffy here no are you sure sure im sure he frowned my bedroom door was shut when i came upstairs and its shut now she couldnt have got in oh sorry then is she lost he was out of bed crossing the floor concerned no she said urgently stopping him in his tracks theres no need for you to come but if you cant find her shell be somewhere sound asleep she said this place is too big well find her when she wakes up but you were looking for her now i thought id take her outside for a piddle before i went to bed but if shes curled up somewhere i cant find her then ill have to wait until she wakes up buthow will you know id imagine taffy is very good at letting us know where she is when shes hungry she said and he could tell that she was making a huge effort to keep her voice light damn he shouldnt have kissed her it had brought in all these tensions that he didnt have a clue what to do with youve heard her howl so i have he said but go back to bed hamish she told him have you checked marcias room yes shes been working all the time shes still working now i thought anyway if you hear taffy raising a riot in the wee small hours youll know what it is ive warned marcia let me help you find her no she said flatly please hamish go back to bed id like to help i dont want you helping she hesitated hamish i need to be by myself for the rest of the time im here im not sure why what happened tonight happened but it was dumb and meaningless and i need to back right off good night hamish she closed the door before he could respond he should follow he could help her search the thought of susie searching for her pup in this vast castle left him uneasy the thought of susie doing anything alone left him uneasy what had she said what happened tonight was dumb and meaningless of course it was they both knew it susie was a woman who was controlled by her emotions and hewell he knew where emotions belonged they didnt belong with susie taffy if hamish heard hed come down and help he mustnt hear but where was a little dog out here in this huge garden and the cliffs so near taffy had gone over the road to the beach with them so she knew the way if shed tried there was only one path down to the beach if shed become disoriented and ended up on the rocks should she ask hamish for help no it was as shed assured him the night was calm and still and if taffy needed anything she only had to howl shed be snoozing in some obscure corner and if hamish came down and helped her search for a puppy who didnt need finding then they mightthey might she darent ask hamish for help but she needed to find taffy she needed to hug her she needed to hug someone she was bone weary she had a huge day tomorrow she should be in bed right now instead she was just going to walk over the road to the beginning of the path to the beach just to check taffy seven am hamish walked into the kitchen wanting coffee and jake was standing at the kitchen bench fully clothed pouring coffee maybe it was a guy thing but walking in on a man who was fully dressed and looked ready for businesshard physical businesswhen wearing boxer shorts and nothing else made hamish feel a bit like retreating fast he eyed jakes workmanlike moleskins and heavyduty shirt with misgivings morning he said cautiously and jake swivelled to stare at him this wasnt a stare of ooh whos wearing ancient boxers it was a stare of active dislike good of you to join us he growled hamish glanced at his watch seven was not what youd call a slovenly hour to wake up are you here for breakfast we had breakfast an hour ago we the girls and i kirstys taken rose home with her susies searching the bushland behind the garden ive come back to make a few phone calls well get some backup his voice was so cold each word was practically an icicle i want susie to get some rest shes not fit to be searching as shes been doing all night his heart stilled taffy he said hell she didnt find taffy if anything jakes expression grew colder she said she told you the pup was lost i thought she must have been mistaken to let her stay up all night she didnt stay up all night oh she didnt jake said fine hamish stared at jake in consternation jake stared back as if hamish was something lower than pond scum i offered to search with her hamish said desperately she said she was sure the pup was somewhere in the castle that shed howl when she woke up shes good at howling its not much use howling when youre outside jake muttered more to himself than to hamish theres owls hunting at night if taffys attracted one of them im thinking thats what will have happened shes not outside hamish said flatly shes in the castle if she was in the castle shed be howling by now shes a tenweekold pup who hasnt been fed for twelve hours but she was locked in the wet room susie put her there when she put rose down for the night i gather marcia used the wet room as a passage early last night jake said it seems she left the door open hamish thought back marcia in the conservatory fielding phone calls marcia walking back to the house to get notes shed never notice a pup wheres marcia now on the phone to new york where do you think jakes voice said marcia was right there in the pond with hamish she hasnt seen the pup what do you think hamish was already backing out the door heading for some clothes why are you here susie rang kirsty at dawn over a dog dumb isnt it jake said cordially only a dog but susie loves her hamish closed his eyes ill get dressed right jake said politely turning back to the phone ill add you to the search party shall i shell be dead susie stood in the middle of the cove and stared despairingly along the beach shell have been taken by an owl or an eagle its just dumb to keep looking dumb dumb dumb hey its not hopeless kirsty told her shed left all the kids with her housekeeper and come straight back we have half dolphin cove out searching jake says the numbers are up to eighty already eighty susie hiccuped on a mix of laughter and a sob for one little puppy everyone loves you kirsty said solidly theres people coming from everywhere to look shell be dead well keep looking until we find her hamish couldnt believe it hed been out in the bushland behind the castlethree hours of combing the rough gullies and hillside searching in what seemed an increasingly hopeless case hed returned to find the kitchen like a military planning area whatd happen if a child was lost he asked in amazement kirsty looked up from the table where she was crossing grid lines off a map and gave him a weary smile more of the same she shrugged much more ok it might be over the top but the winds up which means the fishing fleet cant get out so the fishermen dont have anything else to do and everyone knows susies leaving tomorrow were upset about it already without this happening wheres susie now i talked her into having a lie down she hesitated you know susies not just devastated because of the puppy he thought about it and decided yes kirsty was right but he knew where kirsty was headed and there were places there he didnt want to go shell miss you too he said deliberately obtuse and she gave him a long thoughtful look that reminded him uncomfortably of her twin as you say is jake out searching jake had morning surgery he had to go so jake was getting on with business well someone has some sense her face stilled at that yes she really was very like susie he thought and then he thought about what hed said maybe it hadnt beensensible sense is a really strange thing she said softly just when you think you have it cornered it turns into something else be careful what you think is sensible hamish douglas it might just turn around and bite you hamish as if on cue a voice came from the door he turned and marcia was standing in the doorway looking displeased where have you been out searching the cell phone in her hand vibrated before he could say any more she stared at the screen prioritised and abandoned the caller how often was she separated from her phone hamish thought and then he wondered how often hed been separated from his until hed come here maybe never youre wanted she said briefly obviously annoyed susie wants me by the hotel assessor she snapped you knew he was coming this morning hes in the drawing room ive shown him around but he wants to talk to youand to susie ill come he said wearily raking his hand through his hair but susies not to be disturbed he turned back to kirsty let me know if theres any news hamish had to focus lachlan glendinning was the representative of an international realty firm hed been valuing a hotel up in northern queensland and hed taken time and considerable trouble to travel to dolphin bay telling him he couldnt spend time with him because a puppy was missingespecially when susie had the whole town combing the surrounding estate looking for himseemed crazy but there was no mistaking that outside with the search party was where hamish wanted to be why he wondered as he answered lachlans endless questions going over the family history as he knew it luckily hed read many of anguss family papers so he had the answers to most questions but his eyes kept straying outside people were going back and forth under the window he could see people down on the beach i hear theres a lost dog lachlan said genially he was smooth and slick and clever knowing exactly what he was looking for in the real estate market and knowing hed found it in loganaich castle this is quite some community spirit you have here the towns picturesque too im thinking we could build this really big im sure you could marcia agreed shed abandoned her cell phone and had joined in the conversation with enthusiasm she and lachlan spoke the same language i really would like to speak to mrs douglas lachlan said regretfully are you sure theres no way theres no way hamish rose marcia would you like to show lachlan the grounds if hes seen all there is here ive seen enough of the inside lachlan said its a great interior they passed into the hall and he poked at ernst with his goldembellished fountain pen though these guys will have to go i know where we can get some real ones ernst and eric are coming home with me it was susie entering unannounced her face was pale and there were the ravages where tears had been but there were no tears left now she was dignified and in control and she introduced herself and took marcias place by lachlans side as if it was her right ill show you the garden she told him im sure marcia and hamish have business to attend to i should go back online marcia agreed and susie gave her a bright and brittle smile of course ill go back to the search hamish said softly but the look she directed at him had no trace of a smile left in it its no use she told him taffys dead shes been out all night if the nocturnal owls didnt kill her the wedgetail eagles will have by now she turned to lachlan im sorry i wasnt here to greet you marcia says youll be thinking about converting the conservatory to a swimming pool before any sale is made you need to see it ill take you susie you dont need to think about that hamish said uneasily and received a flash of anger for his pains i know i dont need to think about it lord douglas she snapped emphasising his title with a short harsh syllable my plane leaves tomorrow afternoon and after that this is all your business this castle is in the hands of the heir thats you and youre going to sell it and put the money in the bank which is the only sensible place for it marcia interspersed it is susie agreed dully of course it is so shall we see the possible site for your luxury swimming pool mr glendinning susie go look for your puppy hamish said desperately and she looked like she wanted to slap him my puppy is dead then why wasnt she crying hamish thought she should be crying hed know what to do if she cried what was he saying he wanted a woman to cry well show mr glendinning the conservatory together he said gently now but her anger was increasing well do nothing together susie let her go marcia said shes got the time hamish surely you have better things to be doing what he thought blankly what ill go back to the beach give it up marcia said wearily didnt you hear susie the creatures dead the creature he was supposed to be marrying this woman he thought of taffy last night sitting plump on her bottom and howling her displeasure the creature we have no proof shes dead he said to the room in general if youll excuse me ill keep looking until were sure and he walked away and left them to it why hadnt she cried all that long day hamish watched susie move like an automaton she spent a long time with lachlan detailing the castle to his satisfaction she worked in the kitchen feeding the searchers she did a bit more searching herself but her back was obviously paining her she was limping badly and when kirsty decreed she should stop she stopped she went back to packing the pile of stuff she was discarding growing higher and higher ill ship ernst and eric over to you hamish said at one stage and if looks could kill hed have been dead right then ive changed my mind theyd never be at home with me in america they belong at the foot of the stairs and if you want to shift themwell thats your business and i dont want to know about it susie stay a little longer he urged why we dont know about taffy we do know about taffy cut it out hamish im leaving she wouldnt budge at dusk marcia came to find hamish she met him on the way upstairs to change hed been bashing through thick bushland in an increasingly hopeless search for taffy and he was filthy we need to take lachlan out to dinner she said hes spent the day photographing the castle from every anglenot that youd have noticed honestly hamish your behaviour has been less than civil hes staying at the pub tonight itd be better if we could put him up here but i dare say you wont ask the widow to do that do you have to call her the widow you know who i mean i wont ask susie to have another guest on her last night hamish snapped wondering again how hed never noticed how insensitive marcia was its bad enough that were here jake and kirsty are bringing dinner susie needs her family and no one else then you and i should at least take him out to dinner youre not susies family he wasnt hamish hesitated marcia was right he should give lachlan dinner andwould susie want him to be around tonight but kirsty came through the front door then carrying a casserole hi she told them dinner in thirty minutes were going out to dinner marcia said sounding efficient oh kirsty raised her eyebrows you too she asked hamish um i shouldnt put pressure on you kirsty told him but it would be better if you were here tonight why marcia demanded why should hamish stay kirsty looked a bit taken aback at that as if she hadnt actually expected an argument to leaven the loaf she said at last susies miserable weve searched a twomile radius and taffys nowhere taffy was supposed to be the little bit of dolphin bay she was taking away with her now theres just susie and rose not even ernst and eric hamish thought leaning back on a suit of armour welcoming the sharp dig of a halberd in the small of his back susie will be better off without a pup marcia said sharply the fewer encumbrances the better kirsty looked at her thoughtfully appraisingly then glanced sideways at hamish leaning wearily on his halberd youre taking the assessor lachlan out to dinner she asked marcia thats right then can i ask that you marcia take lachlan out to dinner and you hamish stay here and see if you can cheer susie up wear your kilt or something i suspect theres not a lot thatll cheer susie up hamish said no she admitted but we can try hamish hesitated marcia looked at her watch she tapped her foot she looked at hamish and saw indecision or maybedecision there was one thing that could always be said about marcia she was good at sussing which way the wind was blowing she was excellent at not wearing herself out fighting the inevitable ill go then she said visibly annoyed honestly hamish someone has to keep a business head on their shoulders in this whole debacle they do he agreed but he was watching kirsty seeing kirstys disapproval thinking how very like her twin she was was susie vibrating with the same disapproval probably not he thought shed be in her bedroom sorting the last things she wanted to take from this place shed be thinking of angus or of taffy or of walking away from her vegetable garden and leaving her wonderful conservatory to be ripped apart thered be no room in her distraught mind for disapproval of one dumb wouldbe earl youre not spending more time looking for the dog marcia was demanding looking at him as if she didnt know who he was any more which come to think of it was pretty much exactly how he was feeling about himself everyones saying itll be dead shell be dead kirsty said softly and the look she gave hamish then was slightly doubtful but well give the grounds one more sweep after dinner miracles dont happen hamish said flatly and kirsty gave him another odd look well see we certainly have enough pumpkins around here for a spell or two to happen she shook herself obviously perturbed that she was getting fanciful ok i

casseroleso we have at last count eleven marcia if you and lachlan arent joining us wed better start now we have a lot of eating to do it was a very strained meal they had eleven casseroles between them they ate about half of one and that was with kirsty and jakes twins helping the two little girls were the only bright company during the meal but even their chatter was pointed daddy why does aunty susie have to go back to america thats where her home is but her home is here this castle belongs to lord hamish now jake told them gently but everyone says lord hamish doesnt want it lord hamish doesnt have to want it susie told the girls with only a hint of a tremor in her voice its just the way things are its his and i dont belong here any more but youre our auntie susie alice said tremulously and penelope agreed we want you to stay and you havent got a puppy to take home now youll be really really lonely ill have rose susie said her voice strained to breaking point she rose to fetch the coffeepot from the stove and started to pour coffee hamish please none for me kirsty told her and susie stilled shed been facing the stove now she turned very very slowly to face her twin you always have coffee after dinner i not now kirsty seemed all at once uncomfortable and susies face grew even more blank i was right she said and her voice was devoid of all expression at the fair you deflected me with taffy and i was so preoccupied i let myself be deflected youre pregnant oh susie kirsty said her face twisting in distress thats lovely news susie managed and stooped to give her twin a hug but there was no joy hamish thought watching the tableau in incomprehension what was going on i so didnt want you to find out until when susie turned back to her coffee cups i thoughtuntil you were settled back in america wont this make a difference hamish asked concerned they both seemed on the edge of tears but there were no tears just rigid control sure kirsty said coldly ask susie to stay because im pregnant how could i do that to her easy hamish thought remembering his mother and his aunts he knew exactly how emotional blackmail was done i wont ask for the same reason susie hasnt asked you not to sell the castle not to destroy the greenhouse i bet she hasnt has she no but and if i did and you agreed susie said suddenly fierce how do you think thatd make me feel for the rest of my life and if kirsty thought i was staying now just for the babyshe couldnt bear it thats why she hasnt told me i dont know where you come from hamish douglas but we dont do emotional blackmail here she swallowed and turned her back on him facing her sister again youre due when not until november its early days yet if i can ill come back of course you will to stay hamish said cautiously and got another glare for his pains to visit like normal people do but you guys are twins he said feeling helpless you should be together theyll be together for the birth jake said putting his hand across the table to reach his wife taking kirstys hand in his and holding it firmly and with love if i have to sail across the atlantic singlehanded and haul susie back here in chains i promise youll be together for the birth im covering the expenses and if susie argues then shell see what brothersinlaw are really made of oh jake susie said choked and hamish thought here at last come the tears but they didnt susie stared at her sister and her brotherinlaw for a long momentand then went back to her coffeemaking with one mug of hot chocolate for the expectant mother chapter ten kirsty and jake and assorted kids left soon after the arrangement was that they were taking susie to the airport the next dayjake had organised medical cover for the town from a locum service so both doctors could leave they took all the kids home with them to give susie a clear run with her packing well be here at eight tomorrow to pick you up kirsty told her twin ill be ready susie promised and hamish thought once again why didnt she cry she should be crying she cried at pumpkins why didnt she cry now suddenly he thought he wanted her to cry itd be ok if she cried he decided it was the set wooden expression on her face that he hated he stood in the hall and waited while she waved them off from the front step and he was waiting for her as she returned what would you like me to do he asked softly and she glanced at him with suspicion nothing ill go down to the beach then he said just for a last check taffys dead you dont know that yes i do im not stupid tenweekold puppy in this terrain i see things how they are hamish not how i want them to be you should be able to hope i gave up on that when i buried rory she said flatly now if you dont mind i have things to do can i help you pack he should butt out he thought he was adding to her distress just by being here he felt so damned helpless i would appreciate help in anguss room she said and then looked as if she regretted saying it what needs doing in anguss room its just she hesitated ive never cleared it out i mean it all belongs to you but i thoughthis personal stuffmost of it needs to be thrown away but i dont want marcia doing it the last few words were said in a rush fiercely and he thought shed burst into tears but she didnt she was pale and almost defiant tilting her chin as though expecting to meet a fight marcias the least sentimental of all of us he said mildly and her chin came forward another inch all the more reason why she shouldnt be the one who takes care of it so on a night when she should be doing her own personal packing when the last vestiges of the search party made vain sweeps of the beach and the hillside looking for taffy when kirsty and jake cared for the kids so susie could spend one night alone with her memories she and hamish sat on anguss bedroom floor and sortedstuff stuff deirdres stuff and anguss stuff the old man hadnt cleared his wifes things and everything was still there the clothes were easy theyd go to the welfare shops hamish could be trusted with that so with the exception of anguss kilt and sporran and beret they were bundled into boxes to be carted away but the kilt and beret and sporran i dont know what to do with these susie whispered holding up a kilt that was far too small for hamish hamish fingered the fabric watching the graceful fall of the pleats thinking of the times angus must have worn this the number of fêtes hed opened in this town the affection in which hed been held is there a local museum no a library maybe yes then why dont we donate it as a display he suggested i could donate the cost of a display cabinet we could put anguss and deirdres photos in it photos that show them as they were vibrant and having fun and set this costume up beside it do you think the locals would like it there was a moments hesitation had he said the wrong thing would she cry she didnt cry thatd be wonderful she said in a small voice can i leave it with you to see that its done of course she nodded a brisk businesslike little nod that had him wishing wishing shed falter a little give him room room to what im not marrying marcia he said into the stillness and her head jerked up from the papers she was sorting youre what he hadnt even known he was going to say it he hadnt even really thought about it or maybe he had hed approached marriage to marcia as he approached business propositions he thought the marriage would be advantageous to both of them but these last few days had been like the switching on of a lightbulb in a dimly lit room suddenly he could see colour where before hed only seen grey suddenly hed not only stopped fearing emotion he was thinking a bit more emotion wouldnt be such a bad thing like susie crying so he could hug her better does marcia know youre not marrying her susie asked her head lowered again and her voice dulled she was in a grey world of her own right now he thought methodically packing stuff into boxes lifting anguss papers checking them putting unwanted ones in a pile to be burned shifting the detritus of a past life absorbed in her own misery ill tell her tonight id appreciate it if you left it until i was gone shes going to blame me why should she blame you there was a twisted smile at that im a corrupting influence she said dryly i make you leave your blackberry at home when we go to the beach thats a good thing too he said stoutly and then watched her for a bit more as she went back to sorting papers susie do you have to do this i can do it after you leave angus would want me to i should have done it before this i justi couldnt bear to she hesitated will marcia be upset do you think he thought about it would marcia be heartbroken no but maybe her pride would be hurt i think maybe i should have told her before i told you he said ruefully yeah shed hate that well forget you told me ill forget i know i need you to know he said softly and it was true silence she bent her head over her sheath of documents a pile of notepaper pastel blue more silence where was he going here he didnt know five minutes ago hed been engaged to marcia he still could be he thought confused what hed said didnt have to go out of this room it wasnt irrevocable but it was irrevocable and the more he thought about it the more irrevocable it seemed engaged he wasnt engaged to marcia engaged meant entwined linked connected he surely wasnt entwined linked connected to marcia tonight hed watched kirsty and jake over the dinner table hed seen their eyes meet as theyd shared their distress and that glance it had been nothing but it had meant everything he wanted that sort of communication with the woman he married he didnt want to share a beachtowel with a laptop go to bed he told susie softly because he wasnt sure what his head was doingwhere his thoughts were taking him he needed time to think this through these are personal i need to sort them ill pack them up and send them to you no you pack the clothes susie you need to pack your own gear the way youre going you wont get to bed tonight its not as if you can sleep on the plane rose will be a fulltime job thats not your business she snapped it wasnt but hell he couldnt bear to see this theres nothing so personal these are letters she cut across his protest fiercely angry these are personal letters then maybe we shouldnt read them at all no her anger faded a little at that but the pain seemed to remain she was kneeling on the floor by anguss bedside cabinet papers spread around her still in her shorts and tshirt with her hair tangled and wisping round her facethe last thing shed thought of today had been brushing her hairshe looked absurdly young how could this slip of a girl be a mother hamish wondered how could she be a landscape gardener by herself susie against the world listen to this she said softly and he paused in his folding of sweaters and let himself watch her face again she was holding herself rigidly under control he thought so rigidly that at any minute it seemed she might crack listen to what i knowwell maybe i know that we ought to burn these without reading them she whispered but angus knew he was dying and he left them so maybemaybe what maybe he didnt mind us reading them maybe he was even proud of them this is from deirdre way back when she was shopping for the contents of this castle were talking forty years back its not too personal you need to know a bit of backstory she told him ignoring his query angus put a huge amount into this castle because building it provided an industry for the men of the town in a time of recession but the locals say he scared himself with how much it cost and when it came to furnishings he turned into a real scrooge i cant imagine the angus ive heard about being tight with his money he said and susies face softened in agreement neither can i but listen to this deirdres obviously in the city on a buying spree writing to angus back home my love we have children angus darling its one of the great sadnesses of our marriage that we havent been blessed with babies and we cant adopt well ive found a replacement no sweetheart i havent picked up a couple of strays much as im always hopeful a couple will come our way but today ive found eric and ernst who are eric and ernst i can hear you say it in increasing trepidation irish wolfhounds maybe diggers up of vegetable gardens no theyre warriors they stand eight feet tall in their gauntletedis that what you call itfeet theyre a sort of madeinjapan imitation suit of armour real and ready to fight lifelike right up to the eyes in their visorswhite glass eyes with a little black pupil that bobs up and down when you lift the visor up and peer in i found them in the back of a theatrepropcumjunkshop and theyre so neglected angus ernst is missing a leg can you believe that well need to build him a new one do you know a leg builder theyre shop soiled and tattered and unloved and i just looked at them and knew they were destined to stay with us for as long as we live anyway dearest kindest angus this is to say that were coming home on friday and if you were planning on meeting the train in your car can you think again i talked to the nice man at the railways today and he says he cant guarantee theyll be safe in the goods car so ive bought two extra tickets ernst and eric can sit in the carriage with me isnt that the best thing can you imagine it oh my dear im so excited i so want you to meet them you and me and eric and ernst ready to live happily ever after from this moment forth there was a long silence it was a ridiculous letter hamish thought of marcia writing such a letter and couldnt he tried to imagine susie writing such a letterand could very very easily susie and deirdre twin souls there were too many twins his head was spinning why couldnt she have children he asked at last trying to sound neutral surely forty years ago adoption was an option he was changing the subject here and he wasnt quite sure what he was changing it from but he was starting to feel desperate deirdre was profoundly deaf susie said softly rereading the letter with a smile i imagine adoption agencies wouldnt see deafness as a desirable attribute in adoptive couples from what i know of deirdre she might have excluded herself on those grounds that floored him he sat back on his heels and thought of what he knew of deirdre i thought she was a nurse during the war she was how could she be a nurse if she was deaf she worked in a rehabilitation hospital i imagine she would have fought tooth and nail to be useful lack of hearing wouldnt have stopped her from what ive heard of deirdre she refused ever to stand still half the older generation of this town knows some sort of sign language as everyone wanted to talk to her they tell me she was irresistible angus loved her so much the twin thing slammed back again deirdre and susie taking on life no matter what life threw at them how could they ever have communicated without email susie said dryly its beyond comprehension isnt it but angus said he woke up one morning in his army hospital she was standing by his bed and she smiled at himand he just knew love across a crowded room he said disparagingly right one of the other soldiers had lent him a magazine like playboy she continued ignoring his attempt at sarcasm hed gone to sleep with bunny of the month splayed across his chest he woke and deirdre was giggling and he thought sod bunnies this is the one i want sod bunnies susie was smiling again when she smiled it was as if the sun came out hamish thought and anguss words slammed into his consciousness with the force of a highvoltage charge this is the one i want i dont suppose he said into the stillness and then paused you dont suppose what she was back to sorting her head down her curls falling forward intent on the task at hand i dont suppose youd like to marry me there was complete and utter silence in the room and the silence lasted for ever what had he said the words rang round and round in the silence echoing over and over he hadnt meant to say them he thought wildly they were just suddenlythere marry susie said at last and she sounded like shed been winded youre asking me to marry you yes he thought about it wondering what on earth he was saying but somehow the words still sounded right his proposal might have been made on the spur of the moment but that was definitely the gist of what hed been asking and youre asking me to marry you because susie demanded she had her breath back now and was sounding politely bemused which was wrong he didnt want her to sound politely bemused i suspect im in love with you he managed and listened to what hed said and thought yep that sounds ok too he sounded confusedbut then he was feeling confused about some things not marriage he was sure about this youre engaged to marcia im not marrying marcia marcia thinks youre marrying marcia ive made a mistake he said jodie told me i was making a mistake and i didnt see it its only now whos jodie another fiancée jodies with nick hes a woodcarver he thought about the way jodie had said goodbye to him the way shed dared him to take this holiday and move on jodie would be proud of him so you moved on to marcia jodies my secretary shes still in your life susie can we get back to the issue at hand which is that youd like to marry me yes this was dumb he thought he was sitting on one side of the room in a tangle of sweaters and socks she was sitting on the far side of anguss bed surrounded by papers he should be down on one knee on her side of the room at the very least they should just have had a candlelit dinnernot the country womens association tuna surprise he thought of the finesse of his proposal to marcia and the dinner that had preceded it and he almost grinned but not quite a survival instinct was kicking in here telling him that chuckling over cliché engagement settings wasnt quite the thing to do right now why do you think you love me she still had the conversational tone hed like to move closer but her wordsthey were like a defence he thought a bit brittle a bit too casual susie i dont want you going back to the states by yourself im not going by myself im going with rosie you know what i mean im not sure what youre suggesting here she still hadnt moved and neither had he it was like some crazy stilted conversation about something that concerned neither of them are you saying you want me to stay here and youll stay tooor are you saying you want me to come back with you he hadnt thought that far ahead he tried to make his mind work but there was something akin to fog blanketing everything making it impossible to apply logic he was terrified he thought suddenly he was just plain terrified stepping off into some abyss hey hamish im not going to accept she said gently theres no reason to look like that like what like im a cliff edge she said gently i wont do that to you youre no cliff edge but hed been thinking that how had she known you dont really want to marry me i do this seemed important if he kept saying it then itd start to make sense he decided it must make sense what would you do with me she almost sounded amused back in manhattan you could work theres all sorts of landscaping jobs windowboxes to be planted out that sort of thing wed get a place further out he said starting to sound as dopy as he felt i can commuteor stay in manhattan during the week and come home at weekends in the tiny gaps you have from work at least you wouldnt be alone she let her breath out in a long exhalation she looked at him then really looked at himand then she pushed herself to her feet hamish this is crazy you havent thought it out forget you said it its time i went to bed ill get up early and see how much of this i can cope with then she was letting him off the hook he thought but he didnt want to be off the hook sure he hadnt thought this through but the essentials were there he rose with speed crossing to stand before her reaching out to grasp her wrists and hold her at arms length susie it could work he said urgently dont be daft im not daft if you didnt feel sorry for me she said softly would you be even thinking of marriage no i thats what i thought she said flatly and hauled her arms back no his word exploded across the room frightening in its intensity he took her hands in his urgent susie its not like that its not she swallowed seemingly as confused as he was struggling to figure things out if i wasnt limping would you be thinking you could possibly let marcia down i cant marry marcia not feeling as i do about you but youre talking about commuting in the gaps from work in the same breath as a proposal to stop me being lonely she took a deep breath and carefully carefully disengaged her hands hamish when i was single i loved having my own space i had lots of friends and loneliness didnt come into it but youre lonely now because i met rory she said softly when he and i were together there wasnt loneliness how could there be sure there were nights when we were forced to be apart but our phone bills were enormous and wed go to sleep talking to each other thinking of each other as you and i shut up and let me finish she told him and her voice was almost kindly because its important rory died and i learned what loneliness is its the awful awful emptiness when people leave susie it gets filled she said almost conversationally now im alone ive gone back a little to how i was i depend on me for my company its taken two years but ive learned to cope but you know kirsty comes to dinner and then she leaves and the loneliness closes over me again i fell for angus and it was good but when he died it was bleakness all over again emptiness you know there are lots of single people who dont like people staying overnight because the house seems so empty when theyre gone loneliness happens again and again and what youre offering hamish every time you walked out the door id be alone id have to work he said startled but she shook her head as if she was sad about his incomprehension yes but when you went to work i wouldnt come with you what the in your heart susie whispered as he stared at her in confusion she smiled hamish you dont understand and maybe if i hadnt had it with rory then i wouldnt understand either but hamish ive fallen in love with you shed fallen in love he reached for her but she took a step back holding up her hands to ward him off no no no she said softly if you think that makes a difference of course it makes a difference ive fallen for you too susie have you she said youve spent your whole life defending yourself learning not to let anyone close and youre not about to stop now youre going to spend our entire married life waiting for me to manipulate you if i was fool enough to marry you which im not i know you wont manipulate me no you dont you dont know anything about me i know youre the most courageous person ive ever met thats pity she said flatly not love if i died tomorrow would you cry i dont cry he said before he could stop himself and she stilled there was a long long pause no she said at last you dont cry susie im not emotional well there you go then she said softly maybe were a match after all because neither am i are you kidding you see thats the problem she whispered what you see is on the outside youre thinking you might marry the outside but insideyou dont have a clue you just dont have a clue and now if youll excuse me im going to bed she made to push past him but he stepped across the doorway susie please think about it itd be sensible itd be committing me to loneliness for the rest of my life she whispered even i think i deserve better than that chapter eleven was she mad susie lay and watched the shadows this was her last night in this castle the man she loved had asked her to marry him a courageous woman would take him on and train him she thought desperately into the stillness marry him and ask questions later have a tantrum or six when he spent fourteenhour days at the office seven days a week and treated her as being on the outskirts of his life which was what would happen she was under no illusions as to how hamish saw marriage hed had some sort of epiphany this week she thought hed seen marcia out of her business zone and seen how sterile the life they proposed was so hed gone for the easy solution the noble one ditch the businesslike fiancée and pick up a ditzy one with a gammy leg and attached child give his life a bit of interest and do good along the way problem solved she rose and crossed to the window staring out at the moonlit sky an owl swooped across the night sky and she thought of taffy taffy shed had her for what a whole day and shed gone and susie felt sick this is it she whispered into the dark she wanted rose here so she could hug her so she could tell her baby she was doing the right thing i cant expand my heart any more the heart expands to fit all comers maybe but how often can it break and stay intact she wanted to cry but the tears wouldnt come nothing would come she should sort a few more things she should dammit if its not packed now i dont want it she told the moon fiercely watching the flight of the owl over the waters edge ive got no more room i have no more room for anything marcia i cant marry you it was two in the morning hamish had been sitting at the kitchen table waiting for marcia to come back which had taken quite some time now shed burst in the back door still laughing and had stopped dead when shed seen hamish waiting he should have broken it gently he thought as her laughter stopped hed been sitting here for hours trying to make it right in his head nothing made sense any more but the only absolute that stood out was what hed just said he couldnt marry marcia in the end the words had just come what what have they told you marcia demanded and he blinked pardon hell this place how did they know he blinked againand then he focussed she looked rumpled he thought there was sand in her hair a strand of dried seaweed was intertwined with the normally impeccable french knot the knot was coming undone she put a hand up to adjust it a pin came loose and it tumbled free what was going on youve been on the sand dunes he ventured cautiously and she swore and shook her hair looser causing a shower of sand to fall to the floor god whod live in a small town people have been staring at me since i hit the town boundaries i might have known she glared across the table at him defiant what do you mean you cant marry me youre not getting prudish on me are you prudish i was bored ok theres nothing to do in this godforsaken place and you were stuck with the widow so he was putting two and two together and making six but maybe six was right you andlachlanheaded for the sand dunes of course lachlan who else do you think hell hamish someone had to be nice to him you hardly made the effort but she had coloured his efficient cool fiancée was seriously flustered you were nice to himas in heading for the sand dunes it was just a bit of fun this is the modern world you know i think im oldfashioned well dont be hell hamish we lead separate lives thats the basis of our whole relationship what relationship we fit she snapped you know we do together we can be a serious team but not if youre going to get jealous every time i let my hair down i would have thoughtmaybe youd want to let your hair down with me oh come on hamish thats not what our relationships about were a serious team does it matter if we get our fun elsewhere and it was as easy as this he was being let off a hook he hadnt known he was on until tonight and suddenly he didnt even recognise what it was that had snagged him she didnt love him he didnt love her where on earth had they been headed im in love with susie he told her and she paused in shaking her hair to stare at him in incredulity you have to be kidding i dont think i am what on earth do you have in common i guessnothing are you in love with lachlan of course im not i dont do love including with me were a sensible partnership she snapped you know that weve talked about it you let emotion into your life and its down the toilet if you were on with the widow im not on with anyone but you want to be with her disbelief was warring with incredulity that he could be so stupid there was only one answer to that yes shell never be a businessmans wife maybe ill be a landscape gardeners husband he retorted and she gave a crack of scornful laughter this is ridiculous youre being ridiculous yes she paused regrouped lets talk about this we dont need to break up i want that title she said abruptly as if it was suddenly the most important factor in the whole deal i think you can buy titles over the internet if you pay enough he said cautiously ill see what i can do it can be a breakingoffengagement present youre not serious im serious ive come all this way for nothing it was practically a yell she was no longer flustered she was out and out furious im sorry not half as sorry as youre going to be she snarled you really think i wouldnt mind a marriage where my wife trots off into the sand dunes with other men this has nothing to do with anything i might have done with lachlan she flashed back has it no he admitted it hasnt but ive decided marcia maybe emotion is important in a marriage maybe we could both do with some there was a long pause strained to breaking point right she said at last you want emotion lets see how you deal with emotion you stupid twotiming wannabe country hick sitting in the middle of the table was a vast earthenware casserole containing the congealing leftovers marcia removed the lid she lifted the potand she threw the entire contents at her fiancés head with pot attached tuna surprise susie heard marcia come in she heard their soft murmurs in the kitchen then the voices were raised then came a crash of splintering crockery should she get up and investigate mind your own business she told herself and shoved her pillow over her head so she couldnt try to eavesdrop she didnt want to know she didnt breaking off his engagement had been as easy as that hamish lay in bed and stared at the ceiling and wondered where to take it from here his cell phone rang it was three in the morning was there an emergency back in the office douglas he said crisply into the phone trying to sound efficient and there was a sigh down the line that he recognised youre not supposed to be working jodie you remember me his exsecretary sounded pleased nick said you mightnt answer the phone if you recognised my number are you still in australia yes he said cautiously jodie its three in the morning since when did you need sleep ive just seen your photograph my photograph he said blankly oh hamish its lovely arent you supposed to call me mr douglas he demanded and her sigh this time was totally exasperated im not your secretary any more im calling as a friend why to tell you i think she looks gorgeous to say the baby looks really cute and the dogs amazing and ive never seen you look so happy i opened the magazine and got such a shock that i almost dropped my coffee what magazine she told him and he gaped into the stillness how youre on the beach she told him the babys asleep at your feet whats the dogs name boris he said before he could stop himself his mind was racing a photograph on the beach albert and honey it had to be albert and honeys photograph this was susies doing shed told them his real name theyd have done some research and now the photograph would be splashed across america did he mind is she nice jodie was asking umyes one of the girls from the office told me marcia was following you marcias here jodie what business is it of you see the thing is that im pregnant jodie said ignoring his interruption i thought i was last week and now im sure nick and i are so happy but im so happy that i want everyone else to be so im worrying about you you dont need to worry about me i wont if you end up with the lady on the beach she wont have me hamish said before he could stop himself and there was a breathless pause youve fallen in love jodie said at last oh hamish she wont have me it was almost a statement of despair he was in territory here he didnt recognise you havent asked her to live in your grey penthouse jodie said anxiously she doesnt look the sort whod live in a penthouse hell jodie its where i live its where i work ive taken a job as parttime secretary in the church that nicks restoring jodie said as if she hadnt heard him the pays lousy not a lot of prestige there im happy as a pig in mud im pleased for you but dont stuff it hamish mr douglas he roared before he could stop himself and there was a cautious silenceand then a giggle youve got it bad she said on a note of discovery oh im so pleased i phoned nick said i was butting in where i wasnt wanted but i so wanted to know and now i do ill ring you back in a few days and find out the next installment dont stuff it and dont shove your penthouse down her throat where was sleep after that nowhere the castle was almost eerie in its stillness at five hamish rose and went out into the bushland behind the garden he walked the trails in the moonlight calling over and over again taffy if he could find her he wasnt sure what that might mean he only knew that susie was holding herself under rigid control and he needed to break through it somehow if he could find taffy he could offer to buy a house on the coast commuter distance from work he could see susie there but the loneliness thing was an issue shed need a dog he could buy her a dog but taffy would be better taffy was dead but there was a tiny part of him that was refusing to accept the pups death it was the logical conclusion and hed spent his entire life trying to be logical but hed just let this tiny chink of inconsistency prevail just for now taffy he didnt find her of course he didnt find her logic was the way to approach the world logic was always right emotionwell it had no place in his life did it there was a bruise on the side of his head that said emotion was happening whether he encouraged it or not somehow he had to persuade susie anyway but by the time he conceded defeat and returned to the castle he knew he was too late the castle was alive with people half dolphin bay seemed to be there kirsty was presiding over the kitchen issuing orders a mountain of luggage was piled in the hallway susie was behind a mug of coffee with half a dozen women sitting around her she looked up as hamish entered their eyes metand he saw a tiny flicker of hope die behind her eyes you didnt find her she knew what hed been doing she wasnt being logical either she was still hoping someone had to see things as they were no he spread his hands helpless susie hamish can you help jake load gear into the car kirsty asked sounding as if she was annoyed with him and he met her gaze and knew he was right she was seriously displeased its like a huge jigsaw puzzle how were going to fit everything in i dont know sure and what happened to mrs jacobsens casserole kirsty asked i took a dislike to it tell mrs jacobsen ill buy her ten more susie can i talk to you but susie was no longer looking at him im leaving in half an hour and i have all my friends to say goodbye to she whispered hamish we said everything we needed to say last night theres nowhere else to go susie youre way over the limit for cabin baggage it was jake appearing at the door and looking exasperated rose cant need all these toys ones hippo ones evangeline and ones ted theyre all too precious to be entrusted to the cargo hold youll have to repack jake said trying to sound stern evangeline weighs two kilos two kilos for a toy giraffe its either evangeline or the nappies susie closed her eyes defeated by choice blank she should be crying hamish thought feeling desperate she should be sobbing but her face was closed and shuttered dead please susie he started and her eyes flew open again leave me be she snapped anger breaking through the misery hamish douglas butt out of what doesnt concern you if thered been another casserole to hand he could have been hit twice over and maybe he would have welcomed it he butted out marcia was packing as well he went out to the courtyard and found her loading her gear into the back of lachlans bmw as fast as that he asked and she gave him a vicious glare lachlan looking nervous stayed back you dont want me here ill be back to you about financial details financial details this has cost me she muttered throwing a holdall into the trunk with vicious intensity ive wasted three years of my life organising our future and you mess it up with one stupid widow if you think youll get out of that without a lawsuit you have another think coming you did go to the sand dunes he said mildly he looked across at lachlan who decided to comb his hair in the cars rearview mirror i hate you marcia told him you dont do emotion i so do she rallied then whirling to face him head on and her eyes were bright with unshed tears tears of fury frustration and bitterness you see she snarled her voice almost breaking i do do emotion its just that i dont want to it stuffs up your life you cant control people and i dont want it any more than i want you she flung herself into the passenger seat and slammed the door unfortunately the window was open and without the engine on she couldnt close it get in she snapped at lachlan lets get moving sure lachlan said and grinned at hamish thats quite a lady youre losing rich too hamish offered you think i dont already know that im sure you do he thought as he watched the bmw disappear from view two unemotional people no there were emotions there all right maybe they were in the wrong place but they were still there as were his he just had to figure out where to put them he still hadnt figured it out thirty minutes later as he watched susie climb into jakes car still with no tears still with that dreadful wooden face he was starting to knowand to fear goodbye hamish she said but she didnt kiss him goodbye her body language said it all he had no choice he stood back and let her go the castle emptied just like that one minute thered been a crowd waving susie off a confusion of packing and tears and hugs and waving handkerchiefs as the car disappeared down the road then nothing the inhabitants of dolphin bay simply turned and left went back to their village went back to their lives which didnt include him hamish went back into the kitchen expecting a mess but the dolphin bay ladies had been there en masse and everything was ordered pristine there was a note on the table from kirsty susies organised professional cleaners to go through the place tomorrow leave a list of what you want kept theyll dispose of the rest mrs jacobsen says one casserole dish will be fine thank you but it had better be a good one great he walked back out to the hall where ernst and eric were looking morose guard duty with nothing to guard theyd look dumb back in manhattan he thought could he write a clause into the hotel sale saying the new owners had to keep these two ridiculous the word hung why had susie thought his proposal ridiculous it had been a very good offer he thought hed told her he loved her hed look after her keep her safe make sure she wanted for nothing ernst and eric gazed at him morosely ridiculous the whole things ridiculous he snapped not me what does she want me to do whatever it was he couldnt do it he couldnt his phone buzzed and he looked at the screen jodie another lecture he flicked it off out of communication that meant the office couldnt communicate either good he needed to not communicate you are sure youre doing the right thing of course i am they were outside the vast metal gates at the airportgates you could only go through as you passed passport control the days of waving planes off were long gone now the gates slammed on you two or three hours before the plane left and that was that susie and kirsty were in a huddle jake was standing back holding rose giving his wife and her sister space to say goodbye but youre in love with hamish he doesnt have a clue what love is leave it kirsty its over you will come back when our babys due i promise oh susie i dont see how i can bear it if i can bear it you can susie said resolutely shed expected to be a sobbing mess by now but the tears were nowhere she didnt feel like tears she felt dead i can bear it she told her sister youve been the best sister in the world but were separate twins but separate you have your life and i have mine yes thought kirsty as she stood and watched the gates slide shut irrevocably cutting susie off from return i have my life my husband my kids my dog my life oh susie i wish you had the same what the hell was a man to do hamish paced the castle in indecision he went back into anguss room and looked at the papers scattered over the floor yes they needed to be gone through there were all sorts of important deeds that couldnt be left they represented a couple days work hed stay for two more days and then hed leave he rang the airline and booked his return flight for two days hence right that was the start of organisational mode now sort the papers it didnt happen his head wasnt in the right space the papers blurred he went back out into the garden and saw his halffinished path hes work on that two spadefuls and he decided his hands were just a wee bit sore to be digging hed go to the beach hed swim alone he had to do something he went to the beach the water was cool clear and welcoming before every time hed dived under the surface of the waves hed felt an almost outofbody experience it had been as if hed simply turned off a switch had been flicked here he could forget about everything but the feel of the cool water on his skin the power of his body the sun glinting on his face as he surfaced to breathe today it didnt work he couldnt find a rhythm he felt breathless almost claustrophobic as if this place was somehow threatening susie had almost lost her life here he remembered and he hadnt been here to help her she wouldnt have let him near even if he had been here hell he looked back to shore a seaeagle was cruising lazily over the headland as he watched it stilled did a long slow loop focussing on something below and glided across the rocks just by him there was something therea dead fish maybebut hamishs presence distracted the bird for a moment he thought the bird would plunge down and suddenly he splashed out and yelled at it the bird focussed on him and started circling again slowly still watching whatever it was on the rocks itd be a dead fish hamish told himself nothing but a dead fish he struck out for the rocks surfacing at every stroke to make sure the bird wasnt coming down twelve fourteen strokes and he reached the first of the rocks they were sharp and unwelcoming hed cut his feet trying to get across them itd be a dead fish but the thought wouldnt go away he looked skyward and the bird was focussed just in front of him two or three yards across the rocks he hauled himself out of the water ouch ouch ouch ouch a dead fish it wasnt a dead fish it was taffy curled into a limp and sodden ball half in and half out of a rock pool he thought she was dead for a long moment he stared down at the sodden mat of fur at the tail splayed out in the water half floating at the little head just out of the water and then she moved just a little as if she was finding the strength to drag herself out of the water an inch at a time the rocks were forgotten his feet were forgotten he was kneeling over her lifting her out of the water unable to believe shed still be alive taffy he whispered and her eyes opened a little and unbelievably the disreputable tail gave the tiniest hint of a wag taf he held her close cradling her in his arms taking in the enormity of what had happened what had happened he looked up and the eagle was still circling there was another bird now swooping past as if the two birds were disputing about who was to get lunch two birds he looked down at taffy and saw lacerations in her side deep slices something had picked her up and carried her out over the sea and then maybe got into an argument with another bird and the prey had been dropped if shed been dropped into the white water around the rocks then maybe the birds had lost her maybe shed have been left struggling in the water to finally drag herself up here only to expose herself again to the birds of prey whod dumped her here in the first place hamish was crying hell he was crouched on the rock and blubbing like a baby taffy well get you warm he told the pup well get you to a vet but to walk over the rocks in bare feet was impossible he was two hundred yards from the beach hed have to swim he backed into the water dropped down into the depths and felt taffys alarm as she was immersed again he was on his back cradling the pup against his chest hed get back to the beach using a form of backstrokebackstroke with no arms but if the pup struggled trust me taf she said softly and it seemed she did the little body went limp dont you dare die on me hamish told her i have such plans for us my god how can i have been so stupid the doors closed behind her it was over susie walked past the dutyfree shops and the huddles of excited travellers and she didnt see them her mind was blank im not going to let myself get depressed again she told rosie hugging her almost fiercely ive been down that road and never again if id let hamish have his wayno ive fought too hard for independence to risk it all over again that was the crux of the matter maybe she could change him maybe she could teach him what it was to really love oh but if i failed she told rose i have you to think about now sweetheart and im just not brave enough to risk everything again the vet was stunned and beaming two deep lacerations on the right side but only scratches on the otherthe bird couldnt have got a decent grip but theres nothing vital damaged well run an iv line for twentyfour hours just to be on the safe side but youve got her warmed and dry i see no reason why she shouldnt live to a ripe old age hamish stood and stared at the little dog on the table and felt his knees go weak hed run up the cliff wanting help wanting to shout to the world that hed found her the castle had been empty hed opened the oven door lined the warm interior with towels and laid the pup in there while hed pulled on some clothes then hed offered her a little warm milk and had been stunned when taffy had hauled herself onto shaky legs shrugged off her towels and scoffed the lot then hed thought that maybe hed done the wrong thing in giving her milkmaybe shed go into shock or somethingso hed bundled her off to the vet to be given the good news shes as strong as a little horse mandy the vet was saying susie will be so pleased i can go about sorting out the quarantine requirements again taffy would leave hamish thought blankly of course taffy was susies dog she didnt feel like susies dog she felt like family can i take her home he asked back to the castle can you keep her still so the iv line stays in place sure he carried her out into the morning sunshine and shook his head trying to figure where he was things had shifted important things what plane was susie on he started doing arithmetic in his head the new rules for international flights meant you had to be there three hours ahead of departure kirsty and jakes car had been overloaded and theyd left leeway expecting delays if he left now taffy was in a box in his hands the iv line hooked to a bag slung over his shoulder hed have to rig it up carefully in the car to get her back to the castle he didnt want to go back to the castle hed have to find someone to care for taffy he didnt want someone else to care for taffy at leastnot completely you havent found the puppy it was harriet dolphin bays postmistress emerging from the post office and carefully adjusting a sign on the door to read back in five minutes oh my lord im not my lord he said absently im hamish youre my lord to me she said resolute ever since i saw you in that kilt she peered into the box and her mouth dropped open in shock youve found her she whispered oh my lord where was she an eagle had her he said but he was moving forward harriet see that sign the sign she turned back to where shed written back in five minutes yes can you make it five hours she looked at him as if he was crazy of course i cant yes you can he said encouragingly im your liege lord you just said it my wish is your command harriet i command you to change the sign hop into the front of the car and cuddle taffy why your liege lord needs his fair lady flight to los angeles is delayed by sixty minutes we wish to apologise for fine susie said to rose and glowered at the screen lets go buy some dutyfree perfume youd like that wouldnt you sweetheart no said rose what do you mean she cant come in sorry mate dogs are forbidden in airport premises hamish had parked the car in the multistorey car park and they were now at the airport doors hamish was carrying taffys box and harriet was carrying the iv line you cant go any further the man said and harriet sniffed knowing what was coming harriet youre going to ask me to sit in the car with taffy she said darkly just when it gets interesting harriet dont mind me she sighed her bosom heaving with virtuous indignation im just the peasantry then she grinned go on with you she told him but im not staying in the car ill just sit on the doorstep here and watch the comings and goings taffy and me will like that you cant stay here the security officer told her and she puffed up like an indignant rooster ready to crow theres a sign saying i cant come in with dog she said but theres no sign saying i cant look in with dog thats just what im doing and she sat on the rack holding the luggage carts in place she slung the iv bag over her shoulder she took taffys box into her arms and she smiled what are you waiting for she demanded go fetch who you need to fetch her flight had been delayed oh thank god there was sixty minutes grace but even then it wasnt easy there was the little matter of the metal doors at passport control you cant come through he was told not unless youre a traveller im a traveller he hauled his passport from his wallet and displayed it im from the us you need to be booked on a plane today you need seat allocation before you can get through they were adamant we can get a message to whoever you want to see he was told but if they come out theyll have to go through security again no one will be happy maybe she wouldnt come out he thought maybe a message wouldnt work he took his wallet over to american airlines i have a ticket two days from now he told them any chance of swapping it for today the flights fully booked he was told the girl behind the counter eyed him dubiously and he thought that even if he had been booked there might be trouble hed dragged on jeans a windcheater and trainers but he hadnt shaved that morning and hed come straight from the beach and he knew he looked desperate hell the gates stayed shut shed be through there sitting miserable maybe crying he stared at the screen there was susies flight leaving in fortyfive minutes any minute now theyd start boarding the flight straight after that was to new zealand susies flight was from gate the new zealand flight was from gate act cool he told himself trying frantically to be sensible if you launch yourself at the counter and act desperate theyll drag you off as a security risk so he sped into the washroom washed his face bought a comb and a razor from the dispenser and spent precious minutes transforming himself from a beach bum with hair full of sand to someone who might board an international flight with business in mind casual but cool he stared at himself in the mirror what was missing ha five more precious minutes were spent buying a briefcase and a couple of books to bulk it up then a walk briskly to the air new zealand counter feeling sick with tension and with the effort not to show it any chance of getting onto the flight this afternoon i only have hand luggage im booked for a us flight in two days but ive finished what i need to do here and could usefully see some of my people in auckland his authoritative tone worked the girl looked him up and downand smiled do you have a visa he did the work he did required travel at a moments notice and he always had documentation theres only economy available she said and he almost grinned what value a comb thank you which way was new zealand why would she want to buy perfume lets have a look at dutyfree cigarettes you dont smoke she told herself i might if i get desperate enough are you all right madam an assistant asked and she blushed umyes just telling my daughter about the evils of smoking hell why was security taking so long the line stretched forever passengers for air new zealand please come through the priority line thank god for that but when he was through theyre boarding already if youd like to board the cart well get you straight to the boarding gate fine but he was jumping off early she wasnt in the departure lounge where was she this is the final boarding call for flight to auckland where was she pardon me sir your flight is ready for boarding you need to come this way not until i find who im looking for there was a commotion down near her boarding gate shouting beefy security men running then a couple of burly giants escorting someone back toward the entrance area susie glanced up from her rows of havana cigars hamish excuse me she said faintly stepping out into their path where are you taking him security one of the guards said brusquely step aside maam she was holding a box of havana cigars in one hand rose in the other she dropped the cigars with huge difficulty she managed to hold on to rose you cant take him away she said faintly hes mine chapter twelve so you see you need to come home they werent going anywhere right now the chief of airport security had raised his eyebrows shrugged and shown hamish susie and rose into his office closing the door on three troublemakers take her baggage off the plane he growled to his staff as he left them to it american airlines is already boarding shes officially missed the plane and if she objects ill have them booked for nuisance or something but there was no way shed object the security head was smiling as he closed the office door behind themand he just happened to nudge a wastepaper bin full of crumpled paper in roses direction he had kids himself and he knew what was needed here was a bit of distraction so the adults of the party could sort themselves out rose obliged she immediately started emptying the trash paper by paper perusing the security memos of the day with all seriousness then ripping them into tatters more thoroughly than any shredder hamish wasnt reading anything he was holding every part of susie he could reach but i still dont understand she whispered when she could finally find room to speak shed just been very thoroughly kissed she was snuggled against him and he smelt of the sea he tasted of the sea her hamish just because you found taffy i cried when i found taffy he told her it felt right and then the thought of sending taffy to you in america felt wrong so youre saying i want to marry you i want to marry you more than anything else in the world then he hesitated no that needs improvement i already asked you to marry me and you very rightly threw it back in my face but its different this time its more than just the love thing susie i want us to be a family more than anything else in the world which means reorganising he said bluntly not taking you back to my life not being part of your life making a new life for all of us where all the pieces fit in a new whole where all of us are a part of it just because of taffy she whispered awed just because of you he told her when i found taffy i thought how fantastic it was that id found her and then i thought that id found our dog but id lost the most important person in the world here i was crying about a pup when my life was gone and i suddenly realised why you criedand why you stopped crying you must love me you must please susie of course i love you she said and tried to smile how could i not love those knees a woman with taste she silenced him with a kiss and the kiss lasted deeply and satisfactorily through the shredding of at least ten more security memos it was a kiss where all questions were answered where there was no need for words it was a kiss where two people found their home the first time i asked you to marry me i was dumb hamish whispered at last when he could finally find the space to get the words out she was cradled on his knees and he was holding her as if hed never let her go but susie i swear this is different i know its different she said scornfully you think im dumb id never think youre dumb you dont mind that ive been married before he answered that with another kiss you dont mind that i almost married marcia no but this is different too she said trying to be serious marcia and youyou werent really engaged but i did love rory i never thought i could love again but his love this loveits just this is a love for who you are now he said hugging her tight while the world steadied on its axis are you worried that ill be jealous of rory that ill make you put away his photographs hell susie rorys part of my family and i need all the family i can get no but rory is part of who you are he told her refusing to be interrupted he loved you and he cared for you and how can i ever be anything but grateful that he found you out in the wide world and brought you into the douglas clan as angus brought deirdre she whispered and all of ussomehow were all together she wriggled on his knee feeling suddenly like bouncing the shock was wearing off and what was left was a searing blast of joy so great it almost overwhelmed her oh hamish do you think well live happily ever after with ernst and eric they expect nothing less in our castle sure in our castle with our pumpkins as in all good fairytales her thinking was extending past the confines of the man she loved to the world outside wheres taffy now out in the trolley racks where with harriet come and see and when they finally found taffy she wasnt alone the trolley racks were loaded kirsty and jake had shown the girls round the airport and had finally emerged to find the postmistressand dogin residence so theyd settled down to wait toohoping that hamish hadnt talked himself onto susies flightand when susie and hamish and rose emerged from the airport it seemed half dolphin bay was waiting for them so youve come back to us jake said but he wasnt talking to the woman hed said farewell to a couple of hours ago he was talking to hamish gripping him on the shoulder as a man gripped a friend he hadnt seen for years i guess i have hamish said thinking of the impossibility of futures broking from dolphin bay and then shrugging and thinking that impossibilities were made to be overcome i guess i have email from hamish douglas to jodie carmody subject suggestion dear jodie susie and i are delighted to hear you and nick will be at our wedding next month here in dolphin bay with your pregnancy and your job as church secretary we thought youd be deeply embedded in your choir stalls but your letter saying the stalls are finished and you and nick are after adventure before the arrival of your little one set
