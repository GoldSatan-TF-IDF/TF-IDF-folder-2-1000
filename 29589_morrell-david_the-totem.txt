david morrell the totem introduction one of the first things i learned as a writer was when in doubt dont throw any pages away that rule has frequently been of help especially when due to overfamiliarity with a manuscript in progress i edited a book too stringently taking out scenes that shouldnt have been omitted needing to go back and reinsert them grateful that id saved the original versions my filing cabinets became crammed with material that i eliminated from various works even after those works were published i continued to save the files as a consequence this is what you might call a found book in the british publisher headline decided to reissue my only to date outandout horror novel the totem it had first been released in hardback by the american publisher m evans in and had subsequently been reprinted by fawcett in paperback one year later the hardback was eventually discontinued by the end of the eighties so was the paperback my memory of the story dimmed thus when headline suggested that it might be interesting for me to write an introduction to its new edition i decided that id better reacquaint myself with the text so id be accurate about what i was introducing but when i pulled the totem off the shelf and studied it i discovered to my dismay that the book i remembered was not the book that had been published so much was different so much was missing where was this scene and where was that i asked myself with increasing shock abruptly a barrier in my memory fractured i suddenly recalled that when id submitted the totem in the late seventies my editor had not been pleased its too big too sprawling hed said wheres the love interest how come it takes so long to introduce your main character why isnt this about the military as in first blood given the ultimatum that if the novel wasnt changed it wouldnt be accepted i reluctantly produced an alternate version of the totem half as long twice as fast with my main character appearing on the first page and yes with a love interest not that i feel uncomfortable about that version i think its effective and im gratified that it has acquired a reputation among horror fans critics have described it as one of the best horror novels of the seventies its been cited in horror best books and denver s rocky mountain news in placed it on that newspapers halloween list of scariest books but its not the book that i wanted published and after i reread the totem in preparation for writing the headline introduction i couldnt resist the impulse to search through my files and with delight i discovered the original version that the turmoil of my negotiations with the books publisher had forced me to forget the manuscript was dusty dogeared and yellowed written on a typewriter not a word processor i felt as if id opened one of those metal boxes that are sometimes placed in the cornerstones of buildings so that historians from a later age can open them and study the oncecontemporary objects sealed within them i cant emphasize sufficiently how much id repressed my memory of the first version of the totem its no exaggeration to say that i truly couldnt remember having written it as i said a found book a time capsule from and about the sixties and the seventies and having found it i couldnt help smiling there were the scenes that id subconsciously been missing there were the length and scope and texture that id wanted an expansive alternate style a new beginning a quite different ending and as for the middle well lets put it this way the story is twice as long and twothirds dissimilar there isnt just more plotthe extra material gives the plot a different twist so what youre about to read is the intended version of this novel if youre familiar with the totem in its previously published form youre about to enter its alternate universe i think youll find some pleasantly scary surprises david morrell santa fe for geoffrey household the thriller writer beyond compare totem noun amoung primitive peoples an animal or natural object considered as being related by blood to a given family or clan and taken as its symbol an image of this the power of the moon on animals and people is well known passing over the parallel between a womans monthly cycle and the phases of the moon we note the predominance of industrial accidents when the moon is at its fullest the tendency of dogs and other canine animals to bay at it of lunatics to do the same perpetuating ancient myth we link the moon with love and with fertility we speak of harvest moon we speak of someones being moonstruck the very motion of the earth its tides and shifting subzones are related to the moon we even set aside one day in worship of it monday what in ancient times was moon day jacob steiger the pathology of madness part one potters field one a solitary rider on a ridge that was the beginning hed been out for half a day now checking the borders of his ranch and coming from the high ground he stopped to look down past the pine trees toward the sweeping grassland it was something that he never failed to marvel at sitting up here at the farthest reach of what he owned staring down at all that rich wide ground the abundant grass the dots of sagebrush he remembered how his father had used to take him here and point to it and tell him how his fathers father had to fight for it and how the land would one day soon be his he hadnt known that his father was then dying he wasnt sure that his father even knew but six months later he had seen his father burieddeath had been both quick and painfuland then all the land was his that had happened twenty years ago now at thirtyeight he still came out here on the anniversary of when his father had died and looked down at the valley from where his father once had pointed to it and was proud pride of ownership and something else of knowing who his father had been no not who but what the kindest gentlest and yet strongest man hed ever met still after all these years he loved the man and loved the land because of him he sat there his reins tight on his horse and stared out at the pasture stretching off as far as he could see and rubbed his weathered face and shook his head he knew that he should go the sun was fierce upon his back his head protected by his cowmans hat the horse would need some water soon he still had lots of range to check all the same he didnt want to leave he waited his boots pressed into the stirrups leather creaking admiring the land his father had shown to him and then the moment passed he loosened the reins nudging with his heels and he was leaving the ridge led to a gametrail that wound down through shade beneath the pine trees there was water at the bottom and he felt the horse increase its gait the cool smell evidently reaching it he held back on the reins working past a sharp turn in the trail then easing farther down the angle so steep now that he was forced to lean back in the shade his sweatsoaked shirt was cool against his sticky back he reached behind to tug at it then he was working past another sharp turn angling farther down and he could see the stream below him glinting in the sunlight his horses hoofs plodded on the fallen pine needles he looked and saw another carcass this one wedged between two trees another deer or possibly an antelope from this far away he couldnt tell he likely couldnt tell regardless the winter had been so severe the snow so deep the storms so frequent and intense that many animals who normally survived up in the mountains had come down here for food but the winter had been just as bad down here so they had wandered becoming thin and weak and cold until they dropped and maybe tried to stand up once or twice and dropped again and died sometimes scavengers would find them and when finished would leave only bits of bone and skin other times like this the carcass hadnt been discovered it had dried and shrunk till just the empty hulk remained the positions they assumed were on occasion fascinating like this one that was wedged between the two trees an outsider might think that it had tried to squeeze between the trees had gotten stuck and there had died but then of course the ground had not been visible in the winter the animal had walked upon a floor of iceimpacted snow the snow had been quite deep at least ten feet and likely more the two trees veered apart at that height the animal had lots of room it walked between and died and with the thaw it settled toward the ground and wedged he rode down near it passing it and he was right deer or antelope he couldnt tell it was the fifth such carcass he had seen today and he was sure that if he looked around more intently hed find several others he couldnt take the time it didnt matter anyhow he wasnt out here just to admire the land to commemorate an anniversary he was checking on his stock he heard the low of cattle off to his right now and he stopped beside the stream sunlight angling through the trees and glinting off it long enough to let the horse lean its head down and take a drink just enough to give it strength but not enough to make it sick then he was pulling on the reins and angling off emerging from the trees to the grassland turning right the low of cattle was much louder now he guessed that they were just below the coming rise he reached the top and saw them spread out across from him a gully between and he was riding toward the gully looking for an easy place to dip down up and then across to them at first he thought the carcass in the gully was another deer it had the same tawny color but then he saw that it was one of his stock and frowning he was pulling up and getting off he looked around to tie the horse but couldnt find a place holding tightly to its reins as he walked slowly down among the open earth and rocks the steer was lying on an angle with the slope its back to him and he was thinking that it had fallen and snapped its neck but coming toward it he saw nothing strange about the neck and none of the legs looked broken and he was thinking afraid now of disease he shifted toward its head peering at its mouth but there wasnt any froth on its lips and he was thinking of a dozen diseases that could kill a steer and leave no trace when suddenly he came around and saw its midriff and was nearly sick he stumbled back and dropped the reins the horse began to bolt two the old man in the chair was tired hed been out and making rounds all day from just after dawn till well past suppertime checking on some newborn calves giving shots a dozen other things once even coming on a case of founder odd how people who had worked with horses all their lives could still forget the basic rules and get their stock in trouble he had needed just one look to know that the case was classic take a hot day and a tired hungry thirsty horse give it too much grain and water something happened to the horses blood the veins within the hoofs swelled the horse went lame hed helped to get the horse to stand in water that would cool the veins and possibly reduce the swelling but not much the horse would never be the same the swelling would leave scars and more would change the horses gait hed cut away part of the outside crusted nails had given purgatives to get the horses stomach and its bloodstream back to normal but he didnt have much confidence most cases like this ended with the horse dead on its own or else destroyed on rare occasions when the horse recovered it almost never worked well after that and ended as a family pet if the rancher had the tolerance livestock out here was a business after all and anything that didnt earn its way was hardly welcome the old man sat in the rocking chair and glanced out at the setting sun its stark red swollen disc was very close now to the mountains shortly it would touch and disappear behind them from the kitchen he heard cupboards being opened dishes rattled knives and forks selected supper had been heated and reheated hed been told his wife had been mad about it not because shed had to do more work god knows she never let that bother her but shed been mad that he had let himself go on so long a man his age should be retired at the very least he ought to cut back on his hours but at a time when he should take things easy he was working more than ever more than any other vet in town and she was angry claiming that his system couldnt take it im a doctor i know what im doing sure of animals not people whats the difference dont be smart she said a doctor doesnt treat himself youve got me there id best sit down and take it easy hed smiled then as he left her in the kitchen sitting glancing out the window hearing pot lids being lifted and replaced no point in telling her that she had not slowed down much either going out to see the sick the orphaned and the poor cooking for them mending clothes or making them there was a phrase they used to have for that what was it called the corporal works of mercy the truth was that he was more tired than she guessed short of breath and feeling dizzy there had been a time when he would come in after making rounds all day and smoke and make a drink and sip it eat and go out with her for a walk or maybe to a movie then hed read till one or two oclock now he couldnt stay awake the cigarettes and whisky were long gone the walk was too much the movie something on the tv while he slept it was more than feeling tired he was feeling sick his appetite was less each day his stomach faintly queasy he told himself it was the heat but he knew better it was something with his heart no pains yet in his chest or down his arm just a vague discomfort that would shortly be much worse all the same he didnt know what he could do it was in his nature to deny himself to make of weakness strength besides he didnt know how he would fill the time hed been a vet now forty years he couldnt just forget all that and sit around the house he joked about that to his wife you wouldnt want me under foot all day be grateful but the joke was very poor a man whose occupation was his life he didnt have much choice he had to work and one thing more the ranchers who depended on him he had worked with many of them all their lives all his own life he had seen their fortunes rise and fall or fall and rise their families grow their ranches go through all the good times and the bad he had measured out the seasons with them now they were a part of him the rhythm of his life he couldnt any more restrain himself from going out to work with them than he could stop the racing in his blood each april when the warm winds first began the long slow thawing of the snow maybe he was wrong maybe they didnt depend on him so much as he depended on them or maybe it was both together there were vets enough to go around that was sure but he was part of their lives too theyd had him with them through so many times that maybe they felt incomplete without his presence in their common rituals maybe it was hard to say hed never ask but ranchers had their superstitions they had patience only with what worked and what worked best was often very old like himself he thought but really he knew what the truth was he was getting older than he liked to think and he was damned if he would sit around and let death come to him what was the greatest disappointment in the world that of feeling useless if he didnt work he didnt see that he was justified still he guessed his wife was right he didnt have a reason to put in this kind of day maybe he would cut back work just mornings spend some time around the house his wife was aging too and maybe they should find out more about each other while they still had the opportunity he sat and thought his breath now coming easier glancing out the window while he listened to his wife reheating supper and the phone rang dont get up she told him and he understood this likely would be business most calls at this hour were and she was bound to see he wasnt bothered he sat waiting while it rang he heard her put a lid down on a pot then saw her walk across the entrance to the kitchen disappearing toward the phone that hung against the cupboard wall she got there halfway through another ring hello no im sorry hes not in right now ill take a message what how are you sam i didnt recognize your voice hows the no i dont know where he is well is it serious if youll tell me what it is ill have him call youre sure all right then sam ill have him call you first thing he comes in no i wont forget right sam yes i will right goodbye and that was that he heard her hang the phone up and then saw her walk across the doorway toward the stove he knew three sams but he didnt dare ask which it was if she wanted to shed tell him but he knew that if he asked her he would only make her mad so he waited he sat smelling supper as it cooked then she told him it was ready he went in and ate slowly as she wanted him pork chops string beans and potatoes boiled then stirred with butter and crushed parsley as he liked them then she had a pie for him apple with brown sugar and no upper crust again the way he liked it then there was some tea chinese black light and smooth and mellow and he waited he sat back and looked at her and tapped his fingers on the table and she told him that was sam bodine he nodded best get over there he had to laugh i thought you didnt want me to ive changed my mind what is it thats the point he wouldnt say the old man looked at her you should have heard his voice i think youd better go he looked at her a moment longer and then stood to get his bag three the old mans house was on the edge of town the side that faced the western mountains he got in the car and backed out of the driveway aiming toward the setting sun it was almost down behind the mountains now its topmost swollen rim was barely showing rocky mountains tall and jagged capped with snow although june was oddly warm in august some would be rock bare but most would be snowcovered all year round that was one nice thing about this kind of country the difference in the weather in the valley it might be one hundred but five hours drive up there and you could dig snow caves and wear a jacket plus the sun did strange things with its color it might be white with heat from nine to five but after that as it came closer to the mountains dipping down behind them the sun changed first to red and then to orange bathing everything in alpenglow a rich warm golden tone that made the countryside seem magical it was like that now everything the same calm soothing color even trees were tinted by it the green of leaves now more like yellow the range grass all around reminding him of grain and honey the old man drove down the road past fence posts stretching off as far as he could see past ranch homes nestled in their hollows cattle feeding windmills turning in the evening breeze the supper had been very good he had eaten more than was his custom indeed he felt much better now his breath more easy his legs more steady that was why he drove the kind of car he did to help him with his legs the effort of a clutch had lately been too much for him and he had traded to an automatic which was bad for hills and snow but he was forced to pace himself in little ways he had to compensate he sat back in the seat his foot relaxed on the pedal his hand light on the steering wheel and glanced at all the country as he passed the isolated trees the sweep of rangeland stretching off the fences and the cattle and he thought of sam bodine no of bodines father at one time the old man had been just about his closest friend although they hadnt been old back then thirty forty years ago hunting fishing working no not just about his closest friend his only friend they had been like brothers he had loved the man and still he missed him dearly after twenty years he marveled at how constant was his grief he had seen the son grow to a man and seen him marry and have children he had helped him every bit as much as he was able but the son was not the father he had different interests and concerns and things were never quite the same now he drove out toward the ranch as he had done so many times before he passed the tree that he had seen grow from a seedling to a giant and then start to crumble he passed the ditches he had helped to dig the fences he had helped to set he came around the curve that led down toward the entrance slowing turning left to rattle across the grate that lay over a gully and that kept the cattle off the highway its metal gaps so wide that cattle couldnt walk across them next he was on gravel gaining speed again spinning up a swirl of dust behind him as he drove on toward the house and barn their structures now in dusk the alpenglow abruptly gone the sun behind the mountains then he saw him standing by the gravel parking space beside the house big and tall dressed in denim shirt and jeans cowmans hat and boots hands gripped on his thighs his face was strong and solid leathered at the same time almost chiseled he was walking forward even as the old man pulled in on the gravel thanks for coming the old man nodded whats the trouble i dont want to say id rather have you look the old man glanced at him a moment and then got out with his bag in all his years hed never heard a rancher talk that way they almost always had a thought of what the problem was and told him right away whatever was the matter out here surely wasnt ordinary bodine was already walking how you feeling pretty good the old man said were going to be a while bodine said that with his head turned as he walked angling toward the big garage it isnt in the barn bodine shook his head and pointed out there on the edge of the foothills my boys there watching now wed best take the truck and that was that bodine was already climbing into the truck to start the engine the old man climbed in the other side and set his bag between his legs but whats the mystery i dont want to say a thing like this if i tell you youll get preconceptions have a look then you tell me and they were driving out the open doorway turning west beside the barn and heading off across the range four they headed toward the spot of light the darkness was all around them now the trucks lights on and they were jouncing across the open bumpy ground the old man with his hands braced on the dashboard bodine glanced at him and then ahead the spot of light was flickering a fire and bodine had to smile he hadnt thought to tell his boy to build one but then he had talked to him when it was day and clearly they would need a thing to aim for bodine saw a patch of smooth ground up ahead and gathered speed but then he hit a bump he hadnt seen that jounced the old man very hard and had to slow the headlights showed the rangeland stretching off beneath them up ahead a rabbit was paralyzed by them bodine veered to miss it then he picked up speed again the light was now distinctly flames growing as he neared he saw his boy stand up and walk in front of the fire his body silhouetted by it he saw the motorcycle parked beside the fire the fire was very close before him as he pulled up and he stopped he kept the lights on then stepped down onto the ground the old man was already out the boy walked toward them anything bodine asked the boy just shook his head no animals no tearing at the carcass its been pretty quiet well thats something anyhow you stayed up here the way i told you you didnt go down messing any tracks the boy just shook his head again okay then doc its down there in the gully careful of the slope the old man walked across the glare of the headlights standing at the edge of the gully i cant see much without more light bodine reached beneath the seat to get a highpowered flashlight he held it long and heavy walking toward the old man as he flicked the switch the light shot out across the range he dipped it toward the gully sweeping back and forth until he found the carcass there its back was toward them just the way it had been when bodine had come upon it as much as he could tell it looked the same the old man started down and bodine stopped him i dont know i think the way to do this is to walk up here a ways then cut across and come down looking on the other side i want to keep from messing any tracks the old man hesitated looked at him and nodded they went where the gully was more narrow climbing down the old man needing help to get up on the other side the ground was hard and rocky the old mans breath was forced as he got up and straightened you all right its nothing im not used to this you sure i said ill be all right okay then and they waited then the old man had his breath back and they walked along the top until they stood across from where the headlights and the fire were bodine aimed the flashlight into the ditch the old man didnt speak he didnt speak for quite a while all right now tell me what the hell it was that did that bodine said i dont know the old man cleared his throat right now i couldnt say it wasnt that the sight was shocking hed seen worse too many times but the thing just didnt make much sense whatever had disemboweled this steer had done so from below and ravaged at the guts but nothing seemed to have been eaten the guts were mashed together chewed and mangled but the point was they were here whatever did this hadnt eaten at the flesh had only chewed at organs and then left them he had never seen thishe had never heard about a thing like this before the old man saw the flies that crawled upon the guts smelled the stench that was coming from the gully shook his head and turned away i just dont get it youre the expert bodine said take a guess well process of elimination what would prey upon a steer i already thought of that bobcats but they dont come down here wolves the same coyotes maybe i even thought it was a cougar they dont single out the guts though not when theyve got flesh to eat and one thing more it doesnt look like anythings been eaten the old man said what about those tracks you mentioned were they any help i never found them if they were around i didnt want them messed before somebody good came out to have a look the old man turned again toward the gully and he pointed well i dont know if id mess the tracks but i should go down and have a look youre the expert so the old man slowly worked his way down into the gully bodine close behind but there was nothing he could tell the only thing i notice is the blood or lack of it thats what i mean a thing like this there should be lots of blood the old man thought a moment could be something spooked whatever did this and it didnt get a chance to eat it just licked all the blood could be i dont know the old man looked around well i cant tell out here id like to get this into town where i can have it on a table and dissect it if theres a way for us to move it what about your herd theres nothing strange about it you were out two weeks ago you said that it was fine well something might have happened in the meantime what im getting at is if this steer was sick whatever tried to eat it might have felt the taste was off and left it maybe but i hardly think its likely bodine said i dont think so either what about the truck can we get this in there the old man asked thats no problem well rig a line so they climbed up from the ditch the old man breathing hard and bodine got a rope and tied it around the head of the carcass and hitched the rope to the truck and used the truck to drag the steer up onto the level then he opened the back and pulled out a ramp and this time hitched the rope around the motorcycle his boy was working with the bike while bodine pulled and guided on the rope and slowly motorcycle revving hard the steer was dragged up onto the ramp and then pulled into the back they stood and frowned at the carcass well the guts stayed pretty much the same the old man said and bodine flashed the light around to see if any had been left behind the old man walked back toward the gully nothing down there either but the swath the steer made sure played hell on any tracks bodine turned and studied the old man theres one other thing id like to show you he walked toward the woods the flashlight in his hand its wide beam sweeping through the trees they came to where the stream flowed through the trees and found a narrow spot to step across and walked up onto the gametrail bodine led the way about a hundred yards then stopped to let the old man come up close to him he shone the flashlight in among the trees the carcass of a deer all right so whats the point the old man asked well i saw a lot of these when i came through here just before i saw the steer i figured what the hell the winter was a bad one then i didnt know i came back up and checked on this one bodine poked with a stick where he had pushed the carcass from between the trees there see where all the stomach skins been eaten otherwise it isnt touched but its been dead for several months hell anything could have caused that maybe insects even so the old man looked at bodine and wondered what he must be thinking five the old man drove while bodine followed in the truck the boy stayed back at home they raided across the grate and then turned right and headed toward town it was after midnight the car and truck the only traffic on the road all around the countryside was dark no lights on in ranches the stars clear a few clouds across the moon isolated trees were black against the murky gray of night the old man heard a coyote howling in the hills he was tired this was late for him and he was worn out from climbing into the ditch then walking through the woods he was feeling sick again as well the good meal he had eaten now gone bad on him and rising in his stomach he could taste the undigested pork what did he expect he knew he shouldnt eat so large a meal and one that was so heavy but then he had been hungrier than was common for him and besides his wife had gone to so much trouble that he couldnt very well refuse now he paid he squirmed in his seat wishing he would throw up and be done with it his foot was heavy on the pedal not because he wanted to get quickly into town but he was so tired now that he could hardly move his feet they were like a separate part of him he felt that they were swollen water filling up he thought hed have to take another pill for that he suffered glancing at the darkened country as the car sped down the road one curve then another and he almost missed the third better take things easy better get control he told himself and gripped the wheel more tightly tensing muscles in his leg to get life in his foot he glanced at bodines headlights in his rearview mirror he looked ahead and saw a car approach him its headlights growing larger as it neared he glanced away as it flashed past the headlights hurting his eyes and then the car was gone and he was staring at his own lights and the dark up ahead the carcass of a badger had been flattened on the road at least he thought it was a badger he had only one quick look before he was upon it and had passed he thought about it and then had to concentrate on going around another curve he shook his head to clear it and then squinted down the headlightflooded road twenty miles in terms of effort they felt more like eighty he was thinking he was getting closer thinking of his bed he blinked his eyes to clear them now staring down the road and then he saw the first light in a house another one closeby and he was at the outskirts coming around another bend and starting down the hill and there the town was spread out wide before him its streetlights sending up a glow that in the cool of night was like a yellow mist traffic lights and lights on in some houses lights on in the diner and the first bar that he passed and then the allnight service station after staying up so late climbing in that ditch walking through those woods after this long drive tired as he was the warmth of all these lights he felt that he was home the town was potters field socalled not because of any graveyard that was near it although there were a lot of those from the old days farmers passing through trappers ranchers sheepmen range wars and the miners at one time the hills around had all been rich with gold but that was ninety years ago and the gold had soon been gone there had been two towns back then one high in the hills that theyd called motherlode the other down here where the miners came from work to get supplies and drink and rest and often die like the farmers trappers ranchers and the sheepmen all passed on and laid to rest in graveyards that were like a page from history the town up there had long since gone to ruin but the one down here had grown and prospered twenty thousand people in it now and growing bigger better all the time there were rumors about oil ski resorts and breweries but the main trade here was cattle and a lot of people didnt want those other things the town was in a rich wide valley mountains all around it and the first man whod come through here back in was named potter he had been a farmer and hed liked the country so much that hed tried to work it but the soil was wrong for farming and at last hed given up staying on nonetheless hunting fishing living out his days here just because he liked the place his shack had been rebuilt several times since then set apart beside the courthouse with a plaque explaining who potter had been and telling all about his field the field was where hed tried to farm about the size of what was now the city limits the town was built exactly where hed lived it was the property hed still retained after all the farmers and the cattlemen had come through here and bought up any land hed sell them at first he didnt want to sell but potter had anticipated what was coming and he didnt see much point in holding out either he would sell or else theyd take it and so hed sold and seen the farmers leave the ranchers stay had seen the cattle business grow around him then he had a store and then a bar a hotel and a restaurant and soon the town was on its way still potter had tried a bit of farming marking off a plot of ground beside his shack which he refused to leave and where he died growing corn and lettuce and potatoes the ranchers thought him funny but he prospered and he still was going out to plant his corn the day he died that spring in so the field was both the city limits and that plot of ground he tended the latter set aside behind the shack a little park and flower garden potters field a place where you can grow so the sign said as the old man passed it heading down the hill and driving farther into town below him he could see the main street cutting through from right to left one long row of doublestory buildings feed stores hardware stores bars and shops and restaurants a movie theater the police station and the courthouse the last two were beside each other surrounded by great elms sent in from the east donated by a rancher indeed the other trees through town were all sent in from other places too maple ash and oak a dozen others the color of their leaves in autumn stark against the fir green of the mountains down the hill now farther into town he reached the stoplight where the two main roads intersected waiting until the red changed to green and angling right driving down two blocks and turning left to pull in at the wide twostory building made of cinder blocks and painted white that was his office not just his but everybodys every vet in town there were eight of them and they had long ago decided that instead of each one having a separate office it was better at least cheaper more efficient if they all combined to build a place that would be better equipped than each could ever manage alone in addition to the offices there were operating rooms a storehouse and a kennel it had been expensive but the ranchers out here paid to keep their livestock healthy and besides there hadnt been much choice to operate on bulls and stallions you just had to have the space headlights arcing the old man went down the driveway toward the back stopping by the double doors that led in to one operating room the parking lot was walled with concrete and he sat there cut his motor and his lights waiting in the dark flexing his hands and kneading his legs to get more life back into them he wondered how long it would be before he got to bed hed never felt so tired then he heard the motor saw the headlights flashing up the drive and stepped from the car as bodines truck pulled into view the old man lost his balance put his hands against the car then waited took his keys and opened the double doors he went inside and switched on all the lights the room was suddenly like day brighter like the starkest hottest day hed ever seen fierce overhead lights stabbing down at him he had to turn away barely glancing at the long wide metal table in the middle at the white walls and the cabinets and rows of medical supplies he sought out comfort in the darkness waiting for bodine to back the truck up to the entrance bodine came up almost into the room then shut off his lights and motor and stepped down onto the concrete parking lot the old man didnt move what is it something wrong bodine asked the old man shook his head youll have to help me bodine nodded walking past him toward the glare that spilled from the entrance to the room hed helped with this before heading toward the pulley that was on a bar up on the ceiling grabbing at the straps that hung down from it tugging at them so the pulley rolled along the bar up there and stopped above the back bin of the truck he climbed up into the back and hitched the straps around the midriff of the carcass just inside the legs it was heavy work even though the steer was not fullsized he still had lots of trouble heaving at its bulk so he could slip the straps beneath and slide them into position once the stench of all those open guts left out in the sun all day became too much for him and he was forced to turn away then he had the straps in place and he secured them pulling downward on the chain to work the pulley until the steer was slowly rising its hoofs dangling above the floor of the truck a hunk of guts dropped out and plopped near bodine he didnt even look at them just climbed down from the truck tugging at the straps to slide the carcass from the truck across the room and then above the table another hunk of guts dropped he grabbed the chain and yanked down on it in the opposite direction the pulley in reverse so the steer was slowly settling onto the table next bodine slid the straps from beneath it heaving at the carcass and he moved the pulley toward the entrance to the room the old man was inside his hand above his eyes to shield them from the light youre sure that youre okay bodine asked im fine all right then guess its up to you now what about those guts that fell the old man looked around take these forceps and that plastic bag put them in it bodine did what he was told he set the bag on the table how soon till i hear i dont know yet i cant tell yet what im looking for tomorrow afternoon bodine nodded walking toward the truck ill be waiting yes i know you will six then truck gone it was quiet no the lights up in the ceiling made a buzz funny how hed never noticed that before but then he hadnt been here this late in some while in the daytime there were always sounds and people he just wasnt used to being here alone the old man kept his hand near his eyes to shield them from the light staring at the carcass on the table what to do what hed said was true he didnt know what he was looking for he needed rest a chance to think and sleep he needed to sit and then he realized he hadnt even thought to ask bodine to help him slide the carcass into the cooler he didnt have the strength to do it on his own he could put the bag of guts in there but not the carcass it would simply be too much for him he wondered what to do the phone rang he almost didnt answer but he thought about it and he guessed it would be his wife and so he walked with effort toward the door that led down to his office reaching for the phone beside the counter by the door doctor markle here hi how are you im just about to leave i dont know yet something got a steer were not sure we brought the carcass in to see listen dont wait up i might be half an hour or so go to bed ill tell you all about it in a while no i wont be long i promise right goodbye and he hung up shed told him that she loved him and hed smiled with his hand above his eyes again he turned to face the carcass and he realized that he had lied he would not go home directly he would stay and work a little on the steer either that or let it stay out all night decomposing more until he couldnt do the proper tests a few slides for the microscope maybe take a portion of the brain and cool it for tomorrow test the feces take a sample of the blood the little that there was and in such poor condition he winced from the sickness in his stomach and he almost changed his mind then he braced himself nothing for it but to go ahead his legs heavy he went over to the sink and washed his hands and put on rubber gloves a gown and face mask out of habit really and to keep his clothes clean and to bear the stench he didnt think his samples would be clean all the same he liked to do things right and not contaminate anything so he stumbled toward the carcass and he wondered what hed tripped on and then realized it was himself his legs werent working properly hed have to do this soon and rest there were three facts that he needed to learn right away whether the steer had been dead before the animal had gotten at it whether the organs were all there whether the predator had left some sign of what it was the first he thought he knew if the steer had been dead especially for some time the blood would not have flowed no matter that they hadnt found the blood it clearly wasnt here the predator had maybe drunk it but that still meant that the steer was freshly killed the only sure test was to open up the heart a lot of blood would mean the steer was long dead when the animal had gotten at it little meant the steer had still been living when attacked the point was that a dead steer meant a scavenger and that would help identify the animal that had picked at it the fact about the organs whether all of them were present was related to the first if some of them were missing the assumption was that theyd been eaten and that would help eliminate a good deal of the mystery the steer had been attacked for food on the other hand if all the organs were still present hed have to figure why the extensive damage meant that the animal had lots of time to eat even if it had been scared away there had to be a reason why it didnt take advantage and eat something at the start could be that the steer was dead and something not a scavenger instead an animal that preferred fresh kills had tried to eat and given up could be too the steer was dead and something a disease perhaps had made the meat taste bad could be but the only way to tell that was by checking on the cause and time of death the other fact he needed a sign to help identify what kind of animal had done this he was hoping he would find as he examined the organs something like a piece of fur a toothmark anything but that would come as he went through the process first hed get a sample of the heart the brain the feces since the carcass was already open he would start in on the heart but as he went around the table looking at the open guts at first he couldnt find the heart then he did mashed in with the lungs and upper stomach it was more complete than he had hoped and he was cutting carefully around it reaching in to pull it out and slice it into quarters he was taken up with interest now breathing fast and hard staring at the sectioned heart it was almost empty that was that the steer had died from the attack of course it might have been diseased as well and he would tell that as he checked the other organs but at least he knew that what had done this was no scavenger it had been a fullscale hunter on the prowl for food his legs gave out and he was forced to grip the table this was wrong he had to get away get home and get to bed but he couldnt make his legs move then he had them working and he straightened he tried to go but couldnt take his mind off all those organs sorting through them liver bladder kidneys all those stomachs he couldnt understand it even shredded as they were it seemed that nothing was missing but that shouldnt be he cut deeply into the abdomen to where the bowels were still intact and took a sample of the feces the stench on top of what was in his stomach made him almost retch he had to find a reason if the animal had been a hunter then it should have eaten but it hadnt and he didnt understand his legs gave out again his chest constricted the pain shot through his left arm and he was praying he thought about his wife he thought about how she had said she loved him and he wished that he had said it back he thought about so many things just before he fell he singled in on one small portion of the guts staring at them disappearing into them and noticed a detail so horrible that in his death at last he understood seven they found him in the morning where he lay on the floor by the table one fist full of guts that he had taken with him as he fell that was shortly after seven the men who found him phoned a doctor but it wasnt any use the doctor came and knelt and checked him and just shook his head by then the old mans wife was there she had waited up for him but then in spite of all her good intentions she had gone to sleep she had wakened early and had missed him searching through the house shed seen that the car was gone and phoned the office but there wasnt any answer she had waited half an hour before going into town she came around the corner and started running when she saw the ambulance the double doors were open and she saw a crowd in there and she was pushing through stopping as she saw him and she gasped she ran across to him kneeling down to cradle him then yelling at him pushing shouting that he was a fool no one understood the doctor had been just about to leave he tried to calm her to lead her carefully away but she kept screaming then she started hitting the body and the doctor had somebody hold her while he opened his bag and swabbed her arm and filled a hypodermic giving her a sedative it didnt calm her right away she kept screaming began to sob crouched beside her husband once again and finally it seemed all right to try to make her go they led her down the hallway to the office the medical examiner was there to see the last of it he waited while they led her down the hallway then he checked the body doing more or less the same as what the doctor had but taking more time making notes he straightened putting pad and pen together turning toward the open double doors as behind the people there he saw the police car pulling up he waited while the drivers door was opened and the big man got out putting on his hat the uniform was tan the hat a stetson even with the people there the policemans face could be seen above the crowd burly craggy strongboned with high cheeks just a little puffy near the eyes the medical examiner assumed from too much beer what the hell if you worked the hours he did youd be puffy near the eyes as well never mind the beer the policemans name was slaughter and that had meant he almost didnt get the job he had settled here five years ago and when the old chief had died slaughter had asked the town council for the job at first the council was reluctant but slaughter had showed them his credentials and they couldnt pass him by twenty years a policeman and detective in detroit trained in every manner of investigation tired of living in the city wanting to come out and live in peace he had tried his hand at raising horses but then realized he wasnt any good the only thing he knew was being on the force he did it well the council needed him he needed them they finally worked it out some had feared thinking of his name that he would be too tough for them that coming from the east he would treat them as if he were in the city breaking heads as if this were detroit but they had phoned detroit and reports about him there were even better than he claimed he had never had a complaint against him he was never one to push so they had tried him on condition and they had kept him ever since at least in terms of lack of crime the town had never had things better as the medical examiner kept watching slaughter started big and solid through the crowd talking to them his hand pressed down around his gunbelt bullets showing that was shoved a little low around his waist then the crowd was in back of him and he released the hand from his holstered gun instincts from the city among the few that slaughter still retained standing there in cowboy boots and cowmans hat a toothpick in his mouth he looked about as local as a person could become not because he wore them but because he wore them with a certain pride and made the townsfolk proud to see him and to speak with him that faint inflection in his voice that he had picked up since hed come to see him grow to meet the town had made the town aware of what it was he had added to it now he paused and glanced around taking the toothpick from his mouth he walked across and frowned down at the body old doc markle yes im sorry i know how you felt about him slaughter didnt answer heart attack the medical examiner said his wife was here to see him shes just down the hall slaughter looked at him she had to be sedated slaughter shook his head shell have it rough from now on his voice dropped with sorrow he tried to distract himself by paying attention to details what time did he die i dont know yet rigors set in that means several hours some time in the night it had to be otherwise somebody from the office would have seen him maybe lets find out for certain slaughter glanced around he saw the people by the open double doors and went across to talk to them they listened saying something back to him he spoke again they nodded slowly breaking up to go away he turned and saw the people in the green lab coats standing by the wall he waved to them to follow him as he walked back toward the table you all work here anybody see him just before you closed they shook their heads there were six men and two women one the youngest woman twenty maybe slightly more began to cry it was clear the way her face and eyes were red that shed been crying earlier as well they were looking at the body then away then in a moment back again no one man was saying he was redhaired freckled maybe thirtyfive thin and going bald i came through to lock the place and markle wasnt here you check all the rooms yes in case someone forgot to lock them what time did you check shortly after six were you the last to leave the redhaired man nodded anybody else youve got kennels anybody come in after that to check the animals i did the older woman maybe thirtyfive as well short but solid her hair cut to just below her ears a little after ten the doctor wasnt here then either slaughter looked at her the doctor he said markle pointing to the first man hes a vet i just work here that means markle came in after ten the first man said and died a little after slaughter glanced at him and shook his head i dont know youre the one who found him thats right did you change anything i turned the lights off what about the doors well they were open then it wasnt after ten slaughter said when i sent all those people home i found a man whos got a room in a building that looks down on here he was out till well past midnight he came home and checked his window and hes sure that everything was dark down here if the doors were open and the lights were on he surely would have seen it no the doctor came here after one now i know you people put in heavy hours the same as all the rest of us but one oclock i cant believe thats normal no one answered what about this steer tell me whats the story on it i dont know the vet came around the table looking at it you can see that it was dead before he brought it in youre sure of that it had to be with all that damage you can see that he was doing tests on it there isnt any record why you dont know whose it is no answer slaughter looked at him then at the steer and at the body and he turned to face the medical examiner heart attack well maybe all the same i think wed better run some tests again but slaughter only frowned at him then hearing someone coming through the hallway door slaughter turned and saw the doctor he went over to him how is mrs markle the doctor shook his head can i speak to her she wont understand how soon till she does maybe after supper shell be at the hospital ill check on her and let you know thanks slaughter stared at the floor its too bad a woman that age now shes all alone he sighed then walked toward the double doors the medical examiner was waiting for him what about the body can i move it ill have pictures taken then its yours again he tried to distract himself is everything all right for tomorrow as near as i can tell okay ill see you then tomorrow was the weekend and they always got together out at slaughters that was slaughters way of keeping everybody friendly everyone he worked with had an open invitation to the ranchalthough ranch wasnt quite the word just five acres with a house and barn but he had two horses and the house was very nice and he liked to have the people whom he worked with out the only friends he had hed been married once his wife though had divorced him which was common with policemen who were married to their work she had kept the children one boy and a girl and now he hardly ever heard from them except when he insisted that they come out for a visit that had been a month ago and since then hed been distant it was obvious that he was looking forward to have people with him for tomorrow now he walked to the cruiser glanced around opened the drivers door and slid inside he sat there for a moment then reached to grab the microphone from the twoway radio on the dash he pressed the button marge its slaughter any news he released the button hiss of static nothing chief what about doc markle at the vets slaughter didnt answer chief he swallowed its too late hes dead oh hiss of static lord im sorry yeah well guess his time just came the words were like stones in his throat damn it he murmured say that again chief i didnt understand you nothing ill be back to the office shortly slaughter returned the microphone to the radio grabbed the key and twisted it starting the car he had tried his best to be objective in there really it was hard the doctor and the medical examiner both knew the way he felt so did marge that was what shed meant when she had said that she was sorry not for markle but for him markle was the man hed known out here the longest it was markle who had come out showing him about the horses he had tried to raise explaining his mistakes markle had told him that a vet should come out twice a year at least checking giving shots and worming just when slaughter got so he had one thing right though he would screw up on another and soon markle had to come out nearly every day in the end the old man had asked him why he wanted in this business in the first place and then slaughter had told him of his ideal image living in the country raising horses selling them sitting on the porch and watching all the animals run free markle shook his head the word hed used was business and he meant it if you wanted horses just to ride and look at that was one thing raising them and selling them that was something else people out here bred their own anyway you needed decent stock good brood mares a winning stallion it took years to build a proper herd not to mention all the care and work days and nights of making sure that they were healthy taking pains that they stayed out of trouble you needed to watch them all the time slaughter had listened nodding but hed persisted and only when the herdnot one horse or a couple but the whole damned herdcame down with colic did he know enough to stop it was markle who had told him of the old chiefs death and how the town council needed a replacement markle was a member of the council and that had helped of course plus markle felt close to slaughter by that time at first just full of pity and exasperation toward him but then growing to admire his determination and the way he liked the country and the people and the style of life indeed theyd gotten to be good friends sitting on the porch each time markle had come out discussing each new set of problems slaughter drinking beer the old man drinking coke the old man sensed in him a gentleness that went beyond slaughters name and strong tough manner the old man had told him so and while there were some members of the force who stood in line to get the job the old man had felt that since slaughter had singled out this place in which to live and since he had a sympathy for ranchers since he had the best credentials he ought to have a good chance for the job so the two of them had done their best the old man working on the members of the council especially those who felt that bigtime tactics werent exactly what the town required slaughter coming in to say that bigtime tactics were exactly what he didnt want that they had been the reason he had left detroit he made a good impression the issue waseven those who didnt want him had to sayhe knew so much about this kind of work they couldnt help but be convinced and markle was the cause of it that night slaughter took the old man on a celebration markle even drank some beer and now markle was dead slaughter pulled up at a stoplight waited thinking shook his head and when the light turned green he angled left he thought of how hed never spent the time he planned to with him there had always been a thing to do some aspect of the job to keep him occupied oh sure hed gone around to see him and his wife from time to time but not enough and not for long and now hed never have the chance again eight the door was thick wood rich and solid and slaughter swung it open stepping into the shadowy coolness of the stairway the cells were down the stairs to the right connected to the courthouse by a tunnel above and straight ahead a wide square vestibule led into the offices the floor was wood the vestibule was rimmed by treelike plants the ceiling two floors up was domed with glass he climbed the stairs and stood in the middle of the vestibule looking at the ceiling and the glass the sun was not yet high enough to gleam in where he stood was in halflight he felt the halflight match his mood thinking of the old man and then shaking off his mood he turned abruptly left to enter his office morning marge morning chief your coffees on the desk the night sheets right beside it thanks but hed already known she would say that it was what she told him every morning reduced now almost to a ritual in spite of what had happened he was forced to smile walking past her toward his glassedin section of the office in the far right corner marge was fortyfive grayhaired heavyset she had been here briefly with the old chief just before he died and wanting to keep everything efficient the change as smooth as he could manage slaughter had kept her on it was the best move he could have made marge was widowed with two fullgrown children and she had gone to work to get some order in her life she had helped slaughter ease in to his job telling him which man was good at what he did and which was faking she organized things so he could find out quickly what was going on it had been her notion that they move the twoway radio unit from the room across the hall and put it in here with him that way slaughter could overhear whatever messages were coming through and maybe save some time certainly that saved the town some money rather marge did taking on two jobs instead of one freeing one man who had always worked the radio now he could go out on the street at the same time taking slaughters calls and acting as his secretary she had the unit on the desk beside the entrance to the office typing at another desk and waiting for the cruisers to start checking in with her behind her desks were set in rows where officers would come in for debriefing after finishing their shift the desks were empty now there wasnt any point in having men here waiting for some trouble best to keep them on the street and have marge call to tell them where to go if they were needed slaughter barely glanced around the quiet room as he entered the glasspartitioned section of the office sitting at the desk he reached to swing the door shut peered out the window at the cars and trucks that went by past the trees out there then sipping at his coffeecool he hadnt drunk it soon enoughhe took the night sheet leaning back until his chair was braced against the metal filing cabinet there were ten notes on the sheet last night hadnt been busy a breakin at the hardware store he saw that two men from the day crew were already working on that they would check the manner of the breakin find out what was taken chances were by monday they would catch whoever did it strangers didnt come to steal here very often when they did they surely didnt try the hardware store most likely these were locals even though the town had a population of twenty thousand it was small enough that there would be no problem discovering whod suddenly gotten his hands on lots of hardware store equipment two drunk driving one assault that was at a truckers baran argument during a pool game one dog that kept barking all night and one prowler that was on the other side of town and slaughter would have a cruiser checking there tonight he scanned the other items on the sheet two car accidents no injuries a broken window at the high school a missing person well not really missing that was clifford who had left his wife three times already he kept going out and getting drunk and then not coming home cliffords wife would phone to say that he was missing and theyd find him two days later at a friends well slaughter would have a man check all the friends and this time tell the guy at least to phone his wife when he got sober they had better things to do than run a marriagecounseling service that was that nothing pressing although he didnt want to slaughter would have to work some more on organizing traffic control for the junior ranchers meeting that was coming up next week he would have to make a speech there too and for sure he was going to have to work more on what he planned to say to them he thought about the old man might as well get started he was reaching into his desk for a pencil and some paper when the buzzer sounded on his desk slaughter pressed the button on the intercom what is it marge a call for you its doctor reed reed had helped calm mrs markle put him through slaughter straightened reaching for the phone how are you doc and then he frowned and listened mrs markle was still unconscious from the sedative she kept talking anyhow babbling was more like it mixing things like sam bodine the steer the old man several other things as jumbled mostly though she just kept saying sam bodine the doctor thought that slaughter ought to know you think bodine owns the steer doc markle had on the table slaughter asked i dont know its hard to tell i thought id better call you though im glad you did slaughter set down the phone scratched his chin and peered out the window marge he said and opened the door she looked at him sam bodine and old doc markle werent they friends the father and the doctor were i dont know much about the son slaughter didnt either he had heard the old man talk vaguely about him but hed never understood the story guess its time i took a drive anybody calls i wont be back till after lunch nine it was a place hed never been slaughter had made a point of getting close to nearly all the ranchers around town but bodine was a loner and except for once or twice a year at ranchers meetings or in passing on the street slaughter almost never saw him strictly speaking slaughter had jurisdiction only in the town the state police had power in the valley so it wasnt strange that slaughter barely knew him all the same the town and valley were related and he liked to keep on top of what was going on out there he meant to tell bodine what had happened to find out if the steer the old man had been working on was his slaughter could have phoned to do that but really it was better that he drive out and do it in person this way he had a chance to be alone and think mulling through the times that he and markle had shared together facing up to what had happened so he could adjust to it and keep his feelings separate from his work that was just about the only value that he had the largest one at any rate of course that value was a mix of several others but they all combined to just one thingthe need to keep his life as straight and simple as he could since his work was really all that mattered to him so he told himself at least he wished he had his children with him that meant keeping his work as straight and simple as he could as well he couldnt be two people feeling one way acting some way else he had to bring them both together which was why he liked to have the crew he worked with out at his place on the weekends seeing all those people was a way of merging leisure with his work so the old man had passed on now never mind passed on the old man was plain dead three days later monday hed be underneath the dirt there wasnt anything that slaughter could do about it feeling bad was just a distraction anyway he told himself how come youre feeling bad to start with for the old man for his wife or for yourself is that sorrow or regret you owed him things you didnt go around to see him now hes dead and you start wishing that youd gone some friend you turned out to be all right hey get control get it straight that next time youve got dues to pay you pay them next time you make friends you understand the obligations right he told himself and then repeated right he thought and shook his head and then because he didnt like the way his mind was working he did his best to switch it off to concentrate on driving to look at the fields around him at the mountains the sky was almost white now he could feel the stark sun burning through the rear glass of the car today would be the hottest yet and he was thinking of the ranchers whod be working in the parched grass of the range the cattle wouldnt breathe well some would die then because the thought of death was going through him he began to notice all the carcasses of animals that were here and there beside the road five of them in just one mile a raccoon and a porcupine a field squirrel and a rabbit then a skunk stiff and bloating in the sun he thought of old doc markle shook his head and didnt bother counting anymore he turned left rattling across the grate heading down the dusty road between the fields seeing cattle coming up a rise then seeing where the house and barn were down there in a hollow he saw trees and sheds a wood pile a big corrugated metal building that looked like it would serve as a garage the house itself was newly painted white with gray around the windows and the eaves fresh and clean and bright against the summer sun it was big and getting bigger as he neared wider than hed thought a porch that faced off to the left a gravel parking space on this side of the house he pulled up and he cut his motor getting out putting on his hat walking toward the porch the thing was no one seemed to be around the windows all were open anyone inside could not have helped but hear him all the same there wasnt any sign of anyone slaughter knocked but no one answered then he turned and looked out toward the barn toward the corrugated metal structure which he saw now had one door open nothing in there on this side except a motorcycle well that helped explain it they were on the range and seeing to the stock either that or gone to town even so youd think that someone would have stayed the wife perhaps hed met her once in town nice hands she didnt seem the type to go out working with the stock he put his hand down on his holster stepping off the porch and walking toward the barn he saw where posts and boards were rigged to form a horse pen a nice looking appaloosa in there underneath the shelter of a cottonwood he saw a water trough a salt lick and a feed pail that reminded him to get another salt lick for his horses he turned facing toward the house again the flowers on one side the wellkept strip of lawn around the house and porch he scanned the sheds the barn the open space between them nothing out of place nothing dirty or rundown everything as freshly painted as the house and thought that this must be among the bestkept ranches that hed seen he stood between the house and barn and shouted no one answered the horse was looking at him slaughter went over leaned on the fence and snapped his fingers at it whats the matter no one home the sun glared down on him the horse moved its hoofs as if to come across to him and then stopped its head cocked toward the house slaughter sensed before he heard it a constant high shrill whistle it was coming from the back of the house he walked along the side looked through a kitchen window in the back and saw it there upon the stove a kettle with a flame beneath it steam escaping through the whistle on the spout he found a door in back that led in to the kitchen knocked but no one answered went in and shut off the stove he didnt understand he searched through all the downstairs rooms and then the bedrooms up on top he thought that someone might have turned the kettle on and then lain down to rest a moment and then gone to sleep but there was no one anywhere the wellkept grounds the freshly painted house it wasnt like the people here to go off with a kettle on the stove slaughter went out checking through the barn the sheds and the garage but there was no one and he didnt understand what would make them leave a kettle like that why had they forgotten where in hell had they gone anyhow the kettle had started shrieking only a while ago they must have turned it on just before he came so where in gods name were they ten dunlap was hungover he was slumped across the back seat of the bus he had made connections with the nearest airport and had thought that he would take a taxi to the town he hadnt remembered to check his map though and was told that potters field was fifty miles away no one would agree to drive him it wasnt just the distance it was that the town was on the other side of all those mountains getting there was several hours better take a bus but i want to go there in a taxi they just shook their heads this was something new to dunlap in new york where he came from taxi drivers would grab the chance to go that kind of distance picking up another fare and coming back that was just the trouble no one would be coming back people took the bus but ill pay to have you go both ways he told them they just shook their heads again all that driving through the mountains well stay here and save the cars so dunlap took the bus hed stayed up drinking late the night before in denver waking almost too late for his morning flight to here the plane had propellers it hit some rough air just above the northern mountains jolting up and down and sick already dunlap had barely kept his stomach down hed tried some coffee that didnt help he tried some alkaseltzer and it almost worked then he made a joke about a little of the dog that bit him asking for a drink at first the flight attendant was reluctant early in the morning like that but dunlap made a point of it and in the end he convinced her to sell him a jim beam on the rocks that was just the trick it went down sharp and made him gag but it stayed down and it seemed to settle his stomach two more sips and he was fine at least he thought he was returning to his stupor of the night before another drink and then his stomach let him have it he was in the washroom throwing up he washed his face looked in the mirror at his gray wrinkled skin walked back and slumped but he was glad to have it out of him at least and he was sleeping even through the turbulence as the plane struggled through the clouds and jounced down for a landing waiting for the bus dunlap went in to the mens room washed his face again opened up his travel bag took out a bottle and had another drink he knew that he was classic drinking all night sick and yet in need of still another drink all the same he needed it and if he did his job right who could tell the difference just as long as he could function thats what you do function just about he had another drink he had another on the bus his pint bottle hidden in his jacket pocket he sprawled feeling sick again staring at the seat before him and then sitting up he glanced at all the grassland going past it was flat at first but then it started rising sloping up to foothills and then mountains fir trees angling off as far as he could see now rocks among them and at one point looking out he saw the guardrail and a straight drop down to boulders and a section of the road that curved around a ridge down there an object came around the lower bend he knew it was a car but down that far it resembled a toy and suddenly aware of just how high he was dunlap felt a spinning in his brain a rising in his stomach and he had to look away either that or throw up again he settled back in his seat glancing at the people who were near him men in cowboy hats women wearing gingham dresses ginghamlord he thought that had gone out of style fifty years ago old men in suspenders all with suncreased skin that looked a bit like leather two seats ahead of him an indian was looking at a magazine the indians dark hair hung to his shoulders he wore a pair of faded jeans a red shirt and a beaded necklace his boots stuck in the aisle showing cracked seams rundown heels and something on one side that looked distinctly like a piece of horseshit dunlap watched him as he turned the page there was something strange about the photograph it showed a naked woman braced her crotch against a tree dunlap peered a little closer she was darkhaired ruddyskinned exactly like the man who read it and the language as he leaned a little closer wasnt english christ a pornographic magazine for indians hed have to make a note about that clearly he could use it local color and all that he squinted at the pearshaped breasts upon the naked woman then the page was turned and he was looking at a beaver shot dunlap thought of indians and made a joke about a little beaver shook his head and took another drink what kind of place was this to build a commune anyhow he thought why not east or maybe on the coast at least he had some friends there well there had been many communes in those places but none had ever been like this besides he didnt choose his assignments his bosses told him what to do and he went out and did it maybe that was how they got at him for all the drinking that he did maybe still he did his job or so he told himself at least hed have to clean the act up that was sure after this job he would dry out and hed show them sure just as soon as this was over he slumped so no one could see and had another drink eleven the sign said potters field gazette of course dunlap thought that almost slipped my mind gazette for god sake what else could it be at least the building had a little class it was mostly windows on both stories shiny metal strips connecting all the panes and clean at that he told himself thinking of the bus depot he had left there were likenew imitation marble steps that led up to the allglass door shiny metal all around it a shiny handle on the door dunlap waited for a truck to pass then stepped off the curb and started across the street toward the entrance the door turned out to be electrically controlled swinging open with a hiss the reception area was spotless bright lights in the decorator ceiling allwhite walls shiny imitation marble on the floor what was better the building was air conditioned sweat already cooling on dunlaps forehead he thought that this might work out after all he glanced at polished metal counters on his right and left desks and people typing at them yes sir may i help turning he saw a woman on his left early twenties thinfaced attractive her hair combed straight back in a pony tail he smiled and leaned against the counter yes im looking for a lord he couldnt remember the name parsons that was it im looking for mr parsons she stared at his wrinkled sport coat at the sweat marks underneath its arms something shut off in her eyes yes and may i have your name dunlap gordon dunlap im from new york on a story then the eyes were bright again of course hes been expecting you take these stairs the first door on the right she pointed toward a flight of stairs beyond the counter and dunlap smiled nodding walking toward them she wore a silk blouse her bra quite clear beneath it the two top buttons of her blouse spread open dunlap thought about that all the time he climbed the stairs after all the women he was used to seeing with no bra their nipples almost poking through their tops this was exotic he stopped and took out a handkerchief and wiped his face to the left he saw a corridor of offices their doors open people typing talking on the phone to the right he noticed a wooden door the first wood in here that hed seen mr parsons editor dunlap knocked and entered another woman older sat at a desk and studied him yes sir when dunlap told her she said of course she went out through another door this one wooden like the first although the desk and chair and cabinets were metal he waited everything was just as clean and shiny as downstairs through the windows he could see the stores across the street the woman came back smiling saying he should go in dunlap nodded walking through everything was wood in there bookshelves desk and chairs and tables even the walls no not everything a thick rug occupied a large part of the floor and two of the chairs were leather the difference was the same this was more a study than an office more than that a sanctum people summoned here would be impressed whoever summoned them understood the principles of power parsons he was smiling getting up from where he sat behind the desk coming around to shake hands hello there we expected you the middle of the week yeah well something came up at the office they wouldnt let me go till yesterday at noon and then because he knew hed sounded rude i hope i didnt inconvenience you no not at all smiling again parsons pointed toward one of the wellstuffed leather chairs before the desk have a seat can i get you something coffee would be nice parsons pressed a button on the intercom and looked at him cream and sugar lots of it dunlap said and parsons put the order through then still smiling parsons sat back his hands upon his lap and waited he was maybe fiftyfive husky almost fat but not exactly mostly he was just bigboned massive chest and shoulders hands as big as a heavyweight boxers his head seemed extra large as well even with his bulging stomach he seemed very much in shape though his skin as fresh and smooth as athletes in their twenties when hed come around to shake hands with dunlap he had moved as if he were a dancer or a man of half his size and weight dunlap was impressed this man had a presence more than that he knew what he was doing he had never once appeared to notice dunlaps wrinkled coat and ravaged face and eyes clearly though hed been aware of them from the start he was not a man who did things without thinking the way hed fixed this office so it stood out from the others the way he sat his expensive suit conspicuous in a town where everyone wore cowboy clothes his blue shirt crisp and clean his striped tie meticulously knotted his hands upon his lap leaning back and smiling as if he were at his leisure but he wasnt dunlap knew hed have to watch him yes well tell me parsons said still leaning back and smiling i know you told me on the phone but just to help me understand why not tell me once again dunlap lit a cigarette well were doing retrospectives parsons leaned ahead abruptly pointing no not here dunlap wondered what he meant he looked around he saw that there were no ashtrays and understood standing up to crush the cigarette against the inside of a refuse can sorry quite all right you couldnt know sure and now youre up on me you bastard dunlap thought sitting back and going on like i said were doing retrospectives newsworld magazine thats right and parsons nodded quite a thing a man from newsworld magazine to come here yes well must be quite a story then the door opened and the woman came in with the coffee thank you certainly and she was gone dunlap tried to continue his explanation weve been hows the coffee just the way i like it fine and dunlap had lost count of how much parsons was ahead of him the commune he was saying parsons looked at him he evidently hadnt figured they would get so quickly to the point his eyes narrowed thats right i remember now youre checking on the commune the commune twenty years after it was founded twentythree hows that twentythree years since it was founded yeah we figured that might make a point parsons shook his head and frowned i dont quite understand well the difference between then and now nineteen seventy dope and acid vietnam young people either going into politics or dropping out of society but what about the commune well we figured we would check on how it went i still dont understand its a way to measure how the country changed all those fine young good intentions parsons made a face the new republic thats the thing they called it free love free food and free spirit parsons made another face yes but never mind the free love business thats the part that people always pick at what we want to know is what came out of all that you could have saved yourself a trip ill tell you what came out of all that nothing thats what came of it well thats a statement in itself hey wait a minute parsons said do you have that tape recorder on dunlap nodded turn if off but whats the matter turn the damned thing off i said dunlap obeyed but whats the matter listen radicals back then are running corporations now either that or writing books about how wrong they were entertainers who dropped out and went to china are out hoofing on the stage again everything has changed its a different world whats so wrong to talk about that all the communes are long gone as well but then none of them was quite like this none of them had so much money so much talent and ambition coming out here from the coast buying all that land and setting up to start a brand new country brook farm in our century yes and brook farm went to bust and so did this parsons said but whats so wrong to talk about it look you didnt come here just to see the difference you came here to start that trouble once again dunlap didnt understand its common knowledge how the town put pressure on them parsons said how the freaks came through here in their long hair and their costumes dressed as superman and god knows what all turning kids to dope standing on the corner howling blowing kisses how the town refused to tolerate them wouldnt sell them food or clothing or supplies wouldnt even let them in the city limits tried to find a way to get them off that land how one rancher had his boy run off and went up there to get him went a little crazy pulled a gun and shot a guy theres a lot of memory yet in town about that theres a lot of feeling i dont want you going around and making people ugly once again either that or guilty i dont want you writing so this town looks like the nations asshole we had lots of that before writers coming in and making trouble sympathizing with those freaks you tell me how things have changed well one thing hasnt reporters like an underdog and the way the town reacted to those freaks there wasnt any question who the reporters sided with my guess is youll be doing just the same but really im not here for that dunlap said i just want to see the difference will you mention what went on back then how the town reacted sure i guess so thats a part of how things changed as well parsons shrugged all right then there you have it and they looked at one another and they waited the buzzer sounded on the intercom parsons touched a button dont forget you chair a council meeting in an hour a womans voice said thank you parsons took his hand off the intercom leaning back christ dunlap thought he isnt just the newspapers owner and the editor and maybe owner of a half a dozen other places too hes the goddamned mayor dunlap tried to think of how to smooth things look he told him you know just as well as i there are two sides to a story back in nineteen seventy everything was polarized the straights and the longhairs the hawks and the doves one group acted one way and the other did the opposite the thing to do is talk to people in the town and get their version of the story then to talk to people in the commune and get their version too parsons shrugged theres no one out there now what dunlap straightened in surprise nobody told me maybe two or three are still there if they are its news to me dunlap stared at him of course there are ways to track the others down parsons said the names are all on file if youve got the time dunlap went on staring at him look ill tell you what parsons said you may have gathered from that message that i dont just run this paper im on the town council if i wanted i could make things tough for you see that people didnt talk to you deny you access to the papers files other things it was the other things that dunlap didnt like the sound of but i wont for one thing that would show up in your story too for another youd just work a little harder and youd get your story anyhow all the same if i wanted i could make things tough now the point is i dont want you thinking im against you the fact is that im not in your place id act the same as you what i do want is a simple understanding anything you need is yours ask and ill arrange it you go out and do your story then you come back to this office and we talk i want the chance to make this town look good to you these people here are fine im anxious that they dont get hurt dunlap squinted no im not afraid of business being hurt parsons said people out there dont stop buying cattle just because a story makes a town look bad what i said was true i just dont want these people hurt dunlap took a breath fair enough what do you need well for starters let me in your papers morgue then id like to see the records the police kept thats no problem what else courthouse records trials and transcripts thats no problem either then id like to talk to people in the town ill go out to the commune too of course of course ill see that someone goes out with you dunlap shrugged thats all i can think of for now well youd best get at it then just remember anything you need dont worry ill get back to you i know you will and parsons stared at him as dunlap stood to leave one thing now was certain dunlap thought this was going to be a whole lot harder than hed expected twelve ken kesey was the cause of it the merry pranksters and that bus that was back in kesey had already finished one flew over the cuckoos nest and sometimes a great notion with his money he had bought some land near palo alto california gathered freaks around him and started on a trip that was back when lsd was legal and the trip of course was only in his mind then the trip was real he had bought a bus had sprayed it every color of the rainbow and then dressing like a comic strip he had shooed his freaks on board and started for new york on the road a decade later neal cassidy as driver that same cassidy whod been with kerouac they had ballyhooed across the country music blaring out of speakers on the top channeled in upon itself so that it echoed and then echoed yet again police cars stopping them while pranksters jumped downdayglocolored costumes captain marvel mandrake the magiciansetting up their movie cameras yes sir yes sir whats the trouble speak right toward this microphone well the policemen didnt stay long and the pranksters got few traffic tickets roaring on across the country popping acid blaring music acting out the movie of their lives they reached new york and headed back and by now they were noticed not just by the strangers they were passing but the press as well there were numerous stories about their odyssey acid rock and dayglo paint so that when they got back to the commune others of their kind were waiting for them and the movie went on only larger more extreme from the commune they went to the cities starting what they called their acid tests light shows flashing pictures music coming from each corner of a hall they rented speakers blaring all matched with the flashing in their minds from all those koolaid pitchers spiked with acid then kesey was arrested for possession not of acid but of marijuana that took place in in he was arrested yet again same charge but convicted by now on the first offense and out while sentence was appealed he had fled his second trial heading south toward mexico unlawful flight rumors where he was then back in california where he was arrested once again in he was serving time that was how the acid culture got its start from kesey and his life style bigger than his books but there were other ways those who said that kesey had been wrong that with a good thing going hed been foolish to be so in sight better to do it on the sly keep things quiet keep them truly out of sight like the commune some were saying that had been a good idea the trouble was that kesey ventured out he had been his own undoing better find a place where no one went stay there do your thing well they did it and where they chose to do it was near potters field wyoming all it took was one rich kid whose parents had both died hed been with kesey he had seen the trouble that was coming and hed split twentyone he had complete control of all the money hed inherited hed found a spot where no one ever went fifty acres of thick timber in the mountains far across the valley from the town he had bought it paid the taxes for ten years set up buildings and moved in it wasnt just a place for freaking out he had notions of a kind of ideal way of life those who marched against the vietnam war but felt they werent accomplishing anything those who tried to change society from within the system but found that the politicians they worked for betrayed them these and others like them he would welcome to his arms the new republic free love free food and free spirit everything was on his tab not an orgy not the kind of free love everyone was thinking of but something else simple freedom that permitted love love in any form physical emotional as long as no one would be harmed the kind of freedom those who were attracted to him hadnt seen before first there were the freaks imitation pranksters some who had indeed been pranksters then there were the dropouts those who couldnt stand things anymore who couldnt even bear to watch the television news queers and junkies cowards troublemakers traitors and more that was how the straight world saw them but in quillers fifty acres they were just themselves quiller twentyone and rich and leader of his version of a country photographs of him were not at all what a conservative would expect no long hair and beard and ragged jeans no beads guru shirts or captain marvel costume quiller looked just as straight as those who spoke against him short hair reminiscent of the fifties sideburns even with the middle of his ears fairskinned to begin with so his clean face looked like it was always shaved he wore customtailored shirts and designer slacks and handsewn patentleather shoes tall and thin no that didnt quite describe him tall was far too relative he stood sixfooteight a star in basketball in college but that still did not convey his seeming height think of what he weighed one hundred and sixty sometimes less just sinew bone and muscle running ten miles in the morning and another ten at night he looked as if someone had put him on a rack and stretched him long legs long arms neck and body stark thin hips and chest and waist his face was in proportion high and narrow slight jaw small lips thin nose mostly what you noticed were his eyes though even in the photographs bright and clear and gleaming almost piercing in color photos they were blue some who were against him said his eyes were bright like that because of all the speed and acid he was popping others more inclined toward him maintained that they were bright like that because he was so goddamned smart his iq close to genius up there near one hundred and eighty all that dunlap had already checked on going through old newsworld files back in new york at his office there were photographs of quiller talking to reporters of the conference that he had called using all the power of his wealth to tell them what he planned reporters had been glad to come promised champagne pheasant under glass and caviar eager too to find another kesey they had written many stories based on kesey now they hoped to write a lot more like them based on quiller disappointed when they saw how straight he seemed quiller had them writing soon enough however first he told them how disgusted he was that he couldnt get attention without bribing them to come how he hoped the caviar would choke them and remind them of the sickness in the country he explained his views about the nation and he told them to go out and spread the word they of course refused some were standing up to leave but he had something yet in store for them the exodus he called it two months further on july independence day he would free his people from their bondage starting out from san francisco he would lead a caravan of misfits malcontents and dispossessed from city hall at nine am and take them to the promised land he told reporters of the fifty acres told them what he planned to do there told them of the kind of ideal life he hoped to lead because he couldnt change the nature of the world he would turn his back on it and make his own no hate no wars no repression only peace and mutual respect and harmony he invited all the reporters in the room to join him mostly though he let them in on what amounted to a newsmans holiday two months from now theyd have stories all right more than they could handle visions of those photogenic hippies traffic jams and confrontations dayglo buses vans and motorcycles god knows what all heading down the road local color and events that was it events this had the feel of something major quiller got what he had wanted they went out and spread the word it was a mediacreated happening later many would maintain that nothing would have taken place if reporters had been silent but the media said that it would happen and of course it did five thousand freaks of all descriptions half as many vehicles it wasnt just a traffic jam it amounted almost to a riot police attacking the freaks claiming the assembly was unlawful dragging hippies off quiller put a stop to that hed used his money there as well buying various permits from officials and they started away quiller at the lead in a bright red classic corvette heading across the country they went through nevada and then utah others joining in along the way a fivemile caravan of cars and trucks and bikes and buses straight or twisted some plain others daygloed orange and green and purple every color you could think of it was something else they said it was also quillers last cooperation with reporters he had broken his first ruledont let people know what youre doing hed been forced to without newsmen he had no publicity but now he had no need for them and he ignored them all along the way he reached wyoming moving close to home he crossed the rangeland worked up through the mountains crossed more rangeland then more mountains then he reached the valley coming through the western pass never getting close to town simply heading north within the valley until he reached the loggers road and going up and that was where the story ended no reporter ever saw the compound lord knows many tried quiller though was adamant echoing a famous kesey slogan that a persons either on or off the bus he said that newsmen too were free to join the catch was they would have to stay youre either in or out of the compound theres no inbetween many newsmen tried to fake it but he wouldnt have them he wouldnt accept a lot of freaks whod come with him as well he wanted only those who sensed a mission those who wanted nothing but parties he ordered to leave there were thugs he had hired who took care of forcing them to leave and many of the chosen who took care of forcing them as well at last he had a thousand then he cut them down to half and all the gates were closed from all accounts there wasnt much to see regardless just an open space within the trees wooden buildings set out into streets and sections not like houses more like barracks just as if this were the army that had turned a lot of people off helping to thin the ranks the place itself was far off in the forest quiller hadnt bought land near the highway he had bought it away up in the mountains also buying a strip of land to get to it that was why you couldnt see the compound walking up the loggers road you came to where a gate was closed and members of the commune watched it you could work across and come in from the side that took several hours though the woods were thick and slashed with ravines but the borders there were guarded too and anyway the woods were still so thick you couldnt see the commune for a picture of it you would have to walk right to the forests edge and someone surely would have spotted you there were rumors that one man had gone there been discovered had his camera taken from him and been chased but no one ever found the man to talk to him and no one ever knew and anyway so what the story by then wasnt at the compound it was in the town all the freaks whod been rejected or had lost their interest showed up in potters field that was when the trouble started when the town rejected all those crazy perverts wouldnt sell them food or even gasoline and called in the state police to have them sent away there were fights and broken windows shattered heads daygloed buildings litter obscene gestures and a lot of dope it was two weeks that the town wished hadnt been in the end the freaks were all evicted but the town looked on the compound as the cause of all the trouble indeed the town drew no distinction between quillers people and those others and it wouldnt sell the compound food dunlap knew that from the files in new york too he had seen the photos of the san francisco riot policemen dragging hippies off kicking swinging clubs and pushing a great mass of pained and twisted faces bodies trampled underfootphotos that reminded him of others like them from the previous decade especially the march on the pentagon and the chicago democratic convention he had read about the sudden permits that came through suspecting that quiller could have had them sooner but that quiller held off until he made a point binding all those people to him dunlap saw photos of the corvette heading out of san francisco the long procession following of locals by the road who even in still pictures seemed to shake their heads and turn and frown and ask each other what the hell was going on state patrol cars waiting for a traffic violation restaurants that wouldnt serve them by the time they got to utah the photos began to seem ordinary editors enlivened them juxtaposing brigham young the mormon trek and quillers ragged motorcade the point was obvious daygloed buses against covered wagons this new trek a parody of what had once been dignified and meaningful even layouts like that soon lost their effectiveness however so that by the time the column reached wyoming there was little new to show oh sure there were the mountains and the valley the road up to the compound and the gate but all those pictures didnt have much drama to them editors rejected them in favor of what was happening in town as near as dunlap could remember from the photos he had studied in new york there didnt seem much difference between how the town had looked back then and what it looked like now a few new buildings maybe and of course the slogans had been erased from the walls but really nothing much was changed the same wide central street the same twostory buildings that went straight down on both sides their clapboard walls painted white a pocket of tradition continuity the place had likely looked the same back in the fifties too dunlap had seen pictures of the confrontation in the town beaded hippies facetoface with sterneyed men in cowboy hats state policemen standing by patrol cars waiting for trouble fights and local people jeering flying stones and bottles broken windows tents and garbage through the parkand more fights further confrontations each day worse than the one before until the roundup in the park patrol cars all around it while the troopers went in from all sides and pushed the hippies toward the center county buses waiting for them those on foot at least others forced to start their cars and trucks and vans and get the hell out from the town the state police cars stayed with them right through the town and valley up the pass and only left them when they reached the other side there were some who stubborn came back but they didnt last long forced to leave again and then that part of everything was over the story idled there was nothing doing newsmen and photographers soon left potters field was by itself again except for quiller and the compound so much for the files that dunlap had gone through in new york parsons had been right of course the press had sided with the hippies civil rights and freedom of expression not to mention that the hippies were the underdogs all the same dunlap couldnt blame the town it really hadnt been prepared for several thousand strungout westcoast freaks descending on them there was just too little understanding it didnt matter anyhow that wasnt what hed come for although hed have to note it for perspective in his story what he wanted was the story of what happened next the story no one else had covered the subtle manyyear changes that when isolated didnt have much drama but when put together and compressed might make a dramatic point quiller and the compound what went on up there behind those sentries and that gate dunlap was guessing that the new republic failed all that wealth and innocence not good enough to make a difference lofty ideals compromised gold turned into lead not that quillers ideals had been very deep or complicated regardless of the iq they had come from they were mostly wellphrased slogans sure there was the paradox of using wealth to make a way of life that didnt need it there was too the paradox of quiller straight and cleancut leading all those hippies his classic corvette at the head of all those musicblaring buses nonetheless for all that dunlap knew quiller had just made himself look straight so he could use the system to create his enterprise the only way to know that was to talk to quiller and as much as dunlap was aware no one from the outside had heard news of quiller since hed closed the gates and gone back in the woodenshrouded compound back in it was almost twentythree years ago exactly parsons had been right next month the middle of july would be about the time the trouble had reached its worst within the town dunlap guessed that if the compound went to hell its members simply drifted off quiller with them so dejected no one wished to talk about it could be quiller lost his wealth and disappeared no longer powerful only disillusioned and anonymous could be all the same youd think that someone would have told well the only way to know was to do the research get the facts and get out of here dunlap sat before a microfilm machine he was in the newspapers basement in a small room at the far end of a corridor his coat was on a chair the only light the one that glowed from the microfilm machine it was pleasant down here in the halfdark cool and faintly soothing even with the sound of a fan that blew air past the film to keep the reading light in there from burning through it he had asked the man in charge down here to give him all the reels for summer actually hed been surprised that parsons had the gazettes morgue on microfilm most town papers like this just had issues put in storage destroying many when they needed room parsons though was up on things dunlap hated reading microfilm all the same he was impressed he sat there fooling with a reel adjusting it he turned the reel until he got an image on the screen before him centered it and started reading what he wanted was some aspect of the story that the files hed read had not included some small detail that would tell him what had happened in the compound while the troubles in the town upstaged it for a time the microfilm before him and the files hed read in new york were the same different writers handled them there were different slants one in favor of the town and one against it but the information was the same then he came across an item that hed never seen before the cars and trucks and vans that went up in the compound quiller had them sold some he sent down to the local dealers trading at a loss for cash then the trouble in the town intensified so much that angry dealers wouldnt any longer trade with him and emissaries from the compound had to leave the valley for the dealers in the nearest other towns emissaries that was it quiller wasnt ever with them what was more the emissaries wouldnt ever mention what was going on up there that was no surprise of course although dunlap thought that it was subtle good religious precepts swear your followers to secrecy have them give up all unnecessary worldly goods the money they earned from the sale would have been nothing when compared to quillers wealth but this way they were adding to the enterprise giving not just taking the thing that puzzled dunlap however was the sports car in all the local items that described the way they traded all their vehicles for cash there wasnt any mention of the classic red corvette even back in a corvette was special chevrolet had switched designs and many buyers felt the earlier was better surely some reporter would have made a note if it were sold dunlap told himself that when he had the time hed have to call the other papers in the area in the meanwhile though and on a chance he scanned the usedcar advertisements on the microfilm he knew that if a dealer had his hands on that corvette hed surely want to advertise there wasnt any mention though dunlap looked ahead for several weeks and still there wasnt any mention he would have to check the other newspapers of course but could it be was it possible that quiller had ordered his members to sell their vehicles and while they did it had kept his own what the hell was going on dunlap turned the reel and read more of the microfilm once again except for how events were slanted this was much the same as what hed read in files back in his new york office the roundup the expulsion and the slowly settling peace then there was a difference local items on how much it cost the town to clean the garbage from the park to put in new windows and to scrape the slogans off the walls there were letters praising how authorities had handled things attempts to understand a strange and changing world confusion and bewilderment only one dissent no name saying that the town had been too hasty that instead of beating on those kids we should have tried to understand them maybe so but if there had been others who agreed with that there was no published sign of it the overwhelming sense was of a town that still had not recovered from its shock weird beaded costumes long hair beards and what all they were one thing although dunlap guessed that local people with their cowboy clothes and gingham dresses had seemed just as strange to all those westcoast hippies as the hippies seemed to them dope and shiftlessness and filth though they were something else something that the town could neither understand nor tolerate a woman wrote in angered by two infants she had seen dirtyfaced and crying diapers unchanged while the mother stretched out on the grass and looked away another woman wrote that all shed seen some children eat was halfcooked rice and moldy cheese and milk which with the specks of straw inside had clearly not been pasteurized and where on earth theyd got that kind of milk she didnt know but what was going on the dope had really done the trick though they had evidently smoked it clear out in the open almost flaunting it and dunlap going through the items in the paper was surprised that no one was arrested sure he understood that too he guessed to pick up one youd have to take them all otherwise you punished one and let the others get away the jail was likely far too small the trouble just not worth the cost of feeding them better just to clear out the lot of them which is what they did then dunlap read some issues of the paper where there wasnt any mention of what happened things were getting back to normal so the townsfolk were pretending that was just about the time the newsmen and photographers decided that the story was played out and started leaving they werent present for what happened next the murder headlines straight across the page at last thirteen the door creaked open dunlap swung a man stepped into view outlined by the hallway light that spilled in he was tall and gangly wearing suspenders his shirt sleeves rolled up his white hair haloed by the light behind him the man in charge of microfilm whom dunlap had talked to earlier im sorry sir we close at five the words were hushed as if this truly were a morgue the almostempty room echoing dunlap stared at him and breathed then he leaned back in his chair and rubbed his temples he looked at his watch ten to five hed started shortly after two so taken up by what he read that he hadnt realized how quickly the time was going abruptly he felt tired what time do you open in the morning eight oclock we close at noon the room echoed again dunlap lit a cigarette and nodded thanks hed been afraid that the newspapers office wouldnt be open on saturday he stood and put his jacket on glancing at the notes hed made surprised that there were so many of them unaware hed made them he put the microfilm back into its box stacked it on the other boxes snapped the light off on the reader picked the boxes up and walked across the room to hand them over thanks he repeated and with his camera tape recorder and his notes he went out past the man and down the hall on the street dunlap had to squint again the sun was low descending toward the mountains but the glare was as bad as earlier in contrast with the airconditioned building hed just left the air out here was close and humid and he started sweating almost immediately there were people going past walking home from work lots more traffic on the street he glanced at several women young and tall with soft loosefitting dresses that nonetheless suggested hips and breasts and shook his head he turned and walked up toward the right as much as he remembered that was where the two big buildings with all the trees had been when hed arrived on the bus at noon he looked and saw the trees in the distance and he kept walking the trees seemed five blocks away at least and he was wondering if the effort would be worth it mostly he was hot and tired and his hands shook so bad that he knew hed have to stop soon for a drink but reading through that microfilm had perked his interest and he didnt want to stay here any longer than he had to so hed take a chance and if the office up there were still open maybe he could save some time maybe but the trees seemed just as far away the more he walked and several times he almost weakened glancing at the bars then he stood across from all those trees the big stone pillared courthouse and the brick threestory building that he guessed would be the police station he crossed the street toward them reaching the shadow of the trees and feeling cool beneath them as the siren started wailing and a cruiser shot out from the corner of the building racing down a side street emergency lights flashing barely stopping at the main street as the big man in there swerved the cruiser sharply to the left and tires squealing rushed down through the center of the town dunlap watched him go this was more like home there were people all along the sidewalk stopped and watching there were cars that pulled close to the sidewalk while the cruiser wailed quickly past then the cruiser was so far along that dunlap couldnt see it anymore he heard the siren rising falling becoming fainter then he couldnt hear it and after he noticed that the traffic and pedestrians were going on about their business he started up the sidewalk toward the police stations entrance there was rich welltended lawn on each side of the walkway from the shadow of the trees he guessed the sun could not get in and scorch it he was thinking of the brown grass on the rangeland thinking of the cruiser what in this small town would merit such commotion probably an accident he thought a bad one rush hour and all that he reached the stairs that led up to the entrance brick just like the portico and walls old and dark and weathered he went in there were stairs that led down to the basement stairs that led up to a vestibule wide and tall and spacious treelike plants in pots along the walls doors that led off on each side the place gave off the notunpleasant must that comes with many years he saw a door wide open saw the sign on top police chief nathan slaughter and he entered the room was bright white walls lights across the ceiling to the left he saw a heavy grayhaired woman at a desk that supported a bulky twoway radio at first she didnt notice him all she did was sit there staring at the radio he moved and then she turned to him yes sir may i help dunlap glanced across the empty room and doubted it im looking for the chief sorry hes not in the woman stared at the radio again well my names dunlap mr parsons sent me over youre the reporter from new york he nodded mr slaughter had a call about you but he couldnt wait something came up and he had to get there sure the cop who raced out in that cruiser dunlap thought as the woman stared at the radio yet again he couldnt tell if she was being rude or was merely preoccupied i dont suppose you know when hell be back the woman shook her head tomorrow morning swell dunlap thought then maybe you can do something for me that depends i need to see some files the woman shook her head again youll have to ask the chief about that swell dunlap mentally repeated and abruptly a call crackled from the radio christ hes dead all right a man blurted his frenzied voice distorted by static lord he hasnt got a fourteen slaughter skidded to a stop behind the other cruisers he was getting out and putting on his hat even as he reached to turn the motor off his siren faded over to his right he saw them standing in a circle in the middle of the field staring down toward what appeared to be a hollow several members of his force a few civilians and the medical examiner they looked at him as he hurried around the cruiser then they turned and went on staring he was stepping onto the curb rushing through the stiff brown grass looking at the stockbarns over to his left smelling cattle droppings mounds and mounds of them the one thing out here that he still wasnt used to cattle milling in the pens brought in to be force fed and then shipped he was almost running as he came up to them and looked down in the hollow no one spoke jesus he said and turned away and then looked back again youre sure that this is him someone nodded to his right the husky blond policeman who was rettig rettig handed him a wallet slaughter opened it and read the drivers license clifford robert b it was him all right unless somebody had made a substitution all those times his wife had called and said that he was missing afraid that something had happened to him when in fact hed just gone out to have some drinks and get away from her and this time damn it anyhow her fear was justified what made slaughter think about a substitution what made him read the license was the body splayed out stiffly in the hollow the body had no face its eyes and lips and nose and cheeks and chin and forehead everything was ripped and mangled as if somebody had shoved the face into a wood shredder there were bits of chin and cheekbone showing sockets where the eyes had been but mostly what was shocking were the teeth bared no flesh around them white against the dark dirty scabcovered flesh the ears were gone as well no not gone exactly they were mixed in bits and pieces with the other mangled flesh tufts of hair stuck where his eyes had been the illusion that the hair had grown in the sockets slaughter was almost sick and had to turn away he took a breath okay what have you got so far rettig stepped a little closer well he was drinking last night at that bar down on the corner slaughter squinted down the street the railhead where the stockyard workers went for lunch and after five he nodded he was drinking quite a bit he stayed till closing bitched a lot because they wouldnt serve him then he left was he alone thats what the bartender says no one saw him after that nobody i can find slaughter glanced once more at the wallet in his hand searching through it two fives and a one we know he wasnt robbed at least he brooded and turned to the medical examiner so tell me what your guess is i wont know until i get him on the table hell its obvious a man nearby them said slaughter turned he saw a young policeman redhaired bothered by what he was staring at his name was hammel slaughter had hired him several months before and now he guessed hed have to start to teach him no it isnt obvious there are just three ways this could have happened one he was already dead when something came and ripped at him two he fell unconscious and it happened three he got attacked while he was walking now if hed been dead already then we have to know what killed him someone might have slit his throat and then an animal came by and smelled the blood slaughter kept staring at the young policeman who was redfaced blinking looking one way then the other slaughter knew that he had shamed him that he shouldnt press it anymore but he was powerless to stop in case you havent noticed theres a difference between a dog attack and homicide if thats what kind of animal to blame he turned toward the medical examiner again is that what you think did this i dont know ill have to measure all those lacerations you can see there arent any claw marks on the body that rules out a cat or something like that cat you mean a cougar thats right sometimes mountain lions come down here to the stockpens where the cattle are but not too often and certainly not lately not in twenty years there arent many cats around here anymore you think it was a dog then thats my guess ill have to check to see though as i said one thing that i want to look at are those pant cuffs you can see where theyve been torn it could be something nipped at him and brought him down could be on the other hand they could be old pants that he didnt bother changing when he left the house ill send them to the statepolice lab and in the meantime go around and see his wife about them slaughter was thinking that hed have to go and see her anyhow and then he didnt feel like talking anymore he turned and saw the young policeman who continued to look flustered his cheeks red blinking never saw a thing to beat it i did slaughter told him trying to make up for how hed spoken to him back in detroit working homicide bodies one and two days old bite marks all over their arms and legs their faces and their necks rats in tenements we got so we expected them if we werent out there fast enough we sometimes didnt find too much just take it easy a thing like this can throw you come to think of it a thing like this can throw me too the young man nodded slaughter nodded back he turned to rettig go down to those houses on the corner see what people know screams a dog thats loose any thing they might have noticed right rettig hurried away slaughter faced the medical examiner again wed better call and have the ambulance brought out he paused and watched as rettig moved across the barren lot you know what ive been thinking im not sure im thinking of that chewedup steer we found by old doc markle some connection i dont know but i cant shake the feeling somethings wrong part two the compound one his name was warren he was nine old enough to sneak out from the house when it was night but too young for the trouble he might get in now he waited for his mother and his father to stop talking in their bedroom he crouched beside his partly open door watching for the light to go off underneath the door across the hall once he almost panicked when his father came out toward the bathroom walking back and stopping as if he might look in and check on him warren knew he couldnt make it to the bed in time he crouched and trembled but his father shrugged and went in to his mother and the light went off and warren was fine he waited quite a while or so it seemed to him at least he heard no noises in the room across there and he guessed that they were both asleep cramped from crouching he gently closed the door and straightened his legs stiff groping through the darkness toward the window it was open crickets sounding out there in the grass and among the bushes he was just about to free the catches on the screen and set it to one side when he remembered here hed gone to all the trouble making up a plan and now hed almost climbed out and forgotten he turned to the right to touch his bed and pull the covers back and slip a pillow under there to make it look as if he was sleeping hed seen that trick several times on tv and it seemed a good idea in case his mother or father peered in to check on him then he reached beneath the bed and felt around to grab the sack of crackers he moved toward the window took off the screen and crawled out his legs still feeling cramped as he eased down onto the porch and put the screen back in the window but it kept falling off and he was forced to tilt it so the bottom angled out the top part leaning on the frame he studied it a moment then he turned and walked across the porch climbing onto the rail and hanging down fearful that his parents might still find him letting loose and dropping his stomach scraping against the wood that stuck out from the porch he huddled in the bushes rubbing his stomach he wore the pirate top his mother had slipped on him when she brought him in to bed him waiting until she left then taking off the pirate bottoms putting on his jeans and running shoes he felt beneath the top and touched the welted skin across his stomach tensing from the sharp biting pain thats all he would need is for his mother to see marks across his stomach in the morning well he couldnt do a thing about it he was out and he might just as well keep going all the same he crouched among the bushes several moments longer he groped for the sack where he had dropped it when hed slipped down from the rail then he had it paper crackling beneath his fingers and he froze he glanced around to see if any lights came on inside the house but nothing changed in there and he was certain he was being foolish if they hadnt heard him climbing off the rail and landing in the bushes then they surely wouldnt have heard the noise when he touched his sack of crackers what had really bothered him he knew now were the crickets they had stopped their squeaking that was how his mother had explained their noises to him crickets made that sound by squeaking one leg across the other and theyd stopped as soon as he had landed in the darkness every noise seemed extra loud and now the silence frightened him well if that was how this expedition would turn out then maybe he should go back in the house hed been brave enough when he was planning this now that he was outside in the dark he started getting scared maybe he should go back no he told himself he mustered his resolve and straightened the sack bunched in his hand as he stepped from the bushes where he lived was in the older section of the town between the business district and the new homes along the outskirts there were trees and shrubs for cover and a shaded lane that stretched behind the houses wary of the streetlights in the front he crept toward the murky lane his sneakers soaked with dew from the grass as he reached the lanes rough dusty gravel back in here away from all the streetlights it was blacker than he had expected he moved slowly working up his nerve over to his left he saw an object huddled by a shed he froze again and almost turned to run before he realized that it was a garbage can his eyes adjusted and he recognized what in the daylight would have been familiar sights the swing set in the backyard of the house next door the old well that was filled in and that he sometimes hid behind the wooden wheelbarrow from the old days that the man in back put flowers in he took a breath the moon emerged from clouds and he started walking again the moon made quite a difference almost full but not exactly lighting the darkness around him with a pale silver glow there were stars out too he saw and he felt better with each step passing trees and bushes cars and gardens sheds garages and more garbage cans all lit dimly by the silver of the moon he heard an owl instead of being frightened he pretended that the owl was cheering him on the lane came to a side street where he waited in the bushes until the headlights of a car went past and when it was safely up the street he ran across to where the lane continued he knew this section of the lane about as well as that part down behind his house looking at the flower garden up ahead the tree house and the oldtime water trough and hitching post watching for the dog the people down here kept out on a chain the dog was not around it seemed although he could see the chain quite clearly stretched out from the dog house lying in the grass reflecting moonlight no dog barking nothing coming after him he held his breath and hurried past it then he felt relieved maybe they had let the dog in maybe they had taken it away he didnt know but he was feeling even better as he passed the last few houses on the lane he had never been out on his own this late before and with his fear now gone he felt exactly as hed thought he would happy and excited thrilled to be out doing this he came to where the lane stopped and the park loomed up before him there were trees that shut away the moon a few thin silver streaks that filtered down upon the grass he didnt mind the darkness though this was one place where he always felt at home he played here often coming here with his mother nearly every day over to his left would be the swing sets although he couldnt see them down there straight ahead would be the swimming pool and tennis courts and over to his right would be the stream that wound its way through town and then through here to meet up with the lake there were ducks and fish and turtles in the lake and sometimes he would walk there with his mother eating lunch beside it that was where he went not directly toward the lake but toward the stream that met up with it toward a bend that they had walked along they had gone there wednesday and then yesterday and each time they had seen it the little animal that lived down in the reeds beside the stream he had been the one whod noticed it first look there mother at the cat down by the water shed gazed where he had pointed and shed said that it wasnt a cat the bushy tail and pointed face and mask around the eyes thats a raccoon it stood there in the water staring at them and then slowly walked up on the bank and disappeared within the reeds they waited but it didnt show itself again it looked so soft he wished that he could touch it better stay away from it his mother had said it might be wild it likely is that night they had told his father what theyd seen and he had nodded sure there might be coons still living in the city look at all the rabbits moles and possums theres no reason why it couldnt but they hardly come out in the daylight chances are nobody else has even seen it that had been exciting the only ones whod ever seen it warren had thought about it all night and the next day he had made his mother take him there again and he had seen it again it was standing high up on the bank this time and staring at them like before its head cocked sitting on one hip it had stayed there quite a while then it had crawled back into the reeds his mother said there was a hole in there that was why they always found it in this place and warren was even more excited thinking he had come upon a secret but today when he had walked there with his mother it was gone it hadnt shown itself at least and hed been disappointed he remembered what his father had said that raccoons didnt like the daylight and he guessed that if hed ever have a chance to touch it he would have to go at night even if he saw it in the day again he knew that his mother would never let him touch it so hed have to wait until dark and go there on his own at first the thought was scary after all hed never gone out by himself like that and what was more he knew his parents would be angry but the thought kept working on him he remembered what the raccoon looked like how hed wanted to reach down and touch it he remembered how hed often been tempted to sneak out when things were dark and learn what happened in the night soon the thought quit being scary he would go on his adventure and one day announce mother by the way do you remember that raccoon we saw well one night i went down and touched it she would look at him and he would smile and then shed know that he was bigger than she thought maybe he would even catch it that was what really made him go ahead with this to catch it bring it home and train it as a pet then his mom and dad would surely know how big he was but even as he thought of that he knew that he was wrong his parents wouldnt let him keep it they would just be mad at him the thing to do was catch it and then let it go later when hed grown a bit hed tell them what he did and theyd be proud for now though he would only hold it and then let it go that would be almost the same as having it for a pet plus hed be out on his own at night and thinking of that prospect he was so excited that he started making preparations all through supper hed been halfscared halfeager his heartbeat so loud he couldnt believe that his parents didnt hear it after eating he had tried to play a game of catch with his father but he kept dropping almost every pitch his father threw him fearful that his father would ask him why he was so nervous he had fidgeted through several shows on television then at last the sun had gone down his mother took him in to bed now his sack of crackers in his hand warren walked among the dark looming trees sometimes coming on a silver strip of moonlight and then moving into darkness again he felt more nervous than when hed left the house as much as he was used to coming here the park at night was quite a different thing shapes that should be friendly he could hardly recognize others even scared him that dark object over there was that something lurking for him he didnt think hed ever seen it what about that crouching shadow by that tree looking toward it warren bumped past the water fountain stumbling back before he realized what he had hit then he looked to see the shadow and it wasnt there now and he didnt know which way to go sometimes he heard noises far behind him and he turned to figure what they were other times the noises were quite close and he was forced to run then he slowed then he ran again and then he heard the trickling of the water came around a clump of trees and saw the silver pool of moonlight on the lake and knew that he was too far to the left even so hed managed to get here and the light was better and he felt a little more at ease he stopped to eat a cracker but the brittle biting noise he made unnerved him and he dropped it then he took a breath and left the lake to walk along the streams edge looking for the bend there it was directly ahead he saw the wide curve in the stream the reed tops sticking up from down there on the bank and he was walking closer the moon was gone a moment off behind a cloud making him stop then the moon was back and he started walking again he was almost there he looked down at the reeds and hoped that he would see the animal but he didnt he strained to notice some sign of movement but there wasnt any then he glanced around him up and down the stream there was just the silvertinted water shallow rippling on the stones for sure if the raccoon were here he would have seen it then it must be hiding in the reeds but how to go about this first warren walked a distance back and scrambled down the bank the slope was steeper than it looked he ended with one sneaker in the stream the water shocked him and he lurched back onto the shore he had no socks on and the water sloshed within his sneaker cold and faintly greasy draining out he shook his foot and then his skin adjusted and he put the foot down on the shore it sank into mud as had the other he revolted and the sneakers made a sucking noise as he stepped onto firmer ground now hed really fixed things he had mud upon his sneakers and his mother couldnt help but see that surely she would know he almost panicked then he thought of waterhe could wash themand the image of that drinking fountain came to him and he knew that he could wash them there he began to feel relieved he stepped a little closer to the reeds worried that the noise hed made had scared the raccoon into its hole he had almost dropped the bag of crackers and now he clutched it to him drops of water on it and on his hand he crouched peering in through the reeds but there was nothing he could see the reeds were thick and dark and he would never find the hole all the same he peered as close as he could manage his face up even with the reeds still he couldnt see for all he knew the raccoon was right there in front of him and if it didnt move there wasnt any way for him to know then he thought that where the raccoon went down into the stream and then turned back and went up to its hole there had to be a little path a kind of tunnel within the reeds he stood and looked down at the stream and made his choice bracing himself against the shock he stepped with both feet into the stream waded then turned to face the reeds at first warren didnt notice it then he did a little burrow in the reeds a kind of channel where the raccoon came and went somewhere up inside would be the hole he stooped and opened the sack of crackers reaching in to grab a few here coon he was saying softly but he didnt like the noise and so he switched to whistling short and low he didnt like that either but he liked it better than his voice and so he kept on whistling pulling out the crackers throwing them they rattied up the passage in the reeds here coon he was saying and then caught himself and started whistling once again he threw a few more crackers listened harder but there wasnt any movement what to do warren crouched a good deal closer the crackers in his hand he thought that he would throw them like the others then he thought that he would reach in with them maybe it would take the crackers from his hand he held them at the entrance he reached his hand up in there watching the hand disappear and that was when he heard it over to his right he looked it was coming down the bank it seemed to be off balance hi coon he was saying heres some crackers for you but it didnt stop it just kept coming and it made a hiss he had never heard a sound quite like it something like a cat but not exactly and it kept on coming hissing and he had his hand out with the cracker thinking it was going to eat already knowing how hed reach to grab it firmly behind the ears just the way his father had shown him how to grab a cat and it was past the cracker its teeth sunk into his hand aaiieee warren jumped up stumbling into the stream the raccoon was attached to him its mouth sunk into his hand its weight suspended so it dragged him downward almost falling into the stream he couldnt bear the pain the sharp teeth biting tearing scraping on a bone his flesh now ripping from the weight of what was hanging on him he was struggling for his balance flailing grabbing at the raccoon to free it swinging jerking with his arm and then he swept around and flung the arm and he was free of all that weight the raccoon flipping through the air thudding on the other bank warren didnt have a chance to marvel at his strength the animal was bigger than hed thought almost half his size and heavyhed expected he could lift it like it was a cat and here it felt like someone he was wrestling with the force of flinging it away had toppled him against the bank and he was scrambling to his feet now as the raccoon came for him again it must have hurt itself when it had landed it was limping listing to one side as it surged across the stream it hissed and warren was scrambling with his back against the slope staring down and kicking with both shoes the raccoon snapped and bit and got one shoe and wrenched its head from side to side as if to tear a piece away and warren felt its teeth go into his foot and he was kicking at it with his other shoe ramming down against the raccoons nose and then warrens foot was free and he was scrambling farther up the slope that pointed nose those bandit eyes he had thought that they were cute and now he couldnt stop from screaming at the terror of them he was at the top now feeling where its breath was at his ankles jumping up to run and he could hear it hissing there behind him as he ran with all the power of his fright he had never run so fast before his legs stretched out beneath him his chest on fire gasping choking crying and the thing kept on behind him and he kept on running and he turned to see how close it was and rammed against a tree he fell back his shoulder smarting and sprawled across the grass he didnt know how long hed been there blinking straining to move he fumbled to his hands and knees the thing was very close he couldnt see it but he sensed that it was near and he was stumbling to his feet he turned and lost his balance reaching for the tree he shook his head and heard the hissing behind him turned to kick at it and there it was but it was nowhere close out there in the moonlight turning in a circle limping lurching in a circle he had never seen any animal behave like that but he didnt stay to watch he suddenly was running again his legs unsteady his breath an effort stumbling his arms out to keep balance and he didnt stop until he was almost to the lane he limped along it his hand on fire then he started running once more he didnt even think to watch out for that familys dog down there he just kept running then he crossed the side street toward the last part of the lane and he was limping again looking back to see if it was after him it wasnt and he looked down toward his house now walking slowly toward it his injured hand oozing blood warm and sticky making him wince from the pain he realized that he had dropped his sack of crackers at the stream he didnt know why that should seem important but it was and he couldnt help sobbing then he started across the backyard toward his house he worried not just because his wound hurt and he didnt know if it was bad but as well because his mother couldnt help seeing it shed be angry knowing what hed done i have to hide it he thought how he didnt know keep his hand in his pocket stay away from her even if she didnt find out until tomorrow night that would give him time to say it had happened in the afternoon a dog perhaps a cat he couldnt decide but for sure he couldnt let her know the truth he reached the porch thinking he would climb up but he didnt have the strength so he walked around the front and went up softly onto the porch in the glow of streetlights he saw his hand and it was ugly caked with dirt and blood the flesh all torn and jagged he was frightened by it put his good hand over it and quickly looked away he came around to where the screen was leaning against his window took it off and crawled through into his room now he feared that he would get blood on the carpet and the drapes leaning swiftly out to put the screen back in and snap it shut with one hand underneath the other catching drops of blood he fumbled at the doorknob to his room and tiptoed down the hall to close the door behind him in the bathroom when he switched the light on he was shocked the hand looked worse than he had thought the bite deep down to the bone and wide and swollen oozing blood covered with grit a mass of ugly bulging ragged flesh he gripped the sink to keep from dropping to his knees he had never felt a pain like this made worse by the sight of what was causing it in the mirror he saw the sweat on his face the dirt and blood across his pirate top his skin as white as the towels that hung by the sink his pallor really scared him he was trembling he couldnt stop he turned on the tap to wash his hand understanding that hed have to wash the pirate top as well after reaching down to take it off he rinsed it then squeezed it to get the water out he checked to make sure that all the blood was off and then he went back to his hand the more he washed the more it continued bleeding but at least the wound was clean now and he grabbed a rag beneath the sink to bind the wound and keep the blood from dripping nothing more to do he thought about some firstaid cream but he had bound the wound already and he didnt feel like doing that again indeed he felt sick and he was thinking only of his bed he took the pirate top and shut the lights off turned the knob and went out down the hall is that you warren whats the matter he froze and waited warren nothing mother going to the bathroom all right dear warren tiptoed into his room closed the door and leaned against it breathing hard sweating he bit his lip to ease the pain he waited but his mother didnt come he hung the pirate top within his closet limped to the bed and sat there taking off his shoes the mud he hadnt thought to wash the mud off and hed have to hide his sneakers somewhere in his closet far in back he didnt want to barely had the strength and had the feeling that this would never end he took his pants off put on his pirate bottoms and crawled into bed he wished that he had never gone out he wished that he had stayed at home and gone to sleep he tried to sleep his hand kept throbbing he stared at the moonlight on his wall two it was a dog all right there isnt any question thats what ripped his face or thats what killed him slaughter asked both the cause of death was loss of blood from massive wounds around the face and neck slaughter put his beer can down you mean there really is a chance his throat was slit the medical examiner just shook his head no i remembered what you said back in that field i checked the throat especially the jugular was ripped not cut oh sure some nut might still have gone at clifford with a hand rake something that would tear but that would leave a different set of marks than all those bites you saw on him the medical examiner reached for his own beer can and slaughter shrugged okay then slaughter told him how about this the nut rips cliffords throat and runs away a dog finds clifford and starts chewing that way all the first marks are obliterated the medical examiner just shook his head again well why not slaughter asked all the wounds showed evidence of bleeding oh and slaughter leaned back in the chair and studied his beer can that was final only living bodies bleed so clifford must have been alive when he was mangled if some nut had ripped his throat clifford might have lived for half a minute longer but not long enough to bleed from what a dog might later do it was halfpast two at night and they were in the medical examiners office slaughter had stayed near the stockpens helping rettig and the new man ask the neighbors if theyd heard some trouble in the night he had asked about a prowler or a stray dog that was barking then hed met with rettig and the new man but they hadnt learned a thing the trouble was the field was too far from the houses near the noisy stockpens and the highway over there a sound from a dog would not have carried very well slaughter told his men to write their report and go home but in the morning to search the field what for im not quite sure yet do it though then hed looked at the setting sun and known he couldnt put it off much longer he would have to go see cliffords widow in detroit hed on occasion had to tell someone that a wife or child or husband had been killed but hed never known the people he was telling by contrast here those he told were always people he knew and some days it was worse than being the chief of police was worth like today to see his friend doc markle dead beside that mangled steer to hear about his friends wife so distraught that she was in the hospital slaughter planned to visit her as well and then to go out and explain to cliffords wife what had happened it was bad enough to have to say that clifford had been killed but not to know why hed been killed or how that made slaughter feel inept and worthless he had held cliffords widow let her keep on crying and helped her sit down on the sofa he had brought her coffee waited until her son arrived from the other side of town and finally decided that hed earned the right to leave he told her that hed let her know when she could have the body that hed pass on any news the minute he received it then hed said goodbye and went outside and nearly lost his balance on the porch by then the sun was gone and he was looking at the stars the rising moon thinking that he ought to go see mrs markle but he couldnt make himself the scene with cliffords widow had been just too much the only thing slaughter wanted was to get away from this to get inside his car and roll the windows down and drive to his place out in the country where he fed and watered both his horseshed forgotten when he last had ridden themand then because the things hed seen today had ruined any appetite he might have had he put off supper driving back to town he parked lights off in the shadows by the stockpens looking toward the field in case he saw some movement but there wasnt anything and after all he couldnt spend the night like this so he drove to the station the lights were on along the hall the night man was on duty by the twoway radio tall and thin an adams apple that bobbed whenever he spoke hi chief i wondered who was out there much doing quiet for a change today slaughter walked toward his glassedin section of the office he sat and thought a moment looking at the night sheet he had read in the morning he tapped a pencil on his desk and reached to open the phone book first the hospital mrs markle shes asleep now resting better thank you then a number in the valley sam bodine but no one answered then the state police its slaughter here i wondered if youd check on someone for me sam bodine thats right hes got a ranch on route twenty miles north of town i wonder if youd look in on him for me no theres nothing wrong at least not that i know of but i went out there today and no one was around it seemed like they had left in quite a hurry i phoned later this afternoon and then again just now but both times no one answered and i thought if you had a man out that way he could maybe have a look thanks i appreciate it slaughter hung up and again tapped his pencil on his desk too much in one day he thought fifteen minutes later the night man told him that the medical examiner was on the line slaughter picked up the phone so howd you know i was working well i called your house and no one answered where else would you be you mean youve got a lady friend shacked up that i dont know about you would have wakened me at this hour why not all the rest of us are working actually i knew youd be waiting and i phoned this number first you care to visit youre finished just this minute on my way hey hold it dont forget i have it in my trunk slaughter stood and left the office ill be at the medical examiners he told the night man he was moving down the hall what hed put inside his trunk were two sixpacks of coors that hed picked up at a convenience store as he was heading toward the office it was now a ritual with them whenever slaughter made the medical examiner work late he always dropped in at the hospital and offered beer and talked with him a while the gesture was a small one but appreciated and besides the chance to talk to get to know the people whom he worked with that was part of slaughters reason for his move out here in fact hed even started looking forward to their chats as if a corpse were not the reason for their latenight conversations not this time however no not this time slaughter got there in five minutes in a town this size there wasnt any place he couldnt get to quickly he parked in back beside the spaces for the doctors and went in through the emergency ward the hospital was small by bigcity standards two stories made of brick and glass with wings off to the right and left and one wing down the middle but though small it served the town quite well and thinking of the nightmares of detroit slaughter was grateful that he seldom saw a bleeding groaning patient whod been brought in from a knife fight or a shooting he walked along the corridor and reached the section marked pathology where without knocking he turned the office doorknob and the medical examiner was in there sitting waiting as they sipped their beer slaughter shifted in his chair to face the darkness beyond the open window where a dog began to bark a frenzied howl came shortly afterward then some sounds that slaughter couldnt identify he listened strangely fascinated at the same time apprehensive you know he said and turned and paused because he saw that the medical examiner was looking toward the window too and evidently concentrating on the sounds out there you know he said again since we saw clifford in that hollow in that field i kept remembering the night sheet that i read this morning theres a mention about clifford being missing something bothered me about it i went back tonight and read it through once more a couple lines above where cliffords missing theres a note about a dog that howled all night another note about a prowler so both complaints were from that neighborhood the medical examiner glanced from the window looking at him not quite near the field but close enough slaughter squinted how drunk was he anyhow the medical examiner just shrugged not even checking through the papers before him pointtwoeight percent and hed been drinking like that several years his liver looked like suet could he walk though i see what you mean did someone drag him to that field or did he walk i found no evidence of a struggle it could be youll find something different in the field i did find some bruises on his right forearm that are compatible with his position in that hollow also bruises on his shoulder so well think about it all those bruises were fresh so fresh in fact that he incurred them just before he died not after someone kicking at him once hed died no bruises are just localized internal bleeding if you strike a corpse youll cause some damage but not bruises in the sense we mean them only living bodies bleed hence only living bodies can develop bruises now a bruise will take a little time before it starts to color half an hour as an average slaughter stared at him you mean he landed in that hollow at least half an hour before he was attacked thats right but bear in mind the words i used i said the bruises were compatible with his position in that hollow could be he received them earlier some other place but its my educated guess that theyre from where he fell down in that hollow now its possible that someone pushed him if so i dont know what point there would have been because the cause of death was dog bites at least half an hour later what time three oclock threethirty at the latest yeah the people at the bar said clifford left a little after two when they closed fifteen minutes walk up to that field half an hour or so beyond that yeah it brings him pretty close to three oclock youre understanding then im getting it there wasnt any other person as the untouched wallet more or less suggested he came lurching from that bar and stumbled up the street he had to piss he tried a shortcut or maybe he was just confused well never know exactly why he tried that field but halfway through he passed out from the booze thats how he got the bruises then he slept a little and at last the dog came on him thats the way i reconstruct it but how many what how many dogs one or several oh just one youre sure about that you know how the language goes my educated guess sure but on what basis well the teeth marks were all uniform but lets assume for argument that weve got two dogs with the same sized teeth their enzymes would be different though their what their enzymes their saliva hell the crud inside their mouths a dog cant plant its teeth in something and not leave saliva all the enzymes in those wounds were uniform they came from just one dog not a coyote or a wolf slaughter asked no the teeth were too big for a coyotes yes all right a wolf ill give you that a wolf would be a possibility no more than that however no ones seen a wolf down here in twenty years its hardly worth considering all right a dog then slaughter said abruptly exhausted tell me why youve been living herewhatfive years just about well i was born and raised here dogs are something to be frightened of people take them into the mountains camping they lose them or abandon them the weak and spoiled ones die the others turn more wild than many animals who live up there you see a dog up in those mountains get away from it you might as well have stumbled on a shebear with a cub ive heard about some vicious maulings hell ive seen some victims with an arm chewed off but this is in the town no difference sure they live up in the mountains but they come down here for food the winter was a bad one dont forget you know yourself the stockpens put on guards at night to make sure that the steers are safe from predators the field is near the stockpens some dog from the mountains came down near the stockpens and found clifford but nothing tried to eat him he was just attacked without a reason thats the point were dealing here with totally perverted animal behavior they just like to kill theyll sometimes come down here and chase a steer for several miles just to get some exercise theyll bring the steer down kill it and then leave it in a human we would call that kind of behavior psychopathic slaughter put his beer can vaguely cold yet up against his forehead he was thinking of old doc markle in the morning i want you to go over to the animal clinic i want you to examine that steer we saw this morning what slaughters eyes became stern i know it sounds a little crazy all the same just do it look for similarities somethings going on here he managed to stand slaughter you dont look too good i need a few hours sleep is all slaughter headed toward the door hey what about the beer theres still a sixpack left you keep it hell youve earned it what you did on clifford just make sure you do that steer let me know when youre finished slaughter reached for the doorknob somethings going on you said thats right and what i wish to god i knew three the corridor was empty and the sound the door made when slaughter closed it echoed like a mausoleum he was thinking looking at the imitation marble floor he paused beneath the harsh neon lights in the ceiling trying to decide if he had finally accomplished everything hed meant to do tonight and still not certain vaguely troubled he walked down the hallway one turn to the right he nodded to the nurse on duty at emergency and then the automatic doors hissing open he stepped out to face the night the parking lot was rimmed by darkness there were floodlights just above him though illuminating the lot itself and he was walking toward the cruiser noticing the countless insects that were swirling around those lights the swarm of insects bothered him making him scratch at a tingle that inched down his neck the air at least was cool pleasant after the heat of the day and fresh as well in contrast with the cloying sicksweet smell of the formaldehyde which because he liked the man he never mentioned to the medical examiner he reached the cruiser and glanced in the back seat before sliding into the front a habit that he retained from when hed worked nightshirts in detroit then he sat there thinking once again not prepared to go home but still uncertain what it was a part of him intended he should do he was tired that was certain but he couldnt keep from feeling that his work was not yet complete no it wasnt even duty something strong out there was drawing him he turned on the engine and backed the cruiser from between two cars after glancing one last time at all those swirling insects he drove along the side of the hospital and out the front to reach the street the night was darker here he swung left without thinking merely following his inclination and when he steered right at the next intersection he was guessing that he meant to go back to the station but he reached a stoplight and when it changed to green he didnt go straight through but instead veered left and now he found that he was driving toward the outskirts toward the northeast section of the city and he finally knew where he was going there was little traffic the lights were out in most of the houses a few streetlights were out as well and he came around the corner driving slowly glancing around stopping by the railhead tavern it was closed by now this late it had better be he thought he got out his flashlight in his hand and walked up to check the doors but they were locked as hed expected although it would have been a pleasant joke to come here for a different reason and then as an accidental extra find that they were serving liquor after hours to be certain he checked all the windows too and then the back he even checked the garbage bin to see that all the bottles had been broken as the law required now youre getting mean he told himself and switching off his light he walked back to the cruiser it was three oclock now just about when clifford had been killed of course clifford had entered that field at least a half hour earlier and maybe if hed fallen sleeping closer to an hour but now was when the attack had occurred and slaughter stood by the cruiser staring up the street toward the field there were houses all along the far side of the street rundown mostly since this section was the closest that the town had to a slum listing porches dirt instead of grass cardboard here and there in place of windows but the people although poor were peaceful and hed never had much trouble with them from the bar of course but that was mostly workers from the stockpens and slaughter stared up past the field toward the vague silhouettes of buildings at the stockpens three of them the cattle stayed outside except for special auctions and there wasnt any need for more than just an office and two arenas in the stillness slaughter heard cattle lowing faintly from the far side of the field he hesitated then started up the sidewalk toward them in the open like this he had no need for his flashlight there were stars a nearly full moon they gave the night a glow that made it almost magical so clifford would have thought he guessed he himself was trying hard to think like clifford last night had been bright like this and clifford had come from the bar and walked up this way toward the field clifford had been drunk of course with that much alcohol inside himpointtwoeight percentthe glow would have been just about the only thing he noticed and he wouldnt have been walking hed have staggered lurching slowly up the street and maybe that was why hed tried the awkward shortcut through the field instead of going twice the distance around the block because clifford knew that in his condition he would never otherwise have managed to get home he had stumbled slowly toward the field and anything that might have hidden low in the weeds there would have seen he was an easy target no the timing was all wrong slaughter thought keep remembering those thirty minutes between when he fell and when he was attacked anything that saw him come and knew he was an easy target would have tried him right away there wasnt any reason for the animal to put off lunging unless the thing had not been interested unless it tried the cattle next and didnt like the men on guard there and then came back killing clifford why it didnt eat him out of anger and the thought was strangely chilling now as slaughter left the sidewalk stepping into the rustling grass and weeds and crunchy gravel of the field slaughter told himself that this was crazy he was tired he should be home and asleep by now but if there were some kind of wild dog coming into town it would return to where it was successful at its killing and the next night was as good a time as any to expect it slaughter was ten steps through the field moving up from the corner in a vague line toward the center and the hollow there and cliffords house up near the far end of the other block this route would have been close to the direction clifford followed although slaughter wouldnt know for sure until the two men hed assigned to this had come here in the morning and investigated oh thats fine thats really great he told himself and understood now just how tired he must be shuffling through here marring any tracks that they might find thats great police work like a bad joke thinking that the criminal will come back to the crime scene our investigator scuffs out any evidence that might be left thats really great just what the hell must you be thinking well ive done the damage now he told himself and he was too committed to his purpose to go back without some satisfaction he might just as well keep going which he did reluctantly because in spite of his determination he felt really unaccountably disturbed not the vague uneasiness that he had been experiencing since finding old doc markle this was something different more precise some visceral reaction to this place and hour part of it was no doubt caused by slaughters fatigue by memories of cliffords shredded face by thoughts of what the medical examiner had called psychopathic animal behavior mere pavlovian suggestion that he understood and could make compensation for and part of it was no doubt too the stillness of the night slaughter all alone here in the silence that by contrast emphasized each brush of his pantlegs through the weeds and grass each crunch of his boots upon the gravel he was kneedeep in the grass now moving slowly the flashlight in his left hand ready to be switched on if he needed it his right hand near his revolver in its holster and he told himself that he was being silly he had gone through worse than this when he had worked on nightshift in detroit checking through an unlocked warehouse chasing someone down a mazelike alley walking into that grocery store those two kids that was quite awhile ago he told himself heart pounding youre just not used to this the last few years it didnt help as well that now a rustling wind had started blowing through the weeds and tall grass making sounds as if there were movement in them once slaughter turned but he saw nothing fighting the impulse to switch on his flashlight no save it until youre absolutely certain he was thinking dont scare off some thing before its close enough for you to see it so slaughter continued walking he had thought that with the night light from the stars and moon hed have no trouble seeing but the silver glow distorted things indeed it made objects seem much nearer and it obscured details so that everything seemed blurred he glanced toward the stockpens with their shadows and their faintly moving shapes of cattle and the buildings behind them he was thinking that hed better not get too close to the pens or some guard might mistake him for a thief and pull out his gun slaughter was halfway through the field now and he couldnt find the hollow hed been glancing so much all around that he had angled from his course and now he didnt know if left or right was where he ought to go the hollow had been rimmed by long grass he remembered and he maybe wouldnt find it even if he stood ten feet away he told himself he should have kept his eyes toward cliffords house across there keeping in a line with it but now that he considered there was no way drunken clifford would have staggered in a straight line anyhow hed have veered off one way then the other so this was still a replication of what had happened and slaughter figured that hed shifted too much toward the stockpens moving now the other way he suddenly was conscious of the wind or rather the absence of it but the rustling through the grass had still continued coming nearer he turned startled ready with his flashlight lurching back to gain some distance and the tangled strand of broken wire must have been there all along for him to see when he first came here staring down at clifford it was snagged against his heels now and his arms flew out his head jerked up to face the moon and he was falling he was braced to hit the ground already calculating how hed have to roll to break his fall but he kept dropping surging heavily past the level of the ground and then his head struck something hard that set off shockwaves through his brain and left him sightless for a moment he was rolling that was all the motive he retained just reflex and his training pure adrenaline that scalded him into motion he was reaching for his gun hed lost it he was in the hollow panicked thoughts that he was powerless to order christ the hollow it had happened just like this to clifford slaughter groped for his flashlight but he couldnt find it he heard rustling coming toward him scrambling from the hollow toward the open ground where he at least would have the chance to run he felt the claws flick down his face and he was screaming falling backward landing breathless on another object which was so hard that it seemed to rupture his right kidney he was fumbling for it jesus and he saw up there the thing as it was crouching now to leap at him its fur puffed up to make it even larger hissing its eyes wild mouth wide teeth bare leaping toward him and he had the gun from underneath him now he raised it toward the hissing fury diving toward him squeezing the trigger blinded this time by the muzzle flash knocked flat by the recoil as the fury blew apart above him thudding on his stomach and he didnt think the blood would ever stop its shower upon him four the hotel room was small and musty space enough for a narrow bed a desk and chair a tv on the desk and that was dial the desk was scratched its finish cracked by years of drinks spilled across it plus the television had no channel dial you had to grip a tiny metal post and turn until your fingers ached and even then that didnt do much good because the television only got one channel the image kept flipping black and white the window had no screen you had to leave it closed to shut the insects out which partly was the reason for the mustiness in here but mostly dunlap knew the must was from the aging wooden walls the place had been erected back in dunlap knew that from a plaque that he had seen embedded in the bar downstairs as if a hotel so outdated were something the town was proud of threadbare carpet creaky bed a common toilet at the far end of each hall hed had to get up in the night to urinate had made a wrong turn coming back and almost hadnt found his room so involuted were the halls one merging in a t with others and those others merging yet again with others like a rabbits den a gigantic maze that kept twisting inward dunlap was fearful about what hed do in case of a fire which considering the tinderlike walls was overdue for several years now and he didnt like the thought of jumping toward the alley from the second story plus he didnt have much strength to do it he was sick again he tried to think back to a night when he had not been sick and with his lack of memory he was doubly fearful how much longer could he keep doing this hed sat and watched the reruns on the tv set behind the bar downstairs from eight oclock until the place had closed he had no way of telling just how much hed drunk except that near the end the barman had looked strangely at him and the programs were a blur of ads and station breaks and dont forget the stock reports oh my yes not the stock reports but out here stock was not the closing points of xerox kodak or the rest of them no stock was cattle and the market prices came on first at eight and then at ten and then again at signoff time hey he could not have drunk too much if he could recollect all that in detail no then why was he shaking why was he so sick that breakfast was a thought he couldnt tolerate he had to have a drink before he dared go down the hall and shave and then another when he came back before fumbling with the buttons on his shirt it scared him this much he could recollect a time when he had not required one drink in the morning just to function now this morning he had needed two and if he werent careful he would soon need a third but theres a difference he was thinking needing one and taking one lets make sure you keep in mind the difference dunlap picked up his tape recorder and his camera where hed set them by the television vowing to himself that he would clean his life up feeling virtuous determined he didnt pick up his pint of bourbon when he walked out the door the hall went to the right then left then right again then opened on three sides to show the lobby down there a moose head on the wallfrom thirty forty years ago no doubt the thing looked shabby enough for thatgray tile floor discolored wooden checkin counter a bald wrinkled man in denim clothes behind the counter dunlap took a breath and instantly regretted it the must was even worse up here he asked himself again what he had ever done to deserve being sent to potters field then trudged down the stairs crossing the lobby toward the street the sun was like a knife jabbed into his eyes eight oclock and how hot would the day be with the sun so fierce this early he didnt want to think about it eight oclock but hed been awake since well before dawn and that was something else his drinking had affected now he hardly slept at all and when he did not deeply waking often drifting back and forth from grotesque dreams he didnt want to think about that either not the image that had constantly been coming to him he walked toward the corner concentrating on the coffee he was going to taste sure you could buy a drink back at the hotel but there wasnt any place to get some coffee try the grubsteak at the corner hed been told and hell they either didnt know the way to spell it or they maybe were more clever than he thought the one thing he at least was getting was a mess of local color you dont talk like that he told himself youre here one day and theyre infecting you youd better keep your mind on what youre doing which was fine with him because he didnt want to think about a lot of things but work was hardly one of them he sensed that he was on to something dunlap entered the diner the counter was a horseshoe the curved end in the middle of the room and sure what else did you expect he thought he looked at all the men in cowboy hats who in turn were looking at him and he passed them to sit in a far corner booth where quicker than he had expected a waitressher hair pinned up beneath a netcame over to him haifa minute later he was sipping coffee but although hed been eager for it he had to drink it slowly lest he throw up yes he was on to something christ hes dead all right the voice had blurted through the static on the twoway radio lord he doesnt have a the only thing that dunlap had been able to discover was that two kids had been playing in a field where they had stumbled upon the body of a man named clifford whose face had been so mutilated that policemen couldnt tell at first exactly who he was the woman who had sat behind the radio had tried to avoid dunlaps questions and had finally suggested that he leavethe chief would see him in the morning dunlap had lingered even so but when policemen from the day shift had begun to come in for debriefing they had made it clear that he should leave and hed had no choice but to go out on the street he had hoped to talk to rettig and a new recruit named hammel whom dunlap gathered were the men assigned to this investigation but they hadnt come in yet and he had quickly gotten the picture that unless he had the chiefs permission no one would be talking to him nonetheless the symmetry appealed to him a murder twentythree years ago and now another as he arrived to do the retrospective the contrast would be worth reporting how the separate murders had been handled if this second killing were indeed a murder well a dead man with no face that surely wasnt ordinary and as far as dunlap cared the difference was the same that first murder had been something he hadnt counted on there hadnt been a mention of it in the files that he had looked through in new york when parsons mentioned it in passingyesterday in parsons officedunlap had required all his discipline not to show his interest he had just kept sitting there and nodding as if vaguely bored by all this ancient news but really he had felt his heartbeat quicken felt that tug inside him as he guessed that there was more here than he had anticipated he had kept his guard up all the time he and parsons made their bargain he had still looked bored when he had gone down to the papers morgue and asked the man in charge to bring the microfilm but when he was alone hed squinted in suspense for it and in an issue twentythree years ago the first week in october he had found it it was pretty much the way that parsons had described it the town had evidently feared another rush of hippies coming through especially if reporters showed up publicizing what had happened once the town had adjusted to its shock it must have worked to keep the news from going farther and the tactic was successful as much as dunlap knew the story had been strictly local a headline the first day a thirdpage feature the next day then a few paragraphs buried near the sports section a rancher had wakened to find that his eighteenyearold son was missing at first the rancher wasnt bothered thinking that his son had gone out with some friends and simply stayed the night hed made some calls but couldnt find him waiting through the afternoon until at suppertime the boy was still not home and he got worried on a chance he phoned the state police fearing that thered been an accident or maybe the boy had gotten in trouble and was too afraid to call the police hadnt heard a thing about him doing what the father had already done however checking with the young mans friends the friends though didnt know a thing about him either hadnt seen him in a couple of days hed been moody staying to himself hed even broken up with his girlfriend someone thought of suicide and then they really did get worried this was sureno vehicle was missing from the ranch the son had either walked off or had gotten a ride had he run away the father spoke of arguments that theyd been having and as dunlap had gone through the story he had sensed that the arguments were severe small town ranchers son who wanted something more father who repressed him reading through the microfilm dunlap had been puzzled why it took them so long understanding but it did indeed it took them several days but then a friend remembered how the boy had hung out with those hippies when theyd caused that trouble in the town the friend had even seen him smoking marijuana the son had talked about the hippies often after they had left the father and the state police considered this for a while and then they finally had it figured out the father wanted to go up and get him but the state police insisted that they go alone they evidently saw how furious the father was and concluded that theyd save some trouble if they went up on their own besides there wasnt any guarantee that the boy was up there this was just a chance no point in making judgments until they knew the next few details dunlap had to guess because while there was plenty of space devoted to the missing son to start with once the murder occurred the lid came over the story dunlap was impressed by someones thoroughness that was parsons he suspected working to protect the town there wasnt any way to know exactly what went on the rationale was obvious to guarantee that the trial was fair to keep the jurors free from bias after all a small town if the trial took place here news about the murder had to be subdued and dignified oh it was dignified all right hell it was almost nonexistent and back in a small town in the boonies could get away with that there hadnt been those recent major court decisions about freedom for reporters at a trial not that any local newsman would have worked against the blackout no the point was to keep outside newsmen ignorant of what had happened here conspiracy is what some people call it dunlap thought and sipped his coffee now youre thinking like a woodward or a bernstein lets not make too much of this well make too much or not he sure as hell was going to find out what went on up in that compound he walked toward the counter and paid fifty cents for his coffee as he left he glanced back toward the elderly waitress who was staring puzzled at him then down at the twodollar tip hed put on the table what now showing off well why not if he felt like being a bigtime spender from the city he was maybe condescending but at least he didnt hurt somebody and besides it made him feel good he might be a boozer but at least he wasnt stingy he went outside and once again the sun stabbed his eyes it was even worse though hotter more intense and his elation as he left the diner suddenly was gone he felt nervous and impatient he had planned to go back to the newspapers morgue but he was doubtful that hed learn much more hed tried to get in touch with the police chief several times last night but slaughter had been neither at his home nor at the station when hed called and dunlap was determined now to speak with him he hitched the straps of his tape recorder and his camera around his shoulder and marched through the glaring sunlight up the street the time was halfpast eight he noticed lots more traffic mostly pickup trucks with people crowded in them come to town on saturday to shop or merely look around he noticed that the stores were open and he was thinking that he maybe ought to stop at one and buy a hat oh that would look just great a city suit and a cowboy hat well keep your pride then but before long out here in the sun like this your facell be as parched and leathered as those people in the pickup trucks he passed the newspapers office wishing he could hail a taxi but he hadnt seen a taxi since hed come here and he trudged on beginning to sweat well this would be the last time he would let them send him to a jerkoff town like this he sensed that there was some good story here and when he put it all together he would show them he was just as good as he had once been and he wouldnt have to take this kind of job but then an odd dilemma started working on him dunlap was anxious to get out of here but if he meant to guarantee that he would never find himself this low again hed have to take more time than he could tolerate he might be here a week from now and that was too much for his mind to bear as he walked underneath the trees at last and up the front steps to the police station of course the chief had not come in yet what was worse the chief had phoned to say that he didnt plan to come in at all hed had some kind of trouble and what am i supposed to do dunlap asked the policeman on duty well maybe if you told me why you had to see him dunlap slumped in a chair hed gone through this the day before but there had been a different person then a woman and dunlap studied the policeman sighed then passing through frustration told him very calmly what it was he needed thats no problem dunlap blinked he didnt think hed heard correctly what if you had told me who you were to start with when the chief called in this morning he explained you might be stopping by just hold on while i call him back and fifteen minutes later dunlap stood across from a row of dingy houses staring at a barren field with stockpens up at one end and a bar the railhead down at the other he had carefully avoided mentioning his interest in the recent killing concentrating only on the compound twentythree years ago as a consequence when he had found out where the chief was sending him hed been astonished by his luck the railhead he had heard that name on the twoway radio yesterday this was where the mutilated body had been found dunlap looked at the two policemen who were standing in the middle of the field they turned to study him when the cruiser that had brought him here pulled away the sun was stark a wind hurled bits of sharp hot sand at him he licked his gritty lips and started through the field the two policemen met him halfway yes sir may we help you one of them asked and dunlap thought that things might just be getting better as he told them but the one named rettig didnt want to talk five oh thats wonderful just goddamned great im out here in the middle of this stupid field and this guy rettig doesnt want to talk well what else did you think would happen dunlap asked himself just because it got a little easier a while ago you figured everything would be simple now hell youre the one whos simple wake up do your job dunlap knew that rettig wasnt just the man in charge of this investigation rettig had been with the state police back then dunlap had learned that from the man on duty at the station he had learned as well that rettig was the one whod spent the most time with wheeler twentythree years ago look way back then i dont see what the problem is but rettig didnt want to talk wheeler was the rancher who had lost his son all right then you dont even need to talk about it lets try this ill tell you what i know and guess and less than that just make up on the spot dunlap decided but at least this was a way to draw out rettig to get him talking you just tell me if im right or not im going to do this story anyway youll want to make sure that the parts about you are correct dunlap studied him and rettig wasnt certain staring back so as another gust of wind came up the dust obscuring them their faces specked with grit dunlap started prompting him anxious to fill the silence and keep rettig from having a chance to say no you drove out toward the commune looking for the boy you headed up the loggers road the sentries wouldnt let you through the gate they made you go back to the town to get a search warrant but in the meantime wheeler had decided not to follow your advice he went up on his own despite what you had warned him no that isnt true rettig hesitated then continued wheeler didnt go up in the meantime we had made him wait back at the stationnot the one in town but the state police barracks out on the highwayand he heard us call in that we had to go to town to get a search warrant thats when he drove out the man on duty at the station went to take a leak and wheeler left while he was gone and wheeler was upset enough the man on duty called you to go back up to the compound dunlap said thats right so you couldnt have been very far behind wheeler didnt have to go home for the gun he was a rancher and he likely had it in the trunk or car or jeep whatever he was driving a pickup truck dunlap had an image now of all those pickup trucks that he had seen this morning families come to town the guns in racks behind the drivers seat a rifle or a shotgun dunlap said the last word made rettigs eyes flicker yes a shotgun dunlap said and now he understood why thered been no details about the murder wheeler was cursing angry at the boy for running off angry at the compound for the trick that it had pulled more than that he didnt understand those hippies he was afraid going up to find the boy and rescue him he roared his truck right up that loggers road and crashed straight through the gate he drove until the road came to an end then jumped out with his shotgun running through the woods the sentries racing after him he almost made it to the clearing when they tackled him there was a fight he jumped back shotgun ready and he blew one bearded hippys head apart dunlap had to pause to check for some reaction he was guessing based on what hed read but it made sense except he didnt know exactly how the shooting had occurred especially what part of the body but it had to be the head head or groinotherwise the paper would have been more specific but a shotgunned head or groin was something that you didnt mention if you wanted to be delicate and since as far as dunlap knew there was no sex involved in this the head its long hair and its shaggy beard would have been what the rancher likely shot at hell it was symbolic of the trouble dunlap kept waiting as the wind died in the silence rettig murmured his face looked like somebody had squashed a quart of strawberries on it just this mushy red stuff no eyes no mouth nothing just this mushy red stuff rettig guided him toward the cruiser ive said more than i intended look i understand ill make a deal you call your chief and hell explain that its all right i told you at the start i cleared this first with parsons then with him rettig looked skeptical i have to go to his place ill be sure to ask him take me with you rettig frowned i mean i dont have any car you cant just leave me i can leave you if you cleared this as you say i dont want any trouble though rettig thought about it you get in well drive you but youd better not be lying dunlap smiled and hurried into the back the other cop got in the front beside where rettig drove and both were taking off their hats and dunlap wished that they had rolled their windows down when they had parked the cruiser the heat had built up in here so that his clothes stuck to him and to the seat they drove up past the stockpens dunlap glancing at the cattle in there and then watching how the slums diminished as they turned left and headed toward a newer section of the town they were going through an underpass and quicker than he had expected they were in the country dunlap had noticed in the phone book that the chiefs address was r r something but he hadnt really understood how far out that might be they went past sunbaked grassland no one spoke on occasion there were staticdistorted voices on the twoway radio but neither man picked up the microphone to answer dunlap studied them rettig with his red curly hair the other man much younger blond his hair cut short in imitation of the style back in the fifties with the difference that out here the style was not an imitation rather a continuation they both looked like football players big and tall and husky and the man back at the station had been big and tall as well and dunlap was thinking that their size might be a part of what the chief had looked for when he hired them if that were true then slaughter maybe had some bigtime notions about how to handle trouble he might not be just some hick and dunlap considered that then tried to get rettig talking again you were close enough to hear the shot rettig stared at his rearview mirror look i warned you but you answered me regardless dunlap thought oh you were close enough all right hell you were nearly there to see it happen once you heard the shot and saw that shattered gate you sped up through it stopping by the pickup truck and running farther up the trail to find the rancher with his shotgun aimed at several other hippies oh yes dunlap could imagine what the scene had been like the hippies looking down the barrel of the shotgun terrified not knowing what to do if they ran wheeler would fire if they stayed hed likely do the same the rancher too far gone to maintain control his eyes wide his face stark breathing hard and tensing his finger on the trigger and the two of you the last thing that you wanted was to shoot the guy you didnt want him shooting someone else though either even if that someone else was just another hippie the first one spread out on the ground his face like someone had squashed a quart of strawberries on it and the others sure there would have been other hippies from the compound whod heard the shot and come running through the trees and when they saw the body they stumbled back or maybe just froze in shock and soon the rancher became more nervous seeing people all around him hippies his finger tight on the trigger as he squinted at the two cops who had their guns out telling him to stop this inching toward him howd you manage to take it from him what the shotgun how did you take it dunlap hoped that the question would appeal to rettigs pride but the cop just stared down the highway some dumb hippie tried to grab him rettig said abruptly wheeler turned and i jumped close to get the shotgun i had it pointed toward the ground when it went off it blew up bits of dirt and pine needles but i had him and he couldnt work the pump to slide another shell in my my my and sure you didnt have much trouble telling me how well you did dunlap thought he knew that soon hed have it all especially what happened to the ranchers son hey tell me what you saw up there but rettig didnt answer i mean look i said well clear it with the chief first rettig told him and their little game was finished dunlap didnt even try again he sat back his clothing sweaty against the seat and watched the country they were passing flatland mostly clumps of brush out in the fields they turned left through an open listing wooden gate then they were on a weedgrown wagon road and he heard gunshots many of them louder as they sped along the dusty road dunlap leaned ahead trouble but they didnt answer they sped down a hill dry red earth on either side and there were buildings in a hollow first a modest house four rooms maybe with a porch in front painted white and then a barn about the same size as the house and painted white as well some kind of shed and it was white and all three were beside a fencedin pasture where two horses shied from what disturbed them in the gully six slaughter watched them shooting by the gully then he turned to face the medical examiner it was a cat all right i shot its fucking head off the medical examiner narrowed his eyes youre sure you think i never saw a cat before the goddamned thing attacked me some big torn i mean a big torn fifteen pounds at least and if i hadnt shot it id have had my face scratched off the medical examiner scowled it didnt make sense not only the attack but slaughters fierce reaction and then he understood sure slaughter must have been terrified lying in that hollow thinking he would end up next like clifford he likely hadnt felt that kind of fear since he had worked back in detroit he wasnt used to it and he was angry now because hed lost control the medical examiner had never thought of slaughters being capable of fear the thought was oddly new and made the medical examiner feel sympathetic liking him even more over by the gully the men continued shooting what about that scratch youd better let me have a look at it the medical examiner said but slaughter only waved the offered hand away i fixed it up myself the scratch was long and deep across his cheek thickly scabbed and ugly old doc markle made me keep a decent firstaid kit out here just in case from when i tried to raise those horses first i washed it then i disinfected it i was thinking about stitches no it isnt bad enough for that i should have gone to see you but all i wanted was to get home slaughter turned toward the sound of the cruiser angling down the redclay road between the hillocks rettig and the new man were in the front but as slaughter watched them drawing closer a dust cloud rising he could see as well another person this one in the back a man in a gray wrinkled suit his faceit was obvious even through the dusty windshieldas gray and wrinkled as the suit but when the cruiser stopped and they got out the man hitched up what seemed to be a tape recorder and a camera and his body wasnt stooped or wasted and if slaughters judgment was correct his age was forty fortyfive a face like that though slaughter knew there wasnt any question this guy was a boozer dry and brittle hair gray like the rest of him slaughter stepped from the porch theres some beer inside he told the medical examiner see you later wait a minute i have questions later slaughter walked toward the grayfaced man who had the tape recorder and the camera rettig and the new man didnt even bother looking toward the sound of the shots in the gully but the grayfaced man was staring in that direction we did everything you told us rettig said as slaughter reached them nothing i expected slaughter held his hand out mr dunlap and that earned the look that slaughter had anticipated dunlap was impressed slaughter always made a point of keeping track of names hed learned that in the city understanding that a name could mean the difference between trust and panic people tell me youve been looking for me dunlap gripped his hand youre a hard man to find not so hard youre here after all slaughter smiled and dunlap turned once more toward the gunshots in the gully look if you dont mind my asking anything thats what youre here for slaughter said that shooting target practice its a pattern we got into saturdays i have the men i work with out to drink some beer and eat some chili at the start though before they drink the beer they go back behind the barn and do some target practice some towns dont require that but i insist my men shoot two times a month at least the shift on duty today will come out next week and we alternate like that you care to see as they walked toward the barn rettig joined them hes been asking about quiller and the compound i know it slaughter said parsons phoned about that quiller was before my time thats why i sent our guest to you he said that he had cleared it but you did exactly what you should have i tried calling on the radio but evidently you werent near the cruiser theres no problem in your place id have been suspicious too they passed the clean white barn the gunshots louder echoing and then they came around the back the dirt here hard and brittle and five men were in jeans and rolledup shirt sleeves spread out by the gully shooting revolvers at tin cans below a ridge across the ditch the ditch was maybe twenty feet across the cans another five feet farther on and three men were reloading glancing at where slaughter came with dunlap and then rettig past the barn to reach them one man said that beer had better be as cold as you pretend it is i lied slaughter said its even colder they laughed looks like we could use some new targets slaughter pointed all the cans across there had more holes than metal barely held together by the seams that joined them well we figure once we blast them till theres nothing left we can say we earned the beer a hundred rounds per man no less than that slaughter gestured toward dunlap this mans from new york hes a reporter and hes doing research on that commune in the hills i want you to cooperate i dont know all that happened back then but i dont see much use hiding it they studied dunlap and nodded how come youre not out here shooting one man asked slaughter i put in my time before you came oh sure you did they looked amused slaughter glanced at dunlap then at them shrugged and drew his revolver dunlap stepped back automatically he stared at the gun as slaughter approached his men and concentrated on the cans on the other side of the gully he braced himself his body sideways his feet apart and aimed then squeezed the trigger a can flipped the shot loud the recoil spreading smoothly through slaughters body and he cocked again and fired cocked and fired six times altogether the shots echoing on top of one another as the can went through its clattering dance and with the last hit fell apart slaughter had worked his hand as quickly as the eye could follow his men were laughing clapping as he shrugged then pressed a button that allowed him to swing out the handguns cylinder he pocketed the used cartridges and reloaded i see youve got some rounds to shoot yet slaughter pointed toward the halffull boxes by their feet that beer is getting colder he winked then walked toward the barn and pick up all your empty cartridges this time yeah yeah they told him looked toward the riddled cans and started firing again as slaughter led dunlap and rettig back to the house thats impressive shooting dunlap said nothing that a little practice doesnt help slaughter said i wasnt kidding i did my stint before they got here sometimes i shoot with them mostly i just sit up on that porch and welcome people theres a western gentlemen inside me trying to get out he noticed that dunlap smiled then that was good the message from the mayor had been emphatic give this man a good impression you must find this country different coming from the east and all a little dunlap said yeah i felt that way myself at first dunlap shook his head at first i came here from detroit five years ago a little while out here and you can get to like the easy way of life which dunlap didnt buy so slaughter didnt try to sell it anymore slaughter had been just about as friendly as hed planned but he had other things to occupy him and he didnt have the time to give this man a guided tour they passed the police car rettig had brought walking toward the porch and slaughter saw that the medical examiner was up there drinking beer talking to the new man slaughter was just about to ask if dunlap wanted any beer when the medical examiner interrupted him your man here says its still down in that hollow look i want to know if that thing bit you no i thought about it and i checked slaughter said i even took my clothes off back here and the only mark is where it scratched me the scab was thick on slaughters cheek the medical examiner persisted scratched not bit you does this mark look like it bit me no im certain well i want to check that cat regardless cats dont go at people that way some cats do when i was in detroit i had my share of bites and scratches cats gone wild and living in abandoned tenements i know exactly what you mean though this is different cats might fight back but they dont come looking to attack you and the five of them were silent dunlap had been listening with interest slaughter turned to him he noticed that both rettig and the new man had been looking at him too youre right he told the medical examiner and then explained to dunlap you see weve got a situation here but its not the reason youre invited i could ask you to go in the house and have a beer but then youd think that we were hiding something from you so im going to let you stay but understand this anything about the commune thats your story what were saying now is strictly off the record slaughter waited sure i guess you have your reasons youll know soon enough slaughter turned toward the medical examiner again my handguns a i loaded magnums before going in that field i told you when i shot that cat i blew its fucking head apart im no pathologist but im aware of this much if you want to check for rabies in an animal you run some tests on portions of its brain thats correct well brain hell i can give you all the brain you want its scattered bits and pieces all across that goddamn field but theyll be so contaminated you wont have a use for them slaughter pivoted toward dunlap there ive said it now you understand if word about rabies ever gets through town therell be a panic dunlaps face was ashen thats what happened to this fellow clifford slaughter studied him you do your job ill give you that no were not sure about him weve been edging around this subject since last night he asked the medical examiner youre sure it was a dog that killed him not a cat i told you swell slaughter stared down at the porch i need a beer he looked around sure dunlap told him ill take one rettig me as well the new man and the medical examiner already had one ill just bring a cooler slaughter entered the house seven christ whats the matter with you slaughter thought trembling once the door was closed youre damn near cracking up a cat attacks you and its like you never used a gun before whats happening to you im out of practice weak and soft is more the truth that easy life you told that guy aboutyou really fell for it hell lifes so easy for you that you lose your nerve when some stray cat jumps at you no that isnt true i do my job im good at it but you know youre lying you can go through years and years of doing what you think must be your best but then you get in some real trouble and you understand that you were coasting and you didnt even know it hell i dont know why i even bother trying sure you do that emptiness inside that grocery store those two kids what they did to you you want to prove yourself and that purely was the truth he stood inside his small neat kitchen staring at two coolers filled with ice and beer and he was thinking that hed open one can right away but that would be a public show of weakness drinking before he brought out the cooler for the others maybe not in their eyes weakness but in his so he lifted one of the coolers and returned to the porch they didnt even look at him just concentrated on the cooler as he opened it the glinting ice the cans of bud they made a ritual all snapping tabs at once and raising beers as if in toast then sipping all right so what do you suggest slaughter asked the medical examiner he hoped the beer would relax him well no matter what you say i want to see that cat tell your men to keep watching for animals that act strangely ill check the hospital for anyone who comes in bitten the truth is though theres not a lot we can do until we have another incident thats if rettig hadnt spoken in some time right thats not until but if lets hope at least slaughter said dont wait for a dog or cat thats foaming at the mouth a symptom like that shows up late the medical examiner said what were looking for is an attack without a reason totally irrational aggression something clicked in slaughters mind thats funny what you said the same about those dogs up in the hills and everyone became silent too much so slaughter realized it wasnt only them but everything around them sure the men had stopped shooting they were walking past the barn now laughing holstering their weapons as they joked among themselves and came near rubbing their hands together as they stepped up for a beer who died one of them asked noticing how somber everyone was weve got a little problem did you pick up the empty cartridges they nodded good when you get a chance reload them we might need them and they paused where they were reaching for the beer i have to check the horses slaughter said lets take a walk ill tell you all about it he stepped from the porch there isnt much to tell he heard behind him and saw where rettig had moved back a little talking now with dunlap rettig evidently noticed how slaughter looked at him youre sure its all right if i talk to him about what happened at the commune hell i dont care youre getting jumpy slaughter told himself and walked with the other men to reach the horses eight rettig watched them go then again faced dunlap really theres not much more to tell despite permission to discuss this he was nonetheless reluctant he still remembered the secrecy with which the case had been conducted there had been such trouble in the town such bad publicity that summer that the council had arranged for secret sessions to discuss this new development parsons had been mayor then as he still was and the general agreement had been to keep news about the murder quiet otherwise those hippies might come back and those reporters and the trouble might begin again the trial had been delicate the matter kept within the valley with some understanding from the nearby towns beyond the mountains and the valley had gone back to being normal even though the state police had jurisdiction in the case and they were separate from the town they had nonetheless cooperated with the town realizing that the valley was related to the town and rettig in particular had been warned to keep his mouth shut oh nobody ever said that quite so forcefully but the implication had been clear and he was very careful it was twentythree years now since hed thought about the case but he remembered the way things had been back then and it was hard for him to break his habit really not too much you figured most of it already but the son what happened to the son dunlap took his coat off setting it across a chair on the porch he was fine i went up with another man and searched the compound the rest of the men stayed back to get the hippies version of what had happened wheeler had cracked up by then and they were helping him into a cruiser we went and tell me what it looked like oh not much id heard too many rumors and the place seemed ordinary by comparison just rows of barracks lined up to form streets like in the army but more like migrant workcamps like in the depression pathetic really there were gardens by each bunkhouse dying flowers in them but the flowers never really had a chance up there all that shade the thin air and the lousy ground the worst part was the fields theyd tried to plant with corn and beans tomatoes stuff like that theyd put the seed in too late and a farm crop never does well even down here in the valley so i cant imagine why they thought that corn would do well in the mountains it was awful all these little stumps of corn that never quite developed little ears on them all browned by the early frosts they had a mess hall i remember that crude log tables in there and they had a kind of officers command post with a sort of square in front where people must have stood to get their orders but it was obvious that things werent going well up there and i couldnt help wondering what they were going to do when winter hit oh yeah we found another building that was like a big garage the corvette what the red corvette the classic that quiller drove you found it i remember hearing about that no we never found it oh we found a van and then a pickup truck but that was all no red corvette believe me id remember it christ what the hell is going on rettig stared at him ive done some checking dunlap said and as far as i can tell quiller never sold it but i know he took it up there what in gods name did he do with it youve got me rettig said all im telling you is what i saw if id been looking for that car i might have found it but i had my mind on searching for the boy you found him in a while it took us quite while we checked the buildings and the forest if i hadnt stopped to take a leak i maybe never would have found him even then but i went over by an outhouse and i found him in a trench he sure was dirty i remember that and scared although he never said what happened to him in the compound mostly he was scared about his father even when we brought the boy down to the cruisers he refused to get in with his father we were forced to drive them separately and what did quiller have to say excuse me quiller rettig shrugged nobody ever saw him what you searched the compound and you never saw him no one did well where could he have hidden why would he have hidden in the first place dont ask me he might have been out in the forest i dont see the difference it makes no i dont either dunlap told him frowning but theres something strange about all this and i wish i understood it are you getting what you wanted a voice interrupted dunlap turned to where slaughter stood beside the porch his deputies with him after they had come back from the horses mostly dunlap said there are still a few loose ends well tie them up we want you satisfied you bastard dunlap thought putting on this country show for me youre ten times more sophisticated than you pretend he glanced at rettig so what about the trial i never read the end of it oh wheeler was convicted rettig said dunlap nodded sure the coverup was just to keep the town safe from another bunch of hippies coming through if wheeler had been freed and word had gotten out there really would have been some trouble then the town had done the wisest thing his lawyer tried to plead insanity but people here dont understand that sort of thing rettig said the charge was manslaughter extenuating circumstances and the son was such a prick when he was on the stand clearly out to get his father that the jury sympathized with wheeler recommending that the judge go easy two years was the sentence and the day the trial was over wheelers son got out of here the town police had kept a watch on him to make sure he didnt leave before then also to protect him there were plenty of ugly feelings toward him people angered by the painful choices he had caused and he just packed his gear and left some people figured that he went back to the compound but i always doubted that once his father was released the father surely would go looking for him again the kid was scared enough that he would want to run much farther than the compound he would want to put a lot of miles between him and his father slaughter stepped up on the porch all that happened here i take it back about country life being easy he stooped to pick up another beer then restrained his impulse look i think wed better break this up if weve got the trouble i think we have we should all be on duty grab that phone he told the new man it was ringing inside and as the new man went in slaughter faced the rest of his men you know what to do he told the medical examiner ill go with you to get the cat i shot then he told dunlap how else can i help you well id like to see the compound talk to wheeler i dont understand what youre looking for but you can see the problems ive got ill make a deal you let me have today and ill go out with you tomorrow can somebody drive me back to town dunlap asked id like to examine the records in your office youre pushing slaughter thought you know i dont have time to watch you he was just about to answer when the new man appeared in the doorway thats the state police the new man said and slaughter felt his apprehension intensify his mind seemed to tilt and he knew that normalcy was on the other side now did you phone them yesterday about a rancher named bodine the new man continued thats right damn it tell me what they want well the ranch is still deserted not only that but when slaughter heard the rest of it he murmured jesus and rushed in toward the telephone nine the helicopter circled high above the foothills it was just a speck up there and slaughter barely heard it as he sped across the bumpy rangeland squinting upward then glancing straight ahead to make sure he didnt hit a rock or a clump of sagebrush or a gulch he wouldnt see until he was almost on it he glanced to the left as well worried by the wide deep drywash over there and hoped that hed made the proper choice when he drove down along this side instead of heading across the bridge back near the ranch and moving down along the opposite side he was aiming toward the helicopter closer to it closer to the drywash too and worried that hed have to stop the cruiser soon to cross the gully on foot and walk the rest of the way he didnt have to one bend in the wash and then it straightened almost in a line up toward the helicopter high above the foothills he was taking chances speeding faster arent you worried that youll break an axle dunlap asked beside him not in this car its designed to go through anything i made sure we got the best slaughter concentrated on the bumpy terrain bringing dunlap with him was something he regretted but he hadnt wanted dunlap going through his files when he wasnt around and certainly he hadnt wanted dunlap asking people questions about what was happening in townthat would surely start the panic slaughter wanted to avoidand so hed made a quick decision taking dunlap with him slaughter told himself that there was no place where dunlap would be harmless at least this way the man would be in sight but slaughter wasnt confident of all the weekends for a reporter to arrive he thought and he was speeding faster toward the helicopter high above the foothills what about that cow the medical examiner mentioned dunlap asked the steer i beg your pardon out here they call beef cattle steers i didnt know its all right i called them cows too many times myself it takes a while to get adjusted maybe ive changed the subject slaughter hoped the night before hed told the medical examiner to check the steer that had been found next to old doc markles corpse but it turned out that someone at the veterinary clinic had mistakenly had the carcass incinerated slaughter had been furious wasnt anything about this trouble going to work out easily but what about the steer dunlap asked so the subject hadnt been changed after all a different problem slaughter told him something got a steer two nights ago we dont know what did it the steer was sam bodines and how did you know that slaughter thought yes thats right bodines so then this problem isnt really different from the other the helicopter now was lower as the foothills loomed before them slaughter had to look away the helicopter in a straight line with the blazing sun and then he saw the statepolice cars where the rangeland ended at the bottom of the thickly wooded slope he drove as far as he was able stopping by the other cars his bumper up against some sagebrush and he scrambled out putting on his hat holding it as dust was swirled up by the helicopter coming down he looked around puzzled wondering where everybody from the cruisers had gone the helicopters roar was deafening so he didnt hear them coming through the trees abruptly they emerged from the underbrush altick and three men he hadnt seen before they all belonged to the state police but altick was the ranking officer a captain so slaughter focused his attention on him one thing about altick he was good at what he did so good that no one ever made jokes about his unflattering mustache hed been forced to grow it after he had tried to stop a knife fight and had nearly lost his lip when two drunken cowboys turned on him the scar was partly visible beneath the sandy bristles he had his hat off wiping at the sweat across his forehead then he put it back on stepping down toward slaughter on a level with him now and just about as tall they tried to talk but couldnt hear and turned to watch the helicopter set down rotors slowing engine dying nobody told me youd be in on this slaughter said well bodine was a friend alticks voice was raspy thats why we got on this so fast i knew the forestry department had its helicopter out this way the lands so dry theyre checking for fires so i asked them to look for bodines truck the phone call said theyd found it altick pointed toward the trees hed come through motioning for slaughter to follow they hiked up through the underbrush and stopped where the ground eased onto a level before sloping sharply upward again there were fir trees boulders and a small streambed that wound down the slope the pickup truck was before them its blue paint scratched from the trees it had squeezed past one wheel in a sinkhole both doors open covered with dust the helicopter pilot joined them i almost didnt find it i was looking for it out on the range what made you even think to look here slaughter turned to altick just a guess altick said i thought that sam had maybe taken his family on a trip that appaloosa mare of his though its won half a dozen trophies no one came around to feed it so i knew something had happened to him i checked all the traffic accident reports when nothing turned up there i figured he was out on the range in some trouble and wed better take a look this pilot is something he wasnt out here half the morning before finding this slaughter walked toward the pickup truck he circled it then glanced at where the streambed angled toward the flatland looks like sam was in a hurry he chose the only route that he could follow rammed up the streambed until he couldnt go much farther then jumped out and ran not just him slaughter squinted at altick both doors are open dont forget altick said we havent touched a thing sam and someone else its my guess his wife and son were with him otherwise where are they slaughter slumped against the truck the shade in here was welcome cooling him he tried to think it could be nothings wrong maybe he just drove up for the hell of it the truck got stuck but they were going camping something like that so he left it until hed come back then he planned to get help to move the truck why would he leave the doors open i have no idea theres something else altick pointed up past slaughter when slaughter turned he saw a patch of brown and red among the fir trees his apprehension increased as he straightened and breathed and walked up toward it he heard someone likely altick walking behind him but he didnt look in that direction he only stopped and kept on staring sure he thought the freshly mangled carcass of a steer its mutilated guts protruding flies swarming over them what else did you think it would be he felt dizzy when we started searching we also found this altick said the fifth one weve had news about today slaughter leaned his head against a tree better make that six what bodine found one like this thursday but we only learned about it friday morning jesus thats not all slaughter said weve had some animal attacks in town a mans been killed at first we figured it was wild dogs from the hills but now were worried about rabies altick paled thats right now you feel the way i do slaughter told him weve got trouble he pointed toward the mountains whats up there nothing wilderness the forestry department lists this as a recreation area altick suddenly understood rabies christ what if people are camping up there slaughters forehead throbbed lets assume wild dogs are what did this bodine saw them on the range he chased them into these foothills id better get the helicopter looking for them altick turned scrambling down the hillside followed by the pilot and for anybody else up there check the lakes the likely camping spots slaughter hurried after altick look i know this is your jurisdiction but wed better work together on this leave a man to watch the carcass and the pickup truck get some other men out here with rifles have them search the hills as far as they can go today they reached the bottom altick turning toward him and for just a moment slaughter thought that altick would be angry that altick would tell him not to interfere to keep his opinions to himself but altick only nodded saying ill go you one better dogs well get some bloodhounds out here well pick up bodines trail ten warren she heard him screaming and ran from the living room to the kitchen staring out the screen door she saw him racing through the backyard toward her warren he was clutching his hand she saw the blood the mangled flesh and she was pushing at the screen door rushing out to meet him he kept screaming warren tell me what it is that happened she was holding him the blood across her sleeve now she could feel his frantic tears drop off his cheek to wet her blouse he just kept screaming warren please youve got to its the glass but broken glass youve got to show me warren she stared at him at the blood she wasnt certain what to do she knew she had to stop the blood but what had caused it how bad was the cut she tried to lead him show me warren he pointed toward the backyard she squinted past the backyard toward the metal barrel in the old mans yard across the lane she saw the blood across the rim and she was running oh my god the blood covered everything the rusty cans the broken glass the ashes from the garbage fires that the old man used to set before the town denied him permission warren must have climbed up on this cinder block and reached in there for something but he lost his balance and he cut himself she swung around warren was clutching his hand running toward the back door and she called to him but he was in the house already she scrambled toward him across the lane and past the bushes the back door getting larger as she reached it fumbling at the handle charging in she saw the blood across the floor and she was racing down the hallway toward the bathroom but he wasnt in there where she doubled back he sat in his bedroom crying blood across the sheets she hurried to grab him wrapping a sheet around his hand and guiding him into the bathroom no i have to wash it i have to see how bad it is dont touch it warren kept crying as she freed the bloody sheet and pushed his hand down into the sink she turned the tap on he wailed again too hot she turned the other tap and now the water felt lukewarm and she was brushing at the bleeding flesh she saw the wound but blood kept oozing out and she was brushing at it freeing all the dirt and black clots and lord the hand was mangled deep and wide and jagged oh my baby she was thinking as she felt his weight against him and she knew before she looked that he had fainted eleven warren smelled something strange something like the powder that his mother put inside the washer when she did the clothes his eyes fluttered he winced from the light all around him and he saw the strange man in the white coat leaning close he started wailing warren its all right his mothers voice his father close beside her they looked angry mommy i its all right warren please dont be afraid youre with a doctor back now to the man his white coat flecked with red spots down his arm the man was holding something like a plastic pill that he had broken open and the strange smell seemed to come from it warren kept on crying this man was much younger thinner than the doctor he always went to and the freckles on his face looked like the blood specks on the white coat and warren couldnt stop from crying ssshhh its all right son were here now youre just fine then warren slowly understood that they had him on a table that his hand felt numb and awkward he was raising it the hand was like a white club bandaged so he couldnt even see or move his fingers hes still suffering from shock hell take a while to get adjusted he heard the doctor saying someone dried his eyes his mother she was smiling so she wasnt angry after all warren can you tell us how it happened he turned toward the doctor trying to remember what the plan was yes the glass he told them slowly in the barrel yes i cut myself his father clenched his fist im going to sue that old man harry please not here his mother said so i got away with it warren thought warren let me tell you what i did for you the doctor said you have to make sure you keep the bandage on i sewed you up i gave you stitches do you understand that yes like mommy when she makes a dress they smiled a little something like that the doctor said you were cut too deeply to let the wound heal on its own i took some string like this except it wasnt string its more like what we used to call a piece of catgut and i sewed the cut together will the string stay in there no a week or so from now ill take the stitches out and youll be like before although youll maybe have a scar the doctor said but youve got a lot of growing to do and most of the scar will disappear what youve got to understand is that you cant put much weight on your hand if you try to pick up heavy things or make a fist or anything like that youll risk the chance of pulling out the stitches too soon take things easy let your mother or your father do the lifting for you will they make my bed for me you bet we will his father said and ill still pay your full allowance warren grinned then yes hed gotten away with it and he was wiping at his tears trying to sit up here let me help you his mother held him hes going to be all right i think the doctor said take him home here are pills for when the local anesthetic wears off call me if theres any trouble but i think that all youll have to do is bring him in a week from monday what about the bandage change it every night the first few times you ought to soak the bandage before its removed i dont want any dried blood tearing at those stitches dressing anything you have around the house firstaid cream is fine i gave him an antitetanus injection i dont see any problems coming up thank you im just pleased that you got him here so quickly he was bleeding quite a lot more talk but warren didnt listen he looked around the room at the cabinets and shiny metal objects and abruptly he was dizzy he almost toppled off the table here young man i think wed better get you home despite an itching burning pain along his hand warren couldnt stop from feeling happy he had gotten away with it all night long hed tried to figure how to hide the bite his hand had swollen so much that it scared him at breakfast time his mother had come in to wake him but hed snuggled in the sheets as if he wanted to keep sleeping he had stayed there until he knew that she would surely come to wake him so hed listened until he heard her in the living room and he had managed then to dress himself the pain had been so bad that he shook he had slipped and smeared some blood across his sleeve but he had figured what to do by that time and hed snuck outside to reach the barrel over there the worst part had been leaning in to let some blood drip onto the glass when he had pulled the bloody rag off he had seen the swollen throbbing ugly cut caked with dirty blood hed shivered reaching down to touch his hand against a broken bottle that had been his plan at least but he had lost his balance and the cut had burst not from the glass but from the pressure he had never felt such shrieking pain he couldnt stop his screaming twelve okay then sure why not and slaughter turned up onto the loggers road ive heard so much about this place i guess its time i had a look myself he hadnt planned to do this until tomorrow but he didnt like the thought of dunlaps staying any longer than was necessary it was fine for parsons to instruct him to be friendly give him all the help he needs parsons had been clear on that but parsons didnt have to babysit this man parsons didnt know about the trouble that was going on there wasnt much that slaughter had to do in town regardless he could sit and wait for calls to come in on the police stations twoway radio or he could drive out troubleshooting on the streets but hell the compound wasnt even ten miles down the road from bodines place halfway from the ranch to town and he was out here going past it he might just as well drive up and get this nuisance finished slaughter saw the road and made his choice and this would help take dunlaps mind away from what was happening in town slaughter knew the turnoff although as he had said hed never taken time to go up it there had never been a need to never been an interest back in the sixties hed seen freaks enough to last a lifetime they could smoke dope up here until they couldnt tell their ass from grass for all he cared he angled up the loggers road if road was what it could still be called no one had come up here for some time there were bushes in the ruts pine needles fallen leaves young trees growing in the mound between the ruts and branches dipping down from all the large trees on each side the place was shadowy cool yet strangely humid slaughter suddenly was worried that if he got stuck he wouldnt have the room to turn around that backing down would be a problem given all the ruts and bends and several times he had to squeeze around some young trees that he couldnt just drive over narrowly avoiding large trees at the side he wished he hadnt been impulsive hell i need a jeep to get up in here whyd i do this but he had no choice now and he eased his foot off the gas pedal slowing bumping working up this godforsaken lane to nowhere what kind of place is this to build a commune anyhow i asked myself that several times dunlap said slaughter glanced at him not too happy where they sent you huh ive had a little trouble but im working on it this is what youd call my penance i can see that from the way your hands are shaking its a bumpy ride but wouldnt a beer go good now dunlap stared at him i said im working on it hey i dont mean to rile you im just making conversation dunlaps stern gaze weakened all right i apologize its my fault i was mixing in your business but the fact is youre right i shouldnt be so jumpy when somebody says the truth you really like it here love it i find that baffling its simple back east in detroit things got out of hand i got so i couldnt keep control my wife divorced me i was fed up with my work you were a cop thats right and finally i simply quit i didnt know what else to do i couldnt keep doing what i had however so i spread a map out on my kitchen table and i asked myself where id rather be and you chose here dunlap looked incredulous sure because id never been here i was having daydreams mountains horses running free id never really seen those things never been around them what they represented were the things i wanted though i knew that much so i came here just like that i left the next day and i loved it oh i had some hard times at the start i tried my hand at raising horses but i made a mess of it the next thing i was in police work again but i was talking earlier about control and thats the point my life here is exactly what i want to make of it things arent so complicated that i have to give in to them i have freedom slaughter looked ahead and eased the cruiser past a clump of bushes he didnt see the pothole just beyond them and felt the cruiser jolt down into it now its me im being personal about id better watch it dunlap rubbed his forehead i think ill soon be divorced as well who wants it her or you oh shes the one wholl do it i suppose is that why you drink so much its that obvious is it no i started drinking long before it could be i caused the problem with her but you know a person has ambitions in his work he wants to prove how really good he is and i just never lived up to my expectations or you maybe liked the booze so much that it distracted you dunlap shrugged the chicken or the egg what difference does it make i ended here no matter how it happened i know where it got me nowhere nothing personal well why not just give in then maybe settle in a place like this dunlap started laughing no i mean it slaughter told him things could be a whole lot worse sometimes we end up exactly where we should be or deserve to be slaughter gave up trying to convince him they were all idealists dunlap said who what are you talking about quiller and the others up here dunlap said they truly thought that if they left the world and went up in here they could live the kind of life theyd always wanted they were fools its worked out fine for me i wonder how it all worked out for them however dunlap said this quiller do you know about him just from talk i pick up now and then well he was evidently something six foot eight thin beyond grotesqueness and that maybe helped him newsmen who were near him said he wasnt real you know as if they couldnt quite believe that he was there its like he radiated something holy charismatic like the best of that type and those newsmen saw the best believe me if this way of life had any chance quiller was the man to do it he was rich i hear an understatement and that money would have helped as well they squeezed up past a fallen pine tree its needles were dead dried and scattered across the road the branches skeletal and slaughter looked up past them toward a wall of vines and bushes slats of brown that showed through and he knew that they were almost there he slowed around a curve and before he even stopped the cruiser said to dunlap see if you can budge that gate but dunlap only stared ahead i said im going dunlap stepped from the cruiser first he viewed the wall of vines from several angles took several photographs then he left the camera in the cruiser and he walked up to the weedshrouded gate slaughter watched him through the windshield with the filtered sun the frame around his windshield slaughter sensed that dunlap was much farther than he really was sitting here the motor idling slaughter was abruptly conscious that there werent any other sounds around him in the forest sure the noise we made has frightened everything away he guessed he watched as dunlap stopped and looked at all the vines and weeds that wound around the gate posts dunlap reached out then he brought his hand back poison ivy dunlap called slaughter laughed a city boy no i dont know exactly what they are but theyre not poison ivy dunlap nodded then he turned back to the vines and almost touched them before looking at him again youre sure for christ sake never mind ill do it dunlap tugged some vines away he did it cautiously at first and then he used more strength against them he was pushing at the gate well maybe have to clear the whole bunch slaughter leaned out saying more than that well have to break the lock here what a rusted chain and lock tug at it the chain might be so old youll break it thats what ive been doing hell i thought that was more weeds youd better have a look slaughter thought about all the time they were wasting thought about the town and shut the motor off he stepped from the cruiser walking toward the gate i should have known theyd have fixed the gate once wheeler drove up through it dunlap said slaughter didnt understand the reference ill tell you later but they fixed it all right christ they really did just look at those thick timbers theyd stop any pickup truck the two men stood in the shadowy cool yet humid forest that was close around them grass and fallen pine tree needles underfoot and they were silent for a moment here let me try it slaughter said he put his full weight against the gate and pushed but nothing happened oh a little creaking in the wood and some slight movement as the chain went taut but nothing else and slaughter felt the awkward pressure in his shoulder stepping back and rubbing at it what about the hinges he asked but although rusted they were large and solid and the screws were sturdy in the timber well that does it slaughter said you dont mean were leaving no i came up this far and i dont intend to waste time coming back were going to have to climb the fence and walk they looked at one another wait a second while i get my camera dunlap went down to the cruiser for it when he came back slaughter waved for him to climb up first and dunlap put his shoe on one thick timber grabbing at another timber easing over slaughter climbed up just behind him and they stepped down into the compound on the edge of quillers fifty acres something wrong slaughter asked no im just shaky dunlap answered you were right i need a drink well youll be done with this before you know it they walked along the next part of the loggers road which was as overgrown as the first part slaughter heard a noise in the bushes and turned but there was nothing he could see he kept walking are there any people up here yet slaughter wondered i meant to ask you that myself parsons says there might be two or three oh swell some commune in its day it was dunlap said i read that quiller started with a couple thousand then he cut them down to just five hundred even so if only two or three are up here yes it isnt hard to measure quillers failure whats the point then i dont see your story thats the story how it failed and more important why well you must know your business they kept walking once again slaughter heard a noise behind them he turned but there was nothing now whos jumpy dunlap asked him slaughter had to laugh then but the laughter echoed through the forest and he quickly stopped the loggers road disappeared a hundred feet ahead of them or could be that the forest just reclaimed it slaughter said they reached the dead end of the lane and glanced at the maze of trees around them what now slaughter asked well the road was going straight up and the clearing i suppose was somewhere near it lets just keep on through these trees we could end up walking in a circle well have to pay attention to our landmarks that big boulder up ahead slaughter thought and then that line of cliffs below the ridge they veered through the pine trees the needles lancing at them dunlap stumbled falling on his camera and he groped up clutching at his chest staring at the camera that was dangling from his shoulder is it broken slaughter asked dunlap didnt know he hurriedly checked the camera but it seemed intact and hed made certain that he kept the lens cap on i dont see any damage what about yourself oh just the wind knocked out of me it could be worse you want to try to walk dunlap nodded bent a little forward limping slightly he pushed farther through the trees the forest now was thicker darker dead trees fallen among the live ones intersecting thick vines growing up around them dunlap stopped and took deep breaths there has to be a better way they brought their cars and vans up here but its sure as hell they didnt bring them this way maybe we should go back to the loggers road and angle right or left slaughter suggested and maybe lose our way as you just said i wish i knew well lets keep going then if this gets much worse well have to change direction so they pushed up through the pine trees and the clearing wasnt fifteen steps away the trees so dense they didnt see it until they stepped free from the forest there were stumps that stretched off through young forest all the growth here up to slaughters chest so that he looked out past the new tips of the pine trees toward the compound over there slaughter was reminded of a camping trip years ago hed gone with his father to a small lake in northern michigan theyd pitched their tent and eaten so exhausted that they soon had gone to sleep rain pelting onto the canvas had wakened them and they had talked and dozed and wakened again as the storm got worse and in the morning when the storm was finished they had crawled out from the tent to stare across the lake a billowing mist hung over it but they were camped up high enough that they were just above the mist the pine trees visible along the other bank and slaughter now remembered how hed thought about what he couldnt see below the mistthe fish that would be rising and the ducks and frogs and other things it wasnt real that thought again like now that sense of life around him but unseen except the compound was deserted they started through the new growth toward the compound dunlap took a photograph hope the camera works they continued walking sure dunlap said they used the timber here to build the barracks he thought that rettig had been accurate with the difference that the walls were like log cabins dunlap was reminded of a deserted army camp lanes and squares a parade ground everything was here no not exactly everything he didnt see a flagpole hell this kind of culture theyd have called it a maypole the compound loomed as they approached it wide the buildings all one story and with slanted roofs at least the hippies knew enough to compensate for deep snow on the roofs in winter slaughter thought and then he paused as dunlap took another picture watch these branches on the ground here slaughter told him we dont want another accident dunlap nodded staring toward the compound as they walked around the branches coming toward the nearest buildings there were weeds and bushes young trees growing in the lanes and vines enmeshed around the shutters there were broken windows doors half off their hinges and the slogans on the walls the symbols daygloed green and red and blue now faded flowers flags with rifles for the stripes and bullets for the stars a skull and crossbones and a down with nixon the down with slashed out then to hell with scrawled above it that too slashed a simple fuck above it vietnam will claim our children skeletons across a pentagon sure they took the time to do all that but they didnt even think to treat the logs for insects slaughter said and pointed there were tiny holes in all the logs and down below the holes thick piles of what seemed sawdust dirty flecked with dead leaves from the vines dunlap took more photographs as they reached the buildings slaughter had the odd sensation that hed been here before is anybody around and then he knew what he was thinking of sure bodines ranch when yesterday hed gone there and hed heard the kettle you look in this building ill check the others dunlap said and slaughter stopped him no wed better stay together whats the matter dunlap asked lets just say ive got a bad feeling anybody here he called again he waited but no answer no ones been here for quite a while dunlap said they stepped inside one building there were bunk beds wooden slats instead of springs no mattresses but many spiders cobwebs leaves piled in one corner as a nest for something the floordecaying plankslooked unsafe lets try a little farther on slaughter said but almost every building was the same slaughter glanced around to notice how the compound had been situated in a canyon cliffs beyond the trees on three sides and the slope behind them descending toward the loggers road a wind came from below there rustling trees and cooling him he took his hat off then his back felt unprotected and he looked behind him well they picked a good spot anyhow except they would have needed water and i dont know where they got it higher up those cliffs might have some streams could be but i dont have time to look that made his point slaughter hoped he didnt have time he hadnt thought it would take this long getting up here while he felt more sympathetic toward dunlap all the same he had his job to do and he was anxious to get out of here because youre thinking of bodine he asked himself that feeling you had yesterday youre scared you might as well admit it no because i have to get back if theres trouble sure and now he followed dunlap past some bushes toward a larger building its door had toppled the steps were rotted they looked past the spider webs at what must once have been the dining room rettig had been accurate again logs made into trestles tables that went down the whole length of the room a bird sat in a glassless window staring at them slaughter blinked the bird flew away and slaughter felt that spot between his shoulder blades again he turned but there was no one out there are they hiding little children laughing dunlap asked what the hell is that its from a poem ts eliot i know who he is thats not what i meant and slaughter started running toward the small low building in front of the parade ground i saw something moving he ran harder glancing at the buildings on each side staring toward the trees beyond them and he had his gun out lunging past the listing door finding just a table spider webs and dirt more pine needles but there wasnt any back door and he didnt understand what hed seen moving then he did the wind blew toward him and he saw the thick rotted curtain moving a blanket really torn in half and hung up on a branch before a broken window he was nauseated by the smell that hed been registering all along must and crumbling wood the fetid sicksweet smell of buildings left to ruin then he saw the hornets nest in the far right corner something moved inside its portal and he stepped out into the open dunlap where was dunlap over here now he reads my mind slaughter thought as he ran toward the muffled voice inside another building the emotion in dunlaps voice worried him this building didnt have planks for a floor only dirt there werent any windows two big doors hung open dunlap stood in a shadowy corner staring at dark stains on the ground thats blood slaughter asked dunlap only shook his head well what then christ you scared me did i well i didnt mean to no dunlap picked up the dirt and sniffed it slaughter suddenly was angry tell me what that stuff is even after all these years you can still smell the oil this is where the corvette would have been except it isnt where then dunlap wondered look theres no one up here quiller drove out years ago he maybe let the others walk but he kept the car in case he needed it to leave i hate to say it but i think youre right and now my goddamned job is almost over you can still track quiller no its finished ill be out of here by monday after i talk to wheeler and see your records and visit parsons slaughter told him right i havent let that slip my mind twentythree years you really thought that theyd still be here well i had my hopes i needed some big story to impress them in new york dunlaps face was blank youre luckier than you imagine well i made my own luck dunlap took a breath and nodded maybe he said maybe after this ill have to spread out my own map he looked all around the new republic he snorted its not all that failed he started past the sagging doors and slaughter thought about the town as he went after him the sun was descending the wind had died the compound felt lonelier than ever well wed better reach the car before the woods get too dark to see landmarks slaughter thought lets get a drink dunlap said and they walked along the lane between the ruined barracks part three the mansion one it sniffed at the shoe mud and dampness and it choked it scurried back and settled on its haunches puzzled by the odd sensation in its throat then the choking spasm passed and it was staring at the shoe it waited almost sniffed the shoe again then made its choice and scuttled toward the pile of clothing in one corner blue and stiff yet muddy damp just like the shoe and once again it felt that sharp constriction in its throatwhich made it angry and it cuffed at the clothing then it snarled over to one side another kind of shoe this one dark and scuffed light spots showing through the surface a faint odor partly sweat and partly from the animal the hide had once belonged to it was sniffing closer then it bit the leather and it shook its head the shoe flopping one way then another but the clothes that hung down brushed against its head and that annoyed it so it pawed up at the clothing snagged a pocket pulling and some clothes dropped down upon it smothered frightened it fumbled to get out from under snarling pawing and the clothes dropped free then it smelled soap and chemicals and it was growling as it bit hard into the cloth and held the garment tearing it heard noises coming down the hallway out there it turned staring but the door was closed the noises stopped it went back to the garment snarling tearing something raided it swung toward the door the handle moved it stiffened garment hanging from its teeth the handle kept moving then the door came open and she stepped in dropping the garment from its mouth it bared its teeth and snarled at her she breathed in sharply warren and it sprang at her she stumbled back her elbow hit the door the door swung shut behind her and she fell against the doorjamb fumbling with the handle as it sprang at her again she scrambled toward the dresser to avoid it warren but it only snarled and kept coming warren she kicked at it throwing pictures off the dresser dodging toward the bed climbing screaming when it leaped the final time it caught her not quite balanced on the bed so that they both went crashing off the other side her back slamming hard on the floor as it came clawing at her throat she screamed and hit at it she struck it on the nose the throat it felt the blood pour over its lips a salt taste in its mouth and gagged it pawed to clear the salt taste angered by the gagging slashed its teeth down toward her face but in that moments hesitation she had gripped the table near the bed and scrambled from the floor to kick at it the shoe came toward its face but there was time to dodge and now it sank its teeth hard into her leg she wailed and kicked to free the leg but it was growling biting and it felt the blood spurt into its mouth that same salt taste it gagged again as shouting she twisted her leg and jerked free something hard smashed against its shoulder glass and a lampshade falling past the pain surged through its shoulder whining it was stunned then she wasnt before it any longer she was stumbling past it toward the door and it was turning snarling leaping as she reached the door and grabbed the handle pulling squeezing out to reach the hallway slamming the door it banged against the door and clawed to move the handle she was out there screaming but the handle wouldnt move it heard her out there screaming and it dimly understood that she was gripping at the handle pulling at the door it knew that there was no way to reach her more than that it understood the danger others would be coming they would trap it have to get away it swung to find an exit saw the open window the screen then the porch and the open air and it was charging forward leaping slamming at the screen the mesh pressed cutting at its face the screen gave way and it was falling through the porch rising up to meet it darkness pain it shook its head the salt taste flooding its mouth then it could see again and spitting gagging it vaulted across the railing toward the bushes warren it heard someone screaming two slaughter heard as he came driving toward the outskirts he reached for the microphone ive got it marge he switched on the siren and the emergency flasher staring now at dunlap well that drink will have to wait he pressed hard on the gas pedal racing past the houses swerving onto a sidestreet people staring as the siren wailed and he was concentrating on the street that stretched before him five oclock the forest had become increasingly dark as they hiked down through it toward the cruiser the sun had been low toward the mountains and the dusk among the trees had lengthened theyd almost lost their way but then slaughter had noticed the big boulder that hed chosen as a landmark it was farther to the left than he had figured and theyd cut across then found the loggers road and worked along it to the gate hed heard that skittering noise again but hadnt paid attention just had wanted to get over to the cruiser and hed slowly backed the cruiser dunlap outside watching to make sure the rear wheels didnt jolt down into a sinkhole soon hed swung the cruiser so the front was facing downward dunlap got in and theyd bumped across the saplings and bushes down the road to reach the highway even so the fading light made driving harder and slaughters eyes were strained as he finally moved out from the trees to cross the rangeland all he wanted was a drink and then some supper thinking he would check in at the station first but now he wouldnt have the chance staring at dunlap who was fumbling with his camera both hands shaking his tongue persistent at his lips you ought to have a bottle with you for emergencies i left a pint back in my room i figured id be brave well i cant take the time to drop you off hell i wouldnt want you to slaughter squealed around a corner swerving just in time to miss a young boy in a wagon thinking sure if youre not careful youll hit one kid rushing to find out about another slow down theres no point in racing if you never get there but he couldnt force himself to slow he strained to watch for people stepping from a corner or from cars parked on the side he roared through an intersection one car coming at him from the other way then swung around another corner as he saw the people up there and the cars along the street and one tall woman standing crying other women grouped around her as everyone turned toward the cruiser slaughter reached down to flick off the siren and the flasher other people were crossing toward the house and at last he was forced to slow he stopped by a car before the house doubleparking switching off the engine reaching for his hat a plumbers truck was coming toward him it stopped as he slipped out from the cruiser walking toward the lawn he glanced toward the truck and saw a tall man jump out running toward the group of women and he guessed that this was the husband as they both came to the women at the same moment pushing through slaughter vaguely had the sense of dunlap just behind him he didnt want dunlap learning too much but he couldnt take the time to send him to the cruiser the woman clung to her husband peg what happened he attacked me who and that was slaughter stepping closer she kept sobbing warren did she gasped for breath and slaughter had a name at least my god what happened to your leg the husband blurted they stared at the blood that oozed down her leg and across her shoe he bit me bit her husband said im telling you i couldnt keep away from him where is he slaughter asked the window he was crawling like an animal slaughter hurried toward the house it was a singlestory with a porch along the front and down the left side he guessed that warren was the boy hed heard about when marge had called and he was thinking that hed better look in through the windows rather than go into the house and risk the chance of something coming at him he passed the aspen in the front yard and charged up the stairs the porch rumbled under him as he looked first in at the living room and seeing nothing rushed along the side another window toward the living room but he didnt look through it he stopped frowning at a broken screen that hung out from another window then he drew his guna gun against a little boyand swallowed looking in at what had been a bedroom but the place was wrecked in there and he could see the blood both on the floor inside and on the porch out here turning toward where it was on the railing just above the broken bushes at the side he stared off toward the gravel lane back there and sprinted toward the front again the woman had continued sobbing as her husband held her people stood back from them watching murmuring to each other did he break out through the bedroom window slaughter asked she nodded gasping for more breath he ran down toward that lane in back i didnt see i only heard the noise and when i looked in he was gone what in gods name made him do it i dont know yet but believe me ill do everything i can to find out i dont understand why he would bite me she sobbed uncontrollably as slaughter ran toward the cruiser picking up the microphone marge weve got a situation here that young boy had some kind of breakdown he attacked his mother now hes running loose i want everybody looking for him have you got that affirmative the same address you gave me and one thing more i want the medical examiner somebodys dead marge asked in alarm just get him theres no time to talk about it ill call back in fifteen minutes slaughter hung up the microphone he hadnt thought to ask the mother but he knew the answer even so although he had to check for certain and he slipped out from the cruiser staring at dunlap who was near him and then running toward the woman yet again she continued to cling to her husband mrs standish he had seen the name on the mailbox mrs standish look i know that this is hard for you but please i need to ask some questions she slowly turned to him this would bring the trouble into the open slaughter knew but he had to ask the question he glanced at the people near him turning so his back was to them did your son complain about an animal that maybe got too rough with him a dog that bit him or a cat anything like that they stared at him but i dont understand the woman said no bites at all the husband said we told him not to play with animals he didnt know he cut himself the woman said and slaughter looked at her what is it she was asking i dont know just tell me how he cut himself some broken glass her husband said a barrel in the lane back there slaughter felt puzzled hed been certain that the boy was bitten several weeks ago think back did anything seem strange to you this morning what he cut himself this morning why a dog bite why is that important slaughter couldnt bring himself to say it weve had trouble with those wild dogs in the hills its nothing look i need a picture of your son to help my men identify him he hoped that hed changed the subject and they looked at him and slowly nodded walking toward the house slaughter just behind them he really didnt understand now if the boy had not been bitten why had he behaved the way he did maybe what hed said to marge was true the boy just had a breakdown maybe they mistreated him maybe he fought back and ran from home the only way to know was to find the boy and as the couple went inside the house slaughter turned to frown toward the sun it was almost below the western mountains dusk would be here soon then night and how on earth theyd find the boy when it was dark he didnt know he peered in at the living room the place was absolutely clean and ordered surely anyone who kept a home so well was not the type to beat a child but hed been fooled that way back in detroit and he was wishing that his men were here so they could set out looking for the boy the husband came back with a picture blond and brightfaced blue eyes in his sunday suit the boy was much like slaughters son had been at this age and he had some trouble looking at the picture god the boy must be in terror out there slaughter couldnt show his feelings though he simply told the father thank you ill return it listen my wifes too upset to come back out and talk about this find him will you slaughter heard the sirens pivoting as two cruisers pulled up in the street well have him back i promise then he paused i think your wife should see a doctor shell be all right once she rests a little no i mean her leg a human bite its probably infected ill take care to clean it take her to a doctor slaughter told him ill check back to see about it look i have to go he stepped from the porch the photograph in his hand the policemen coming toward him this is who were looking for he said warren is his name and hes no doubt scared but stay away from him hes just a kid but he attacked his mother and i dont want any of you hurt they waited looking at the picture you two check the streets down this way you two check the other way ill take the lane in back remember dont get careless just because hes little i dont know whats happened here but something isnt right abruptly slaughter faced the people on the lawn everythings okay now well take care of things i want you all to go back to your homes but they just stood and looked at him come on lets move it slaughter approached them gesturing for them to leave and slowly they dispersed youll know soon enough how this turns out just go back to your homes he turned toward his men they were getting in their cars and he was all alone except for dunlap theres no chance to take you to your room slaughter said i was hoping there wasnt hey i know you need a story but if word of this gets out i told you therell be a panic ill be careful i assume i have your promise on that dunlap nodded looking puzzled but if the boy wasnt bitten yes i know it doesnt make much sense they got in the car at the corner slaughter steered right then right again slowing as he started up the lane hed had to make a choice here or where the lane continued to the left but this direction took them toward the house the boy had fled from and he figured that would be the place to start his search so he was staring up the lane then at the backyards and the houses on each side i cant watch for everything you check the yards on your side ill check over here hell a kid he could be anywhere just think of how the yards would look to someone small a crawl space underneath a shed a low spot in some bushes places an adult would never figure or hes maybe half a mile from here dont even think that slaughter told him he was driving past the backyard of the house now slowing even more then stopping whats the matter i just want to look at something slaughter stepped from the cruiser walking toward a metal barrel near the gravel lane what made him stop was the blood along the rim and down the barrel he studied the blood on the ground as well noticing the large drops leading toward the house he peered inside the barrel saw the rusty cans the broken glass the blood across it and the woman had been right so why then had the kid behaved the way he did he glanced around for places where the boy could hide stooped to check underneath some bushes by the shed then straightened walking to the cruiser dunlap asked him anything but slaughter only shook his head and worked the gearshift driving slowly down the lane the radio crackled chief its marge i havent found the medical examiner slaughter grabbed the microphone well keep trying stay there until you get him i need lots of help on this ive got plenty of questions they were at a side street now slaughter saw a german shepherd on a chain in one backyard the dog was lunging held back by the chain as it glared at them slaughter studied it a moment then he looked across the street toward where the lane continued far along it at the end he saw the large trees of the city park and all the places where a boy could hide not to mention all the places in the backyards of the lane he was looking both ways on the side street a cruiser went by and slaughter nodded grimly to the driver then staying to the search plan he moved across the side street and down the lane the thing is he was thinking we dont have much time until its dark and what the hell is that kid doing now he maybe just was angry at his mother what though if hes crazy how do we behave if someone traps him and the kid attacks again three the medical examiner scowled he had been a star in his profession once back in philadelphia but that had been ten years ago born and raised in potters field he had left the town to go to school a doctors son hed wanted to be like his father he had guessed that he would be a surgeon but when he had finished premed staying on at boston for his training he had found that diagnostics more than surgery attracted him his father had approved after all those specialties were quite compatible a lot of men could cut but not as many could detect a cause and a combination of both could earn considerable fees but the son had soon determined he would specialize much more than that searching out diseases not just in the living but the dead as well pathology and in particular those duties strictly relegated to a medical examiner the father had been livid but for reasons that the son had not expected granted that a medical examiner had little chance to make the money that a surgeon could but autopsies the father had shouted you should want to cure the living not dissect the dead the son had not been able to explain himself the best that he could manage was the notion that determining the cause of death could help prevent another death just like it but the argument was not convincing even to himself he sensed that there was another reason although that reason wasnt clear to him but he had made his choice and despite his fathers angry objections he had continued with his studies even when his father threatened not to pay his tuition hed persisted working parttime getting money any way he could as well as with his father he had trouble with some teachers they felt that working with the dead was selfdefeating for a doctor and they had tried to change his mind but he was adamant everyone agreed though he was good at what he did he finished in the upper tenth of all his classes and when he completed all his training he had little trouble finding work by then he and his father no longer spoke to one another he was certain he would not go back to potters field the place he chose was philadelphia and in five years he rose from simply being on the staff to acting as assistant medical examiner the hard jobs he was always given more than that he sought them out the murders that were mystifying and those deaths that no one understood those suicides that maybe had been awkward accidents he solved them all it got so other members of the staff would come to watch him do his work there were betting pools to see how long he might be stymied by a bodys puzzle homicide detectives hoped that he would be assigned to their investigations reporters interviewed him magazines did stories on him once he even had an article devoted to him in time and so his star had risen with it selfunderstanding he grew to comprehend that what attracted him were riddles from mute witnesses the pleasures of the chase oh sure if he had stayed in diagnostics hed have had his share of puzzles but the kind he worked with now were so much different so more final and detached he didnt have to bother with compassion even fear both in himself and in his patient he could be objective logical and most important uninvolved a body there before him he had this and this to learn about it he would learn these things and then this problem would be finished except for his excitement as he sensed that he was getting closer to the clue that he was looking for he never felt emotion no that wasnt true he often felt frustration but excitement and frustration were related one the polar feeling of the other and the satisfaction of his work was in his scientific method in his order in the truths that he uncovered after all it doesnt matter nothing does he often told himself what profit if you diagnose a living person and that patient dies because there isnt a way to cure him granted there were times when you could find out what was wrong with someone and stop the illness but the end was still the same if not on this occasion maybe the next time and finally the end was certain every person died there wasnt any way to stop that people just marked time he couldnt bear the thought of caring for a patient and then failing selfdefeat his father had said when he first suggested that hed like to be a medical examiner his father had been wrong though for the selfdefeat was not his study of the dead but how his father had prolonged the agony of someones living tomorrow and tomorrow life is just a sequence of small losses all those phrases now occurred to him but back then he had not been wise enough to understand them to call them up against his father it was just a matter of ones viewpoint life was either good or else it wasnt in the long run did it matter if you saved a man from this disease and spared him for another the final truth was what he studied on the table something else a corollary he would never have the strength to watch a patient die he didnt have the courage he was fearful of mistakes and even if he made none he was fearful of the look in someones eyes should he be forced to pronounce a death sentence he could never tolerate responsibilities of ultimate consequence certainly he had responsibilities in this profession but if he failed what difference did it make a murderer would walk the streets a suicide would never be detected but he couldnt change what they had done he couldnt replay time and alter things the pain of what they did was past he hadnt been connected with it the medical examiner was not so unaware that he didnt realize the causes for his attitude his mother for example who had died when he was very young but not so young that he didnt remember how her body tortured her lung cancer and hed seen his father helpless to preserve her yes his father the physician who was powerless when it most counted each day watching as she wasted no although he himself had long since learned to mute the power of that memory he had not forgotten she had been the only person close to him whod ever died and filled him with grief he didnt know why that should be how his mother had made so strong a mark on him perhaps because he loved her and that startled him because he knew a childs love had little substance so he told himself but if hed really loved her she had been the only one he ever loved for sure he didnt love his father new thought could it be that he had set out insecure to imitate his father and then facing up to how he felt about the man he had determined to annoy him selfdefeat his father maybe had been right it could be that he himself had ruined his own chance to have a lucrative career just to get back at his father but he knew that wasnt true hed chosen this job because he liked it the pleasure of practicing medicine without the obligations his mind worked best without the setbacks of emotion so his talents made him famous but his life became a muddle he could not commit himself to anyone he had no use for friendship people only let you down he thought or die or get sick or leave there were only different ways of losing better to be careful so he concentrated exclusively on his work and lived alone and went out seldom personal distractions didnt matter either he was thinking have a drink and just forget them one day he had been too busy for a shower one day he had guessed he didnt need to shave his pants went unpressed his shoes unshined he wasnt so slovenly that his manner and appearance were offensive but the edge was off the shimmer gone and now in retrospect he knew that he had started acting like a loser selfdefeat could it be that he had always been a loser but that losing wasnt any good unless you first had been a winner had he courted his own losses or else could it be he thought about this oftenthat when he had made his choice between the living and the dead he himself had started dying other people whom he worked with didnt have that problem so the job was not at fault here for a time he had a lover but she couldnt tolerate his lifeless manner and indeed hed forced her to leave certain that shed one day leave him anyway besides the dead were much more lovely he would often go down to the morgue at night and solitary stare at certain corpses not the ones who were disfigured by a fire say or a traffic accident but those who having died peacefully were much more radiant than they could ever have been when alive the peace that passeth understanding quiet and at rest a pewter sheen upon their faces and their bodies like some statues but much better or when working late at night hed pause before he cut a body open meditating on perfection and when he at last was forced to cut he would do it lovingly with care so much so that responsive to his care the body gave up all its secrets but the process took much longer each day what before had taken two hours now would last a half a day and sometimes all alone and working late hed occupy himself with just one body until the dawn so that was how they brought him down because when all his theorizing had been prolonged and exhausted after he had put up all his layered explanations he in time had come to understand his motives he was fascinated by the dead in love with them and all he needed to discover that truth was one late hours gentle touching of a young girls lifeless body he had looked up and his supervisor had been standing in the doorway watching him there was no need for accusations or explanations no word passed between them but they both knew what had happened one week later he resigned effective when a person could be found to take his place and without thinking he went back to his birthplace potters field his father had been dead by then so it was easy to return he sometimes thought that he had wanted to return since hed first left the place except his father would have been there his credentials had been so impressive that he hadnt required a recommendation from his superior in philadelphia hed asked the local hospital had hired him and here hed stayed and here he had been happy understanding bred control he settled in his fathers house he did his job and he passed the time he continued drinking but not as much as before on occasion he looked at slaughters sometimes puffy face and thought that slaughter ought to cut back on the beer but really it was he himself who liked the beer and he at last had found a friend in slaughter because slaughters life was his profession as his own was and a friendship based on work was something that the medical examiner could handle people who were good at what they did who related to you on that basis seldom disappointed you and besides although this was a weakness he had come to like the man perhaps in part because he sensed that slaughter felt that way toward him and so he frowned at it the body of the cat down in the hollow he stood along the rim and looked down at the mangled head and it was blown apart all right slaughters magnum bullet had shattered the skull there were bits of blood and brain and bone and fur that had been blasted back along the slope behind it there were insects crawling on those pieces on the carcass and the bloody skull flies that clustered buzzing on the blood as well when he had parked his car and walked across the dusty field to reach the hollow he had heard a noise down in there hed seen a dog run from the hollow glancing furtively its ears back its tail low as it had loped away he had seen a bloody strand of sinew hanging from its mouth and although hed have to check the textbooks in his office he was certain that hed read somewhere that rabies could be passed on from the meat of tainted animals he didnt have a gun he wouldnt know how to use it even if he had one that had been another block between his father and himself his father was a hunter he himself had not been interested if slaughter had been here now the medical examiner would have been eager for slaughter to shoot the dog either that or trap it but that second way was risky and the dog might be too clever for them better just to shoot it never mind who owned it never mind that he himself would want a living animal for observation and testing that dog was a danger it was running toward the cattle pens and he was bothered by the damage that the dog could do if rabies were indeed the problem here oh this soon the dog would not develop symptoms but it certainly could leave the virus if it drank from where the cattle drank and they would then contract it he watched as the dog disappeared among the bushes by the cattle pens as the cattle shifted slightly brown shapes in a group across there and he licked his lips and looked up at the summer sun it was noon and he was thirsty worn down by the heat hed left his suit coat in the car had pulled down his tie and fumbled to open his top shirt button now he rolled his sleeves up and he walked down into the hollow every sound he made was vivid to him the dry sand crunching underneath his shoeshe never wore the cowboy boots so many of the townsfolk wore his suits still those that he had owned back in the eastand he was positive that he would waste his time by doing tests on what was in a heap before him there were only bits and hints of brain and worse they were contaminated fly eggs on them now corruption settling in the cat had been a large one black a massive torn he could understand why slaughter had been startled when it suddenly came leaping at him but he wished that slaughter had shot it somewhere else besides the head well that couldnt be changed and for certain he couldnt leave it here in case it was contagious he would have to seal it in a bag and then destroy it he waited thinking at last climbing back up the slope and crossing through the dust and bushes toward his car at the curb he opened the trunk and reached in for the kit he always carried with him for emergencies lab coat rubber gloves a cap and face mask once he had them on the face mask stifling in the midday heat he chose a plastic bag a pair of forceps and he returned to the hollow there he used the forceps on the bits of bone and brain dropping all those pieces in the open bag he held the process took a half an hour he made sure that he found them all then he went up on the rim and searched among the bushes when he was satisfied he used a stick to push the carcass into the bag put the stick in there as well and noticed a piece of ragged flesh that had been hidden by the body when he gripped it with the forceps setting it inside the bag he paused to guarantee that hed been thorough sure the blood that soaked the sand dry now rustlike but he couldnt leave it and he had to go back to the car again to get the shovel in the trunk the lye he always kept there and fifteen minutes later he was finished the sand scooped into the bag the hollow pale with sprinkled lye he walked back to his car tied the plastic bag and put it in another bag and then inside the trunk he put the sack of lye the shovel his lab coat and cap and face mask in yet another bag careful with the gloves he took off locked the trunk and didnt know another way he could have done it he would drive now to the office go down to the furnace in the basement and arrange for what hed gathered to be incinerated abruptly he was conscious of silence no wind no cars going by or people talking no sound over at the cattle pens well saturday he thought there wont be much going on but he had the odd sensation that he was not alone of course he thought my rubber gloves my lab coat cap and face mask id have looked like i was from another planet sure the neighborhood is inside staring past the drapes at me but when he looked he saw no movement at any windows and he did his best to stop his premonition as he got in his car and drove away he headed toward the hospital glancing in his rearview mirror where he saw two men come from the railhead bar he saw a woman emerge from a house and get in her car he thought he saw reflected dimly workers from the stockpens walking down the street behind him it seemed as if the world had once again resumed its motion the instant he left that place and he was thinking he should get control of his imagination keep your mind in order because really this was something that engaged him if he didnt dare consider all the trouble that was maybe on the verge of breaking out he found the problem in the abstract quite attractive he was intrigued the way he once had been in philadelphia a riddle to be solved a secret ready for him to discover he was driving glancing at a cat that perched in royal splendor on a porch rail he was passing a young boy who walked a cocker spaniel and because the day was hot he leaned his elbow out the open window his arm hairs shifting in the wind that the motion of the car made he was almost startled by the excitement that he was feeling ten blocks later he turned up the driveway toward the parking stalls behind the hospital he waved to a man from the childrens ward who drove out past him toward the street he reached the back and pulled in at his parking space getting out his key in hand to open the trunk when something slowed him and then stopped him it was something that hed grown so used to that hed long ago stopped being aware of it except last night when he and slaughter had been talking in the office and hed noticed it but slaughter had first turned to it unconsciously reminding him and anyway the thing had been so much in keeping with their conversation that of course he would have noticed then but normally it simply blended with the background and it wasnt worth consideration now when everything that hed been mulling through distracted him the sound had changed had drawn attention to itself he stood motionless his head turned his hand still outstretched to unlock the trunk even when he shifted his body toward the trees back there his hand remained outstretched and stiff until he noticed it and lowered it slowly to his side he felt his muscles tighten he almost couldnt make them work as he walked squinting toward the trees in all the years hed worked here he had never gone back in them never once been curious there was a dry streambed he knew that in the spring was filled with rushing snowmelt from the mountains but a flashflood was not a thing to walk near and hed always watched it from the distance of his parking space the trees here all had leaves their branches bare in the early spring and there had been no trouble seeing but in june now everything was like a jungle back there the trees thick drooping the bushes full and vine enshrouded not to mention that there was a rusty fence he had a fear of snakes of things that crawled and he couldnt see but he was thinking only of the sound beyond the trees now as he reached the fence and glancing at the thick high grass beyond it he gripped the sagging post to balance for a foothold on the wire there was no need to climb the fence the post continued sagging as he gripped it and his weight kept pressing and the post snapped softly weakly toppling toward the ground where it hung bobbing in the wires he looked down at ants a hundred of them next a thousand they were scurrying to flee the ruptured nest inside the base of the post riceshaped eggs gripped by their pincers rushing off in all directions he lurched back revolted all those ugly crawling things his skin began to itch his mouth tasted sour he was conscious of the irony that he could look at burned and mutilated corpses maggots on them and be concerned only about how much damage had occurred within the lungs and yet he couldnt bear to see these insects and their crazy panicked scurrying below him well he thought in the morgue he had control but here the situation governed him and as the sound beyond the trees became even stranger he made himself go near the fence he stepped across the sagging fallen wires avoiding where the ants were staring at them even as he worked around them toward the trees he felt the bushes clutch his pants and he was turning forward stooping underneath a tree branch soon encircled by the trees the ground sloped long grass vines that clung hard to his pant cuffs everything was close and dark and humid then the trees gave out and he was looking at the streambed it was deep between the banks dry with sand and here and there a rock or waterpolished piece of driftwood he saw tiny tracks of animals in the sand he glanced along one track and saw movement ten feet to his right along the bank a chipmunk up on its hind legs staring at him in an instant darting into a hole beside a tree root then the chipmunk poked its head out blinking at him he glanced toward the streambed once more swallowed and with one leg cautiously before him he eased down the loose earth of the bank the sand at the bottom was soft beneath him and he didnt like that feeling didnt like the lacerated tire he saw wedged among the silt and rocks he was eager to get up on the other side edging slowly up then listing off balance clutching at a tree root up there but the clutching was instinctive and abruptly he released his grip scrambling upward dropping to his knees and clawing at last he reached the level and he stood there breathing glancing all around he brushed the dirt from his pantlegs staring at his hands the noise was even stranger though and slightly to his left not straight ahead he angled toward it stooping past more trees avoiding bushes suddenly free of them stark sunlight on him open air before him just the houses past the yards here the white fence all along this back end of the houses he prepared to climb the wooden fence when he thought better down there to his left the sound was even closer stronger from that backyard two lawns down he walked along the fence and then he saw it tangled in its chain the doghouse scratched and bitten splinters and blood spots on the lawn an irish setter and the sound it made was chilling not a growl exactly not a bark much lower almost speaking deep within its throat long and drawn out suddenly a sequence of quick choking then that drawllike laryngitic moaning he stared at the bloody lips the froth that dripped in great gobs from their corners and as it stopped biting at the chain and went back to the bonerevealing sore that it was chewing on its left hind leg he gripped the fence peered down at the unmowed yard and gasped desperate to control the churning in his stomach hed seen what he could only term the face of evil later he would recollect how those peculiar words occurred to him hed judge and weigh them hoping to condemn their wild emotion but he knew that they were fitting he had never seen such open brutal insane evil and his instinct was to flee to repel the image from his sight instead he rushed along the fence until he faced another backyard climbing over straining to see every portion of this yard in case there was a dog in here as well but there was nothing just a tiny plastic wading pool and he ran past it hurrying along the side until he reached the sidewalk in the front and then he swung across the next yard toward the front door of the house in back of which the dog was baying even more grotesquely if hed been the man he claimed to be he would have known what next would happen would have paid attention to the weedchoked lawn the untrimmed bushes would have understood the owner here but he was taken up with urgency he gripped the wobbly railing charging up the stairs on the porch he pressed the doorbell but the sound of a television blared out from the open windows so he couldnt hear the doorbell he couldnt even hear the dog now and he pressed the button once again staring through the screen door past the open main door in there toward the shadowy living room he realized that the doorbell wasnt working as a crowd cheered on the television he banged at the screen door he shouted hey is anybody home hammering so fiercely that the wood trembled and a shadow moved in there pale against the murky sofa a man coming to the door the man was husky naked to the waist a can of beer in one hand he was surly unshaven yeah what is it look your dog i know the bastard wont stop barking it needs treatment what youve got to get it to a vet the medical examiner blurted up your ass i told the neighbors i was working on it hell i even got a special collar i dont one with batteries the kind that every time the dog barks sends a shock to stop it barking the medical examiner was speechless who the hell are you ive never seen you anywhere the man said im the medical examiner explained who he was you live around here no i then up your ass i said if this isnt where you live why dont you mind your own damned business there was no way that the medical examiner was going to make him understand he gripped the door to pull it open heading in hey now wait a minute what the hell do you think youre doing the man demanded blocking him ive got to use your phone the beer store has one on the corner theres no time the crowd cheered on the television as the medical examiner squirmed to get past the man he saw beyond the sofa where the television showed two boxers slugging at each other hey buddy im through being patient the man shoved him hard rabies dont be nuts the dog just had her shots christ go back and look at her the collar makes her act that way i cant afford to take the chance the two men struggled toward the middle of the room i have to phone a vet if youre not out of here youre going to have to phone an ambulance the medical examiner slipped past the man dodging toward the phone that he had seen beside the sofa get out the man ordered but the medical examiner was dialing okay buddy dont forget i warned you as a womans voice came on the phone to tell him animal associates the medical examiner turned just in time to see the hand that held the beer can lunging toward him he was vaguely conscious of the other hand that set him up and held him steady but the blow that split his lips and shocked him backward he was never conscious of at all he had a sense of someone moaning and he wondered through the spinning darkness what that murky cheering was about four they ran with the bloodhounds up the steep slope through the trees the dogs were silent sniffing as they forged up higher and the men who held their leashes were exhausted this is crazy one man said and pulled back on the leash to slow the dog if we keep on like this well be useless in an hour he was gasping taking in long breaths exhaling like a bellows never mind an hour fifteen minutes is more like it another man said and swallowed breathing reaching for a tree to get his balance i say take it slower they were five miles up from where theyd left the pickup truck they hadnt organized the search until almost three oclock it took that long to get their knapsacks and their dogs then there had been instructions and the dogs had needed time to find the scent the search had really started at threethirty running with the weight of knapsacks rifles walkietalkies and ammunition they had labored through the forest climbing bluffs and crossing ridges stumbling down and up through gorges and a tangle of dead timber had been just about enough to finish them they had to carry each dog through the tangle but the dogs had not refound the scent across there and the men had struggled with the squirming dogs to carry them back to the first edge of the tangle bodine must have tried to cross then given up but they themselves had managed to get through here why not bodine never mind one of the state policemen said lets just keep moving so they had worked higher and although theyd only gone five miles theyd needed several hours christ sixthirty hey it must be time to eat another mile yet if this guys in trouble one more mile could be enough to help him which was understandable so looking at the shadows stretching darker through the forest they moved farther higher through the mountains slower though they couldnt run up ridges as if they were sprinting around the local baseball field they knew their breathing should be constant their heartbeats steady keep things smooth and even they had hurried at the start but that had been because they were impatient now that this had become routine now that it was boring they were moving much less frantically something broke a branch up to their right and they were staring but the deer that showed itself and ran away only made them laugh i dont see why that guy went up here anyhow if it was me if i was chasing some wild dogs i wouldnt try it on my own they heard the helicopter roaring closer it had been a muffled droning far off to their right but now it skimmed across the trees above them and they saw the insignia of the us lands and forest bureau air search to police a mans voice crackled from the walkietalkie they halted on an open bluff and squinted toward a line of trees that obscured the helicopter they had little trouble hearing it however once again the static from the walkietalkie air search to police the man in charge a sergeant gave his dogs leash to a trooper beside him he fumbled with the straps that looped his walkietalkie across his shoulder then he pressed a button and put the walkietalkie to his ear as he leaned back against a boulder roger air search we can hear you whats the problem over is that you on the bluff i just passed roger affirmative tenfour over the sergeant answered the man beside him winced he was well aware that there were special words you had to use with walkietalkies affirmative was better than yes which sounded like a hiss but hed seen some men pick up a walkietalkie and they suddenly were like some goddamned hotshot actor in a police movie roger tenfour a smug look in their eyes like they were getting screwed while they were talking jesus a crackle from the walkietalkie i just wanted to be certain im done for today the grounds too dark to see much except us the second man thought sure you saw the bunch of us all right youre just eager to get back to town and celebrate saturday night in a bar roger the sergeant responded christ the second man thought the sergeant continued anything that looked suspicious over i checked all along the slope to the north of you i checked the lakes up that way nothing some nice elk at windshift basin well well keep moving with the dogs then theres a lake another mile above us and well camp there over just make sure you cuddle close boys it gets awful lonely on your own in the woods weve got the dogs to keep us company over yeah but you should see what ill have nightynight boys roger tenfour out the sergeant brought the walkietalkie down aw go screw yourself the second man grumbled he wasnt certain if he meant the man up in the helicopter or the sergeant but the sergeant grinned at him and so the second man decided raising up his hand to make an obscene gesture toward the faroff roaring of the helicopter soon the noise dimmed becoming fainter at last inaudible and the men now looked at one another throughout the afternoon theyd heard the chopper roaring near them in the mountains they had gradually become accustomed to it at last so familiar with it that they hadnt been aware that they were hearing it they heard it now though or rather heard its absence and they missed it somehow incomplete without its reassuring presence lets get moving the sergeant said he reached for the leash hed handed over and they let the dogs go on straining to keep up with them what a way to spend a weekend someone said saturday and hell we wont be back at least till sunday evening well if you boys worked as good as you complained the sergeant told them wed have found this bodine long ago the dogs began to slacken and then cower five it was crouched behind the deer cage watching as the black and white police car reached the end of the lane stopped a moment and then drove toward the swimming pool the thought of water made it gag again and when it crawled out from its cover to be certain that the car continued moving it saw people diving from the high board splashing into the water and it had to turn away to keep from retching there were people over by the swings and slides children and a mother they were laughing a man and a woman strolled toward the deer cage in the cage the deer had long since shifted toward the side away from it they stared at it their withers rippling nervously and it was bothered by them just as much as by the people coming near it only wanted to be on its own to hole up somewhere safe to stop the spasms racking through it finally the man and woman reached the deer cage and it scurried through the bushes up the slope it dimly recollected that a walkway angled across the slope above there and it reached the walkway wooden steps that cut up high across the slope and it was running up them in the sunlight it pawed at its eyes and squinted once it stumbled falling and it scrambled up on all fours rasping whining then it reached the top and it could see the mansion over there once its mother had taken it here to visit the place a big tall oldtime house with many rooms and stairways and it still retained the image of those dark corners all those sheltered crannies it could hide in squinting far around glancing toward the park down there the people it shivered and turned toward the mansion again it saw the trees around the place the bushes and the gravel driveway that led up to the front steps and it saw the car parked in the front and it was ducking toward the bushes moving closer all those shadowy rooms the front door suddenly came open and it paused among the bushes now a man came out and he was talking to a woman they had boxes in their hands the afternoons been slow i dont think anyone will come up now well ive got guests i cant stay any longer they closed the door the man reached to put a key inside the lock no i didnt tell you the woman said eva phoned to tell me she couldnt find her key well she can get mine from me in the morning no she wants to do her work before tonight she has to go away tomorrow i cant leave the place unlocked the man said only for ten minutes i expected her before this if vandals get here sooner you know how the owners will react from what i hear they still have plans to sell the place it doesnt make a difference just remember it was your idea such a gentleman they started down the stairs it crouched behind the bushes watching as they put the boxes in the car ill drive you home the woman said no thats all right i need the walk so whens your next shift not for two weeks sunday afternoon theyve got me chairing meetings well ill see you later nodding the man walked down the gravel driveway and the woman got in her car driving past the man she blared her horn the man waved and soon both the man and car were out of sight it waited just a while then it crept out from the bushes running toward the porch it huddled by the steps and looked around then scampered up the steps and turned the knob and it was in there very quiet everything smelled musty it remembered the large big hallway bigger than the living room at home and there were tables stacks of papers to one side and a box where people put their money in its mother had at any rate she had explained about historical societies and how an old house like this had to be preserved for people to appreciate the way things used to be it hadnt understood the words exactly but it sort of had the sense that this old place was special and it hadnt liked the musty smell back then but now it did the hall was shadowy rooms on both sides oldtime furniture in there guns up on the wall and maps and faded oval photographs it listened but there wasnt any movement in the house and it crept forward now it faced a big room with the longest table it had ever seen bigbacked chairs along it plates and glasses set out knives and forks and more spoons than it understood as if a party soon would be here people eating there were ghosts here it was sure but oddly that was comforting the staircase wound up toward the second floor a cagedin elevator to the side its mother had explained about the elevator how the platform rose without an engine you simply had to pull down on the rope that dangled in there and a pulley then would turn to raise you but the cage had boards across the front and anyway it never would have stepped inside there all those bars the place was too much like a trap it walked a little farther pausing as the floor creaked no it had made that noise itself there wasnt anybody in here and it wondered where to go up the stairs or to the cellar no the cellar would be a trap as well and boards creaking it was inching up the stairs but it stopped as the front door opened it turned the daylight out there strong painful staring at the man who stood within the open doorway this man had just left hed walked until hed disappeared along the gravel driveway that was why there hadnt been a warning why there hadnt been a car sound to alarm it and it hissed now as the man came forward yeah thats just what i expected leave the door unlocked she says god damn it kid get out of here it hissed again whats your name im mad enough to call the cops it growled then and the man hesitated frowning none of that damned stuff you get your ass on down here one more step the man was at the bottom of the stairs he reached and it was leaping body arcing down the stairs to jolt the man and send him sprawling hey god damn it but the man apparently expected that it next would try to scramble past him toward the open door the man lunged to the side to block it his neck uncovered and it dove in straight below the chin jesus they struggled it could feel the blood spurt into its mouth it gagged again the taste was not unpleasant even in a way compelling although the choking was an agony it chewed and swallowed gagging abruptly it couldnt breathe the man was squeezing at its throat it felt the pressure in its chest it squirmed it twisted goddamned kid then teeth free it was snarling at the hands around its throat it tried to bite the hands but only nipped the acrid cigarettevile suitcoat sleeves and suddenly one leg was underneath it pushing as it flew high to one side its body slamming on the wooden floor and rolling hard against a table even so its instinct was automatic turning it scrambled on all fours and braced to spring again the man rolled coming to his feet they stared at one another then the man looked at the blood across his clothes he touched his neck my god he understood now his hands up stumbling backward it leaped but not strongly enough to drop the man just knock him farther backward oh my god the man kept saying and the open door was suddenly behind the man the man was out there kicking as it leapt again its shoulder took the kick the jolt spread through its body falling it landed on that shoulder it crawled back and snarled snarled not just toward the man but toward the carsound coming up the lane now it could see beyond the man toward where the car was coming into view a different car a different woman driving it was staring crawling farther toward the stairs its shoulder wasnt working it snarled and stumbled up the stairs then as it heard the car door out there squeak open as the man glanced quickly out there it mustered the little strength it retained and scuttled farther up the stairs the stairs kept winding it reached the second floor and out of sight from down there it huddled tensing mr cody it heard the womans voice outside the rushing footsteps on the porch good lord your throat the mr cody it heard the heavy body slump to the floor never mind me get in there and use the phone the man rasped call the cops an ambulance watch for some kid something on the stairs panicked much less certain now of what it should be doing it swung to face the hallway up here looking for a place to hide it scurried but at least the place was dark up here at least its eyes no longer hurt six youve got to help me the medical examiner blinked at the shirtless man the television news was droning i dont hey you didnt give me any choice i didnt mean to hit you that hard the afternoon came back to him his head hurt when he moved it and his lips and nose felt like they belonged to someone else when he touched them they were senseless swollen but he felt the blood and he was groaning look my dog youve got to help me the man said whats the matter shes not moving she just lies there staring at me jesus stay away from her i am my christ if only i had listened can i get it if she licked me the medical examiner struggled to sit up when this morning she was acting fine then wash your hands i hope you didnt touch your mouth you dont have any cuts she might have licked i cant remember what i dont have any cuts i cant remember if i touched my mouth i told you wash your hands the effort of the conversation made him dizzy he slumped back use disinfectant mouthwash gargle change your clothes he gripped the sofa to brace himself and stand he fell back then he took a breath and made it to his feet the blood was all across his tie and shirt he started feeling angry and that helped him hurry up wash your hands then suddenly he thought about the hand that had split his lip and smashed his nose he bolted down the hallway shoving past the man who was going into the bathroom get away ive got to wash my face the medical examiner soaped his hands and scrubbed his face scrubbed it until it hurt and still he continued scrubbing he peered at the blood that mingled with the soap upon his hands and dripped down toward the swirling water in the sink he continued scrubbing then he grabbed a towel and scoured his face until the porous cloth was bloody rubbing alcohol he ordered fumbling in the cabinet behind the mirror but he couldnt find it alcohol he shouted and the man jerked open the door below the sink they saw the bottle at the same time and the medical examiner grabbed it twisting off the cap and splashing his nose his lips but he needed more he leaned his face down sideways toward the sink he poured the hot sweet alcohol was flooding burning he snorted then the effort took its toll and he sank onto his knees my god youre just as crazy as that dog out there the man said you dont know the half of it just wash your hands and face and gargle like i told you he slowly came to his feet the man was at the sink swabbing soap around his hands the medical examiner cringed lord i might need shots then he stumbled from the bathroom down the hallway toward the kitchen out there through the window he saw the dog stretched out the blood and foam around her mouth slackjawed staring off at nothing that was all he needed he groped from the kitchen toward the phone he had to concentrate to dial the phone kept ringing on the other end at last an answering machine told him to leave a message whats the matter with them saturday he peered down at his watch of course theyre only open in the morning they wont be there this late he was flipping through the phone book vets vets and then he had it dialing this time someone answered a woman dr owens he blurted whos calling please the medical examiner im sorry hes not in right now give me your number hell call you back the medical examiner felt his heartbeat stop no wait a second she said hes just coming in the door muffled voices bumps and echoes as the phone was being transferred dr owens here the medical examiner identified himself theres a dog i think has rabies the vet didnt speak for a moment rabies youre certain no i told you i just think thats what it is the dog has got some kind of collar that sends shocks to stop her from barking hell this could be heat exhaustion or distemper i dont know youd better get over here dont touch her hey dont worry slaughter called and said this might turn up i hope it hasnt well well know damn sure in a little while the medical examiner saw the man come down the hallway he asked for the address then he quickly told owens and he hung up and the two men tried to keep their eyes away from one another turn that television off fifteen other steers have been discovered disemboweled the same way local ranchers still are baffled the announcer finished saying no i changed my mind i want to hear this weatherwise the weekend has been turn it off the man went over pressed a button and the screen became blank mercifully silent the man shifted his weight from one foot to the other i dont know how to make this up to you you want a beer id like a couple but i cant right now the medical examiner stared at his trembling hands i didnt mean to hit you that hard hey im really sorry just forget it they waited thirteen minutes later the van pulled up in front it was white and dusty animal associates the red words said along the side a young man got out tall and trim as the medical examiner hurried from the house toward the sunsettinted street the man yanked at the back doors of the van and leaned in to get something youre the medical examiner the man asked puzzled by the blood on his shirt thats right im sorry i took so long i had to go down to the clinic for this van i dont like taking chances he pulled out padded overalls stepping into the legs then tugging on the arms and drawing up the zipper has it bitten anyone it licked its owner i dont like that what about your face the owner hit me broke your lip there the medical examiner nodded i dont like that either help me with this gear the vet brought out a padded helmet its leather edges coming down around his shoulders in the front a wire grill kept the face protected and the medical examiner helped the vet put on padded gloves tour names owens thats right help me with these shoe protectors wheres the dog in the back well lets get to it owens grabbed his satchel almost like a doctors as they turned the medical examiner looked up to see the shirtless man on the porch thats the owner owens kept walking if you want to call him that the man stepped off the porch look i had no way of understanding never mind that show me where the dog is they reached a gate along the side and owens told them on second thought youd better not go in there he shut the gate behind him walking down along the side of the house its on a chain the medical examiner said owens peered around the corner then he straightened walking slowly out of sight the medical examiner and the dogs owner frowned at one another without speaking they crossed to the next yard and walked along the fence the medical examiner kept staring toward the corner of the house he saw the backyard getting bigger as his line of sight improved and then he saw a shadow then he stopped as he saw owens standing by the dog but he couldnt see the dog too well and so he walked a few more feet and he was gazing at the slackjawed bloody frothedged mouth the blinking eyes the heaving withers jesus what are you guys doing the gruff voice came from behind them and the medical examiner turned to see a man in tennis clothes come out the back door staring at them get your face back in the house the owner of the dog said youre the cause of this i beg your pardon this mans dog is sick the medical examiner explained yes i know it is the damned thing wont stop barking the owner of the dog started toward his neighbor the medical examiner hurried to stop him dont be foolish youve got trouble as it is behind them he heard owens saying what a mess and they turned whose idea was this collar anyhow the neighbors kept complaining hell i ought to see you jailed for this owens set his bag down reaching in to get a hypodermic leaning close preparing to slip the needle into the dog the dog bit his padded wrist and owens squirmed take it easy girl whats the dogs name irish take it easy irish but the dog kept its teeth clamped onto the padded wrist and owens had to slip the needle in with one hand while he squirmed to free the other still the dog would not release the wrist owens had to crouch there waiting in a minute though he tugged his wrist free standing watching as the dogs head settled onto the ground its eyes closed motionless christ you killed her just as well as far as im concerned the neighbor said on the steps behind them the owner of the dog again started toward him i didnt kill her owens said although ill likely have to the owner didnt know which man to turn to is it rabies rabies what the hell the neighbor said on the steps behind them i dont know yet owens said ill need to get the dog to the clinic and run some tests he pointed toward the bowls of food and water by the back door this dogs chain is too short she couldnt reach her water she could just be vicious from the heat what the hell is wrong with you no one spoke then only stared at where the owner looked around then glanced down at the grass i thought the bowls were close enough i guess i wasnt thinking ive had problems sure his wife moved out last week the neighbor said she couldnt stand him the owner suddenly began to sob when the medical examiner avoided looking at him he saw owens fumbling with his thick gloves to release the chain hooked to the collar owens tugged to free the chain from where the dog was tangled in it twisting pushing at the dog he had the chain at last unhooked then he peered down at the mangled back leg shook his head and stooped to pick the dog up still the medical examiner could hear the owner sobbing lets get you inside youve had a lot of things go wrong today he tried to ease the owner along the fence the owner shoved his hand away and stared as owens straightened with the dog the dog was large and heavy owens stumbled with the weight the owner hurried along the fence and opened the gate to let him through the medical examiner frowned at the neighbor well i didnt mean to make him cry the neighbor said how was i to know the medical examiner gestured with contempt walking away at least the dog quit barking the neighbor said furious the medical examiner kept walking he joined owens and the dogs owner at the van where the owner obeyed instructions and stepped inside to spread a plastic sheet on the floor of a cage then he got out and owens set the dog in making sure to lock the cage the owner wiped at his tears ill handle it from here youd better go back in the house owens said im coming with you no ive got a lot of tests to run ill phone you owens said youd be in the way i promise sorry owens glanced at the medical examiner then started walking toward the backyard i left my bag behind the house as owens disappeared the medical examiner told the owner well you heard him this is my dog im responsible you should have thought of that before and then im sorry i didnt have to say that even so hes right theres nothing you can do just go back in the house well call you hell its saturday the medical examiner was puzzled im all alone there was nothing the medical examiner could think to say he turned as owens came across the lawn carrying his bag owens peered in the van toward the dog and shook his head even with that plastic sheet im going to have to disinfect the van im going to have to burn these clothes and get a new bag what a mess well maybe you wont have to it could be this is something else you wouldnt care to bet on that the medical examiner just shook his head i thought not lets get moving do you need a ride my car is through those trees in back ill see you at the office then owens shut the rear doors walking with him looking in the front the medical examiner was not surprised to see the plastic sheet that owens had spread out where he was sitting hey i think we ought to bring this man along the medical examiner gestured toward the owner who was staring at the back doors of the van oh thats just fine thats really fine owens tried to keep his voice low look i did my best to play it down i have to kill the dog to do the final tests you want this man along to see that there wasnt any need to answer fine then ill be at the clinic owens turned the key and got the engine going then he sighed and shook his head in disgust before he put the van in gear and drove away seven dunlap stared down at his trembling hands everything considered he was doing very well he guessed oh sure hed started shaking and his stomach felt like he was going to throw up but he hadnt thrown up and although he was sweating that was maybe from the heat as much as anything whos kidding who the sun is almost down the air is cooling off youre sweating for a drink and buddy do you need one there were times when he suspected he would scream thats just dramatics he told himself you were looking for a story now youve got it he was not yet certain what was going on here rabies maybe could be something more whatever it was getting out of hand and if he screwed this story up the way hed screwed up many others simply out of weakness there was no one he could blame except himself youll get your drink just keep control this thing tonight is almost finished is it maybe its just getting started and he shook his head and gripped the dashboard as the cruiser swerved sharply around the corner skidding past the swimming pool and up the treelined gravel driveway he watched as slaughter grabbed the microphone its slaughter marge im almost there make sure you send those other units what about the ambulance its on its way i hope so dunlap focused his gaze down past the trees and toward the park spread out below himthe lake a stream that twisted toward it swings and slides and cages that looked like a zoo and people down there staring toward the siren when he glanced ahead the road curved and abruptly he could see beyond the trees up to the hilltop a wide threestory mansion up there the last rays of the sunset glinting off the windows the place was old expensive of a size that nobody could afford to build these days the driveway curving past the front porch columns with a roof above the driveway like a southern mansion showing signs of age though dark and rough and grainy somehow very western all the same he saw the cruiser that had hurried here before them and another car civilian and two officers who stood at the front door talking to somebody in there slaughter skidded to a stop dust cloud settling dunlap got quickly out slaughter putting on his hat and hurrying before him through the dusk they reached the front steps these were stone and both men rushed up their footsteps scratching on the stone the two policemen had already turned to them hes up there on the second level one of them said or the third youre sure hes even up there slaughter asked talk to these people a man was slumped inside the doorway his shirt and suit a mass of blood his throat ripped open his hands clutched at his wound the ambulance a woman blurted on its way youre sure hes up there slaughter asked mr codythis is mr codysaid the boy ran up the stairs as i stopped in the driveway thats your car she nodded better move it therell be a lot of traffic coming up here even as he said that they turned toward a cruiser speeding up the driveway just behind it siren wailing came the ambulance can you walk the man nodded struggling weakly to get off the floor here let me help you i dont want you in the way if something happens slaughter turned to face the two policemen watch those stairs make sure the boy doesnt get away slaughter held the man and worked with him across the stone porch then down the steps two attendants ran from the ambulance policemen from the other cruiser running with them is there any place to get down from the second story slaughter asked the woman who was helping him to move the man out of danger a roof above the servants quarters in the back i dont know how hed jump down and not hurt himself the trees around the house are there any he could lean to and climb down i never thought i just dont know the back slaughter told the two policemen coming toward him make sure no one leaves the building its the kid were looking for the kid slaughter realized that these two men had not been with him at the boys house never mind just make sure no one leaves be careful of the roof above the servants quarters slaughter gave the injured man to the two men from the ambulance they stared and slaughter looked down at the blood across his own hands and his shirt a young boy bit him thats right isnt it he asked the woman she was nodding bit me dunlap heard the injured man repeating his voice distorted rasping added to what hed been feeling dunlap was fearful that the jagged throat would do the job and make him sick he had to glance away more sirens two police cars skidding up the gravel driveway a dust cloud rising behind them slaughter hurried toward them dunlap frowned in the middle of it all the two men from the ambulance had opened out the back and set the injured man inside the woman was inside her car and moving it slaughter stood between the cruisers talking to the officers whod just arrived dunlap turned to face the mansion squinting through the dusk toward the two policemen at the front door this was all too much he was shaking even worse as he walked toward the woman who was getting from her car where she had moved it to the side what is this place the baynard mansion who and dunlap learned then about baynard who had been the richest man around here back in he had cattle all across the valley and he built this place up here to suit a southern woman he had married there was something automatic in the way she said it dunlap thought as if shed said it many times before he listened with wonder as in bits and pieces she explained how baynard had brought from the south the wood the furniture the bushes everything to make his wife feel more at home and then his wife had gone back south one summer where she died either that or else she left him and he lied about her dying no one knows for sure the woman said weve tried to find the record of her death we never managed she had reasons if she left him he was hardly ever home tending business working as a senator plus there were rumors about certain kinds of parties on the third floor but he said she died and everyone agreed to that and he came back and never left the house again dunlap was amazed that she seemed more concerned with what she said than with the preparations going on around them he learned how people said that baynard wandered through the house for days on end the cause of death was claimed to be a heart attack but everyone suspected he just drank himself to death and one thing morethe rumors that he killed her that she told him she was leaving and an overbearing man like him he flew into such a rage that she was dead before he even knew hed struck her then he hid the body and he wasted in his grief at last he killed himself and people in the family hushed it up but those are rumors as i said the woman shrugged nobody ever proved it though in recent years they looked for her they never were successful but back in eighteenninety how come you know all about this im a member of the potters field historical society i still dont understand so she explained no one lives here baynard had two children they grew up to manage the estate then they had children and this new set gave the mansion to the county to avoid the taxes theyre not very wealthy now they live in houses down the hill beside the swimming pool weve fixed this place up just the way it used to be the plumbings from the eighteennineties we even shut the power off to get around at night you have to use a flashlight either that or candles or a lantern if you want to be authentic dunlap faced the mansion oh thats swell he thought so now weve got a haunted house the only thing thats missing is a thunderstorm well there wouldnt be a storm but sundown would do just as fine he saw the orange distorted disc where it was almost behind the western mountains in a while the grounds would be completely dark except for flashlights headlights maybe even candles lanterns as this woman had suggested and the search up through the mansion for the little boy he felt his scalp tighten as the woman said beside him whose child is it i dont know exhausted dunlap walked toward slaughter who spoke to four policemen we need nets dunlap heard as he came closer nets and dunlap saw that it was rettig standing with the young policeman dunlap had gone to slaughters with this morning that seemed several days ago you heard me nets you think that we should club him do you slaughter asked or shoot him but nets i dont know where youd find them try a sportinggoods store or that zoo down in the park rettig youre in charge of that the rest of you i want you watching both sides of the mansion lets get moving they stared at slaughter then they hurried toward the mansion hold it slaughter told them they spun to face him give your keys to this man i want your headlights on the building they glanced at dunlap who had not expected this instinctively he held his hand out then he had a set of car keys mindless he expected more but then he realized that rettig would take one car these keys fit another slaughters was the third car and the fourth had been driven by the two policemen who were in the mansion they separated to watch the sides as slaughter shoved a ring of keys at him you understand i think so dunlap said ill spread the cars out so theyre pointed toward the windows run the engines i dont want the batteries to die and use the searchlights by the sideview mirrors what about the womans car youve got the right idea dunlap nodded running toward the cruisers slaughters car he recognized and rettig now was driving down the gravel driveway siren wailing dunlap went toward the car beside where rettig had been parked and got in fumbling for a key to fit and started the engine in a while he understood that someone else could just as easily have done this but the tactic was a way for slaughter to distract him it helped there wasnt any doubt about that breathing quickly taken up with interest dunlap adjusted to the burning in his stomach he was glad to be in motion driving the cruiser toward the mansion aiming straight ahead and stopping where he judged that the headlights would be most effective he groped down to turn them on he found the switch upon the searchlight and he flicked it and this right side of the mansion almost to the second story was bright against the dusk he got out running now toward slaughters car and did the same this time aiming toward the left side of the mansion and the place was lit up there as well the woman had been watching and she didnt need to have somebody tell her she was getting in her car to move it once again aiming toward the front door and the sun was down below the mountains the park a murky gray below him but the windows reflected all the headlights and people wouldnt have to stumble in the darkness dunlap heard another car he thought it was a cruiser but the siren wasnt wailing and he didnt see the silhouette of domelights on the roof as it stopped where he was watching he could see the mother and the father oh dear god no they scrambled out wheres slaughter im not certain even as he said that slaughter came out from the mansion standing on the porch the glare of headlights on him staring at them he and the parents approached each other the parents hurrying you shouldnt be here slaughter told them dunlap saw that he was angry howd you know we have a neighbor with a police radio have you found him slaughter pointed toward the upper stories hes in there thats as much as ive been told im asking you to go back home and wait to hear from me dunlap thought that slaughter standing in the headlights glare seemed to age a dozen years his cheeks sagging dark lines underneath his eyes but why should he be hiding let me go inside and talk to him the woman said no i dont think so slaughter looked down at the ground and scraped a bootsole in the dust i think that you should let me handle this he looked at them you heard my wife shes going up to talk to him the husband said im sorry i cant let you thats what you think the husband and wife moved forward slaughter stepped ahead to cut them off those headlights those police cars hell youve scared him half to death the husband said i didnt want to tell you but you evidently havent heard the rest of it your son attacked again a man this time the man was bitten in the throat the wife froze her mouth open oh my god the husband gasped the man is over in that ambulance go take a look and then youll know why i cant let you in there they turned toward where slaughter pointed as the two whitecoated men stepped from the back of the ambulance and shut the doors weve done all we can here one of them shouted slaughter nodded and the two men rushed to get inside the front the siren started as the engine roared the lights went on and they were swerving in a circle speeding down the gravel driveway dunlap watched until he couldnt see it anymore he turned and saw the woman crying please i think that you should leave here slaughter said i want to stay the woman sobbed slaughter raised both arms and let them flop down loose against his sides at least stay in the car the best thing you can do is aim your car lights toward the house and please dont get in the way weve got too much to do i promise well watch out for his safety she wept as her husband held her both of them nodding thank you slaughter said they moved weakly toward their car and then they heard it everybody did they all turned mother father slaughter dunlap the policemen by the house staring toward the upper levels deep inside above there from which floor wasnt certain something someone started howling it was like a coyote or a dog a wolf up in the mountains worse though mournful hoarse and hollow rising baying howling then diminishing then rising once again it went on two more times like that chilling echoing from somewhere deep above there dunlap felt his backbone shiver then it ended and the night except for idling engine motors finally was quiet what the hell was that a man blurted from the right side of the mansion im not sure i want to know another shouted back and slaughter started racing toward the front door of the mansion eight the state policemen huddled frightened by the fire they had planned to reach the lake by sunset but the dogs kept holding back and whimpering and the men had traveled slower than theyd wanted soon dusk was thick around them and they never could have seen bodine even if hed been ten feet away from them they had struggled through the underbrush their arms and legs scratched by bushes and the dogs had held back so fiercely that the men were forced to grab the dogs and carry them these dogs of yours are really prizes one man told the sergeant i dont understand it they dont act this way without a reason sure they figure theyve gone far enough today they figure its about time we carried them a cougar maybe down this low a bear then come on charlie these dogs just gave out on us admit it but the sergeant didnt want to he was speechless for a moment a dog held in his arms as he worked through the underbrush all right what about those wild dogs weve been looking for maybe theyre what my dogs are smelling and everybody else apparently had thought of that already because no one spoke then and their lack of banter was selfconscious as they struggled through the bushes one man tumbled breaking branches groaning as the dog yelped in his arms beneath him watch my dog your dog for christ sake what about me well i know plenty of guys like you but ill never get another dog like that one thanks a lot no what he says is true another said hed never get another dog so lazy and that seemed to bring their spirits back they laughed a little waiting as the fallen man got up and struggled to lift the dog well the dog isnt stupid anyhow someone said he figures why walk if someonell carry him and that helped even better they were laughing freely as another trooper ordered quiet whats the matter listen to those noises off there to the right they wrestled with the dogs to keep them silent staring toward the darkness and they heard it branches breaking firtree needles brushing not a lot of noise and not too loud not even close but there was something nonetheless that they heard moving through the murky forest to the right and then it stopped the dogs struggled harder in their arms it could be nothing well i dont intend to wait here until i know that lake cant be too far ahead the sergeant chuckled some tough bunch i brought with me a little noise and you boys start to panic youre the one who mentioned those wild dogs but think about it five of us our own dogs nothings going to bother us so you agree then that those wild dogs could be out there watching us no i agree to nothing except that its late and im tired lets get moving thats exactly what i said lets get the hell out of here someone snickered then and they continued through the underbrush they glanced from side to side and when another noise came louder from the right they increased speed heavy pine cones no the sky is falling dont you know that just shut up at last they were in the open staring at the murky ripples on the lake they had a distance yet to go about a hundred yards but there were hardly any bushes just a few trees by the lake and even in the darkness they were more at ease now walking with less tension toward the lake they heard a branch snap behind them and they turned but kept on walking as they reached the lake they sensed the glow before they saw the moon begin to show above the mountains their inclination was to build a fire but they had to stake the dogs first to take care that their leashes were secure then they had to feed the dogs but only one man was required for that so they let the sergeant do that while they looked around for firewood there wasnt much people often camped up here and there werent many trees by the lake the dead wood long since gathered so the men despite their apprehension had to go back to the forest they used flashlights scanning the trees and bushes first before they stepped in gathering dead branches pine cones fallen leaves going back their arms full toward the sergeant and the dogs beside the lake well whats the matter one man asked the sergeant theyre not eating no wonder look at what you gave them kibble thats what they eat every night they must want something else they understand they have to eat what theyre served i wish my kids would understand that another man walked over you dont mean to tell me i packed that dog food up here just so your damned pooches could turn their noses up they look a little sick to me the first man said no theyre not sick theyre scared the sergeant said and since until now he hadnt acknowledged that there might be trouble they were struck by his remark they stood there facing him then glancing at the dogs well never mind lets get that fire started but the second trooper said that very faintly and he turned to where the last two men were working on the fire they fumbled with matches trying to ignite the leaves one hand shook a little and a match went out the other match kept burning though and soon the flames spread through the leaves and pine needles crackling toward the branches and the branches now were burning their large flames spreading toward the logs above them the men grouped around the fire holding their palms out rubbing them together then rubbing their arms and shoulders they glanced at the shimmer on the lake at the ripple of the fires light across the trees they looked at the dogs then at the darkness around them it was several seconds before one man said what everybody else was thinking we dont have a lot of wood for now its plenty but in an hour damn it then lets get some more im hungry even with the crackling of the fire they heard a noise back in the forest you go do it ill stay here and fix the supper one man said thanks a lot for volunteering the sergeant patted one of his dogs and told it thats all right im with you then he moved toward his men at the fire so you want to do the cooking thats just fine you stay and help him you and you come with me they surprised him when there wasnt any argument the two men he had chosen were reluctant that was true but nonetheless they turned and followed where he led them toward a section of the forest where the noises hadnt been they aimed their flashlights through the trees before they went in for more wood and this time they came out with big chunks stout and heavy branches that would last them just to guarantee that the job was done they made three other trips always to a different section of the forest and they came back dropping wood where they had put the rest and they could smell the coffee boiling not too hot i dont like coffee thats been burned well you can do the cooking then i wanted to but you were too afraid to get the wood i did it for you thats the last i want to hear about that everybody did his job the sergeant said he gingerly drew the coffee pot a little farther from the fire ow he said and reached his fingers to his mouth here use these gloves they heard three noises then in three separate sections of the forest but the sergeant although he stiffened didnt look so whats for supper they frowned toward the forest i asked you whats for supper the sergeant said oh spaghetti freezedried sauce that sounds real fine the dogs were whimpering again though and the sergeant tried but couldnt hide his worry now the moon was higher he went over to the dogs and patted them again i let them drink some water from the lake i wonder if theyre still a little thirsty from the three separate places in the forest they heard noises then a distance to their left they heard a fourth sound this is stupid this is just our imagination one man said those noises hell theyre not my imagination no i mean whats causing them deer or maybe elk its possible the sergeant said they come down here at night to drink they see us here and dont know what to do your waters boiling by the way they looked down at the pot beside the fire right i wasnt thinking and the man in charge of cooking paused a moment before fumbling in his pack then pouring noodles into the boiling water hey you said spaghetti whats the problem noodles are the same well maybe theyre the same to you but quiet and they listened to the noises from the forest thats not deer if you ask me i didnt ask you youre all crazy someone said ive camped here a dozen times i even brought my wife and kid once you hear noises like that from the forest all the time so how come you picked up your rifle im just checking that i didnt get some dirt in it good idea i think ill check mine as well now ive had just about enough the sergeant said they turned to him first of all those noodles need some stirring second if you wave those guns around youre going to end up shooting somebody take it easy what jack says is true you hear those noises in the forest all the time they stared at him ill help you with the sauce the sergeant said here someone fill that plastic sack with water put more wood on the fire it was obvious what he was doing trying to distract them but they did what they were told and everything was better for a moment although the man who went down to the waters edge made sure he didnt stay too long they heard him splashing by the lakeshore and he came up toward them water dripping from the plastic sack lets figure on the worst the sergeant said suppose it is wild dogs theyre not about to come at us hell higher in the mountains ive seen wolves so close their eyes were lit up by the fire but they never came in toward us theyre just curious the main job is to find bodine if you boys still are nervous when you bed down well arrange to have a guard in shifts thats fair enough they thought about it slowly nodding stir those noodles like i told you i once knew an indian a man said good for you they laughed no just listen he did odd jobs for my father when my father was alive and had the ranch the indian was david skyhawk and i felt about him as if he was my brother oh that indian was something sixfootthree and built like some thick tree trunk hes the man who taught me how to shoot and hunt and fish my father never had much time for that well anyway he used to take me camping in the summers wed go up here sometimes for a week or more wed often go up so high that id swear to god nobody else had ever been there and he told me lots of things about these mountains once we camped so far we needed horses we rode up leading pack mules till we reached this crazy draw it wasnt much just steep slopes like a v a stream that wound along the bottom boulders on the ridges hell there wasnt any undergrowth there wasnt much of anything the only reason we chose it was a kind of gametrail that would take us to the high end and we started up the gametrail when the horses went crazy i was only twelve then so if only my horse had gone crazy that wouldnt have proved much skyhawks horse began to act up too though and no matter what we tried we couldnt get those horses up the gametrail they were whinnying and shying back then the pack mules started acting up they tried to turn and there was hardly any room to do that we were scared theyd lose their footing and tumble down the slope so we dismounted and we kept our hands across the horses muzzles while we squirmed around to go back down the gametrail even as it was we almost lost one pack mule i asked skyhawk what was wrong and he just said that we should try another passage thats some story no one laughed though im not finished so we went back to the entrance to the draw and found another way and all day i saw skyhawk glancing past his shoulder toward where we had come from and i asked him again what was wrong but he just wouldnt answer everything went fine from then on we came to a spring and it was nearly dark then so we camped and made a fire just like now and we were eating and i asked him once again he almost didnt tell me but he shrugged at last and said it was a superstition there were places in these mountains where we shouldnt ever go he told me places like that draw back there you didnt know until you got up in them and you never saw a bird or animal but even then you might not notice if you didnt have a horse or dog or something like that with you they could sense the trouble right away there wasnt any way to keep from sensing it they simply wouldnt go up in those places if you tried to force them theyd start acting crazy like our horses had back in that draw what causes it i asked him and he said he had no idea his people knew that there were certain places that you never went to and they didnt question that tradition spirits maybe some terrible thing that once had happened there the point was that they marked those places and they didnt go there some bad medicine he said and skyhawk was no dummy hed been to school he knew the difference between fact and superstition but he said the only difference was that people hadnt learned the facts behind the superstition they just understood the consequences he said that he had seen a whole pack train go crazy in a mountain meadow once hed seen a herd of elk go crazy like that once as well the year before he said hed gone out camping by himself hed pitched his tent and gone to sleep and for no reason he suddenly woke while it was dark and found that he was shaking sweating he crawled from his tent and packed his gear he went as fast as he was able through the darkness to a different section of the mountains now the man stopped looking at them thats the story someone asked christ what the hell was that about the point is hed been to that spot many times it was a special place for him but he said that those spooky feelings sometimes show up where they shouldnt be they move he told me and he never went back to that site again for christ sake that big indian was fooling you he was telling ghost stories by the campfire no im positive he wasnt fooling he was serious hell you were only twelve that indian was close to me he never played that kind of joke and anyhow i saw the way those horses acted so they smelled a cougar or a snake or something else hey i know bigfoot they laughed yeah thats right that indian was frightened by a sasquatch they laughed even harder you know freddie sometimes that big mouth of yours makes me want to smash it in now none of them was laughing take it easy the sergeant said no the boy here wants to teach me thatll do i said the sergeant told them weve got problems without starting in on one another and they did what they were told because the noises were much louder now and everyone was turning now youve really got us jumpy you and those damned stories about spooks the rest of them were picking up their rifles suppers ready save it i dont know the sergeant said the dogs were whimpering the moon was higher maybe thats bodine if hes been hurt up here he might have seen our fire and tried crawling toward it that would explain the noises weve been hearing hed have shouted could be hes not able but the noises are from different sections theres his wife and son remember could be all three of them are hurt maybe separated thats a lot of could bes but at least an explanation the noises became louder hell im going out there i want to find out what that is the sergeant said i dont think thats a good idea its the only one weve had and anyway suppose it is bodine weve got to help him the sergeant looked at them i cant order you i guess is anybody coming with me they glanced toward the ground toward the dogs anywhere except toward the sergeant yeah okay if no one else will ill volunteer it was the man whod just told the story this is getting on my nerves just waiting here the sergeant smiled thats fine im glad to have you so they clutched their rifles and they started from the campfire toward the darkness out there they could hear the noises hey be careful one man said dont worry the sergeant and his companion now had disappeared beyond the firelight those who stayed beside the fire heard the footsteps brushing through the mountain grass the distance was sufficient that in a moment the weak sound didnt carry and the three men stood there staring at the darkness and they waited they should reach the forest soon just give them time the sauce is burning one man stooped and grabbed a glove to pull the pan out from the fires edge they should turn on their flashlights just give them time i said theyll want to save the batteries theyll need them for a lot of hours yet but there were no lights near the forest okay im convinced theyre taking too long theyve had too much time to reach the forest at once they heard barking whats that theyre in trouble lets go help them wait were still not sure yet what the hells the matter with you theyre in trouble the man who had stooped to move the sauce was clutching his rifle im not going to wait here while they need me he moved toward the forest then he turned and looked at them youre coming they hesitated to hell with you he continued moving forward use your flashlight he was just beyond the firelight as the last two men heard the howling not just barking as before but howling no somebody shouted from the darkness out there no stay back the howling intensified then they heard the rifle shot no stay back my god no run they started backing toward the fire staring toward the darkness there were sounds of movement in the darkness to their right and left they lurched farther back staring aiming as the snarling figures hurtled toward them one man fired but he was overpowered and the other man kept stumbling back he felt cold water in his boots and realized that hed stepped into the lake he was shooting tugging at his rifles bolt and shooting yet again his eyes unsteady from his panic peering at the swirling howling figures on the lakeshore but the water held them back as he kept shooting he dropped one and then another and he worked the bolt and pulled the trigger and the pin snapped down on empty all his other bullets were inside his knapsack by the fire the figures twisted snarling on the shore he couldnt see them clearly only made out silhouettes against the fire behind them heard his partners screaming off there in the darkness as he drew his handgun eager now to save his bullets for their final rush at him the water sure they dont like coming in the water otherwise they would have charged me in a rush he waded farther out and suddenly attentive only to what faced him on the lakeshore he ignored what might be rising behind him lost his balance as the muck beneath him sloped much deeper and he fell back completely swallowed by the water nine everything was speeding up the medical examiner didnt have the time to think things through to make sure that he did things properly when owens left to take the dog down to the clinic for example he himself had stayed behind to calm the owner all the while he stood there talking with the man at last walking with him toward the house the medical examiner wanted to rush through the streets to get to owens and to watch him do the tests at the same time he was thinking that he ought to get in touch with slaughter to tell him what was going on but what was going on he didnt know yet there was nothing positive for all he could predict the tests would indicate some other problem and he didnt want to trouble slaughter didnt want to bother him without a reason so hed gone inside the house and stayed there briefly until hed reassured the owner then he hurried from the house dont go out in the backyard you could be infected by the doghouse or the chain and frantically realized that hed left his car at the hospital he ran through the backyard of the house next door the man in tennis clothes came out to tell him hey if id wanted people cutting through here id have put in a sidewalk but the medical examiner didnt answer he simply clambered up the fence and jumped down on the other side racing through the long grass toward the trees and then the dry creek he no longer cared about the snakes or other things that might be hiding there he thought only about his car about the tests that owens soon would be performing he scrambled from the dry creek through the trees and bushes toward the fence that he had toppled jumping across the ants nest running to reach his car but as he stood there breathing hard fumbling in his pocket for his keys he suddenly remembered the objects in the trunk of his car the plastic bags the dead cat and the bloodsoaked dirt how much danger did they pose he couldnt take the chance they might be so contaminated that theyd spread the disease until he had time to examine them he needed to make sure that they were safely stored in medicalwaste containers the process took twenty minutes only then was he able to hurry to his car and speed away he swerved up the driveway toward the back of the veterinary clinic the sun had set now in the darkness except that the rear doors were closed and owens van was parked before them this was much like when hed come here friday morning seeing old doc markle dead and staring at the mangled steer when everything had started for him he skidded to a stop beside the van and jumped out he gripped the door beside the two big doubledoors and owens hadnt locked it as he rushed inside he squinted from the blazing lights and was mindful once again of friday morning had it started only yesterday he saw the dog up on the table a protective plastic sheet beneath it owens there beside it in his lab coat and his face mask owens turned to him his voice muffled by the face mask the dog was dead before i got here is that common sometimes the paralysis can set in very quickly the medical examiner understood what owens was referring to an animal with rabies would go through several stages first it acted normally until the virus worked along the nerves then the brain became infected and the victim was excited furious at last the virus spread back through the total nervous system and the animal was lethally paralyzed but i saw it in the active stage several hours later and its dead paralysis shouldnt be that quick maybe i agree with you this could be something else owens said youll find a coat and face mask in that locker over there the medical examiner went across to get them also finding a pair of rubber gloves he put them on and he was conscious of the buzzing lights up in the ceiling as he walked back to the table first lets get this collar off owens fumbled to unsnap it staring at the battery attachment what id like to do to that guy he set it aside you ought to meet some people who come in here wanting us to make their dog mute cut its voice box out its vocal cords hell id like to cut on them at least they wouldnt talk so much then and they wonder why a dog without a voice will bite somebody when its got no other way to warn him off owens face was red above his mask he shook his head well lets get to it how can i help i need that scalpel four quick strokes and owens peeled the scalp off they stared at the bloodsmeared skull then the drill owens flicked the switch the bit was whirring grinding through the bone four holes widely spaced to form the corners of a square and then the saw owens used it neatly its motor buzzing as he cut from one hole to another swiftly gently not too deeply then the job was done and he was prying at the skull bone well the brain is swollen and discolored you can see that slight pink color indications on the other hand distemper sometimes looks like that i need to take the brain out and dissect it the medical examiner again handed him the scalpel then forceps and owens placed the brain in a glass dish on the table ammons horn the medical examiner said thats right owens cut past the hippocampal region then he had it you can do the slides which way do you want them pressed or done in sections the sections take too long just do impressions what were looking for will show up just as well so the medical examiner instead of placing tissue from that portion of the brain into fixing fluid and embedding it within paraffin a process that took several hours simply pressed a bit of tissue on the slide and smeared it evenly then looked around to find a microscope over by that cabinet the microscope had ajar of sellers stain beside it the medical examiner put stain across the specimen to make sure that what he was looking for would stand out in contrast he arranged the slide and peered down through the lenses can you see them owens asked the medical examiner kept peering whats the matter you should see them but the medical examiner just turned to him and shook his head i think youd better look you mean you didnt see them and we have to do the other tests i mean that you should have a look now owens frowned as he peered down through the lenses what the medical examiner had looked for was some evidence of negri bodies negri was a scientist in italy who first identified them in the early s they were tiny round and sometimes oval bodies in the protoplasm of the nerve cells in that portion of the brain called ammons horn no one knew exactly what they were in current theories they were either rabies virus particles or else degenerative matter from the cells affected by the virus maybe both but seeing them was certain proof that rabies was at work here and the medical examiner had seen them on the other hand he maybe hadnt i dont get it owens said somethings wrong here these things shouldnt look like that the medical examiner understood he watched as owens peered down through the microscope again because the things hed seen were neither round nor oval they were oblong with an indentation on one side they look like goddamned peanuts owens said whats going on here this could be some related virus what you tell me what i just dont know you bet you dont and i dont either rabies is something id recognize and you can bet theres nothing in the books about these things were looking at well have to do the antibody test it takes a couple of hours and the mouse test takes at least a week i want to know what this thing is we have to guess for now its rabies or a virus that has all its symptoms which is fine if no one were exposed to it owens said but what about that owner and yourself if this is rabies youll have to take the serum shots but we dont know if theyd do any good they studied one another and the medical examiner reached up to touch his mask the swollen lip beneath it hed forgotten or more truthfully hed tried to keep from thinking of those shots ill take them anyway but what if they dont work well with the virus what if theres a bad reaction hell if ive already got it ill be dead soon anyway what difference does it make the medical examiner suddenly remembered something that the owner had first told him that hed let slip by in the excitement something that the rabies serum shots reminded him about he said his dog had been inoculated what the owner he mentioned that the dog had received its shots whats his name the medical examiner told him okay there isnt any other animal clinic so his file will have to be here try some other slides make sure we didnt do them wrong ill come back in a minute owens hurried toward the door that led down to the offices in front the medical examiner obeyed the instructions hed been given his legs were shaking as he stumbled toward the microscope he peered at all the slides and each one was the same and he was really scared now owens pushed the door open so forcefully that the medical examiner flinched he was right owens had a file in one hand raising it that dog is five years old it had its puppy shots its boosters every year well could the boosters be the cause of this contamination in the vaccine i dont know but sure as hell im going to learn even if the vaccine were prepared correctly could it have been so strong that it caused the virus in the case of rabies maybe with a weak dog one chance in a hundred thousand but i dont know how the vaccine would produce the thing were looking at one chance might be all this thing might need they frowned at each other look ive got to make a call the medical examiner grabbed the phone and dialed marge was answering ive got to talk to slaughter hes been looking everywhere for you she said hes at the baynard mansion what then she told him the rest and he felt sicker im on my way he hung up turning to owens run the antibody test the fluoroscope ill get back as soon as i can manage but whats wrong there wasnt time to explain the medical examiner tugged off his gloves and face mask urgent he yanked at the door to meet the darkness ten it kept howling jesus lord i wish that thing would stop the policemen stood in the glare of the headlights a net spread out before them rettig had come back a little while ago hed looked everywhere to find a net the sportinggoods stores the zoo down in the park as slaughter had suggested but he hadnt seen one hed been frantic since the stores had all been closed and hed been forced to call the owners but they hadnt been home then as he had given up and started back to slaughter he had slammed his brakes on staring at the restaurant across the street it hadnt done well and the business had been sold a seafood place in cattle country why had anyone put money in it but the decorations still were in there and he saw the heavy sea nets hanging in the window he had run across the doors were locked he didnt know the owners he finally pulled out his gun and smashed the backdoor window slaughter hadnt liked that but he didnt want to say so after all the man had tried at least they had the net now and that really was what mattered he told his men how they would have to do this as the howling kept on from the upper stories and they clearly didnt want to go in for that matter slaughter didnt want to go himself the main thing is dont hurt the boy he glanced to see if dunlap heard that if this thing turned sour he wanted to avoid accusations about police brutality he wanted all his men to know without a doubt that they were only to restrain the boy but what if he attacks us just dont hurt him keep the net between you and the boy well get him tangled in it after that we shouldnt have much problem slaughter looked at dunlap again hoping that dunlap understood how clear and cautious every order had been he squinted from the headlights aimed toward the porch he saw the mother and the father and they still werent in their car he saw the woman from the potters field historical society the other cruisers that had gotten here not long ago the headlights of another cruiser speeding up the gravel driveway well weve got enough men lets do it but the headlights werent another cruiser slaughter recognized the car it was the medical examiners and slaughter told them wait a second as he stepped from the porch the medical examiner got out of his car and rushed forward where have you been ive been looking slaughter stopped talking when he saw the blood across the mans shirt the mangled lips what happened to your face there isnt time to explain i know this things a virus but im not sure if its rabies is it just as bad its maybe worse it seems to work much faster theres a dog that passed through one stage of the virus sooner than it should have were still doing tests well what about this boy up there the medical examiner winced as he heard the howling from the upper stories thats a boy whos doing that his face was twisted with the shock of disbelief i have to think it is there could be some stray dog up there but we dont have a reason to believe that god i once heard someone sound like that a case of rabies back in med school but the other symptoms werent the same as this a victim of rabies might get vicious even bark and snap at someone bark the muscles in the neck constrict the person tries to talk but all the words come out like barking this is howling thats exactly what i mean the symptoms arent the same it sounds more like an animal besides i never heard of anyone with rabies who had actually attacked someone oh i read cases in the medical books but never met a doctor whod actually seen it happen then we dont know any more than when we started thats not true we know theres something and were fairly certain its contagious but the parents claim the boy was never bitten sure and i just saw a dog that had its shots and now its dead back at the vets the howling started again damn i should have thought the moon the medical examiner said now youve lost me look at it he pointed toward the almost full moon that was shining toward the mansion that symptom is at least consistent victims of rabies are enraged by light their eyes are sensitive they seek out darkness when the moon rises they start reacting to it howling rapid dogs will and in this case one small boy they say he cut his hand on glass this morning thats too soon it takes about a week before the rabies virus starts to show symptoms but if this thing is quicker than the normal virus if the glass had been licked by an infected animal that would be enough to transmit it when you catch the boy the first thing i want to do is see that cut the howls were rising its like something someone crazy slaughter told him lunacy they used to call it madness from the moon slaughter didnt want to talk about this anymore ive got to go in after him ill bring my bag well need it slaughter hurried up the stone steps to his men is everybody ready they nodded tensely keep your gloves on rettig hold the net at that end you three hold it at the other end and in the middle just remember no one hurt him slaughter looked at dunlap again to make sure hed heard and they started in dunlap followed no you stay out here slaughter told him but i want to see the end of this i dont have time to keep you safe from trouble ive got plenty as it is to think about ill stay back out of danger youre damned right you will youll stay there on the porch youre hiding something slaughter for the first time slaughter felt enraged by him i beg your pardon you heard what i said youre not sure you can keep your men controlled you dont want someone like me up there to see trouble ive had just about enough from parsons told you to cooperate about the commune but not this he doesnt even know about this but hell be damned mad if you screw up his pr tactics look you need as many witnesses as you can get ive handled this about as well as anybody ive been helping slaughter couldnt stand here arguing he squinted at the headlights at the medical examiner approaching and abruptly made his choice all right im going to take a chance on you the first time you get in the way youll find your ass out on the porch thats what i figured then we understand each other slaughter turned to the medical examiner youll need these gloves hey i will too dunlap said you wont be close enough to need them they crossed the long wide hallway toward the curving staircase men were spread out at the bottom the net before them ready with your flashlights slaughter asked they nodded turning on the flashlights beams arcing up the stairs he heard their breathing and smelled their sweat okay lets do it footsteps shuffling scraping they started the net spread out before them up the staircase eleven it was waiting for them it had scurried to the final landing now it heard their footsteps and their whispers saw their sweeping flashlight beams they still were quite a distance down there but in time they would be up here and it hissed as it swung in search of cover but there werent any rooms behind it just this one big open space that stretched from end to end it didnt understand although it did retain a far off memory of someone whod explained this there were slight projections from each corner spaces behind but these would be too obvious it needed something else and then it saw what it was looking for a perfect hiding place and one it could attack from if it had to it was scurrying to reach the place and all the while it kept glancing at the glow that swept in through the window and spread cold and pale across the floor it started howling again it couldnt stop itself was powerless to fight the urge just crouched there head up howling long and high its throat constricted painfully and then the urge had been relieved and it was scurrying the darkness in this hiding place was wonderful the blackness soothing and secure it closed its eyes to rest them after all the strain of squinting at that cold pale glow that spilled in through the windows it was breathing quickly nervous even though the hiding place was comforting it licked its lips and tasted yet again the scabs of blood that clung in specks against its mouth that salt taste that it now had grown accustomed to and even had begun to crave but the salt taste had been liquid and that recollection made it gag again nonetheless it wanted that warm sweetly salted liquid it was caught in oppositions both attracted and repelled and without conscious effort it was howling even more fiercely twelve they stopped down on the second landing its up on the third floor maybe slaughter told them but you heard it howling we dont know if theres a dog in here as well i say we do this as we planned it dunlap youre so anxious to be helpful shine that flashlight up the stairs dont wait to yell if you see movement oh dont worry if theres anything on those stairs ill yell my goddamned head off are you sorry that you came now i wouldnt miss it for the world you must want that story bad you have no idea but then slaughter saw the way the flashlight beam was shaking and he took the light away from him i dont know if its booze or nerves but i dont want my life depending on you here youd better take this and he gave the flashlight to the medical examiner you do it just the way i told him he turned to his men okay we work along this big hall up here checking all the rooms i dont expect to find him on this level but i cant depend on expectation with the net spread before them they moved through the darkness when they reached the first doors on each side they stopped and looked at slaughter try the left side ill stay here and watch the other breathing hoarsely they went slowly in but there was nothing they shone flashlights in the corners and the closets just an oldtime bedroom with a canopy above the bed a net that came down to keep out mosquitoes they looked underneath the bed and they came out checking all the other rooms along the hallway other beds a playroom and a study all rigged out as if a hundred years ago maps and photographs and guns up on the walls a chair that looked as if old baynard had risen from it only a moment ago but nobody was in there and they came out staring down the hall toward where the medical examiner was aiming the flashlight up the stairs i guess we know hes up there slaughter said they faced the stairs and started up their flashlight beams were making crazy angles on the walls and ceiling the men shuffled as if at any moment they expected some small figure to come hurtling toward them but instead they reached the final landing and they swung their beams across the big topstory room well i dont get it slaughter said what is this place his voice echoed youve never been here rettig asked always meant to never took the time the ballroom rettig told him baynards wife was southern and she didnt like the people out here she was used to parties dances fancy dinners baynard built this place to suit her and the ballroom was his special effort once a month at least he had a celebration ranchers those with money used to come from miles around better people from the town congressmen and senators he paid their way theyd come up from the railroad in carriages he sent for them he even brought an orchestra from denver they would dance and eat and whats the matter slaughter asked him in the dark the flashlight beams angling across the ballroom slaughter felt his stomach burning well i used to hear about it from my fathers father but i never knew if it was true or not he said the parties sometimes got a little out of hand i dont know what you mean rettig continued you can see the way the balcony juts out from that end well the orchestra played up there with that solid wooden railing the musicians couldnt see too much of what went on below them in the corners and the sides there you can see the slight partitions that come out theyre triangles thats right you see those padded benches on the sides well what about them rumors i suppose my fathers father said that wives were swapped up here that people went with different partners in around the back of those things he said there were secret doors that you could go in for privacy he knew that for a fact he never was invited no one ever found a secret door then thats just a rumor like you said i mean a thing like that somebody would have told and maybe not have been invited anymore but baynards wife why would she have gone along with this you said that she was from society i didnt mention that she also had a reputation baynard was the one who had to go along with it to keep her with him then the parties got a little out of hand she found a man she liked much better than the rest some people say she left with him others say that baynard killed her but they never found the body oh thats swell so now youve got us searching through some kind of haunted house just keep your mind on what youre doing dunlap you stay here well check this right end then well move down toward the other shout if anything slips past us everybody ready they nodded then slowly worked across to search the corner to their right moving around the triangle they knocked the wood in case they might find a secret door they crossed to search the other corner then they moved along the big wall going around the triangle on that side nothing so far slaughter said we still have two partitions and the balcony weve almost got him lets be careful they moved up toward the far end like i said be careful there was nothing in the far left corner nothing in the right okay hes up there in the balcony hes got to be they started up the narrow stairs but bumped against each other there wasnt room for the four of them this isnt working slaughter told them they were grateful for the chance to wait rettig you stay back you other three go up slaughter told them rettig will be just behind you rettig breathed out with relief the other three looked tense aiming their flashlights up the narrow stairway what about on top of those partitions one man asked no how could he climb up on them and in that brief distraction their faces turned out toward the ballroom everything began to happen first the snarling then the hurtling body it came off the balcony a halfseen diving figure that swooped past them slamming hard at rettig men now scrambling shouting bodies rolling on the floor slaughter heard the snarling rettigs screaming as he tried to get in past the scrambling bodies he saw rettig struggling upward something hanging on him he saw rettig falling backward then the extra weight upon him as they crashed against the near partition the old boards cracking and the men were rushing forward with the net where is he here ive got him rettig kept screaming then the net swung through the flashlight beams toward where he struggled with the figure on the padded bench beside the triangle oh jesus get him off me rettig shouted and he kicked the figure thumping snarling on the floor the net fell they had him arms and legs were lashing out entangled worse with every effort slaughter pushed between his men and saw them roll the boy and get the net around his back and chest and there was no way that the boy could get out he was powerless except for where he slashed his teeth against the net and snarled at them the medical examiner hurried next to slaughter set down his bag and reached inside to grab a hypodermic keep him steady you dont think well let him go the medical examiner pulled out a vial slipped a needle into it and eased out the plunger to get liquid into the chamber standing by a flashlight he pushed slightly on the plunger until liquid spurted from the needle then he looked at slaughter pull his shirtsleeve up youre kidding in that net i couldnt move it rip a patch out then i dont care let me see some skin through the webbing slaughter tugged and ripped the shirtsleeve he was quick afraid the boy might get at him the medical examiner swabbed alcohol across the skin and leaned close to press the needle one loud yelp the medical examiner kept pushing gently on the plunger then he straightened and he looked at slaughter in a minute why are these bricks here someone said and slaughter turned too much was going on i dont then he saw where rettigs fall had broken the partition in there as he shone his flashlight he saw a wall of bricks he glanced at rettig who was slumped across the padded bench his hands up to his throat are you all right he didnt bite you did he slaughter asked rettig felt all over his body he breathed gasped and swallowed breathing once again he nodded wiping his mouth i think i only lost my wind he tried to stand but gave out slumping once more on the bench ill be okay in just a second what bricks there behind you rettig turned still trying hard to breathe i dont know anything about them i dont think they should be here slaughter didnt even need to ask him rettig was already going on i guessed that this one sounded different from the others much more solid heavier whats that supposed to mean a policeman asked baynards wife i think we know what happened to her the group became silent slaughter felt dunlap beside him they peered down at the small boy who was tangled now unconscious in the net a little kid and all this trouble hell i didnt really understand how little he would be slaughter said they stood around the boy and stared at him wed better get him to the hospital the medical examiner said you too slaughter rettig you as well i want to check both of you he never touched me slaughter said the cat did if this virus is like rabies youre long due to start your shots rettig i dont know if you dont have a bite there wont be any problem but i wasnt bitten slaughter told him only scratched you want to take the risk slaughter shook his head to tell him no thats what i thought dont worry youve got company i need the shots as well but you werent bitten either no but with this bloody lip i cant take any chances the boy is harmless now you men can lift him stay clear of his head they looked at slaughter who nodded one man held the boys legs while another gripped his shoulders hell he doesnt weigh a thing thats what i said a little kid and all this trouble slaughter answered its enough to make you hollow and disgusted he watched as the men worked with the boy to reach the stairs here someone grab that corner of the net before we have an accident he ordered and they moved clumsily down the stairs slaughter kept his flashlight aimed before them on the second landing they turned heading toward the bottom and he heard the idling cruisers now he saw the headlights glaring through the open door the mother and the father out there and the woman from the organization that ran this place an officer beside them take it careful one man said and paused to get a better grip around the boys shoulders okay now ive got him they reached the bottom moving across the hall toward the entrance rettig tell that woman what we found up there those bricks could mean a dozen things and none of them important you dont think so i have no opinion but she should know about the damage they went onto the porch the mother and the father now were running is he just sedated everything considered hes been lucky stay away from him the medical examiner said i dont want you contaminated you can see him at the hospital they didnt look convinced its simply a precaution slaughter said stepping close we still dont know what were dealing with lets put him in the back seat of my car he told his men youd better set him on a blanket we can burn it at the hospital the medical examiner said do we have to be that careful the medical examiner only stared at him ill get a blanket from my trunk the father said and hurried good thats very good we need your help they moved toward the cruiser slaughter opened the back door and the father spread the blanket thank you slaughter told him i know how hard he looked at where the mother stood beside the cruiser weeping how hard this must be for you they set the boy inside and the medical examiner leaned in to check him he stayed in there quite a while when he came out even in the darkness slaughter saw how pale his face had suddenly become i have to talk what is it over there the medical examiner walked toward the trees slaughter followed whats the matter i just killed him what i should have thought the medical examiner rubbed his forehead come on for christ sake make some sense the sedative i should have thought the dog i found i called a vet who came and took one look and gave the dog a sedative but whats the dog had reached the stage of paralysis by then the sedative was just enough to kill it that boy in your back seat isnt breathing oh my god you understand now im not sure exactly how this virus works but its damned fast i know that much he was maybe on the verge of becoming paralyzed the sedative precipitated everything it slowed his bodys metabolism until it killed him you cant blame yourself youre damned right i can i should have paid attention i just killed him the medical examiner closed his eyes shaking slaughter turned to see the father leaning toward the back seat i dont somethings wrong the father blurted slaughter watched the mother crying as the father scrambled in he saw his men the cruisers their headlights glaring at the mansion saw the woman rettig talked to start to run up toward the mansion he sensed the moon above him and the medical examiner beside him shaking as he felt his world begin to tumble and a creature in the park below him started howling at the moon dunlap stood to one side taking pictures slaughter didnt even have the strength for anger anymore he let the man continue taking pictures flasher blinking part four the ranch one slaughter was drunk he hadnt come back home until nearly one oclock and he had stayed outside just long enough to check his horses then hed walked back to his house and with the porchlight on had stared down at the cooler filled with tepid water and the beer cans from this morning there were empties on the porch as well there hadnt been a chance to clean up too much had begun to happen but he didnt clean up this time either simply glanced out at the darkness and then turned to go inside where first he flicked the lights on to study another cooler in the kitchen before heading toward the cupboard where he kept the bourbon that was something that he almost never drank but this night had been special oh my god yes and he almost didnt even bother with a glass he knew that would be too much weakness though and since he was determined to be weak to start with he at least would set some limits reaching for the bottle and a glass he fumbled in the freezer for some ice and poured the glass up to the top and in three swallows drank a third of it the shock was almost paralyzing he put both hands on the sink and leaned across it choking waiting for the scalding flood to settle in his stomach he could feel it draining down his throat he felt his stomach tensing and he knew that because he hadnt eaten since this morning he might easily throw up but then the spasms ebbed and he was breathing trembling he leaned across the sink a moment longer then he poured some water with the bourbon and he started toward the shadowy living room once years ago when he had learned that his wife was leaving him he had felt emotions like this ruin fright discouragement that bordered on despair he had sensed those feelings building in him until the instant of the divorce and going to his rented room his legs so shaky that he didnt think hed get there he had stopped at a liquor store where he had bought the cheapest wine that he could find a quart of ruby banquet some godawful label like that and hed somehow made it to his room where without pausing he had drunk the bottle in thirty seconds setting down the bottle he had scrambled toward the bathroom and the heave of liquid from him had evacuated more than just the wine the sickness had been cleansing purging all the ugliness the hate and fear and anger he had slumped beside the toilet bowl and how long he had stayed there he was never certain but when he got up and slumped across the bed he found that it was night and that the slowly flashing neon sign outside his window was the pattern of his heartbeat measured weary there was nothing in him anymore he had passed the crisis and he had a sense then of a new beginning he was neutral now hed graduated from the cheap wine to the bourbon and he would have forced himself to throw up but he understood that this trouble wasnt over no his apprehension from the night before remained with him and he was definitely certain that this wasnt over first thered be the lawsuit that much he could bet on against the medical examiner and then like ripples in a pond eventually against himself and against the town council that employed him then investigations to determine if the medical examiner and he should lose their jobs hell the medical examiner might even lose his license that boy might have died because he was allergic to the sedative there hadnt been the proper questions proper cautions they had let the trouble so distract them that they hadnt thought beyond it they might very well deserve to lose their jobs he didnt want to think about that he wanted only to shut off his mind and stare down at the bourbon in his hand avoiding the light in the kitchen he sat in a dark corner of the living room and frowned at the darkness past the window for a moment as he raised the glass he didnt realize that it was empty better have another so he went back to the kitchen pouring more but putting ample water with it this time he would have to talk to lots of people in the morning and he wanted to be sober he could recollect as if he still were there the father crying with the mother cursing saying that hed warned them about so much force to catch a little boy the hardest part had been his struggle with the father no you cant go in to touch him hes my son i dont care he still might contaminate you as it is your wife might be infected from that bite it took two men at last to keep the father from the back seat of the cruiser dunlap had continued taking pictures oh my jesus what a mess and when hed finally mustered the energy to talk to dunlap there had been no sign of him the man had sense enough to get away while he was able likely fearing that his pictures would be confiscated slaughter didnt know if he would actually have grabbed the camera but by then he had been mad enough to grab at something it was just as well that dunlap had not been around to serve that function there wasnt much happening by the time he looked for dunlap anyhow the man might simply have walked into town to get some rest the mother and the father had been driven home the medical examiner was going with the body to the morgue the officers were locking the mansion until theyd come back in the morning to investigate he himself had stood in the darkness by his cruiser staring at the mansion and hed heard that howling from below him in the park again but he had been too weary and disgusted to go down there he had seen enough for one night and he had the sense that he would see a lot more very soon all he wanted was to get home and anesthetize himself but not too much he kept remembering as he walked toward the living room and sat again in the corner staring at the night out there hed have to do a lot of talking in the morning dunlap parsons and the medical examiner he didnt know who else but thered be many and he wondered how hed manage to get through this all his years of working and hed never had this kind of trouble no that wasnt true there was the grocery store and on one occasion hed shot a man three to be precise but only one had died and the inquest had absolved him hed been bothered by the killing but hed never felt like this and he was grateful that the bourbon finally was numbing him even slumped in a chair he was slightly off balance and his lips felt strange too long without sleep without a meal but he was too disturbed to want either he was thinking of the medical examiner the green walls of the autopsy room the scalpel cutting that was something else slaughter hadnt done right because the father would no doubt press charges slaughter never should have let the medical examiner go with the body even if the medical examiner were able to determine that the boy was not allergic to the sedative the father would maintain that the evidence had been distorted what was more the sedative had almost surely not reacted well with the virus it had helped to produce the fatal symptoms of paralysis so any way the problem was approached the medical examiner had been at fault he couldnt be objective when he examined the body thered be accusations from the council slaughter wished that hed forbidden him to do the autopsy but dont you see i have to know the medical examiner had begged him slaughter knew how he himself would feel and in the end had let him after all what difference did it make the boy was dead there wasnt time to bring in someone else to do the job they had to know right now how this thing worked he sipped his drink and wondered if the medical examiner would find out that the boy had died from other causes that would be the best thing anyone could hope for if the medical examiner did discover that however was it likely that the town council would believe him or yourself he thought would you believe him do you trust him that much yes he thought and when the phone rang and he reached for it he guessed that this might be the medical examiner calling to report but it wasnt just a dead sound on the telephone who is it slaughter repeated but there wasnt any answer he wondered if this might be the father is there anybody but abruptly the dial tone was buzzing and he stared down at the phone and set it onto its holder which he would have done regardless because from the field down by the barn he heard the horses they were whinnying and snorting through the open window and the screen he heard their hoofbeats skitter one way then another in a rush he set down his glass and rose from the chair the bourbon made him dizzy and he waited until his brain was steady before walking toward the door hed turned the porchlight off when he came in but now he turned it on again and stepped out pausing as he glanced around then swung left off the porch to face the barn there was something different and he had to think before he noticed that he didnt hear any insects they were always rasping in the bushes and the grass they had been when he drove in parking going down to check the horses at the start but now the night was silent heavy except for the skittish whinny of the horses and he wished that he had thought to bring a rifle from the house he had his handgun though and in the dark its range was good enough for any target he might see this likely would be nothing anyhow the horses sometimes acted like this if they sensed a snake or a coyote down that drywash on the rear side of the barn often all he had to do was calm them or else shine a light out into the bushes and the thing would go away but with the bourbon working on him hed left his flashlight in the house and he was wondering if he was in control enough for this considering the trouble that was going on this might be something after all so careful to approach the open barn door from an angle he quickly reached inside to switch on the floodlights there were two sets one in front and back that blazed out toward the drywash and the field beside the barn and toward the house his eyes hurt briefly as he stared at where the horses galloped toward the right and whinnied and then swung fast toward the left their pattern was a kind of circle as if both felt threatened on each side and although they were a distance from the fence before him he could see their wild eyes and their twitching nostrils what the hell the words were out before he knew hed said them and their sound mixed with the horses panic startled him hed never seen them act like this when there was something here that bothered them they always made some slight disturbance and then shifted toward a better section of the field but both were in a frenzy snorting twitching galloping and he was just about to climb the fence and go out there to calm then when he realized that they might be infected sure a sudden change in manner that would be a symptom he could not afford to go to them but what else could he do assume that something in the darkness frightened them he hoped that was the case he loved these horses and hed hate to lose them well get moving then he realized that his reluctance was an indication of how much hed been bothered and he took a breath pulled out his gun then forced himself to walk along the fence to reach the drywash the floodlights brightened everything for fifty yards behind the barn he saw the red clay of the gully saw the bushes on the slope across there and the trees along the far rim he glanced behind him fearful that there might be something crouched behind the barn and then his back protected he walked slowly toward the gully there was nothing at the bottom just the red clay and the boulders and the branches he had thrown in to stop erosion all the same he felt that there was something in the field the horses continued skittering and snorting and he didnt know exactly how to do this under usual circumstances he would have no second thoughts before he went down into the gully and then up the other side to check the bushes after all what normally would be out there that could harm him but this trouble made him reconsider everything he had to distrust every living thing and even dead ones but he couldnt bear the horses panic couldnt tolerate their agony he had to stop what they were doing so he started down the gully when he heard the branches snapping over to his left across the gully in the bushes where the glare from the floodlights blended with the darkness stepping back toward the rim he walked along it frowning toward the darkness his handgun cocked and ready he couldnt be certain if the branches snapped from something that came close or backed off then he heard another group of branches snapping farther to the left and he relaxed a little as he judged that it was something moving off the branches snapped close to the first place he had heard them now howeverfarther to the left again as welland there was more than one thing out here that was certain he was rigid fighting the urge to flee in panic like the horses keep control its just coyotes sure then why the hell have you quit breathing when he heard the snapping once again and couldnt pretend anymore that it wasnt coming closer he reacted without thinking his instinct now in charge he fired in the air and saw the lean fourfooted object furry scrambling backward through the bushes then he saw the other and another and he might have shouted as he saw yet another coming nearer he would never know for sure he heard a noise down in the gully to his right another on the far side of the barn and he was running up along the fence beside the barn to reach the house the horses galloped in a line with him and then they bolted toward the middle of the field he kept running hearing noises close behind him not once looking only gasping racing and he reached the house and burst inside slamming the door locking it behind him he dodged through the living room to reach the kitchen and the back door which he locked as well he closed the windows everywhere he locked them pulling down the shades and he was reaching for the phone gasping frantically dialing hello a sleepy voice said who uh rettig this is slaughter get hammel and get out here chief is that you i uh rettig dont ask questions just get out here to the station what time is it my place fast i need you slaughter repeated his instructions and set down the phone hearing how the horses whinnied beyond tolerance he started toward the windows on that side reaching for a blind to pull it up and see why they were sounding like that but the phone rang and he stood immobile one hand on the blind while he stared toward the phone that goddamned rettig whats the matter with him when slaughter crossed the room and grabbed the phone there wasnt anyone however just that same dead silence tell me what you want he shouted to the mouthpiece but the silence continued then he heard the dial tone again and scratching on the porch and only one horse out there now was whinnying he faced the front door his handgun ready glancing at the window on the side that faced the horses but he couldnt hear even one horse now and as he scrambled toward the front blind the scratching stopped the night became terribly soundless two dunlap set down the phone he was in his room the camera and the tape recorder on the desk where he was sitting his notes spread out before him he was almost out of cigarettes he frowned at the pint of whisky that hed left here in the morning even though his body was in agony he held firm to his promise to himself not to take a drink the promise was a recent one although thered been others like it many times before but this time he was absolute in his determination not to break it he had walked back to his hotel from the park hed seen the mother and the father leave had seen the medical examiner go with the body and hed known that slaughter shortly would be turning on him after all hed seen too much hed even taken picturesof the grieving parents of the body of the medical examiner who looked so guilty that an image of him would be damning dunlap didnt know if slaughter was as good a man as he appeared to be but hed seen even good men try a coverup if they were threatened and the way those parents had reacted slaughter would feel threatened all right dunlap wasnt going to take a chance on him he hadnt come across a story this strong in too many years six of them at least about the time that his drinking had gotten out of hand and the magazine had shifted him to minor stories now though hed been lucky what had seemed little more than a routine story had developed into something that would surely get his reputation back indeed if this situation got much worseand he was positive it wouldit might turn out to be among the ten best stories of the year and he was not about to jeopardize his comeback actually he hadnt walked back to the hotel he had run hed slowed on occasion fighting for his breath but mostly he had run the ten blocks to his hotel knowing from the vantage point that the hill provided which way he had to go to reach the downtown section and hed often looked behind him just in case a cruiser might be coming but there hadnt been one and when he at last had reached the hotel and his room the desk clerk downstairs frowning at him as he hurried up hed fumbled to unload his camera looking for a place to hide the film his room would be too obvious he went out in the corridor and braced the cartridge behind a picture on the wall he hid the tape from his recorder behind another picture he had all their voices from the moment they had reached the ballroom to the instant when the grieving parents had accused the medical examiner of negligence oh it was all there every blessed detail and he meant to keep it slaughter might come after it but slaughter wasnt going to get it back inside his room dunlap had locked the door and that was when his glance had settled on the pint of bourbon he was moving toward it even twisting at the cap before he stopped himself no that was how hed ended in this dump hed ruined every piece of luck hed ever had by drinking had nearly lost his wife and almost screwed up his career if he got drunk now hed do something stupid maybe talk too much when slaughter came or even draw attention to those pictures in the corridor for sure hed need his senses to keep up with what was happening the time lost from a drunken stupor would fit the pattern though like gamblers who kept losing maybe that was what he wanted to keep losing maybe something in him was determined to seek failure well not this time this time he was going to be a winner he had lasted since the morning without booze the first day he had managed that in years and if hed suffered this long he could suffer just a little longer make it through the night the melody to those words occurred to him and he was laughing face this one hour then the next that was how the a a people were successful wasnt it sure take this one hour at a time but although dunlap had laughed his hands were shaking he suspected he would throw up and he set the bottle by the television went into the bathroom and drank some water hell youre hungry thats all a little sick from all that running but no matter the reason he was close to throwing up he stripped and showered and that helped the hot sting of the water flooding all the sweat and dust and tension from him but he nonetheless was sick and wishing for a drink the drink might make him even sicker but he wanted it attraction and repulsion so he put on fresh clothes why he didnt know he ought to go to bed but he was thinking maybe he would take a walk instead he sat down at the desk and tried a first draft of some notes just to flesh out what was on the tape and film he smoked and scribbled his impressions in no special order just to get the words down staring at the way his hand was shaking and the sentences were scrawled so poorly that he almost couldnt read them why not just one drink to brace you get you through this no and glancing from the pint of bourbon he kept smoking writing then he knew he had to get some sleep he flicked the lights off stretched out on the bed and concentrated to relax his stiff tense body hard it trembled and he eased the muscles in his feet his legs his torso slowly moving toward his head it might have been that he was even more fatigued than he suspected or that slowly moving up his body was like counting numbers backward or repeating nonsense phrases but his consciousness gave in before he ever reached his head he woke in what he later learned was half an hour almost screamed in the darkness but stopped himself he found that he was sitting in the bed that he was sweating and he wavered to his feet switching on the light he saw numerous insects clinging to his window he leaned against the wall and rubbed his forehead he had seen that image once again that strange halfhuman antlered figure but he always had associated it with nights of too much drinking dts bourbon nightmares this time though hed dreamed it even though hed been sober when the dream had first happened to him almost three years ago he hadnt thought much about it just another crazy nightmare but the dream had come back in a month and then another month and hed been slightly bothered by it after all his dreams before were always varied and although he reacted to them as he dreamed they never lingered after he wakened this dream though was like an imprint always vaguely with him haunting it was never different an upright antlered figure standing with its back to him and then the figure turning slowly its body twisted its head aimed past its shoulder staring at him that was all but once a month became twice and then three times and lately he had dreamed it almost every night he had thought of going to a doctor but he knew that the doctor would advise him to stop drinking and he wasnt ready for that hell if all the drinking did was cause a few bad dreams so what he willed himself to keep from dreaming it and for a month the tactic worked but soon the dream was back again and maybe its persistence not its nature was what bothered him a repetition like that wasnt normal but the image on its own was hardly normal either part man part deer part cat god knows what all and that grotesque beard and that upright body turning sideways its paws up its round eyes staring at him it was horrifying monstrous more than that it was hypnotic powerful like magic as if it were waiting for him drawing him and one day he would see it he was frightened by it by the riddle that it represented what was happening to him if he kept seeing this thing he would end up in an institution never mind an institution hed be in the crazy house he couldnt stand this anymore he had to talk to someone but he didnt know anyone he could call he crossed the room and grabbed the phone surprised to find that he dialed his home number that was something he never did when he was on a trip the trouble with his wife was so great that they barely managed talking facetoface let alone longdistance but he had to talk to her to tell her that hed managed to stop drinking that everything was going to be all right maybe he was too optimistic but he knew that he could stop at least as long as he was working on this story after that he couldnt say one day at a time he reminded himself just take it one day at a time he didnt even care that he would waken her that in new york it was two hours later he just had to talk to her and waited while the phone rang and kept waiting but there wasnt any answer still he waited and at last he had to admit that she was out but where would she be at this hour the doubts and the suspicions he hung up and glanced at the bourbon before he picked up a cigarette he had to talk to slaughter and get their differences resolved so he could continue working with the man and have this story when he found the number in the phone book and dialed it he was suddenly uncertain though he didnt know how he would do this how he would cancel the ill will he had created as the phone rang he was tempted to hang up but slaughter answered and he found that he was speechless yes who is it slaughter asked and then repeated dunlap waited paralyzed is there anybody slaughter asked and dunlap set the phone back on its cradle that was stupid whats the matter with you dunlap thought but he knew what the matter was all right although he had trouble admitting it he was ashamed of what hed done tonight regretful and embarrassed hed grown to like the man granted there wasnt any valid reason to pretend that they were friends dunlap nonetheless had thought of slaughter that way when they had gone out searching for the boy dunlap had felt that he was part of things that he belonged and was involved that feeling conflicted with his job his instincts and his training no reporter ought to get involved with what he wrote about his job was to watch objectively and then to write the story but then maybe that had been his trouble all along concentrating too much on himself and not on other people for just a little while this evening however he had felt involved and for that brief time he hadnt felt hollow then theyd searched the mansion and the boy had died and he had remembered why he came here he had realized how strong this story was becoming had been mindful of the good that it would do him and hed switched the tape recorder on before hed even considered what he was doing and the next thing he had started taking photographs now he thought about the grieving mother and the father how hed used them how hed planned to benefit from what would happen to the medical examiner he felt sorry for the boy and for the parents sorry for what had happened up there but hed kept taking photographs his career thats where his sympathies had finally been strongest and he couldnt stop his shame now and embarrassment so what do you intend to do do you plan to give up those pictures and that tape do you want to back off from the story no of course not youre damned right you dont because that shame youre feeling is just one more way to be a loser its not your fault that the boy died youre just here to write about that you can go on feeling all the shame you want but just make sure you get that story just make sure that your emotions dont intrude on how you make your living he knew that he was right but all the same he continued staring at the phone regardless of the friendship he imagined he had violated he still had to talk to slaughter to smooth things to fix them so he wasnt cut off from the story even so he debated for ten minutes before picking up the phone again he dialed slaughters number once more and waited while the phone kept ringing this time slaughters voice was angry yes god damn it rettig whats the matter get on out here dunlap didnt answer tell me what you want the angry voice demanded dunlap set the phone back on its cradle there was no way he could make a man who sounded like that sympathetic he would wait until the morning so he smoked his final cigarette and looked down at his notes and then he did a thing that he had never done before had never even dared because he was so bothered by it unsettled by his dream the image fixed in his mind turning glaring at him he was forced he didnt will it but was passive worked on compelled to sketch it he was staring at it swallowed by its eyes he kept on staring couldnt shift his head away he felt a darkness in his mind begin to open and he didnt weaken all at once it took him several minutes and he fought it he would later give himself that credit fought as hard as he could manage but resolve diminished into pointlessness and he was reaching for the bourbon three the medical examiner gave himself the first shot in the lip frowning at the mirror while he spread the injured portions and then slipped the needle in it stung and he was too quick on the plunger so that he felt the liquid spurting through his tissue all he could be grateful for was that he held his breath and didnt spill the liquid up across his lip and hence he couldnt taste it human antirabies serum manufactured from the blood of persons whod been vaccinated against rabies virus that would help his system to produce the necessary antibodies and in tandem with a second kind of treatment it was his best chance to survive contagion he winced as he drew the needle out next he set it down undid his pants and dropped them pulling down his underwear and reaching for a second needle that he inserted into one buttock this injection too was antirabies serum and he wouldnt need another needle until just about this time tomorrow even so that didnt give him comfort because if he winced to draw this needle out tomorrows shot would be the start of worse things it would not be antirabies serum it would be the second kind of treatment rabies vaccine anyone whod been injected with it cringed when they remembered it first developed by an englishman named semple who had done his research in india in it was rabies virus taken from the brains of rabbits mice or rats and then killed by incubation in carbolic acid the dead cells helped the bodys immune system although harmless in themselves they encouraged the body to reject the notyetrampant live cells that were like them but the trouble was that not just one injection of the vaccine was sufficient fourteen were the minimum and twentyone were even better each injection was given daily to the muscles of the abdomen a clockwise pattern was required because the shots were so excruciating that the muscles became extremely sensitive and maybe you could bear the first five or the second but the last few were an agony and this was not a thing the medical examiner was looking forward to he didnt have a choice though he had indirectly been exposed and if indeed he had it the disease would surely kill him without treatment there were only two examples in which persons had lived through the virus and there was doubt that they had really had it since their symptoms had been like encephalitis with the treatment he still took the chance that he would die from the disease that it would be too strong for his precautions but the likelihood was small and anyway as he kept thinking he didnt have a choice even rare reactions to the vaccine like a fever or paralysis were nothing when compared with certain death but all the same the start of treatment didnt calm his fears the dog had gone through preexposure vaccination it had died regardless the start of treatment didnt calm his sorrow either he was thinking of the boy lying on the table in the autopsy room of how he should have had the foresight not to give him the sedative those parents how could he absolve himself he could still hear the mother shrieking well he meant to find out everything he could about this thing when he was finished he would know this virus more than any other he had ever worked on he had once been famous as an expert in pathology so now he would discover just how much an expert he could be thats right you think you know so much get moving nows the time to prove it so he pulled his pants up buckled them and thinking of the tests he would perform he turned and started from his office owens would be here soon with the dogs brain to compare what he had found with what the medical examiner would find inside the boy downstairs meanwhile he himself would use the simple test for negri bodies he would also use a more elaborate test in which a brain smear was treated with fluorescent antirabies serum and examined underneath an ultraviolet microscope to watch the symptoms of the virus hed inject a half dozen newborn mice with portions of the boys brain he would also want a picture of the virus using the electron microscope whatever this thing was he meant to have a look at it and when he opened that body he would understand why the paralysis occurred so quickly why it worsened with sedation as he walked along the corridor he saw the nurses staring at him word had gotten around all right and fast as only people in a hospital could spread it they were looking at a man whose error had been fatal to a patient then he told himself to get control they maybe were just frightened by a thing they didnt understand or maybe they were startled by the grim way he was walking well he didnt plan to ask them and if they knew what was good for them theyd stay away from him he reached the door down to the basement he thought of slaughter who would need injections and the mother and the man who had been bitten and the man who owned the dog there were too many details he had not attended to what was more he needed sleep and food he hadnt eaten since this morning well he would do this and take care of everything with owens here to help him he could find the time to call those people get them down here for their shots but he knew what he really wantedto learn what had killed this boy the medical examiner reached the bottom of the steps and went through to the corridor he came to the far end of the hallway and entered the morgue in the anteroom he washed his hands and put on a lab coat a cap a mask and rubber gloves just to be exact and avoid contaminating his samples he even stepped inside protective coverings for his shoes and then with nothing further to detain him he pushed through the door and he was in the autopsy room green tile on the walls reflected the glare of fluorescent lights in the ceiling a counter with steel sinks and trays of instruments was flanked by three tables each with gutters and a drain for blood the tables were arranged sideways as he faced them one behind the other and the third was where his eyes were focused on that tiny lump beneath the sheet he walked with slow determination toward it breathing through the clinging vapor that collected on the inside of his face mask then he paused and gently pulled the sheet back staring at the naked body on the table so small so battered all those bruises from the fury it had been through there was caked blood on the lips which swollen slightly parted showed some damage to the front teeth but these details werent important even with them the boy was striking blond angelic innocent this was the first time that the medical examiner had worked on someone hed observed in life the first time he had done this to a patient but then that was just the point he never had a patient that was why hed become a medical examinerto keep these feelings of regret away from him to shun these awful obligations to the memory of the living well hed brought this on himself he had become responsible and he paused to eliminate emotion before reaching for the scalpel that he would use to peel the hair away he took a breath and didnt want to do this but he leaned close to select his point of contact while the eyes flickered suddenly below him and then stared at him but they were purged of any innocence as old and stark as any eyes hed seen and they kept staring when the boys hand came up the room appeared to swivel and his own hand to his mouth beneath his face mask the medical examiner stumbled backward screaming four marge had stayed on duty at the police station until everything was finished at the mansion there was nothing she could do up there to help but she could free a man from night shift on the radio while he went up to lend a hand and slaughter needed every officer in town so she had gotten the news in bits and pieces from the radio and when shed found out what at last had happened she had done her best to keep from crying slaughter didnt need the people he depended on to break down when he most required them marge couldnt help it though and she had sat there wiping at her tears relaying messages she knew the mother and the father she had gone to school with older sisters in the mothers family she had known this woman since the woman was a baby why the woman lived just two blocks down from marges house and marge had often gone to visit to see the boy to bring him presents now the boy was dead and partly out of sympathy for what the parents must be feeling partly out of sorrow for the boy she wept but she did her job and when the man she had relieved came back to resume his shift she tried to hide that shed been crying all the same the man had noticed and he sat with her a while until he felt that she could drive you need a little sleep is all he told her but they both knew that it wouldnt be that easy there were many people now who wouldnt get much sleep tonight and she had thanked him walking to her car hed asked if he should walk outside with her but she had thought about the radio with no one to attend to it and she had told him that he really didnt have to anyhow from five years of work with slaughter she had learned the value of control and she was certain shed be fine so she had gone out to her car and driven from the parking lot almost midnight on a saturday she normally would have expected lots of movement in the streets especially outside the bars young trail hands come in for a weekends fun but she was not surprised when she saw little action a few cars and pickup trucks a couple of men who stood outside a bar and sipped from beer cans but in contrast with a normal weekend this was more like a quiet tuesday and she wondered if the word had spread or if ranchers losing stock had stayed home watching for some trouble with the cattle but no matter what the reason things were quiet and that bothered her as she drove through the outskirts she saw lots of houselights on and that was hardly normal either she wished that shed had the chance to talk to slaughter but hed been so busy and she didnt want to stay at home alone so she drove past her house went two more blocks and if there were lights on she meant to go in and console the mother and the father there were lights on for sure the whole house both in front and back she saw the plumbers truck the car before it both the mother and the father must be home then and she parked her car wondering if she would be intruding well shed come this far and after all it was her duty so she got out locked her car and started up the sidewalk she could hear the crickets screeching she was peering toward the lights in all the windows wondering if anybody else had come to visit when she heard the voices loud two men it seemed and they were shouting then they were screaming marge was paralyzed the cool night air was still the crickets silent now as someone ran out onto the porch as if for help a man she once had met from two doors down and he was staring at her jesus shes gone crazy what abruptly marge heard the snarling instinct almost made her run away but she moved slowly forward as the window in the dining room came bursting toward the porch two figures struggling through the broken edges falling writhing on the porch the mother and the father the mother snarling the father screaming and the mother was on top where she was scratching biting marge ran up the steps youve got to help me get her off him but shes crazy the neighbor said marge would later recollect how she had thought of slaughter at that moment wondering how the chief would try to handle this she wanted him to say that she had done the right thing when an instant could make all the difference she pushed at the man behind her shouting go get help as she looked all around for something to subdue the mother she wasnt about to grab the mother and get bitten like the father screaming there but when she saw the thing she needed in one corner of the porch she couldnt bring herself to grab it warren evidently had been playing with it the day before he died she didnt want to touch it but the fathers screaming was too much she reached for it slipping on the broken glass she lurched toward the mother raised the baseball bat high above her head and thinking about slaughter started swinging five slaughter waited in his locked house until rettig and hammel arrived he shouted out the window that theyd better look around before they left the cruiser so they flashed their searchlights but there wasnt anything he went outside to meet them staring past them scanning all around them and then pointing this way well what is it dont you think i wish i knew they stiffened they were dressed in jeans and sport shirts a gunbelt strapped around each waist they saw that slaughter had his own gun out and they were drawing theirs as they walked toward the fence where he was pointing shine your flashlights the beams arced out across the field but i dont understand this rettig said just keep your back protected keep looking all around you slaughter told him there was something out here hell it came up on my porch slaughter climbed over the fence and flashed his light while they jumped down beside him then he started walking with them through the field your porch thats right slaughter was embarrassed determined not to admit that hed run in panic he felt safer with his men to help him but he couldnt subdue the burning in his stomach and he wished they wouldnt ask too many questions but they kept on well what is it rettig asked again i told you i dont know i never got a look at them your porch though i was talking to you on the phone when i heard it when i looked it wasnt there then slaughter saw what he was searching for and wished that hed been wrong with his flashlight aimed he glimpsed the fallen objects in the field and he was hurrying through the grass toward them he stopped and stared the horses were mangled like the steer that he had seen by old doc markle like the other steer that he had seen by bodines pickup truck except that these were worse so mutilated that he almost didnt recognize them he heard his men gasp some damned thing was out here all right god im sorry chief these horses they were all i slaughter stalked toward the gully i heard three of them up in those bushes two more by the barn id like to wait a second chief rettig grabbed his shoulder slaughter pulled his hand away these goddamned wait a minute we dont even know what well be up against you say that there were five of them thats right like a bobcat five of them i know it doesnt make much sense but i dont care about that sure bobcats dont hunt in packs but anything can happen what i mean is we need help to do this we need better light you want the sun to come up damn it theyll be long gone when that happens you can find a tracker who for christ sake i already thought of that these cowboys maybe think theyre expert trackers but i never saw one yet that knew enough to be able to trail a sick man to the outhouse if we dont go now well never find whatever did this im sorry chief but im not going slaughter scowled at rettig then turned to hammel what about you hammel shrugged you dont have a lot to say since we saw cliffords body well i figure ill just watch and learn hammel said yeah i bet you will slaughter spun to face the gully even with his flashlight and the moon he couldnt see much in the bushes and his anger became fear again okay youre right its stupid to go in there looking at these horses i just dont you worry well be sure to get whatever did this rettig said but not right now slaughters anger changed to grief he had to get away from here but what about your horses rettig asked leave them hell what difference does it make slaughter heard his men walking behind him as he climbed the fence and when he stepped down from the house he heard the phone again whoever kept on calling he was thinking livid he would make sure that they stopped it he was running cursing toward the house but when he burst in grabbing for the phone he heard a voice this time and as he listened he mentally started running again it seemed as if the last few days hed never stopped six he charged along the corridor the nurses staring at him rettig and hammel were on guard back at his house and he was thinking of his mangled horses hoping that the two men would be safe as he pushed through the door marked morgue and rushed across the anteroom to push against the second door the morgue looked like a shambles there was blood and broken glass and scattered instruments the medical examiner was leaning against a table he had blood across his gown his face mask hanging around his neck his face was pale in contrast with the blood he looked as if hed been sick although he might have seemed that way because the neon lights reflecting off the green tiles tinted everything a sickly pallor the medical examiner was shaking and the man beside him wearing street clothes didnt look much better owens slaughter recognized him as a veterinary whom he had come across from time to time and had last seen on friday morning when theyd looked at old doc markle on the floor beside the mangled steer the two men turned to him and slaughter kept glancing all around the smell of chemicals of sicksweet clotting blood he didnt understand it he inhaled drawing breath to ask them but the medical examiner interrupted i just killed him slaughter stared at him and then at owens he was puzzled walking toward them look youd better take it easy when you called you sounded like youd had a breakdown but i killed him yes i know you told me on the phone you said that at the mansion but you had no way of knowing that the sedative would kill him whats this blood here i dont understand whats happened christ almighty listen while i tell you i just killed him slaughter spun toward owens whats the matter with him over there youd better take a look owens had trouble speaking he pointed toward the far end of the room beyond the final table where a smear of blood was trickling down the wall and slaughter felt apprehensive again he started forward although a part of him was holding back he peered down past the corner of the table and he saw the tiny feet on the floor then he leaned a little closer and he saw the boy his belly sliced wide open christ you mutilated him no i told you i killed him slaughter swung and glared you said that he was dead back at the mansion i was certain that he was i would have bet my reputation bet your reputation never mind that i did every standard test and he was dead well then he seemed to come back from the dead and tried to grab me slaughter felt as if hed heard some unknown language the words made no sense they didnt have a meaning then he understood what hed been told and he stepped back from the medical examiner my god youve really had a breakdown youve gone crazy no just listen i dont mean that the way it sounds i hope to god you dont i mean the paralytic stage of the disease must have been aggravated by the sedative slaughter shook his head in confusion he was so unconscious that his life signs couldnt be detected what the hell is this now slaughter asked him edgar allan poe no please i listened for his heartbeat i checked his breathing i even took his temperature when i got back here everything was negative you did a brain scan i did everything i told you he was dead as far as i could tell i started working with him on the table and he looked up and he grabbed for my throat i take this slowly one thing at a time youre saying he was catatonic thats it thats your story on occasion it can happen rarely there are cases where a patient has been certified as dead and he wakes up on a slab at the morgue slaughter looked at owens this is true im not a doctor but ive heard of things like that its rare just as he said but it can happen but jesus a brain scan look the medical examiner said once we thought that no sign of a heartbeat proved that someone had died then we found out that a persons heart could beat so weakly that our instruments couldnt detect it so we made up other tests for body heat for electrical impulses in the brain the fact is we dont know exactly when a person dies a patient goes to surgery hes doing fine when suddenly his heart and brain fail we try everything we can to resuscitate him no success hes dead then all of a sudden on its own his heart starts beating again so tell me how that happened you explain it i cant slaughter looked at them more disturbed all right lets assume your arguments correct the sedative wore off along with the paralysis he grabbed for me we fought i knew i couldnt let him bite me scratch me never mind how small he was i couldnt let him touch me he kept coming at me i was kicking yelling for help but those two doors muffled the sound we dodged around the table i got cornered i was scared and lashed out with the scalpel i was holding and i killed him they were silent staring at each other oh my god the medical examiner pounded a fist on the table slaughter walked close take it easy but i take it easy everything is going to be all right the medical examiner trembled something else the mice died owens told them what are you talking about we have mice down at the lab for doing tests on viruses owens said the mice were born and raised in sterile conditions as the parents were and those before them so we know theyre not contaminated we can study any symptoms they develop from injections we give them and be certain that the injections caused the symptom its a way of isolating what were dealing with and finding what will cure it anyhow a standard test for rabies is to inject infected tissue into mice if they live then were not dealing with the virus we suspected if they die then we have perfect samples of the virus to examine well our first tests on this virus werent conclusive oh we knew that it was deadly but the slides we studied looked a little different than they should have so i did more tests instead of looking at the dogs brain i injected several mice and now theyre dead owens nodded well that isnt news you said that it was deadly but the mice dont normally develop symptoms for at least a week these mice died in less than four hours it was like a spedup version of the rabies symptoms first a subtle difference in behavior then hostility lack of coordination finally paralysis and death the hostility was quite pronounced although they didnt snap at one another only at the glass enclosures but the point is that instead of surviving for seven days they barely lasted four hours slaughters mind raced making jumps in logic show me owens frowned at him i want to see them show me where they are slaughter insisted i didnt have the instruments i needed an electron microscope for one thing so i came up here to never mind just show me over there i brought them with me slaughter pivoted toward a metal case and reached to lift its clasp its all right if i open this owens nodded everything is sterile you wont be infected slaughter pushed the lid up staring at the specimens in sealed glass containers he saw the white fur of mice and something else that he had dreaded but expected lifting one container showing it the medical examiner had turned now he and owens staring and the mouse in there was snarling at them slaughter felt the scrape of its claws through the glass but they were dead i tell you owens insisted he crossed to slaughter pulling out the other glass containers in them every mouse was frantic youre certain slaughter asked him dont you think i know when somethings dead the medical examiner added as certain as i was when i examined that boy they continued staring at the frantic mice then i believe you slaughter grimaced i didnt but i do now i dont know whats going on but i do know that its happening he frowned at the farthest table what about the boy the mother and the father wont believe us when they see him i cant think of any way to tell them then we wont the medical examiner braced his shoulders coming toward them color in his face now ill continue with the autopsy id have to do it anyway to learn how the virus works ill fix that slash across his stomach so it looks like it was part of the autopsy and the three of us will be the only ones who know suddenly they looked at one another understanding the significance of their conspiracy ever after their dependence on each other they were silent slaughter nodded owens with him owens did you bring the samples for the microscope ive got them with the mice okay then lets get started slaughter if you go up to my office youll find a stack of books beside my desk search through the master index and read everything that you can find on rabies thats not what were dealing with its close enough though and we cant waste time from now on telling you what well be doing slaughter studied him how long till you know at least a couple of hours slaughter glanced at his watch and saw that it was three am i dont look forward to the morning for a lot of reasons theyll be coming to me with their questions well lets see if we can find the answers slaughter nodded trying to smile in encouragement but failing he started toward the doorway seven this is what a rabies virus looks like slaughter peered at where the medical examiner was pointing yes i know i read about it slaughter told him fine now heres a micrograph from the electron microscope the virus from the dead dog slaughter watched the medical examiner put down the micrograph beside the book that theyd been looking at he studied it he thought about it quite a while well this ones thinner than the rabies virus yes thats one of several contrasts normally we say a rabies virus has a bullet shape but this one looks like i dont know a missile owens said they glanced at him why not all right then a missile the medical examiner pointed at the micrograph again a missile is in keeping with the speed of this thing anyhow the point is that a lot of viruses are shaped in general like this vesicular stomatitis would be one but this thing isnt quite like any of them its much sleeker and while theres an indentation at the bottom theres no sign of an appendage there whats more the nervous system of the boy was not infected slaughter looked at him he knew enough from what hed read that rabies moved along the nervous system fed off it and finally destroyed it he frowned but i thought that yes i know it shouldnt be this is unlike any virus ive ever studied it did infect his limbic brain however slaughter didnt understand he tried to recollect what he had read but nothing on that subject came to him the limbic brain the medical examiner repeated its the part around which all the other sections of our brain developed its sometimes called reptilian but i think of it as animal it causes our survival instincts our emotions and aggressions infection there would help explain why that boy acted as he did put simply he became an animal but what about the coma he went into just dont rush me wait until i get to that its my guess that this virus is transmitted through the bloodstream that explains the quick communication through the body you should know that when i looked at where the boy said he was cut by glass i found some evidence that hed been bitten when the doctor at the hospital examined him he had no reason to assume the boy was lying and besides the wound was jagged as if from a broken bottle but the boy was bitten all right there isnt any question not more than a day ago the virus travels through the bloodstream its selective only certain cells appeal to it the limbic brain the medical examiner nodded it produces the symptoms of rabies very quickly passes through lets say a twelvehour phase in humans paralyzes and produces a coma evidently when the brain shuts down the virus becomes dormant when the victim regains consciousness the virus starts to work again its really quite efficient feeding until it produces near death and then holding off until the victim can sustain it once again because it passes through the bloodstream it would show up in the salivary glands infect the spittle and pass to another victim in a bite but if you were cut already and you came in contact with its blood youd get it just the same the medical examiner pointed toward the scab on slaughters cheek and slaughter suddenly was worried raising one hand to it frowning its too late to worry slaughter if youd been infected wed have known about it yesterday but next time dont be so damned cavalier if what you say is true there wasnt anything that you could do about it anyway thats right our vaccine would be useless the medical examiner reached up to touch his own face then his lips scabbed and swollen i got lucky too i would have had it by now if this cut had been contaminated as it is i gave myself two antirabies shots absolutely useless christ i dont know what were going to do you say you never saw a virus like this you never even heard about it slaughter asked the medical examiner shook his head well i did owens told them they studied him i read about it owens said nineteen sixtynine in ethiopia a herd of cattle came down with a special form of rabies little frenzy just paralysis they all collapsed the owner didnt know exactly what they had he gave them up for dead and then they all recovered what the medical examiner looked astonished nothing can survive it thats impossible as far as i know this herd did the problem is they still retained the virus and in several days they manifested symptoms once again they had to be destroyed youre certain it was rabies oh yes all the later tests confirmed it and i read about another case in india two years ago but this time it was water buffalo but this thing isnt rabies any vaccine they developed wouldnt be of use here even if it would there isnt any time to get it what would cause a brand new kind of virus slaughter asked you tell me the medical examiner responded you want to know the truth i wonder why it doesnt happen all the time never mind a thing like legionnaires disease which evidently was around for quite a while but no one diagnosed it never mind a thing like staph or gonorrhea which mutated into forms resistant to a drug like penicillin lets just go along with my contention that this virus is a new one asking what would cause it is like asking why our ancestors developed a big brain from their limbic system and turned into humans theres no ready answer evolution is an accident a cell develops in an unusual fashion something happens to the dna we like to think that everything is fixed and ordered but it isnt things are changing all around us not so quickly that we recognize the change but its occurring people growing taller dogs whose breeds are now defective dying out we recognize extremes of course we call them monsters but the really startling changes are occurring in those simple life forms that we hardly ever notice cells their time scale is much different from our own much faster evolution has sped up for them the chance for random variants but evolution doesnt even have to be in stages quantum leaps can happen in an instant every time a person gets an x ray tiny bullets zinging past those chromosomes you want a model lets try this one lets assume weve got a dog the dog has rabies but the symptoms havent shown up yet the dog is hurt though lets say that its got a broken leg or some internal swelling so the owner takes it in for x rays and the dog is treated and gets better but the damage has been done the rabies virus has by chance been struck by just one x ray hell it only takes one mutant cell that lodges in the limbic brain and starts to reproduce now the owner goes on holiday he takes the dog up into the mountains the dog goes crazy and it runs away contagion starts what you said about these dogs up in the hills psychopathic animal behavior slaughter told him sure just two roads from the valley owens said the mountains are around us so the virus has been localized but why did no one ever recognize it until now because so far as i remember no one ever tested for it the medical examiner said ranchers maybe shot a few dogs and then buried them but did you ever have a look at one owens shook his head well there you have it but you told me friday night that people have been bitten by them slaughter said they would have come in for the rabies treatment but in spite of that have developed symptoms and they did come in for treatment and there wasnt any problem so the dog that bit them didnt have the virus or the virus didnt mutate until later thats no argument against the model but the virus is so virulent that everything would have it by now slaughter insisted i dont think so the attacks weve seen were plainly murderous i doubt too many animals or people would survive them plus the victims must be weakened by the virus when the winter comes it likely kills them thats a natural control we havent studied any long term consequences of the virus maybe theres a calming process i dont know at this point so why now would the virus show up suddenly in town you know why as well as i do all it takes is just one dog to wander in but i think theres another reason dont forget the winter was a hard one it drives victims down from where their normal hunting routes are in the mountains thats one version of a model anyhow i might be wrong at least its something what we do know in addition to our tests is that the victims are nocturnal the medical examiner pointed toward the case that contained the jars of supposedly dead mice that owens had brought from the veterinary clinic owens had discovered that the mice were peaceful if concealed in darkness that their rage was manifested only when their eyes were aggravated by light thats another symptom this virus has in common with the rabies virus the medical examiner continued intense sensitivity to light that was why the dead boy snarled the way he did the moon was shining through the upper windows of the mansion and that helps explain why so much trouble has occurred at night the victims hide and sleep in daylight then they come out after dark but now the moon is almost full and theyre reacting to it one thing more we know that theyre not dangerous to one another owens said when i put some of them together in the same container they ignored each other staring fiercely at the light and lunging at the glass around them slaughter thought about the figures he had seen up in the bushes by his barn tonight you mean they hunt in packs not necessarily although its possible but what would make them do that look this virus gives control back to the limbic brain and makes it act the way it once did several hundred thousand years ago to hunt in packs is natural its even a survival trait individual behavior at least in humans is by contrast very recent eight wheeler braced himself up in the tree and waited for the sunrise hed been up there all night and his back and legs were sore and twisted from the way he was positioned among the branches he was numb from lack of sleep his eyelids heavy plus his hands were cramped around the rifle he was holding but for all that he was satisfied his effort had been worth the pain he smiled toward the murky rangeland and the object lying by the sagebrush yes hed gotten what he had come for which was something very different for him getting what he wanted things had not gone well for him in quite a while since and that october afternoon when he had shot that hippie on occasion when he managed to be honest with himself he recognized that he had been in trouble long before that with his wife and in particular his son but if hed helped to make that trouble it was nothing that they couldnt have worked out among themselves what had made the difference were those goddamned hippies who had come to town they were the cause of this their loud mouths and their garbage he remembered how he had gone to town and first had seen them angered by their sloppiness their easy answers to the countrys problems sure drop out and act like children more than that like animals oh that was some solution all right they were just afraid to go to vietnam is all too goddamned yellow to protect their country he had been there when the town had forced them from the valley he had helped to push them out hed kicked and thrown rocks as had others he had shut their filthy mouths for them and hoped theyd learned their lesson but his son had gone up to that lousy commune then and he himself had been made to look like a fool no son of his was going to end up like those freaks not so that the town could make jokes about him plus those hippies might be dangerous the drugs they took they might do anything wheeler had known he had to get his son back so hed gone up to the commune and of course they tried to fight him to hide what they were up to thered been no choice hed had to shoot the hippie who had come at him it was selfdefense the town would understand that wheeler had figured but it hadnt understood and his son had turned against him as well and he himself had gone to prison for two years oh that was fine the way his friends had turned against him he couldnt count on anyone he should have learned that lesson years before but he had learned it then all right his son had run off after that and then while he himself had been in prison he had gone through all that trouble with the guard the guy just wouldnt let him alone there wasnt any choice except to fight by jesus he wouldnt be pushed around so instead of getting time off for good behavior hed been forced to serve the full extent of his sentence what did he expect if they were out to get him he was powerless and then his wife had turned against him shed been keeping up the ranch while he was gone she hadnt come to see him but hed figured that shed been so busy that she couldnt get away the day he came home he found out the truth however she told him that shed stayed to manage things because she didnt want to leave the place to strangers but she wasnt going to live with him and now that he was back she wasnt needed she was leaving he had fixed her for that she had limped out to the taxi when it came for her he didnt help her with the bags he let the driver do that he just stood there on the porch and cracked his knuckles telling her that he would never take her back that if she tried to come back he would beat her even worse and that had been the last he saw of her well that was fine as far as he was concerned shed never been good for him always nagging at him about how much he was drinking about the work he didnt want to do christ he was better off without her and without that mouthy troublemaking son he didnt need them he could get along without them but wheeler had trouble all the same his former friends avoided him although he expected that they really hadnt been his friends all theyd wanted was a sucker to buy them drinks sure theyd been lying to him all the way but hed found new friends trail hands and a couple ranchers in the valley who were not so goddamned proper that they wouldnt take a little time out to relax a man got stale if all he did was work that wasnt any kind of life but then wheelers cattle got sick one year the next year there were many stillbirths after that the price of beef went down there wasnt any way to get ahead once everybody turned on you this year the bank was making noises about mortgage payments that he hadnt met the barn was close to falling down the winter had been so bad that hed lost more stock than he had counted on and now the predators were moving in wheeler had found the first steer friday morning so disfigured that he almost didnt recognize what it had been hed never seen a carcass like it not just one wolf or a coyote but a whole damned pack had done this in a frenzy he heard that night about another rancher who had found a steer like this and in the morning when hed gone out to check his stock hed found three other mangled steers and he couldnt stop from cursing hell they meant to ruin him he heard that a dozen ranchers in the valley had also found cattle like this and they didnt know what they could do except to post some guards and maybe have a meeting there was no sense in their leaving poison that the cattle might get into but wheeler knew what to do he was not about to let this thing continue he meant to stop it dead right now those predators had picked the wrong man to play games with in the afternoon he chose three steers and led them to the spot where he had found the mutilated carcasses the predators were in a routine choosing this location each time with the foothills so close they just figured they could slip down for an easy kill and aggravate the man who owned their supper but tonight he would surprise them first he staked the cattle leaving portions of the mangled steers to spread their odor and to hide his scent if he had lately not been good at ranching he was very good at hunting and hed gone back to his house to eat and get his rifle and the benzedrine hed been given by a trucker in a bar one night hed walked back toward where he had staked the cattle that was crucial not to drive his truck and warn whatever might be watching when hed come to within a quarter mile he had eased down crawling inching toward a solitary tree that was between him and the three steers from there with the moonlight to help him he would have a good view and he stayed low by the tree until sunset waiting even longer for the darkness to enclose him before slowly standing hidden by the tree and climbing through its branches to a cradle near the top he moved as silently as he was able then he settled back against the trunk and swallowed a benny staring toward his cattle he checked his rifle and made sure that he hadnt lost the extra rounds that hed put in his pocket and he knew that he was ready even with his jacket he was cold but that was just because he couldnt warm himself by moving he ignored the cramps in his legs and scowled toward the cattle as the moon rose higher and higher the cattle were nervous but he saw no sign of anything coming toward them soon he swallowed another benny abruptly he saw shadows moving and aimed his rifle only to realize that the shadows were only in his imagination shit this idea had been wonderful when he had planned it being here was something different and he almost climbed down going to his house when what seemed several hours later they were out there first he heard them baying at the moon he tensed then he saw a silhouette to one side next another just behind it as he blinked he saw the darkness filled with them he couldnt wait until they came so close that they would see the tethers on the cattle dimly sensing they were ambushed he quickly aimed but he couldnt chance a poor shot that would scare them off and make this agony of waiting worthless he would have to do this properly and breath held he was thinking of his wife his son the prison guard his former friends imagining that they were swarming out there he was easing his finger onto the trigger as one silhouette became distinct and when he fired the recoil knocked him hard against the tree trunk he worked the rifles bolt and fired again but they were gone now although he saw a huddled figure out there by the sagebrush it was still and silent and he smiled to think that he had dropped one maybe more if he kept waiting and he shivered from excitement from the bennies and the cold but he didnt see further movement in the shadows he just heard them howling somewhere in the distance then the howling stopped when the moon went down he waited even longer once he thought he saw something but it darted so fast that he didnt know what it was and he wanted to go down and see what he had shot but hed stuck things out this long he might as well stay put a little longer for a change hed see a project to the finish but his legs were sore and twisted and the darkness was turning gray the sun about to rise at last he climbed down the tree and hobbled toward the figure from the distance it had seemed like a wolf but now as he came closer it looked more like a bobcat smaller with long hind legs and a face that wasnt pointed but flat the fur was draped around it more than growing on it the fur was ragged torn in places and some sections of the skin were bare there wasnt any tail and coming closer wheeler was frowning thinking that this was his imagination trying hard to calm himself but then he stopped and saw the feet and hands and nose and what he felt was like a replay of that instant twentythree years ago god hed shot somebody not a man a boy the kid looked maybe twelve but why was this kid dressed in ragged pelts the way he was had children from the town come out to scare the cattle had some campers but wheeler knew the answer even as he asked those useless questions that long hair below the shoulders christ hed shot another hippie he pivoted scowling around him had another bunch come through here was that first bunch still up in the mountains he had heard that they had left but if they hadnt this might be one of their kids that big hole in its back from where the bullet had burst out that motionless silent body he was nudging at it with his boot but nothing happened he breathed shaking how could he explain this first one now another and the town would act the way it had the first time no one would believe him when he said it was an accident theyd send him back to prison and he knew he couldnt bear that not that guard again he couldnt stand it just because these goddamned hippies came down here to take things out on him he started digging with his rifle butt but all he did was chip the wood because the ground out here was hard and he needed tools a pick and shovel quick before somebody found this he stumbled from the figure bumping against the tree and lurching toward his ranchhouse then he started running have to hurry get that pick and shovel make the hole deep make sure scavengers dont dig up the body sprinkle it with quicklime he ran harder his fear had changed to a frenzy his speed now almost manic as he saw the ranchhouse in the distance while his stomach churning he kept charging toward it part five the lake one slaughter stood before the glass partition numbed by what he saw cody who had found the boy inside the mansion last night and been bitten was now snarling writhing to escape the straps that bound him to the bed his throat was bandaged and the damage there might help explain the hoarse inhuman sounds he made but slaughter didnt think so no the virus was at work the man was like a lunatic and slaughter thought again about the medical examiners remark about the madness from the moon its just a guess he told the orderly beside him turn his room lights off and maybe that will calm him god i wish hed pass out even with the window as a buffer slaughter felt the snarling touch him he was nauseated by the foam that drooled from codys mouth the snarling and writhing became more extreme cody tried to twist his head to bite the nearest strap around him i cant watch this swallowing slaughter glanced at where marge waited at the far end of the hallway she was peering through another window slaughter knew that the mother of the dead boy was inside there and he took one final look at cody before walking slowly toward marge i just hit her marge said not turning to him there was nothing else i could do i didnt mean to hit her so hard she was you cant go on like this but shes got a fractured skull youd rather that shed killed her husband no i marge faced him then take it easy you did what you thought was necessary as it is shes going to live thats all that really counts although i dont know what theyre going to do with her there isnt any way they know to cure her he peered through the window at the mother who was strapped unconscious to her bed bandages around her skull an intravenous bottle draining toward a needle in her arm we know this much slaughter said she shouldnt be sedated so the fact that shes unconscious from the blow you gave her might turn out to be the best thing all considered if she were awake shed be hysterical like cody up the hall even here slaughter heard the snarling from the other room marge leaned against the wall hey why not go home slaughter suggested there isnt anything that you can do here youll be told whatever happens what about yourself oh dont you know im trying for a record how long i can go without sleep he hoped that would make her smile but she only stared marge i know that what you did was hard she studied him i know that if thered been another way you would have chosen it i think that you did fine i wish you wouldnt feel so bad youd feel the same of course i would but then id need a friend like you to say what i just said to you i mean it you did fine i dont want you to worry thanks marge bit her lip but it doesnt help all the same go home ill get word to you she nodded even so she lingered come on let me walk you down he touched her arm and she responded walking with him along the hallway neither looked at cody at the corner she glanced back at the windows in the wall down there and then she went downstairs with him and he was watching by the back door as she walked across the parking lot that poor sad lonely tortured woman he was thinking when she raised that baseball bat she must have been in agony he waved in farewell as she drove away then thought a moment before heading toward the phone inside the nurses station hed avoided making this call much too long reluctantly dialing parsons number and the man answered sleepy angry slaughter eight oclock on sunday cant this wait until a decent hour no we really have to talk well jesus slaughter this is serious we dont have too much time parsons exhaled all right then ill see you in my office in an hour but this better be important oh dont worry slaughter told him youll wish that you didnt know slaughter frowned and hung up he was thinking that in all the years hed lived here he had never been to parsons house and he wondered why just now hed thought of that with everything he had to keep his mind on then he guessed it was because of all the power games that parsons liked to play the man kept his subordinates away from where he lived because he wanted to dissociate them keep them from assuming friendship that way he intimidated them but slaughter didnt care much he had never been afraid of parsons although in truth he didnt want to go through this with him and needing to keep occupied he went out driving to the station where already even early in the morning there were calls about more prowlers about mangled cats and dogs and cattle several missing persons well its just beginning he decided then he did his best to shut his mind off as he cleaned up washing in the mens room changing from his sweaty shirt to one he kept inside his office drawer no parsons wasnt going to like this and a half hour later as the two men slaughter unshaven sat facing one another it was worse than slaughter had expected parsons had been fifteen minutes late and slaughter had been forced to wait outside the locked doors of the potters field gazette then parsons had shown up freshly showered wearing a suit and tie no not yet wait until were in my office the man had told him and upstairs the man had listened then quite calmly answered you expect me to believe this i dont know i wish i didnt really slaughter think about it all youre sure of is that a boy came down with some disease or maybe he just had a breakdown then his mother got hysterical and fought her husband cody is in shock hes got a raging fever theres your explanation youve forgotten cliffords body no i havent clifford was attacked all right and likely by a wild dog as you say but were there any tests performed just to find out what attacked him at the time we had no reason to suspect a virus so the only tests were on that sick dog and the evidence was very close to rabies but the medical examiner look slaughter i dont want to disillusion you but everybody knows that he came back here because no one else would have him he broke down in philadelphia and it wouldnt surprise me if he made a crisis of this just so hed seem important as i interpret what you told me theres been no time to test the dead boy for this socalled virus granted that his brain had been infected if what the medical examiner says is true but that could be because of many things to do a proper slide for the electron microscope takes at least a couple of days i gather that some steps can be eliminated if a persons in a hurry which explains how owens had his samples ready but i know this muchthe slides from that dogs brain were made so quickly that we shouldnt put much faith in them ill need a lot more to convince me think about it as i told you which makes more sense rabies or a brandnew virus you werent there to see the boy but i heard all about it slaughter straightened sure whats the matter slaughter did you think i didnt know i run the goddamned paper im the mayor i have all kinds of people watching for me if those parents choose to prosecute the medical examiner is in shit to his eyebrows he administered a sedative without the proper cautions now of course hes going to say a virus killed the boy he surely wont incriminate himself his word on this is hardly what youd call objective and thats something else i want to talk to you about well leave aside for now the issue of this woman you employ who hit the mother with a baseball bat although i wonder why you havent charged her and im positive therell be a lawsuit lets just think about the medical examiner he was the last man id have chosen to do tests on that boy he its not important if youd seen the boy youd know he wasnt acting normally thats exactly what we pay you for to deal with things like that to stop trouble not cause more of it youve had it fairly easy slaughter not too much goes on here now the first time something unusual happens you come waking me on sunday morning with your crazy notions about sealing off the valley and exterminating all the livestock slaughter scowled he kept his fists gripped tightly by his legs where he was sitting and he felt his face go warm he tried to control his breathing i said if it came to that i dont know if its necessary im just asking your opinion well it isnt necessary lets relax a minute slaughter let me talk about my job a little i was mayor for many years before you came here i was mayor when all those hippies came to town to name an instance and i knew that thered be trouble plus i knew that all i had to do was flex my muscles and arrange to move them out of town i didnt though because there would have been complaints about that people saying that sure no one liked those hippies but maybe we should have let them have a chance and so i waited for the opportunity their foul mouths and their dope and garbage got extreme and still i waited because i knew people shortly would come begging me to move them which precisely is what happened now i got what i intended but i did it diplomatically does all that make some sense to you slaughters gaze intensified the truth is that the people always know whats best for them a proper leader only goes along with what they tell him parsons said thats why theyve kept me as their mayor all these years because i understand that all i want is what they tell me so you say theres going to be an epidemic well thats fine lets wait and see the evidence is inconclusive but ill keep an open mind about it even so the steps that you suggest are inadvisable exterminate the livestock all the animals in town now really slaughter what if theres no epidemic what if this is just a case of poor tests and a biased medical examiner the people would come for our heads theyd want someone to pay for all the cattle that were killed and you sure as hell dont earn enough for that even sealing off the valley christ this valleys livelihood is cattle if a rumor starts that all our cattle are diseased we might as well destroy them anyhow there wont be any way to sell them no well wait and see if there is an epidemic well hear from the people what to do theyll tell us and their choice will be the right one and well all survive this with a conscience just the way we did with all those hippies but the difference slaughter said is that nobody died because you waited on my desk right now the messages are piling up and therell be more until the valleys in a panic not just mangled cattle not just clifford and that boy were going to wade through corpses before long and nothings going to help those people but you havent listened to me slaughter theres no other choice okay you want to argue heres the end of it youll go on as if everything is normal you will quarantine whoevers been exposed if indeed there is a virus which i doubt youll pick up any dogs or cats or even chipmunks if they start behaving strangely but youll stay calm and tell the people that the situations in control and listen to me slaughter if you even hint about an epidemic your ass wont be worth the nail that stakes it to the courthouse door is that clear enough is that an order you can understand slaughter stared can i at least get on the radio and tell the town weve found a case of rabies parsons thought about it yes i see no problem after all we do have evidence of rabies and the town should be informed for its protection but dont dare mention cattle thats a different issue now i have to get back home im late for church and i have relatives coming home afterward for brunch he stood and clearly slaughter was expected to go with him oh yes what about that magazine reporter from new york that man named dunlap i cooperated as you told me slaughter said well dont let him find out what youre dealing with thats all we need is for the rumors to get printed have him leave this afternoon but hes not finished with his story yet hes finished all right he just doesnt know it make sure he leaves town and while youre at it get yourself cleaned up before too many people see you really you dont look so good the job is maybe too much for you slaughter almost laughed you bastard he was thinking you dont miss a chance to stay on top of people do you they walked toward the door and slaughter waited until parsons went out before him thinking this would be the way to handle things hed better keep his back protected two slaughter was in a phone booth but the line was fuzzy and the noises from the other end distracted him look altick i cant tell you why i need them but i just hold on to someone in the background put them over there im going with you i dont want that chopper taking off without me good im sorry slaughter everything is frantic here im listening i need some men he responded louder i cant give you reasons but ill maybe have to borrow help there isnt any way the voice was much too final but no listen to me i need everybody i can muster altick said i sent five men with dogs to look for bodine and there isnt any word from them theyve disappeared but bodine its my men i mean my men have disappeared the chopper flew up where theyd camped but they were gone and theyre not answering the radio i dont like what im feeling if youd called five minutes later id have been up in the chopper maybe theyre behind a ridge thats muting signals to the radio the chopper flew up anywhere they could have gone to no theyre missing and i cant waste time ive got to look for them more noises in the background i said wait until im ready yeah well need that medical kit as well just take them to the chopper slaughter theres no way for me to help you ill call you back when i have a chance but there were other noises in the background then the line was disconnected slaughter put the phone down staring at it sure another escalation by now hed grown accustomed to the burning in his stomach but he hadnt yet adjusted to the way his mind was nagging at him everything was moving too fast there was hardly any time to think his talk with parsons five policemen missing things werent bad enough he had to worry about parsons he hurried from the phone booth moving toward the hotel desk he knew that he had planned this since hed said goodbye to parsons although he wouldnt have admitted it but why else would he have come directly here he could have used the phone back at the station gordon dunlap he told the desk clerk what about him damn it tell me where to find him the clerk was fumbling through cards to find the number slaughter started up the stairs as he heard the number he ran to the balcony and scanned the arrows showing which rooms were on which side darting to the left and down a hallway studying the arrows once again the halls were twisting turning he came around a corner and he saw the door along a deadend corridor and raced past the pictures on the wall he knocked but no one answered dunlap wake up this is slaughter no answer dunlap slaughter knocked again he tried the doorknob it wouldnt move but as he leaned against the door the catch gave way the door swung open dunlap hadnt even shut the door completely he was sprawled across the bed his clothes wrinkled soaked with something on the floor there was an empty whisky bottle papers cigarette butts a broken ashtray a toppled chair what the hell had happened here he smelled the sickness stepping back then going forward dunlap didnt seem to breathe he wasnt moving slaughter grabbed him dunlap wake up its important dunlap didnt move though slaughter shook him come on you bastard wake up slaughter felt to find a heartbeat then he had it and at least he didnt have to worry about that for christ sake dunlap he shook him again dunlap groaned and tried to turn but slaughter wouldnt let him this is slaughter wake up weve got problems dunlap moaned his breath was putrid too rushed to mind that slaughter hefted him across his shoulder and stumbled down the hallway toward the bathroom when he set him on the toilet he started to unbutton dunlaps shirt but that was taking too much time so he just ripped the shirt off dunlap tilted almost falling and slaughter eased him onto the floor then got his pants off his shoes and socks and underwear the underwear was soiled nostrils flaring slaughter threw it into a corner he slid dunlap into the bathtub and turned the shower on to cold dunlap woke up screaming take it easy dunlap wouldnt stop screaming slaughter slapped his cheeks hey its me its slaughter dunlap blinked at him his eyes were red the vomit that had caked around his lips and chin was rinsing off and he was frowning his head to one side he looked as if he might begin to cry and then his body heaved its all right im with you slaughter told him get it out of you he studied dunlap water spraying onto the both of them as spasm followed spasm and then dunlap sighed and leaned back coughing in the bathtub he was crying whats the matter nightmares dunlap nodded well ive got work for you i need you sober while youre stunned like this i need some answers and i think right now that you wont lie to me i need to know if i can trust you dunlap closed his eyes and shivered as the cold water sprayed at him you know already what you want to hear you dont need me to answer listen buddy slaughter dug his fingers into dunlaps shoulder youre not quite so drunk as you pretend i want to hear the answer sure all right ill say that you can trust me if you screw up youll wish youd never met me you can trust me hey my shoulder slaughter noticed the way the skin was turning purple and eased his fingers off he leaned back sitting on the toilet seat i need a man to cover me he said at last a man from outside who has no involvement in this i want you to watch me every second check out everything i do and keep a record therell soon be trouble major trouble and i want to know that im protected dunlap had his eyes shut as he shivered in the cold spray of water do you hear me slaughter asked is it that bad its that bad hell id be crazy not to go along with you youll be crazy if you do theres just one stipulation all i ask is that you wait until i say that you can publish the story now i i dont want to have to worry about you i have lots to watch for without that the water kept spraying slaughter felt his wet shirt clinging to his skin all right so long as no one else is in on this dunlap said its you and me a deal then slaughter sat back on the toilet seat he didnt know exactly where to start you said you wanted a story heres the damnedest thing you ever heard three altick scanned the trees and ridges as the helicopter swooped over them he watched for some flash of movement some odd color anything but there was nothing to attract him just an endless sweep of forest rising sharply boulders deadfalls streams and canyons farther ridges everything but what he wanted and he rubbed his eyes to clear them staring harder there were three of them in the chopper the pilot altick and a state policeman wedged in back they had rifles binoculars a portable twoway radio and several knapsacks filled with food water and medical supplies the helicopter was outmoded small ideal for two persons suitable for three if absolutely necessary with the added weight of their gear it was unsteady slow and hard to keep above the trees it burned fuel too rapidly as they swung up the contour of these rising ridges there were moments when they held their breath and altick wished that there had been another way to get up here as soon as he required on the ground the other team would have already started five men as before but this time primed for trouble clutching their rifles watching all around them as they used their maps to find the best way to the lake up in the mountains there were no dogs no way to get any soon enough but this search team had a specific destination and it didnt need any dogs for guidance altick thought about them somewhere down below him thought about the hard job they would have to push up through the forest toward the rendezvous up here but he had made several phone calls and there hadnt been any other helicopters he could commandeer he was thinking that he might wish he had more than just two men with him there was no predicting what he might find when the helicopter touched down he kept staring then he saw some movement but as he pointed at it he realized that what hed seen were elk below him among the trees he saw one bound across an open space and normally he would have taken pleasure but he had to keep his mind on his objective more than that he now was bothered that he hadnt seen more elk before this deer other signs of life down there he should have this high in the mountains but the forest seemed deserted and he wished the helicopter could go faster it was roaring straining even with the plexiglass the noise came rushing at him and he kept peering down and the whole scene was like everything hed been through back in nam in while the radicals had looted campus buildings while the marchers had converged on washington he had been going on patrols his team in a chopper staring at the wilderness below them and the trees of course were different now the weather and whatever waited for him down there but he felt the tightness in his stomach felt the cramps around his heart as he fought to restrain his nervousness he remembered all the shit that he had gone through all the friends that hed seen killed the blood the disease the suffocating jungle believing that he served his country while the demonstrators back home had weakened the countrys resolve he had come back from his tour of duty and had signed on with the state police the valley at least had responded to him with some pride and with his military bearing hed done well indeed he sometimes acted as if he were still in the service and he talked about the people in the valley as civilians building pride and character among his men reminding them that they were different and they all were loyal to him as he was to them afraid now for the officers hed sent up and were missing he was staring at the forest reaching absently to touch his mustache and the scar across his lip that it disguised he grabbed the microphone and spoke abruptly chopper to patrol report the hiss of static chopper to patrol yeah captain everythings fine were moving fast we should be up there before noon they might have headed back already lets hope we didnt have to do this well just call it exercise some exercise altick answered smiling tenfour out his smile dissolved though as he stared down from the helicopter he was more and more reminded of those choppers back in nam the tension solid in him as the helicopter rose up past another ridge and suddenly he saw it theres the lake the pilot said altick nodded studying the landscape it was formed a basin ridges sloping all around then forest spreading inward then the clearing that went all around the lake there were few trees beside the lake itself but altick knew his men would have gone toward them he pointed toward one tree by the lake and they swept closer this was where they camped the pilot told him when i couldnt find them i went back to get some help the knapsacks were in sight now and the black pit where their campfire had been nothing else and altick tapped the pilots shoulder swing around the lake i want to check those trees beside it on the other shore i want to check the edge of the forest as well i did that when i first was up here yeah well just for me lets do it once again altick continued staring downward they moved around the lake the wind whipped by the rotors causing patterns on the water but the other trees had nothing there of interest and the clearing all around the lake was quiet and he saw no sign of anything around the forests edge okay then take her back and set her down i told you we wouldnt see anything altick only looked at him he spoke into the microphone chopper to patrol one charlie do you hear me static he waited chopper to patrol one i already did that too the pilot told him but i never got an answer they set down the long grass bending from the wind created by the helicopters rotors and back in nam altick would have been in motion by now jumping out before the chopper hit the ground or more often hovered and then swooped away and hed be scrambling with his men to find some cover abandoned at least this way the helicopter would stay with him and he waited for the rotors to stop before he unhitched his harness shoved at the hatch and stepped out holding his rifle he hurried toward the trees beside the lake then straightened as he stared at what hed been afraid of never mind the scattered remnants of the fire kicking at it would be one way to put it out sloppy granted but there was no dismissing what he found beside the charred wood blood a lot of it huge patches of it dry now on the mountain grass and earth he glanced around and saw the leashes on the tree more blood where once the dogs must have huddled he noticed the glint of an empty rifle cartridge in the grass he found a flashlight and the knapsacks had been torn their contents missing and a rifle butt was smashed beside a treethe little signs he couldnt see from the air but now he knew that there had been a fight all right and no dog no wolf no bear ever smashed a rifle at once he saw the barrel in the shallows of the lake my god what happened here his deputy blurted altick swung toward the pilot can you use that rifle we brought for you sure but the pilot looked pale five men and five dogs and this is all thats left of them i dont think we can wait for help weve got to spread out searching altick said not me im not going anywhere alone the pilot told him from the right a wind rushed toward them tugging at their clothing bending grass and scraping branches in the tree the deputy looked up at the scraping branches and pointed altick looked another rifle it was wedged up in the branches where it must have been thrown well do this together altick said these tracks in the grass i thought they might be from our men now im not so sure lets follow them they soon found a state policemans shirtsleeve in the grass the edges bloody no one said a word or even touched it they kept walking farther on they found the other sleeve and then the shirt itself the forest loomed they studied the grass then the forest the wind kept tugging at them scraping branches all the trees were moving im not going in there we have no idea what were up against the pilot said it could be anything but altick continued walking hey i said i wont go with you i heard you stay back then but you cant just leave me if theres trouble you can use the chopper i dont like this altick kept walking when he looked back he saw the pilot running toward the helicopter just as well the deputy said i dont like nervous civilians near me with a rifle altick nodded he was sure excited at the start but once theres danger hes a weekend cowboy he was right though we dont know what well find in there they followed the tracks in the grass noticing more dried blood and when altick parted some branches he saw four piles of guts among the fir trees altick swallowed something bitter the taste of fear and scanned the forest he thought of corpses he had seen in nam their ears and balls cut off and he knew he had only one choice now were going back the deputy beside him was ashen he shook and made a retching sound dont be ashamed if you get sick altick said the man clutched his stomach ill be fine its just that take deep breaths i saw a lot of things like this in nam i never did get used to them my god they disemboweled them who or what for sure no wolf or dog did this come on wed better head back toward the chopper i dont know whats out here but its more than we can handle altick kept thinking four there were five men so why only four flyspeckled mounds of viscera and then he reached the helicopter fighting for his breath and he found out the pilot wasnt looking at them instead he faced the lake his mouth open his finger pointing and when altick got there he saw the headless body floating in the water his deputy moaned the wind kept blowing fiercely on the ripples of the lake the head bobbed to the surface jesus wont those reinforcements ever get here four it was twentythree years since lucas had left now he was coming home he peered out from the window of the car hed thumbed a ride from seeing new homes on the outskirts then a shopping center and the street here hadnt been paved back then but he recognized more buildings than he didnt and he thought that he might recognize some of the people but he couldnt over there a house that had been blue was now painted white and up ahead trees that had been saplings now were tall he saw front yards he once had played in but their spaces now seemed smaller as indeed the houses did and everywhere he looked he had the sense of things diminished well what else had he expected did he think that twentythree years would leave the town and him unchanged or had the town been really this small all along and he too young to put it in perspective well hed seen how big the world could be now potters field was welcome the driver looked at him if youre hungry youll have to wait i dont plan to stop here i have half a day to drive yet no this town is good enough you want me to pull over in a while the road goes straight through to the other mountains when we reach downtown is where ill leave you know this place i used to i was raised here been away long lucas nodded his cheek muscles tense yes im coming back to see my father he stared toward the courthouse up ahead and pointed there is fine if you dont mind ill get out on that corner no problem it was good to pass the time with you the car veered toward the curb and stopped lucas got out thank you i thank you you know i dont pick up many hitchhikers mostly they look well i guess a bit too rough to handle but a nice cleanlooking young man like yourself its rare ive got a lot of driving yet to do and you helped break the time for me thanks again i know your father will be glad to see you well im sure hell be surprised all right lucas reached for his suitcase and shut the door take care now yeah the same to you he watched the car pull away from the curb he watched until he couldnt see it anymore then he turned to face the courthouse in the distance he heard church bells he saw people in their best clothes standing talking in small groups along the street except for what seemed lots of traffic heading out of town the scene was just as he remembered it when he and his mother would come into town to go to church another peaceful sunday morning but the last few years before he left had gradually stopped being peaceful his father angry his parents shouting he had asked the man just now to let him off before there were too many questions then hed understood that stopping here was maybe for the best he hadnt seen this courthouse since those late october days in and he could still recall the way his father sat beside the lawyer staring at him in the witness chair lucas shook his head and wondered where the cars and trucks were going some big fair out in the valley then he picked up his suitcase crossed toward the building beside the courthouse walked up past the trees on either side and climbed the front steps going in the place was cool and shadowy and the first things that he noticed were the tall plants in their big pots all around the edges of the hall they hadnt been here back in and more than any other detail he had seen they signaled to him how much everything had changed since then he faced the office to his right and saw the sign on toppolice chief nathan slaughterand that sign was different too the old chief wasnt here now people might not understand what he wanted to tell them he almost didnt go in but he was too committed now to change his mind and he stepped through the doorway there were half a dozen people phones were ringing to his right a policeman he didnt recognize was talking to a microphone beyond him men were answering the phones and writing notes in a glassedin office at the back a tall man in a uniform was talking to a gray wasted man in a wrinkled suit and everyone was loud and none of them looked happy yes sir may i help you the man whod been talking to the radio looked tensely at him im not certain my names lucas wheeler someone here might know me just a second the policeman spoke into the microphone again thats right a woman and a dog its a hell of a mess the animal control van should be hooked up to our frequency its probably waiting for you get over there a staticky voice that lucas couldnt understand responded roger the policeman glanced up his expression stark im sorry things are crazy here youll have to tell me that again i said my name is lucas wheeler and i need protection from my father the policemans eyes narrowed has he threatened you he isnt acting strangely is he no i havent seen him since the fall of nineteen seventy but i dontjust a second the policeman spoke to the microphone again thats right for gods sake dont go near it keep it locked in the basement if it breaks out use your shotgun lucas squinted around and heard other bizarre conversations he didnt understand it what was going on at first hed thought that he had looked suspicious to this man but he had made a point of cutting off his beard and trimming back his hair of buying clothes as conventional as he could tolerate hell he was even wearing cowboy boots but the reaction hed received was due apparently to what was going on whatever that was and he waited and the policeman stared at him again whats all im sorry but youll have to see the chief whats going on i said youll have to see the chief the policeman gestured toward the glassedin office can i leave my suitcase by the door the policeman waved him impatiently away and spoke again to a staticky voice on the radio if hes been bitten get him to the hospital keep him in the back seat of the cruiser dont go near him lucas set the suitcase by the door and crossed the room hearing the urgent voices around him staring at the troubled policemen then reaching the entrance to the glassedin section of the office quarantine wont work now i dont care what parsons says weve got the big man stopped and looked at him what is it well i guess i picked the wrong time but the man out there said i should see you ive been out of town for quite a while ive come to see my father but i think he might make trouble for me trouble yes my name is lucas wheeler the big man only shook his head puzzled as if the name meant nothing to him in contrast the wasted man in the wrinkled suit snapped to attention wheeler youre the ranchers boy thank god i was afraid no one remembered or would help me ranchers boy the big man asked the murder back in nineteen seventy the wasted man said hes the kid who testified against his father and my father said that if he got the chance hed kill me lucas said i need protection but the big man only leaned back in his chair and wiped his face look cant it wait a few days weve got trouble here my father wasnt kidding lucas said but i dont have the men just wait a while and ill go out with you myself a few days i dont have enough money to stay in a hotel that long and the big man sighed as he glanced toward the ceiling never mind ill handle this the wasted man said no i want you with me nothings going to threaten you while youre here i just need to talk with him you like some coffee lucas have you got a little time to talk with me i want to see my father and youll see him but i have a couple of questions about what the commune and the horror of it all returned to him five the thing came struggling down the street it crawled on its hands and knees and tried to shield its eyes from the sunlight but the pain was too intense and all it did was crawl on blindly it was snarling foaming at the mouth although it didnt do that willingly the broken white line stretched before it and it wavered to one side and then the other as in agony it tried to move directly down the center objects angled past it beeping it heard voices sensed the people crowding near it and it snarled at them and bared its foamy teeth and kept on crawling how it reached here it could not remember trees and grassland it remembered but this hot black surface and this white line it could not recall or understand it just kept struggling down the white line someone screamed more objects inched past beeping and the pain the awful pain it fell face cracking on the hot black surface it squirmed forward on its stomach the white line stretching forward from its nose it pawed at its skull it jerked its head from side to side as the murmurs gathered closer it snarled to defend itself six rettig stopped the cruiser puzzled by the crowd that filled the main street he saw cars and trucks stopped drivers getting out people on the sidewalk pointing others coming from the side streets from sunday brunch in restaurants he was stepping from the cruiser putting on his hat and with his hand near his revolver he moved forward what the hell was this about hed seen so many bad things in the last few days that he had no idea what worse could happen and this morning word had gotten around so fast that even for a small town it was startling people in a panic leaving town or gathered in small groups and talking wildly he had seen three traffic jams this morning forced to waste time clearing them hed shot a frenzied dog had helped its bleeding owner to a doctor he had found a mangled woman by a laundromat but now a mob that filled the street he didnt like where this was heading weak from lack of sleep and scared because the town would shortly be in chaos worried for his family he had phoned his sister down in denver to make arrangements for his wife and daughter to go there they were packing right now and he knew that many others had made plans to leave the town as well but all the same he thought he knew what to expect more of this but surely nothing worse yet even as he walked up to the crowd to part it he was sensing something that was far beyond his knowledge something that when he reached out to shift the crowd would show him some dark final truth that ever after would change everything he heard the words but didnt understand them couldnt make them out a snarled fogthroated muttering he pushed on through the crowd and stopped and stared and it must once have been a person but its trunk was cloaked with furs its arms and legs were bloody it was snarling drooling jerking its hair down to its waist and falling all around it a beard down to its stomach its face dark from dirt and scabs and bugs were crawling on it as it leered up blinking own oom it was choking rettig didnt understand the sounds he stumbled back against the crowd his heart beating faster then he understood the choking rasping barking throne room it repeated throne room throne room throne room seven they were standing in the hallway staring through the window at the figure on the bed in there the figure wore a gown now the collar of it showing just above the sheet that covered him his beard was trimmed his hair was cut an intravenous bottle hung beside him leading to the needle in his arm although he was unconscious straps restrained him do you recognize him slaughter asked lucas wheeler concentrated im not certain its been lots of years i mean i doubt many people could identify me after so long how can i be certain about him but is there anything at all familiar oh a little that thin nose and mouth the thing is i knew several people like that but the commune had a couple hundred members and i wasnt up there long enough to meet them all plus no one was as gaunt as he is lets say he was twenty back then now hed be fortythree a man can change a lot in that time slaughter glanced at dunlap then he scratched his wrinkled brow and turned to lucas once again well would it help if you were closer to him i dont think i want that hes unconscious those straps are secure he isnt any threat to you i know that but you have to understand how much that commune scared me slaughter narrowed his gaze what do you mean look i never said this back in nineteenseventy but when my father came to get me id been praying all along for something like that i was scared id never get away from there when that policeman found me in the ditch for the latrine i wasnt hiding from him it was quiller i was hiding from you know about this slaughter said to dunlap yes he told me when we went to get some coffee at your office they were evidently let me tell it lucas said i should have told it long ago youve got to understand how young i was eighteen and i thought id figured everything the way my father acted toward my mother and me hell he was actually convinced that she was cheating on him he was certain that i wasnt even his i mean i couldnt stand it anymore i felt there had to be a better life and when those hippies came through town i knew theyd found it so i hung around with them can you imagine no guilt freedom to do anything that youre inclined toward without fear of what somebody else will say id never had that and i loved it but the trouble started then and soon the town turned on the hippies and the ranchers forced them from the valley i was worse off than before because i thought i knew then what i wanted so i struggled through the summer but my father and i kept arguing and i snuck out late one night to join the commune but i didnt know that they were crazy see i figured theyd be like the hippies in the town but these were different quiller had selected them thats why he wanted several thousand at the start to pick and choose the special types he wanted every freak whod tripped out once too many times every nut who was almost psychotic every radical whose idea of protest was to plant a bomb or set fire to a building hell they didnt need the drugs a lot of them were scrambled to begin with and they took one look at me and said that i would be their first new member well i should have known the hippies in the town had warned me very bad they told me but they never explained what they meant i suspect they only sensed what was the matter all the same i should have known because the summer had been time enough for quiller to control the commune to make it even more extreme you want to talk about hypnotic people quiller had a way of looking in your eyes and making you agree to anything and he had crazies working with him who would make you go along with him id grown a halfassed beard id let my hair grow long but if i stood out from the people in the town i stood out equally from quiller and the commune they had let their hair and beards keep growing longer they had started dressing even weirder than the hippies who had been in town quiller used to sit in his corvette the red corvette he kept it dunlap asked abruptly oh hell yes he rigged up a grotto for it off in the woods he parked it there beneath a shelter made from tree boughs and he used to sit in it to hold his meetings but the funny thing is that while all the others let their hair and beards grow quiller shaved and kept his hair short when he didnt wear his robe he walked around in patent leather shoes and expensive slacks and custommade shirts that hed brought with him in the context of the commune he looked twice as weird as anyone just sitting in that car and staring toward the forest youd have thought he was on the freeway god knows where his mind was taking him and there i stood before him in my jeans and workshirt and the stubby beard id tried to grow and he was saying that hed let me be their first new member he was smiling and i didnt understand till later that if id refused i wouldnt have had a choice i didnt understand that i was a prisoner its like jim jones dunlap said or david koresh or charles manson slaughter added and they frowned at one another i need a smoke lucas said has anybody got one his hand was shaking as he took the cigarette that dunlap offered a nurse going by frowned at them she slowed as if about to tell them that smoking wasnt allowed in the corridor then she saw the look in their eyes and kept moving lucas drew the smoke in anyway they had these barracks like in the military and they put me in one watching me by then i understood enough to be afraid but there was no way i could run and they were talking about my initiation i dont know what i thought would happen i saw that many of them had a scar across their chests two wavy lines that intersected when they brought me food i wouldnt eat it and i wouldnt drink the water they kept smiling though as if thats what they wanted thats right stay pure they told me i dont know they had this thing about a state of nature quillers notion was to purify them to free them from the outside world he made them pledge their loyalty then put them through this secret ritual their goal was to escape the bonds of society and act upon their instincts but the place was set up like the military and i didnt understand how quillers dictatorial attitude was compatible with freedom or how drugs had anything to do with purity the scheme was crazy schizophrenic and i sometimes wonder if he didnt get some kind of voyeuristic thrill from watching them behave like animals the second day at sundown they were going to have the ceremony but my father showed up that day shooting when they ran to find out what had happened i escaped the men who watched me the policeman found me but you never mentioned anything about this slaughter told him thats right i was too afraid i felt that quiller would come after me you said yourself that quiller seemed a lot like manson he terrified me i didnt want to go against him if i told the town the town would turn against the commune and i knew who the commune would blame besides you have to realize how much i hated my father if i justified what he had done he might have been released i didnt want that hell i knew that hed come looking for me too as far as i could see a guilty verdict was the best chance for my mother and me dont bother saying i was wrong at eighteen thats the way i saw things but youre back now lucas nodded and the whole damned thing is starting again i dont mind telling you im scared i figured that the commune would have scattered by now that my father might be different last month i was with my mother when she died shed been staying in new mexico the last thing she said was make sure your father doesnt cheat you half that ranch is mine and now its yours but hell try to keep it from you lucas straightened im finished running well i guarantee youll be protected dont underestimate my father that isnt what i meant i mean in there i want you to look closely at the man in the bed tell me if hes really from the commune we still have no proof of that if the commune still exists we dont know where it is they moved it lucas shuddered oh thats fine thats fucking great the medical examiner stepped from the room where hed been attending to the bearded figure well slaughter asked the medical examiner looked troubled hes very sick apart from showing symptoms of the virus hes undernourished and dehydrated if he hadnt wandered into town hed have died by sunset as it is i still dont know how long hell live im feeding him intravenously can we have a look at him the medical examiner debated i dont think thats a problem but that cigarette will have to go he pointed toward what lucas held and lucas nodded dropping the cigarette stepping on it pick it up now lucas stared at him then picked it up he glanced at slaughter fine lets get this finished the medical examiner opened the door and they went in they peered toward the figure then at lucas i dont know lucas told them make a guess slaughter said i cant youve got to try but what if i identify him and he comes for me does he look as if hes going to live for christ sake be responsible for once lucas scowled at him the veins in his temples throbbed then slowly they subsided and he studied the figure maybe maybe i once knew him have you got a name for him ill tell you when im ready did you notice if he had a scar he asked the medical examiner two wavy lines that intersect across his chest they remind me of a swastika and what about a tattoo on his shoulder its an eagle let me see it lucas watched the medical examiner tug at the sheet and gown they looked at a purple eagle yes i knew him lucas exhaled pollock all i ever heard him called was pollock he was quillers second in command that eagles like some kind of military symbol like a captain or a major if he wakes up dont go near him hes insane if you could see his eyes youd understand what i mean slaughter sighed then the commune still exists but where the hell did they go dunlap wondered now the figure squirmed beneath the straps he shook his head unconscious flaring his nostrils moaning throne room what the medical examiner shook his head he said throne room slaughter told him i dont understand it either he was moaning that when rettig found him slaughter didnt like the smell in here although the figure had been bathed while he was strapped down in the bed he stank of rancid meat and sweat and mildew and the pungent smell of medicine mixed with those other odors nauseated him where has he been living anyhow the throne room dunlap told him very funny no the place clearly has some importance to him maybe if we asked him hes unconscious you can see that i dont care lets try it slaughter looked at the medical examiner it might work i dont think that it could hurt him but its pointless slaughter said what difference does it make lets try it dunlap bent down by the figure pollock careful slaughter told him dunlap nodded moving slightly away from the figure pollock can you hear me there was no response dunlap waited then he said again but softer pollock can you hear me the figure squirmed he hissed once then he settled pollock youre with friends now can you hear me talk about the throne room throne room that was croaked but they could hear it dunlap glanced at his companions then spoke more softly to the figure thats right talk about the throne room red room dunlap frowned toward the others it could be blood the medical examiner suggested maybe slaughter told him or it could be something he remembers from when he was just a kid there isnt any way to know abruptly the figure on the bed started screaming they flinched as the scream swept louder around them it rose higher strident the figure twisting agonized and then as suddenly as it began the scream diminished the figure settled moaning on the bed they continued staring is there nothing you can give him slaughter asked the medical examiner im not about to risk a sedative the only thing that we can do is watch to see what happens what about these lights though cant we dim them hes unconscious so they shouldnt bother him but why not i dont see a need for them the medical examiner walked to the door and switched off the lights the room became shadowy but the figure didnt stop its moaning it jerked its head from side to side then gradually it seemed calmer what about the red room pollock tell us about it dunlap said there wasnt any answer red room dunlap said again and then in answer red room red room antelope i told you this is useless hes just babbling slaughter said or else hes saying whats important to him dunlap answered then you tell me what it means you know i cant of course you cant we have to find out where theyve gone if theres some kind of red room i sure want to know whats in it slaughter turned to lucas can you tell us where they might be living lucas shook his head he studied slaughter and then everyone their faces in shadow no they never told me much but now that i think back i can understand why quiller would have moved my father and the state police were proof the compound wasnt safe for him hed want to find a better place but where slaughter asked those hills are used for camping fishing hunting someone would have found them could be someone did dunlap said youd better check your missingpersons file and any inquiries you might have gotten from other sections of the country you never know how far back this might take you slaughter would you mind explaining what this means the new voice thundered through the room they stiffened turning toward the doorway parsons braced there looming over them and then they turned toward slaughter we dont know yet we were in the hallway what im waiting slaughter parsons stepped back out and let the door swing shut the room was silent as they looked at slaughter well i guess i knew this would happen what would happen he objects to the company i keep he what its nothing ill explain it later through the window he saw parsons stalking back and forth in the hallway well i guess id better get it settled slaughter faced the door and pulled on it parsons waited until slaughter shut the door behind him you were told to keep that reporter away from this to make sure he was on a bus the hell from town the nurses at the far end stared at them i dont think i can do that if you want to keep your job youll parsons look we really should have gotten to know each other its too late now but ill try to make you understand ive been through situations like this many times back in detroit when there was trouble and pressure was put on our supervisors theyd look around for someone to blame we learned early how to come out looking squeaky clean now theres about to be a lot of trouble and youre going to need a fall guy but im damned sure it wont be me that reporter in there is closer to me right now than my jockey shorts except for this conversation i dont go anywhere not even to the mens room without bringing him along because i want to guarantee that im protected that he writes down every move i make so if you have any accusations any tricks you want to pull to keep your lovely reputation therell be someone elses word besides your own ill have you listen to me im not finished so you want to sit back and let things happen well thats not the way i plan to do this if i have to ill declare martial law im not sure i have the power but when this is over therell be plenty of time for us to argue in the meanwhile ill at least be doing something which is more than i can say for you it could be ill make mistakes okay then ill take blame for them but there is no way in this life that ill take blame for your inaction parsons glared youll wish youd never come here maybe but just think about your options if im right youll reach out and take the credit if im wrong you know who to point blame at but that reporter is my insurance that ive got a witness to protect me im in charge now dont forget it parsons looked through the window at the medical examiner and dunlap and the young man who were watching him oh im not known for my forgetfulness years from now ill still remember you but you wont be around to realize it parsons studied him a moment longer and then stalked along the corridor eight altick raced up through the bushes he had waited with the two men by the helicopter until the ground patrol had finally arrived he told them what had happened and when he was finished urging them when he had shown them first the body in the lake and then the piles of viscera in the forest he had succeeded in his efforts to enrage them after all the one thing he had always emphasized was loyalty to one another the members of the patrol knew all the men who had been killed theyd been close friends and the grisly evidence of how the first group had been killed had been enough to change their fear into anger they werent certain what had done this but they all agreed that someone or some thing was going to pay they edged up past the viscera and they were cursing as they found a gametrail that led higher blood along it which they followed high above the helicopter hovered that way they would have a lookout who could warn them of a trap he saw ahead and if they were indeed attacked the pilot could pick up the wounded at the least the pilot would survive to tell what he had seen down here but no one liked to talk about the chance of their all dying they were rushing up the gametrail concentrating to insure that their side didnt do the dying they found more blood on the gametrail and they were so angry and it was so easy to follow this clear a spoor that no one thought until later that the blood had maybe been left for them part six the jail one the map was spread out on the desk and slaughter stared at it he glanced up at the five men grouped around him rettig dunlap lucas owens and the medical examiner i wanted you to be here because each of you has been involved in this and i need your opinions they were silent outside traffic was unusually dense for a sunday good slaughter said im glad you want to help there isnt any choice and slaughter looked at owens who was scowling out the window slaughter waited then continued as i see it weve got two main problems although theyre really both the same the first thing is to keep the people in town safe by this afternoon there wont be anybody to protect slaughter looked again at owens then at where the man was scowling at the cars and trucks that filed past toward the main road from the valley okay so word spread fast and lots of people are leaving that can help us to do what protect a ghost town owens asked thats exactly what i didnt want to hear youve worked hard on this i thought i could depend on you but whats the use owens demanded you know we cant beat this we can try well you dont have a family my wife and kids are packing right now so are mine rettig said that doesnt mean im going with them owens stared at him and then at everyone his gaze was disbelieving you still dont get it do you everything weve found out the way they dont like light and how they come out in the darkness how the moon affects them how these incidents have been increasing he pointed toward a calendar on the wall slaughter shook his head i dont understand its the moon the moon is getting fuller weve got just today and monday and then tuesday when the moon is at its fullest this whole valleys going to be a madhouse they looked startled what he says is in a way correct the medical examiner added theres a kind of logarithmic pattern to this will you please make sense the numbers slaughter theyre increasing at a faster rate what you told me all the calls that youve been getting all the incidents your men are investigating we start with one thing next its two the next night four and eight and sixteen as the moon gets fuller all the incidents are doubled in proportion after sixteen thirtytwo you see the kind of ultimate its leading toward then that can help us if it can i dont see how the moon will start to wane then and the incidents will be reduced the stimulus wont be as strong if we can get through tuesday then weve got a chance to gain control except that its not just a full moon owens said look at the calendar tuesday whats the date june twentieth thats right and whats it say about the next day slaughter leaned close to the calendar it says the twentyfirst the first day of summer and you still dont get it slaughter frowned confused the summer solstice owens told him christ youre a cop when you were back east in detroit surely you noticed how the crazies started acting up when the moon was full or when the seasons started changing you dont even need to be a cop to notice it just talk to doctors or to me about the way my animals begin behaving talk to people at complaint departments out at sears or wards or kmart the moon does crazy things and now the full moon and the summer solstice will be coming together all those ancient stories about pagans losing control and worshiping chaos on midsummers eve chaos think about it weve got a virus that affects the limbic brain and makes us act the way we did when we were animals tuesday night youre going to see hell they gaped at him their faces drained of color jesus dunlap said yes youve scared me slaughter said and looked down at the map then at the window then at him he took a breath yes i admit it and i guess after what ive seen youre likely right that anything can happen now but i dont know what i can do about it leave before you dont have a choice owens said i cant allow that why because i have a job thats just as crazy as the things youve seen owens said you wont do any good and even if you do whos going to thank you parsons he looks out for himself you think the people in the valley will be grateful if you die for them dont believe it theyll just say you didnt have control that you were foolish take the chance and get out while you can but im not doing this for the town im doing it for me slaughter said if i run now i couldnt tolerate myself and i dont think you could run out either no just watch me and they did they waited staring and owens returned their stares and for a moment it seemed certain that he would walk away but then he didnt something wrong youre bothered slaughter asked owens kept looking at him maybe you had something more to say but owens only swallowed i tell you what its daylight things wont get too bad until tonight just stick around a little tell your family to leave that youll catch up and in the meanwhile keep helping us the way you did just now youve given us more information than we had i dont know how to use it but youre really quite important owens kept staring until tonight at sunset thats no more than i could ask for and then slaughter did an unexpected thing he reached close to shake hands with him and owens seemed a little better and the other men relaxed then were a team again lets do it two parsons pulled the roadblock across the twolane highway it was like a sawhorse only bigger longer he had found it by the roadside where a highway crew had been repairing asphalt and he pulled the second one across so that both lanes were barricaded and he faced the backedup traffic his intentions were uncommon to him all his life hed learned to occupy a still point to let power channel through him rather than be active and pursue it he had earned his station simply by agreeing to what everyone already was committed to that government is best which governs least he always said a public servants job is not to lead instead to follow and for twentyfive years of being mayor hed found that notion was successful now it failed him from his house on the outskirts of town hed seen the people leaving he had begged his friends to stay and trust him but that moment when if he had only acted now was past him and he saw the town dissolving saw the power he had passively received dissolving with it for the first time in his life he was a failure more important he would never occupy his same position if the town were ever saved if the people ever came back they would surely not be loyal to him they would change things choose a new mayor want to do things differently and he would be like presidents who once were influential leaders who were set aside and even an embarrassment he knew that these analogies were grandiose but this had been his country this town in this valley he had ruled it absolutely and he couldnt bear the thought that hed soon be deposed and useless it was slaughters fault he told himself slaughter who had screwed things up and let the situation get so out of hand slaughter who now with that reporter was determined to abuse him to publish stories that would damage him hell ruin him slaughter maybe had ambitions parsons hadnt thought of that but maybe slaughter planned to claim that parsons had been weak and ineffective slaughter then would show how he himself had taken charge and he would soon become the mayor like hell parsons would be damned if he let anybody take his power away who did slaughter think that he was dealing with and what made slaughter think he could suddenly take charge this valley wasnt ruled like that and parsons was determined to instruct him he had both his roadblocks set up and with his shotgun in his hand he stalked ahead toward where the first car waited he was bulky towering above the car that was the first thing he had learned to use his size his presence turn around we have to work together on this get those roadblocks out of there before i ram right through them and what then if everybody leaves there wont be anybody left to stop this look the guy next door was mangled by his german shepherd two doors down the husband went berserk i know of twenty people whove been missing since last night somethings going on but its been covered up and i dont plan to wait around to find out what it is ill shoot your tires out and what about the other cars behind me you dont have enough ammunition just clear those roadblocks let me on my way i cant permit that we dont know what this thing is but if i let you from the valley youll be spreading it this valley starting now is quarantined parsons knew that he was being contradictory that what hed said to slaughter went against what he was doing now but he was in a fight with slaughter and if using slaughters tactics meant success then he would use them what was more the situation was so uncontrolled now that this tactic really was the best way and besides as he was saying to the driver if you leave now if this valley goes to hell you wont be coming back there wont be anything you want here or can trust here take a stand for god sake go back into town and fight this all the cars were lined up honking drivers getting out and swarming toward him he was ready with his shotgun if youll trust me i can show you how to beat this they were yanking at his roadblocks its those hippies dont you see it yes he knew about that too he had informants everywhere and hed been talking to them since hed been with slaughter there were still a few things that he didnt understand but he knew just enough that hed found a scapegoat plus the hippies really were the enemy and if hed worked this angle back in he could work it once again those hippies the drivers paused with the roadblocks in their hands but theyre long gone im telling you that theyre still in the mountains oh they moved to some place else but theyre still up there and theyre crazy god knows what all theyve been doing using drugs and living like a bunch of animals theyve picked up some disease now and theyre coming to the valley oh sure i know dogs and cats have got it too but we can handle them those hippies are the ones im afraid of it was a prehistoric argument that took advantage of their tribal instincts conjuring the image of some hairy foreign thing that no one understood and hence that everyone feared parsons was almost ashamed to use it but he nonetheless believed it all those hatefilled recollections of those hippies latent ready to be triggered and his anger was intense enough now that he wanted to get even damage slaughter kill those hippies get his town back as it was for him oh yes by god the way slaughter had spoken to him he meant to see that someone paid he waited as they stared at him you dont remember nineteenseventy hal there lost his boy in vietnam while those damned hippies crudded up our town and now those hippies are on their way back theyre going to come down from the mountains and kill us unless we make plans to stop them the crowd kept staring i dont even need you ill go see the ranchers they know whats important they know how to keep what theyve worked hard for ill go find some men who arent afraid now parsons felt emotion stirring in them in a moment he would ask if anybody knew the people whod been murdered he would tell them that the state police were heading into the mountains that they needed helpyes he had heard about that tooand he would tell them about slaughter how their chief was so inept that he himself their mayor was forced to come down here and take charge of his people three slaughter scowled down with the others at the map theyd made arrangements for their message to be broadcast on the tv and the radio for everyone to stay inside to keep away from animals from strangers to report a bite or any odd behavior then to call the police station for assistance and to watch for the cruisers that were out in force along the streets he himself had called the state police but there was only one man on duty at the local barracks and no word had come from altick he had called for help from rawlins lander sheridan and casper if he had to he would call in the state militia but right now his main objective was to find the commune you men know these mountains more than i do tell me where the commune is its too much area to figure rettig told him yes but slaughter paused and rubbed his forehead hed been having pains there for several hours from lack of food and sleep the tension building in him and his argument with parsons he was hoping he could handle this but he was overwhelmed by what he faced gradually more doubtful yes but there must be a couple places you can think of caves or canyons where a group of people could live undetected if you want to think about it that way there are hundreds rettig said i remember when i was a kid there werent even terrain maps for those mountains hunters fishermen oh yeah they go up through there but i used to know an indian who lived there as a hermit for three years and never came across another person what youre telling me is that we wont find any answer what im saying is we dont have the time for trial and error look there has to be some logic to this dunlap said they turned to him the city man who planned to tell them about mountains logic where the hell is logic slaughter demanded youd know the way to do this if you were still in detroit think of everything thats happened as a group of crimes youre plotting on a grid of city streets diagram it for the pattern but there isnt any pattern rettig said of course there is dont think about whats happened in the town just concentrate on incidents near the mountains ive been here only since friday but i spotted right away that everything has happened on the western section of the valley dont you think i know that rettig said impatiently use it slaughter shifted his attention to the map okay if youre so confident why not its worth a try we havent anything to lose he drew an x thats bodines ranch pretty close to where we found the abandoned truck heres the lake where alticks men were lost and heres the deserted compound dont forget your own place rettig told him its obvious those werent bobcats you live near that section too can you think of any other things the ranchers who reported mangled cattle live over there and that hippie staggered into town from that direction there were xs all across that section of the map i dont see what that accomplished slaughter said i do lucas answered draw some lines up toward the mountains intersect them slaughter did and the men grouped around the table frowning toward the map well its high up thats what you expected slaughter told rettig high enough that people dont go up there much you see that there arent any trails marked whats this broken line here slaughter asked thats the railroad that went up to where they used to mine the gold back in the old days its all broken down now mine the gold mine what gold this was once the richest section of the state back in eighteen ninetyfive there used to be a town up there and slaughter felt the chill begin dear god the answers been there all along and we were just too dumb to see it owens said the ghost town rettig said they called it motherlode its hard as hell to get there now that we dont have the railroad up there i mean theres no wagon road no trail thats why they built the railroad in the first place motherlode and there are shafts that cut in through the rock walls if you knew what you were doing you could live up there a long time all those miners did and now the hippies slaughter said and now the hippies owens echoed theres no telling what well find up there im sorry slaughter parsons voice came strong across the room they whirled and looked beyond the glass partition at the group of men with rifles who were hurrying through the main door standing in the middle of the larger office parsons was ahead of them looming huge and staring toward the glass partition you keep barging in its not a habit i admire slaughter said well this will be the last youll have to come with us the room was silent the shuffling feet had stopped the officer on duty at the radio was frowning the three men whod been answering the telephones halted in midsentence they made brief remarks and set down the phones at once the phones started ringing again pull the jacks on those things parsons said i dont want to hear them they were looking first at slaughter then at parsons pull the jacks i told you they leaned down quickly pulling out the jacks thats better now we wont be interrupted well you heard me slaughter lets get moving where what for i just declared emergency conditions i dont this is what youd call a citizens arrest youre joking am i smiling move before we make you but you cant be serious im not prepared to argue its a known fact that you wouldnt follow orders thats because you didnt want to deal with this do i appear as if im not prepared to deal with this your logics not convincing youve been acting on your own without authority your methods have been irresponsible youve let this thing get out of hand while you the medical examiner and owens were conspiring to hide evidence of murder what the boy the medical examiner slashed open in the morgue the boy was still alive you think i dont know about that once i figured that the parents would be suing us i had a second autopsy performed that slash is hardly what youd call professional oh sure the medical examiner worked hard to make it seem a part of his procedure but he didnt do it well enough were holding all of you until we learn the truth about this not including me dunlap stepped ahead i dont know anything about this but youve seen enough to be a circumstantial witness slaughter bragged about that and this fellow here i dont know how hes involved in this im passing through lucas said youre wheelers son i know that much by now you used to chum with all those hippies and we cant afford to trust you how much money do you have i dont see how much money ten maybe twelve dollars not enough youre a vagrant and well likely find a record on you once we start investigating all of you im tired of waiting what about me rettig stepped forward i have nothing i can claim against you actually im putting you in charge although im still suspicious of your friendship with slaughter make one move to help him and youll join him this departments been in bad shape for too long i mean to put some muscle in it i wont ask you anymore he told them rettig take his gun but rettig hesitated its all right slaughter told him every second we argue theres more trouble outside do what he tells you ill make good on this parsons laughed sure you will in your own jail lets get this finished rettig looked at slaughter then took slaughters gun the men with rifles stepped ahead to form a cordon and the five men went out guards around them rettig watched as parsons remained in the office and studied the map how much help did he call in parsons asked sheridan and lander places like that well i think that i can keep them quiet keep the word about this strictly in the valley i dont want those ranchers ruined did he call in the state militia he wasnt sure yet rettig had troubled speaking good parsons said i stopped him just in time slaughter meant to ruin everyone i hardly think so parsons tapped his fingers on the map rettig what i need now is cooperation someone who can do the job are you prepared to help or arent you yes i want to help then there isnt any problem is there you stay and you work to keep the town safe i have people wholl be downstairs watching slaughter but that reporter surely you dont think you can muzzle him eventually hell write about the valley what a drunk a common lush when im through smearing his reputation there wont be anyone wholl listen to him plus there wont be anything for him to see hell never have the story he can try but hell need evidence and if you think your chief was good at coverups you havent seen what i can do when im finished this place will be happy valley well have had a small exaggerated rabies scare and slaughter hell be on his ass in jail or on the road to nowhere he cant take charge of a town the way he planned and not get punished for it we still have laws you know i guess it all depends on how you look at it youre learning rettig i might have a place for you lets get these phones in order tell me how much force youll let me use enough to get the job done thats too vague i mean it that way walk the line it keeps you careful this towns economy is based on animals on livestock if you have to shoot take time to get permission get in touch with anyone who owns a cat or dog the court house has the license records if you see a hippie yes well i think you know how to handle it parsons looked at him then slowly walked across to where he paused in the doorway looked again then went off down the hallway rettig stood there silent stunned by what had happened glancing toward the window he saw people in the front yard mostly men and they were angry holding weapons he felt suddenly exhausted tell me what that bastard thinks hes going to do the officer beside the radio said i dont know he saw the pattern on the map he heard us talking its my guess he plans to go up to the ghost town pick a fight with them and kill them all but thats crazy he cant get away with that oh cant he if those hippies have the virus theyll attack for certain so the killings will be justified and even if they arent if parsons takes enough men with him we cant prosecute the whole town but hes instigating them no hes just doing what they tell him thats what hell say later and thats always been his pattern oh hell get away with it all right and hell come back with twice the power he started with were going to see some bad times and i dont know how to deal with them i wish slaughter were in my place go downstairs and spring him do it for me no thanks then you see what i mean wed only end up in there with him rettig turned to face the window once again outside the crowd had shifted so that parsons could go through haranguing them the phones were ringing officers were answering i hate to say it but no matter how you look at it weve got some bad times coming and god help us there isnt any way to stop them four he was feeling strange now they had warned him this might happen but the bite had not been deep across his finger lots of scratches on his face and neck but just the one slight bite where he had reached up to defend himself against her when shed started last night hed assumed that she was crazy from her grief their only child and he was dead now then hed vaguely understood that even grief could not account for how she acted and hed tried to get away from her she wouldnt let him if that woman hadnt clubbed his wife he doubted that he would have had the strength to fight her off much longer now more grief his wife unconscious although grateful he was sorry that his wife had needed such strong force to be subdued he wondered if their lives would ever regain normalcy he worried that his wife might even not survive and now the knowledge of the virus she and warren had contracted of the virus he himself might harbor theyd explained to him that if he had the sickness he would demonstrate the symptoms in the next full day and they had put him in this chamber locked him in the chamber really it was padded floors and walls and ceiling without windows it was for hysterics and the thought of what he might become was reinforced by these conditions he glanced at his watch theyd let him keep it which to some degree was comforting he saw that it said three oclock fourteen hours since hed been bitten maybe hed survive this but he felt the strangeness in him only grief depression was it something else was this the way it started angered suddenly he punched against a padded wall he kicked it cursing yesterday his life had been perfection driving home with warren from the doctor he had felt relief and happiness togetherness now everything had been destroyed for him his son was dead he punched the padded wall again he growled at it so easy to imagine how this day could have been different then he understood that he had growled just now he stood immobile startled no hed merely been angry it was nothing but the sharp salt smell of sweat in here was powerful he sniffed it came from the walls he stepped close sniffing harder this was how it started then he guessed there wasnt any question although he should have felt more fear his grief and anger had wearied him he didnt at last care and maybe that passivity was part of this thing too he didnt have a choice it forced him to accept it and that sharp salt smell of sweat he leaned close sniffing he was licking then he realized that he was licking but he couldnt stop himself the urge was irresistible his tongue scraped against the rough canvas for an instant he could recognize his double personality but then analysis was past him when they came ten minutes later he was raving five parsons waited in the field beside the fairgrounds there were many who were here already but he knew that soon there would be more he had sent messengers to all the ranchers in the valley other men from town were driving in now he saw ranchers whom he knew well just behind them it was almost time to start he climbed up into the jeep and stood and raised the bullhorn listen to me amplified his words boomed stridently toward them they stopped talking checking their weapons or organizing gear in the back of their pickup trucks they turned to face him tense from expectation small motions rippled through them then the group was still and they waited parsons stood straighter using his weight and size to gather their full attention everybody knows the risk his voice blared through the bullhorn second thoughts youd better say so now because we wont turn back once we get started if you want to go home we wont think less of you but make your minds up now before you dont have a choice they didnt move or speak they just kept watching good i knew i could count on you now therell be outsiders who dont like what were doing wholl call us vigilantes they dont understand the spirit of this valley how our fathers fathers got this land and more important how they kept it these outsiders sympathize with weakness if they had their way wed all have nothing but i dont intend to give up what ive worked for and its plain that you dont either the group nodded forcefully parsons watched as more jeeps and pickup trucks drove in we have to look ahead to what theyll say against us and i want it understood that were no lynch mob our only goal is to defend ourselves well go up and well face them and well make them stop what theyve been doing if they want to fight they bring it on themselves but were not looking for that what we want is peace remember that if anyone accuses us you know what our intentions are they murmured in agreement understood they murmured louder all together on this they shouted all together whats that all together now you sound like you deserve to live here he gave instructions they obeyed getting in their trucks and jeeps starting motors moving out to form a line others followed parsons slid down in his seat beside the driver other engines started other vehicles moved out he heard the roar of motors the crunch of tires they headed across the rangeland one long caravan of trucks and jeeps dust cloud rising six altick slumped exhausted on the gametrail this is no good theres no time left he gasped but it cant be very far now well need cover in the darkness altick squinted toward the dimming sky the helicopter had gone back to town a while ago it needed fuel besides in the night it would have been useless as a lookout altick had explained the places where they might seek shelter and the helicopter would return at sunrise they were on their own now and although angry altick was hardly foolish he studied the gametrail on that level up there grab some dead branches bushes anything were going to make a barricade they ran up taking turns some working while the others aimed their rifles toward the forest then exchanging jobs so everybody had a chance to rest they built the wall in a circle a thick barricade made of fallen tree limbs with pointed branches sticking out it was like the makeshift outposts he had sometimes helped to build in vietnam there were pointed branches projecting from the top as well and anything that tried to breach them would soon be impaled or scratched damned bad for certain meanwhile altick and his men had their flashlights and their rifles and their handguns lots of ammunition seven men all told forewarned this time and scared and angry and determined to put up a fight therell be no fire i dont want to draw attention to us not until im ready for them lets find out tomorrow where theyre hiding then well stop them help me make these torches if we need them we can light them they hurriedly gathered dead pinetree branches tying their needles into packets for torches their shirts were soaked with sweat as they worked breathlessly others watching with their rifles as the sun sank behind the mountains at once they entered the barricade blocked off the entrance and huddled silently in the darkness seven wheeler had never worked this hard in his life after he had buried what hed shot hed led his bait to water it was no good if his three steers fainted when he needed them he brought them back and staked them again and then he dug a trench around them not deep just five inches he brought fiveinch plastic drainage tubing from the barn cut it into manageable sections sealed one end with a screwon glued plastic cap filled each section with gasoline then sealed the other end he was almost ready hed been careful not to fill the tubes near where he planned to use them fumes from gasoline would only scare his targets away his only compromise was that he drove his truck to the trap he was preparing there he struggled with the tubes as he made several trips from truck to trench but then he had the tubes in a circle and he drove the truck back to the barn a trigger now he needed something to ignite the gasoline he doubted that a bullet would do the job but for sure a dynamite cap would he had the plunger and the wires from when hed been blasting boulders that blocked the stream to his pond when had he been doing that two years ago hed never finished that chore but at least he had a use for his equipment now and he rigged the dynamite cap between two sections of the tubing and he strung the wire and plunger to his vantage point up in the tree he sprinkled dirt across the tubing and the wire he glanced sternly around in search of anything hed forgotten then he slung his rifle across his shoulder and climbed the tree jittery from benzedrine he stared at the darkness when the moon came up he knew hed have no trouble seeing it was brilliant even brighter than last night almost full he wouldnt have to strain to see their movements out there he would hear them as well hear his cattle because this time he intended to permit the steers to die he wanted to catch as many of those hippies as he could to trap them as they swarmed upon his cattle at first he thought that the cattle fidgeted and lowed strangely because they were tethered then the night was suddenly in motion out there figures crouching darting forward from all angles jesus this was going to be much better than hed hoped he waited until he couldnt tolerate it any longer until the cattle were sprawled on the ground and bellowing with madness when he pushed the plunger night turned into roaring day a circle of tall flames entrapped the figures he shot repeatedly through the whooshing flames he couldnt see his targets precisely only fireenshrouded movement he kept shooting abruptly he was out of bullets and he frantically reloaded laughing he shot again his shoulder ached from so many recoils he shot and shot he heard the screams he smelled the burning flesh amid the roaring circle of flames he shot reloaded and shot again laughing the fire diminished he scanned the mounds of lifeless bodies and continued shooting at them then his rifle clicked on empty and he fumbled in his pocket for more cartridges finding none he tried the other pocket but that was empty as well and then he heard a noise below him staring down he saw a figure no several of them clawing at the tree trunk in the brilliance of the moon the dying flames around the charnel mound he heard them climbing their bearded faces looming toward him and he kicked he jabbed with his rifle as hands reached up to grab him he was screaming eight five men in the cells downstairs two other men with rifles watching them the guards were leaned back in their chairs against the wall there was a desk a door that led out to the stairs up to the main floor and a second door that led through to the tunnel toward the courthouse that way prisoners could be escorted to the judge without their ever going outside and the tunnel was both dank and fetid odors that came underneath the bottom of the second door and filled the cell room slaughter had been down here only when he was required certainly hed never been a prisoner and he was understanding the humiliation vowing that hed make things better if he ever got the chance although that didnt seem too likely he was finished in this town he knew that parsons had been much too clever for him he was sickened and the damp oppressiveness around him didnt help things he at least had gotten some sleep at first he had been anxious pacing back and forth across his cell hed even tried to reason with the guards but they just looked at him and didnt answer and his friends who were imprisoned with him when the arguments had lagged exchanged diminishing complaints then gave up sprawling in defeat across their bunks and finally were silent slaughter gave up with them in his weariness he slept the cells were in a row five units with a prisoner per unit lucas who had come back after all these years to see his father only to discover that the wheel of time had swung around to trap him he had stayed a prisoner down here when he had testified against his father at the trial the prosecution had been worried that hed flee town before telling the jury about his fathers temper so hed been jailed for what was jokingly described as his protection he had thought hed never come back but his dying mother had been forceful shed wanted him to claim the birthright she had worked so hard for plus he intended to make amends he knew that hed been wrong that if hed told the truth about the compound there was every chance his father wouldnt have been punished he had stolen two years from his father with the passage of too many seasons hate had turned to pity and with one remaining parent he was determined not to lose the father hed never had he wanted to get to the ranch to make peace with his father to warn him to see if he needed the medical examiner who was puzzled how hed let himself become committed to this all his life hed tried to keep a distance from other people and now he was close to being prosecuted for his rare social behavior if only hed persisted in his concentration on the dead and not the living yesterday when he had found the virusridden dog he should have phoned the police station and been done with it instead he had become involved and now he surely would be forced to owens who was worried about his family waiting for him hed been denied a chance to call them and he wished that he had left the office upstairs when he said that he was going but hed stayed for stupid reasons loyalty to people other than his family to this group of men whod said that they had need of him when his first duty was toward home now he would maybe face a jury because slaughter and the medical examiner persuaded him that they all would lie about the boys death what had he been thinking of what power did these men have over him did he want that much for them to like him hed be punished for protecting people whom he had no obligation to and he was wishing now that with his family he had fled to some new place beyond the dunlap who a while ago had dreamed about that antlered figure turning staring past its shoulder at him he had never dreamed it with such vividness as if each visitation were more real more clear until hed wake up one last time and see it there before him but it wasnt in his cell when he awakened just the memory of what had happened and beyond the bars the two guards who leaned chairs against the wall and held their rifles he was sweating from the dream and from the absence of the alcohol that gave him strength his hands shook as they had all day and yesterday and he was thinking that if he could only have a drink his troubles wouldnt be so fierce and hed be able to handle this but in a way he was delighted in his agony he at last had gotten his story and if parsons thought that his imprisonment would keep him from the truth about this parsons didnt know how good this loser once had been although he was not a loser any longer he would find the truth and neutralize the nightmare and save himself he clutched at every instant wondering what slaughter who was thinking of five years ago and old doc markle and the secret they had shared slaughter was a coward if the others had their secrets that was slaughters own grand secret he had walked too many darkened alleys in detroit hed faced too many unlocked doors and silent buildings hed chased too many unseen figures the grocery store a february snowstorm at midnight slaughter had finally completed his shift it had been exhausting the fierce weather making people feel on edge causing him to be sent on more assignments than usual mostly to settle violent domestic disputes and drunken arguments in bars while doing his best to drive home without having an accident on the slippery streets slaughter had suddenly remembered that his wife had left a phone message at the precinct for him to pick up some milk bread breakfast cereal and orange juice the schools were closed and his wife hadnt been able to leave the apartment to do her weekly shopping because she was busy taking care of their nineyearold twins hed skidded around a drift and glimpsed the snowobscured glow of an allnight convenience store braking fishtailing to a stop hed quickly left the car and entered the store where hed been surprised to find two boys in their early teens standing behind the counter one of them munching potato chips while the other pocketed money from the cash register the next thing hed noticed were the legs of a man presumably the clerk projecting from the side of the counter a pool of blood spreading around them on the floor his chest cramping slaughter had fumbled to unbutton his overcoat and grab his revolver but the kid eating potato chips calmly dropped the bag and raised a shotgun his eyes expressionless when he pulled the trigger slaughter had groaned from the blasts impact against his stomach the stunning force had lifted him off his feet thrown him past a rack of magazines and hurtled him backward through the stores front window hearing glass shatter hed walloped onto the snowcovered sidewalk in agony unbearably cold but worse than that paralyzed from shock no matter how hard he had strained to reach for his revolver his arms refused to move snow lanced at his face and he kept struggling but he was powerless jesus his hands felt like slabs of wood steaming blood gushed from the wound in his stomach snow landing on it and turning red christ oh christ but his pain as excruciating as it was couldnt compare to the intensity of his fright the two kids ambled out of the store paused before him and looked bored as the one with the shotgun raised it aiming at slaughters face no slaughter had mentally begged unable to speak fighting for breath hed narrowed his vision toward the shotguns barrel and inwardly winced panicked dreading the blast that would blow his head apart then absurdly the kid whod been eating potato chips had asked the other if he thought detroit would beat toronto in the hockey game tomorrow night still aiming the shotgun the second kid had answered matteroffactly that detroit would but the first kid responded that he thought toronto had a better chance and that had started an argument about being loyal to the local team through gusting snow slaughter had blinked in terror at the shotgun aimed at him abruptly the shotgun wasnt there anymore the kids had become so involved in their argument that they walked away contemptuous of him indifferent to whether he lived or died as they disappeared into the storm the kid with the shotgun rested it against his shoulder the barrel projecting upward and for a moment just before they vanished slaughterin his deliriumsaw the shotgun turn into a hockey stick a passing patrol car happened to find him slaughter spent a week in intensive care then four more weeks in the hospital while he recovered from two excruciating operations his physicians told him that hed nearly died from shock and loss of blood the only reason hed survived they believed was that his overcoat had provided a buffer against the full force of the blast otherwise they concluded hed have been disemboweled after slaughter was released from the hospital the police department had given him a months leave and then a temporary desk job to ease him into his regular hazardous duties all the while a department psychiatrist had counseled him but the counseling didnt help although slaughter tried to hide his nervousness the truth was that hed had a breakdown a nightmare kept haunting him making him afraid to go to sleep because of the horrifying snowobscured image of the two kids aiming the shotgun at himexcept that the kids would suddenly be wearing skates and goalie masks and the shotgun would be a hockey stick with equal suddenness the hockey stick would blow his head apart several times every night slaughter woke up screaming when the department finally decided to see how he would perform if they sent him out on patrol slaughter flinched each time he heard the voice from the twoway radio sending him and his partner to a crime scene as slaughters breakdown worsened he finally had to take another leave of absence and his nerves werent all that had broken down so had his marriage he was to blame unwillingly unable to control his temperament at last his wife couldnt bear the strain of his outbursts and had asked him for a divorce bitter but not at her instead toward himself slaughter had agreed why not hed gloomily decided im no good to her im scaring the children i cant be any good to my family if im not any good to myself soon afterward confused and desperate hed made the decision to put his past behind him to go to wyoming and the arbitrarily chosen town of potters field his horses were a therapy for him but he was terrible at raising them the only thing he knew was being a policeman and the day that old doc markle told him to apply for this position slaughter had been shocked by something in the old mans eyes the old man understood that slaughter was a coward slaughter would have bet on that go on try again the old mans eyes had told him and the old man had convinced him slaughter with no option had applied and gotten the job and he had worked so hard at it because he meant to prove himself the bad part was that he had then ignored the man who saved him slaughter always told himself that he was just too busy to go see the old man but the motive he suspected now was that he didnt want to face the man who knew he was a coward oh he was a coward all right seeing clifford walking through that moonlit field trapping that dead boy and running from the figures near his house hed felt the old fear rising in him hell hed panicked in the field and at his house hed lost complete control he didnt understand now how hed come this far his bluff of manliness to all these friends his arguments with parsons they were overcompensations last attempts to keep his selfrespect because the one thing that he wanted was to get the hell away from here to free himself from any need for strength and courage five years he had coasted parsons had been right in fact the mayor had done him quite a favor by imprisoning him parsons had relieved him of this burden slaughter silently was grateful he had argued with the guards to let him free but he had known there wasnt any chance so arguing was easy but the dream of old doc markle had enlivened ancient guilt and he was caught between conflicting notions stay here its the safe place for you or find a way to get out prove that youre still worth a shit he told himself he didnt have a choice regardless of his shame he was imprisoned sublimate the shame get rid of it the night was deep upon him through the tiny windows high along one wall he heard the howling and the shouting and the screaming outside thank god that youre in here that youre safe but he was growing angry at himself at parsons at this trouble he was just about to argue with the guards again although useless that would help suppress his tension then the door swung open at the far end and he stared as rettig stepped in both guards stood now careful take it easy rettig told them watch out for those rifles or youll maybe shoot your mouths off they looked puzzled shifting nervously youre not supposed to be here one guard said oh really well ill tell the woman here to take the food back rettig turned wait a minute what food for the prisoners they havent eaten no one fed us either well im sorry i didnt think of that hey you just bring the food in i dont like this the second guard said its only food for christ sake what the hell im hungry yeah but they might pull a trick weve got the rifles bring the food in if youre certain rettig shrugged bring it in okay then rettig went toward the door and gestured marge came in she had two baskets she looked at the five men in the cells and in particular at slaughter slaughter tried to smile but she seemed nervous and the last few days had aged her she had always borne her weight with pride but now it sagged around her and he couldnt stop his sorrow for her hi marge slaughter told her she just looked at him i thought youd maybe like some food she sounded weary something wrong marge its the woman i hit what about her she died half an hour ago slaughter pursed his lips glanced down at the floor and nodded then he peered up at marge i still think you did the right thing do you i wish i could be as certain nathan i killed her slaughter didnt know what to say whats in those two baskets the first guard asked sandwiches and coffee rettig answered thats just fine you bring them over to this table hey theres plenty to go around dont eat it all who us why well be sure to throw them scraps from time to time dont worry rettig frowned i told you dont worry the guard said theyll be fed i promise rettig debated then nodded motioning for marge to set the basket on the table no i dont like this somethings wrong the second guard said theyre giving us this food too easily what is it drugged its only coffee and sandwiches rettig said and in a while well be sleeping like babies hell no they eat this first were not dummies if you say so rettig picked up the two baskets moving toward the cells as the second guard stopped him no we check it first you think weve got a hacksaw in the meatloaf how about a rifle up your nose friend first we check the basket so they sorted through the sandwiches and looked inside the thermoses and shook them everything was fine okay you stand back here while i distribute them the first guard walked past rettig left some sandwiches before each cell set down plastic cups and then the thermoses all of you listen just as soon as i step back you can reach out for them since youve only got two thermoses youll have to pass them to each other but the moment youre done pouring put the thermoses back out in front where i can see them i dont want somebody throwing them slaughter kept his gaze on rettig what about outside dont ask all the animals are going crazy everybodys got their doors and windows locked theres random shooting prowlers two of our men have been wounded slaughter shook his head we found two hippies by the stockpens slaughter waited theyd been clubbed to death and slaughter made a gesture as if he didnt want to hear any more he glanced at marge then at the sandwiches and plastic cups and thermoses he cleared his throat well listen thank you marge she didnt answer only started from the room slaughter looked at rettig hey take care of her you know it rettig said and then the two guards scowled at rettig yeah okay dont get excited im already gone then rettig scanned the cells and paused and he was leaving see you chief take care now the door was closed the room became silent the group studied the guards get started the first guard told them let me see if the foods been drugged im hungry slowly they crouched slaughter was the last to reach out for the food he chewed his mouth like dust the meatloaf sandwich tasteless here ill pour the coffee troubled by the shooting outside he reached through the bars and unscrewed the cap on the thermos he poured the coffee into several plastic cups and passed the cups along but one cup he was careful to keep only for himself because as he had poured a slender pliant object had dropped with it splashing almost imperceptibly so soft and narrow that it hadnt rattled when the guard shook both the thermoses he didnt dare look around to see if anyone had noticed he just went on as if everything were normal then he stood and leaned back on his bunk and chewed his sandwich stirring with his finger at the coffee this he knew he wasnt going to drink the damned stuff although he did pretend to and then his finger touched the object it was like a worm he felt it long and slender pliant but what was it for a moment he suspected that it was an explosive but that wouldnt do much good because there wasnt any way to set it off besides the noise would draw attention rettig wouldnt give him something that he couldnt use this wasnt plastique then so what else could it be he leaned to one side so that no one saw him as he picked the object from the coffee glancing at it dropping it back in the coffee it was red just like the worm he had imagined but he couldnt figure what it was or how to use it christ this coffees awful dunlap muttered just shut up and drink the first guard told him i was right he told the second the foods been drugged theyll soon be asleep or worse thats all we need well they can throw up all they want to im not going in to help them you remember that he told the prisoners if anybodys sick hes on his own they set down their plastic cups its true this coffees rotten dunlap said dont drink it then the medical examiner said the first guard started laughing slaughter stood and walked to the bars well i dont know whats wrong with the rest of you but this coffee tastes just fine to me if you dont want it pass the other thermos down be careful slaughter owens told him i know what im doing hell im thirsty suit yourself from the far end lucas passed the thermos down they moved it hand to hand along the cells and slaughter set it by the thermos he had poured from ill save this for later if youre not too sick the second guard told him grinning you dont know what youre missing i think youll show us soon enough slaughter shrugged and went back to his bunk pretending that he sipped and liked the coffee all the more for me and he was yawning as he lay back in his bunk he wondered if another worm was in the second thermos and if he would figure out what it was and how to use it on the wall the clock showed half past midnight nine in the barricade altick waited he and his men had been hearing noises for some time but that was normal night sounds in the forest animals come out to hunt or graze or simply wander coyotes howling nightbirds singing there had been no evidence of danger they had formed a circle within the barricade and stared out toward the darkness reassured by what from all signs was another pleasant night spent in the mountains then the noises stopped completely and the men inhaled their stomachs rigid silence in the mountains was something to be afraid of one man jerked an antelope or something big like that was suddenly charging down a wooded slope its hoofbeats thundering as if in panic to escape what chased it there was scurrying through bushes branches snapping and abruptly the night became silent again and they were sweating altick tapped the man beside him in the almost perfect fullness of the moon the other man could see altick pointing over to the left a sound so vague so indistinct that maybe it was only their imagination over to the right another sound and now there wasnt any question something cautiously approached them from the forest on the far edge of the barricade leaves brushed then a twig broke and whatever was out there had encircled them now take it easy altick thought three things out there cant encircle you but then he heard a subtle fourth and then a fifth and howling jesus the howling wasnt like wolves or coyotes it was unlike anything altick had ever heard first from the woods before him then behind him then no longer singly but in concert all around him he remembered how the enemy had tried to spook him with their noises like this back in nam theyd shout or laugh or play rock and roll sometimes theyd talk in english but this howling hed never heard anything like it hoarse and crusty at the same time highpitched and strident altick told himself that in nam hed endured about the worst thing that a man could live through this could surely be no worse than that you hope altick thought again he tapped the man beside him while theyd worked to build the barricade altick had explained the significance of each tap and gesture so they could understand each other without talking now he passed the sign that emphasized the need for silence they would have their guns and flashlights ready and he passed another sign reminding them to hold their fire until whatever might be out there reached the barricade he wanted to be certain of a target but the howling was persistent and unnerving lord it wouldnt stop it must have hidden other noises because suddenly he felt the pressure on the barricade he heard the snap and scratch of something climbing as he switched on his flashlight he was slammed aside his gun went off and he was struggling with a thing that clutched him all around him he saw flashlight beams and muzzle flashes diving bodies heard the shots and screams and gasps of struggle the scene was a swirl of chaos as he rolled and punched with his gun and pulled the trigger at the obscene thing that grappled with him he was suddenly in nam again and that remembrance was familiar helped to give him courage but the thing that faced him swinging with its club was more grotesque than anything hed survived in nam and for an instant he was fearful that his shock had slowed his reflexes the club swooped toward him and the angle of his flashlight showed the spike at one end streaking toward his eye as he stumbled to avoid it firing again abruptly something struck his back oh jesus he swung to fire too late shadows swarmed and he was falling ten whats that your imagination no its shooting its just thunder or a rockfall the ranchers and the men from town went back to their drinking they had their jeeps and trucks parked in a circle on an upper mountain meadow they had posted guards who watched the darkness and theyd built several campfires which they sat around they ate and drank and checked their rifles they were anxious glad to be enclosed in something and with that accomplished parsons sat among some hunter friends pretending to be one of the guys so far he had taken chances inciting a mob imprisoning those five men back in town particularly slaughter thered be trouble about that he knew but not as much as he could make for slaughter after all so many people had gone along with this that few were left to make accusations but parsons couldnt keep the pressure on if for a brief time he had taken charge hed have to selfefface now ease off let inertia carry forward because the men had come this far theyd keep going and hed have to make it seem as if from now on he just went along with what they all intended that had always been his method and he knew that it would work again theyd solve this problem he would still have power and the valley would continue with the precedent of he didnt see how clearing out these hippies could be anything but good for him hed have to do this with some care though he would have to stay in the background what was more hed have to take care that these men werent drunk when they went up to face the hippies image was important there couldnt be any accusations that this group was just a drunken mob he whispered to a few subordinates and acting as if on their own they went around to tell the men to stow the whiskey anyhow the night was well upon them theyd need sleep if they expected to wake up by sunrise and start moving there was plenty to do tomorrow a lot of miles to cover yet a long trek through the high thick twisted mountain ridges eleven they were waiting they had crept up to the forest fringes staring at the once familiar objects in a circle at the fires and figures near them hearing voices watching shadows they were nervous glancing toward the moon and trembling on occasion they couldnt resist the urge to howl but the men across there only turned in their direction as they spread their blankets by the fires then the forest fringes were deserted they were backing toward the high ground moving deeper through the forest they were eager for the taste which although it sickened they nonetheless craved but this was not the moment or the place higher deeper in the mountains where the quarry would be less protectedthat was what they wanted so they shuffled through the underbrush and far beyond the upper ridges they heard rumbles that rolled down like thunder the echo of gunshots they moved toward it twelve slaughter waited in the darkness he was lying on his bunk pretending to sleep as through his halfclosed eyes he glanced out through the bars toward where the two guards having dimmed the lights were tilted back in their chairs their heads against the wall he knew he had to move soon but if too soon he would rouse them he was cursing to himself he had been safe a cell to keep him occupied while everything went on without him now the force of choice was on him once again and if he didnt act he knew that rettig then would understand him did it matter yes he finally decided he would not relive his past humiliation he had come here for a fresh start and if he ignored this opportunity he would never feel whole again he would have chosen a progressive pattern of defeat hed just keep moving pointlessly of course he could pretend to rettig that he hadnt understood the objects in the coffee but he didnt know if he would be convincing even so he wouldnt be convincing to himself he had to do this cursing to himself he studied both guards then he sat up slowly in his bunk because he finally had understood these objects in the coffee they were obvious so much so that he wondered why he took so long to realize their purpose that he wondered how much smarter rettig was than he had ever guessed the plan was simple to the point of genius perhaps that was the reason slaughter took so long to figure it the objects in the coffee were pure phosphorus the liquid kept them from igniting that had been the word that solved the puzzle for him still thinking that these things were explosive he had wondered how to detonate them detonation made him think of fuses a bright light burning but the blast would warn the guards these things must have a silent function then but if they were indeed explosive how the hell could he ignite them since he didnt smoke he didnt carry matches bright light matches and their phosphorus ignition and he had it suddenly in high school watching as his teacher drew the worms of phosphorus from jars of water waiting as the worms exposed to air abruptly were on fire later he would think how close hed come to missing the significance but now he understood and didnt have a choice he got up slowly from his bunk and walked with caution toward the bars he saw that all his friends were sleeping he stood motionless and waited for some action from the guards there wasnt any and he knelt to reach through toward the second thermos then he slowly opened it and poured the coffee into plastic cups another red worm slid out dropping so there was another one and he was reaching in the cup to grab the worm and drop it quickly into the cup that held the other the coffee safely over them there was one thing that still bothered him he knew that phosphorus was poison if some portions had dissolved the coffee might make them sick but then he thought that its foul taste might not be from the phosphorus but from the way the coffee was prepared to make it taste so bad rettig hadnt wanted anyone to drink it so they all had tried a sip and spit it out they maybe would be fine he watched the guards and guessed that there wasnt any point in waiting further he dipped his finger into the coffee grabbed the worms and as they dripped he pressed them around the bolt that locked his cell he wouldnt have attempted this if hed been in a new and wellmade jail but this place had been built in when he had first come down here he had been appalled oh sure the locks would hold if someone lunged at them or tried to break them but the metal wasnt pure enough or thick enough for him and he had asked permission to revitalize the jail which the town council had denied him what did he expect they asked him hacksaws or a bomb there had never been that kind of trouble here and if he did his job right none of that stuff would get in here well he had a trick to show them now and he was grateful that they hadnt acted phosphorus burned at high temperatures although not sufficient to melt steel the heat would weaken this poor metal and the lock seams werent that good to start with hell he didnt have a thing to lose he had to try he stepped back but the phosphorus remained inert or maybe he was wrong and these things werent what he had figured no the coffee still was dripping from them they werent yet exposed to air the coffee had to dry as suddenly he saw what seemed to be a spark and in a flash the phosphorus was burning white hot sparks a thick cloud rising he was staring toward the guards the hiss was louder than hed expected like a thousand sparklers blazing on july fourth and one guard moved a little in his chair as slaughter lunged against the cell door but it held the phosphorus kept blazing around the bolt and lock seams and he lunged again and this time he could see the seams begin to part the guard was shifting in his chair and in a moment would be fully wakened slaughter lunged against the door again the metal clanging and abruptly he was weightless stumbling forward almost falling as he realized that he was out the cell door swinging free the phosphorus still hissing blazing he kept stumbling his arms out for balance as the guard was sitting upright in his chair and slaughter lunged against him while the guard fell upsetting his chair slaughter grabbed the rifle and he swung to grab the rifle from the second guard who now was sitting up as well his face grotesquely startled wincing from the rifle blow against his shoulder falling slaughter dropped one rifle aiming with the other and the two guards paused where they were halfway to their feet now and the worst part had been managed stay exactly where you are dont move or even fidget slaughter told them how the hell they stared from slaughter toward the dimming remnants of the phosphorus whats going on the medical examiner asked in the cells the men were moving nothing were just getting out of here is all remember slaughter told the guards dont even scratch your noses he was shifting toward the table pulling out the drawer and grabbing for the keys he watched the two guards all the time he edged back toward the first cell lucas waiting here the big key slaughter told him and he moved again to watch the guards while close behind he heard the scrape of metal as the key was turned the cell came open slaughter glanced at lucas coming out he concentrated solely on the guards then as the cells were in their sequence unlocked and the men came out but how did owens said ill tell you later you two get on in there slaughter pointed toward the guards they hesitated damn it move i told you slaughter started toward them and they raised their hands okay were moving you get in the first one you get in the fourth but why no reason just do what i tell you i just want you separated move for christ sake and they did and slaughter told the medical examiner to bind and gag them using belts and strips of cloth torn from the bunk sheets slaughter watched them aiming the rifle then the medical examiner stepped out and lucas shut the doors and locked them bring the keys the other rifles dunlap was already halfway across to reach one door no were going this way slaughter told him that way leads upstairs this other one is where were going dunlap was puzzled youll see slaughter went across and took the keys from lucas he unlocked the second door and swung it open then he flicked the light switch in there and they saw the damp slick bricklined tunnel it leads toward the courthouse theres no time they hurried through slaughter stared back at the two guards in their cells he waved and stepped inside the tunnel where he shut the door and locked it then he turned and they were running it was slippery in here condensation on the ceiling dripped down on them and the tunnel echoed from the clatter of their footsteps slaughter saw the vapor from his breath and felt the damp brick chill and kept on running he was forced to stoop as he ran underneath the lights that hung from the ceiling then the tunnel curved a little and they reached a second door its locked i have to use the key but when he fumbled with the key it didnt work the door stayed locked whats going on here then he realized the door had not been locked at all what he had done just now was actually to lock it he worked the key and turned the handle slowly wincing as the door creaked he pushed at the door and they faced darkness theres a hall just follow it youll reach some stairs now slaughter flicked the lights off but we i dont want to be a target feel along the hall they inched through the darkness here the floor was tiled it echoed from their halting footsteps owens struck an object cursing quiet slaughter told him theres a table quiet people might be in here so they kept inching forward slaughter felt ahead we should have reached the end by now he told himself and then his boot struck wood and he gripped the staircase bannister we made it owens said and slaughter didnt take the time to caution him he just continued up the stairs and everything was dark up there as well except that from some windows moonlight spilled in showing the front door and the big main hallway shush he told them and they stopped while breath held slaughter listened well use the back for all we know there are guards in front he moved down the murky hallway and the layout in here was the same as at the police station he passed silent offices and reached the back door staring out then looking at the others pulling the door open stepping into the moonlight my car is in the lot behind the station if were careful we can take it he shifted from the sidewalk toward the grass concentrating on the parking lot as a man stepped from the bushes beside the courthouse slaughter thinking of the two kids in the grocery store whod shot him almost raised his rifle firing but he managed to subdue his fear and resist the impulse there wasnt a reason to kill this guard the most he could hope for was to overcome the man before he could shout to warn other guards slaughter shifted his grip on the rifle about to club the man as rettig came up close to him the other men sighed christ almighty owens said rettig stopped in front of slaughter it took you long enough i almost gave up waiting so you figured what that stuff was how come youre so smart to think of that slaughter asked relieved i didnt marge did she remembered what you said about the cells downstairs how you complained that they were weak then rettig explained what had happened while slaughter was in jail and slaughter wished he hadnt heard i think parsons is going to kill those hippies rettig said what hes going to pick a fight and kill them hell arrange it so it looks justified but hell kill them just the same and hell have so much help that no onell say it wasnt selfdefense its nineteen seventy again but those hippies owens said everything theyve done why should we care what he does to them from the farthest sections of the town muffled gunfire echoed slaughter looked down at the ground then turned to owens because theyre people or have you forgotten that the group was silent oh i know the townsfolk used to call them animals but you more than anyone ought to know the difference slaughter said owens stared it isnt worth it slaughter they arent worth it maybe not to you so go on look out for yourself and your family but ive got my own obligations those damned hippies dont mean anything to me but ill stake everything to help them owens stared a moment longer if i didnt have a wife and kids theres no need to explain go on well talk about it some time sure except they both knew that they wouldnt owens lingered you stayed until sunset you made good on what you promised sure owens hesitated then backed off and turned walking along the courthouse disappearing into the shadows slaughter watched him here chief rettig said take my gunbelt ill get another one from the station the weight of the gunbelt was satisfying slaughter strapped it on your family my brothers with them they left this afternoon thats all that owens wanted too i guess but he intends to leave with them we need him but he doesnt plan to stay that makes the difference slaughter stared off toward the sound of the gunshots well wed better get moving be careful when you reach the parking lot parsons has men inside the station i dont plan to advertise slaughter turned to face the medical examiner you coming i have work to do yourself he said to lucas no i have to see my father without help ive had a chance to do more thinking if theres trouble i know where my place is yes slaughter studied him i understand that i suppose ill see you he started toward the parking lot hey wait im going with you dunlap said youd better not i dont know how im going to stop parsons but tomorrow will be rough you need a witness is it me or just your story im not certain any longer just so you know the risks im going to need a friend up there thats certain rettig you stay here and watch the town ive got to count on someone but you dont have any men rettig said how many would i need ten a hundred if i take the men we have this town will be defenseless even then we wouldnt be a match for parsons and what i assume must be an army no if dunlap and i cant do it then it simply wont get done the numbers are against us if i try to beat parsons on his terms ill have to beat him on my own terms rettig studied him take care i mean to ill see you in a couple days sure but rettig didnt sound convinced somber they shook hands then slaughter moved toward the parking lot the group was disbanding lucas went one way the medical examiner another rettig watched as slaughter reached the parking lot scanned the police station and walked toward his car slaughter had the rifle and the handgun dunlap got in the cruiser slaughter slid behind the steering wheel the engine started and they drove from the parking lot rettig waited until they disappeared he frowned as the rumble of gunfire rolled across town part seven the mountains one parsons and his men woke half an hour before sunrise they crawled from their sleeping bags squinting shivering in the morning dampness there was hurried cooking hunters packing their gear and squatting by the camps latrine then scuffing out the cookfires pouring water on the coals checking that the embers died before the jeeps and trucks were started and the caravan moved out a few men were reminded of quillers caravan when he first crossed the valley now a different kind was heading up to stop him and they thought about their families their businesses the cattle dying and they meant to put a stop to this as soon as they were able parsons didnt talk much now if there had been a way to go back to the town he would have not because he was afraid but he was wishing they would do this on their own if it went wrong he could avoid the blame then otherwise he still could take the credit but hed come this far and hed be noticed if he left and so he stayed with them silent letting their determination carry them forward they would drive up through this meadow take another loggers road up to a second meadow then a third after that theyd move on foot by five oclock theyd reach the start of the escarpment and if not today then tomorrow everything would be completed as the column passed rockfalls cliffs and ridges there were unseen caves that shut out the sunlight and for now what hid in there slept uneasily two the helicopter was anchored near the runway slaughter crouched behind oil drums near a shed and stared at the damp chill postdawn mist that shrouded the chopper he dimly saw the rotor blades that stretched out from the top their long ends partly sagging saw the bubble of the nose the insectresembling tail the smaller rotors at the back he felt the wind shift swirling mist so that the helicopter now was thoroughly enveloped and he turned to dunlap who crouched beside him shivering it cant be long now thats what you keep promising dunlap said what i wouldnt give for a shot of rye to warm me up you want to back out try to make me slaughter frowned dunlap was in bad shape more than slaughter had realized when they had left the jail but there had been so much to do so much to think about back then that slaughter hadnt argued with him anyway what dunlap had said last night was trueslaughter did still need a witness although dunlap shook so much now that slaughter wasnt sure how useful the reporter would be there wasnt any choice however slaughter reminded himself events were in charge and he was compelled to move with them he could tell himself that if he wanted to he could run but given who he was he couldnt allow himself to run his life had trapped him when hed left the jail his first impulse had been to go after parsons in a jeep but parsons and his men were too far ahead of him slaughter needed something quicker and hed thought about the helicopter that altick had been using because it couldnt search the hills at night the pilot would have set it down until the morning when he would take off again the hard part was to find it slaughter didnt think the pilot would have gone back to his home base in a neighboring valley given the emergency the pilot would have saved time staying here slaughter drove out to the statepolice office on the highway but the helicopter wasnt there he checked the park the fairgrounds and at last settled on the obvious the simple airfield from which ranchers flew to reach their cattle in the worst of winter dropping bales of hay there was just one airplane that the ranchers leased in common a gravel runway one hanger and a few equipment sheds but there the helicopter was anchored near the runway after that slaughter had risked driving home he doubted that with so much trouble in town guards would have time to search for him nonetheless hed been nervous when he reached his house relieved to find it deserted hed quickly packed two knapsacks with food canteens woolen shirts sleeping bags lots of ammunition and a firstaid kit dunlap didnt have his camera anymore so slaughter had lent him one if thered been time slaughter would have made coffee but dawn was approaching and they returned to the runway just before the sun rose now the mist was thinning slaughter glanced at his watch the sun had been up for half an hour maybe hes not coming dunlap said no the helicopters too important hell be here im sure of it at once slaughter heard footsteps crunching on gravel he tensed as the footsteps came closer then the footsteps paused on the other side of the equipment shed slaughter frowned he glanced at dunlap then out toward the helicopter when the footsteps went back toward where they had begun slaughter didnt understand who was here a patrolman so this is where you are unnerved slaughter swung to face the voice he found himself staring at lucas christ dont sneak up on me slaughter told him hes not here yet who the pilot no were waiting howd you find us process of elimination yesterday you talked about a helicopter that the state police were using i drove around until i found it whered you get a car a truck it was my fathers look im going up there with you slaughter noticed the rifle lucas held whats happened lucas didnt answer some tiling with your father lucas gazed out toward the helicopter then he looked at slaughter they killed him lucas squinted he was evidently hunting them he had some cattle staked out for bait and he was going out at night to shoot from a tree he must have killed a lot of them there was so much blood you found the bodies only his as much as i could recognize when they were finished with him lucas wiped his mouth they disemboweled him for a start they you dont have to talk about it but i want to then they ripped his arms and legs off lucas spoke without expression when i got to the ranch i didnt find my father but i smelled this stench that drifted toward me from the foothills roasted meat and burning hair i drove my fathers truck out there was something burning all right i could see the flames mostly from range grass when i got there and i saw the mangled cattle and the blood and then i found my father in a half a dozen places from the empty cartridges around the tree im sure he must have killed a lot of them even drunk he never failed to hit a target they must have taken the bodies with them as i said im going with you but you didnt even like him i dont care i owe him i took two years from his life and if i hadnt maybe everything would somehow have been different i dont know what good youll be up there ill be your eyes behind you right now you need all the friends you can find lucas said the right thing that was certain slaughter stared at him and nodded if the pilot ever comes then slaughter heard other footsteps crunching on gravel no a double set of them and he motioned for lucas and dunlap to crouch with him beside the oil drums next to the shed the footsteps crunched past the opposite side of the shed and then moved into the open with the mist almost gone slaughter glimpsed two men who crossed to reach the helicopter one man rubbed his hands together and blew on them the other unhooked the helicopters mooring cables slaughter straightened walking toward them lucas and dunlap following youve got some passengers he told the two men who swung in surprise slaughter recognized the pilot the other man he didnt know but they were rigid and he wondered if theyd heard about his jail break whos that slaughter hell you scared me well be going with you in the chopper theres not enough room then well leave this other guy behind and what about the rest of you theyre coming with me sorry i cant do that one man with me isnt any problem i took two men with me yesterday the pilot shook his head three men with me and i guarantee wed never make it this thing wasnt built for that much weight well have to try it anyhow slaughter said thats impossible slaughter pointed toward the western mountains you dont understand the trouble up there maybe but therell be even more trouble if we all try to go up in this thing well have to chance it without me to fly you choose less men or none of us gets off the ground they scowled at each other slaughter turned toward lucas and dunlap which man could he choose he really needed both of them and more important neither of them would agree to be left behind i cant do that he said and his first mistake had been to think that they knew nothing about how hed broken out of jail his second had been to turn toward lucas and dunlap because suddenly he felt the pilots arms around him grabbing for the rifle at the same time lucas was struggling with the pilots companion dunlap faltered blinking well if you boys planned to have a dance i would have bought some tickets someone said and everybody stopped then pivoting toward the shed as a policeman stepped into view he had his handgun drawn and slaughter didnt know if this was help or more trouble as he recognized hammel the new man on the force whom hed disciplined when they had looked at cliffords body on friday now then everybody step clear of each other keep those rifles down they didnt move i mean it hammel walked sternly forward and they parted you two hammel pointed toward the pilot and his friend step over to the left there dont you know enough to stay away from men holding rifles in particular our fine police chief here he might get angry and shoot your toe off my god hammel asked the pilot what did you think youd accomplish by trying to capture slaughter did you think the town would make you a hero i dont care about his jail break i dont even know why he was arrested i just dont intend to go up with three other men in that helicopter well youre honest thats a credit hammel smiled and waved his handgun okay clear out youre no use to us but hey im giving you a break clear out dont try my patience slowly they moved toward the shed and then they started running no use to us you told him slaughter asked thats right lets keep this in the family when rettig told me what had happened we sat down to figure where you might turn up i must be obvious as hell well a few of us arent quite as stupid as you think we are you call it smart to chase off my pilot we dont need him rettig told me to keep a watch on you to use my judgment and your judgment says im going with you do you remember when we found cliffords body i said something about what had killed him being obvious you called me on that oh not much enough though hell you made me feel like an idiot and it turned out you were right so fine but now its my turn i can do a few things youd give anything to do im going to fly your helicopter for you slaughter thought back to the file he kept on every man i see that its coming back to you hammel said i spent three years in the air force my specialty was choppers and i was damned good just this once youre going to shut your mouth and watch somebody else whos good at what he does and when im finished you had damned well better step up face me straight on and say thank you more than that ill say im sorry for the other day its too late for that slaughter shove your friends inside lets get this party started slaughter touched his beard stubble theres only one thing what is it if we crash ill say we should have kept that other guy to fly us hammel started laughing three you can see that something happened here parsons and his group looked at the barricade the question though is what there werent any bodies but they saw the blood the state police hats the ripped discarded knapsacks the empty bullet casings so there really was a fight up here that wasnt thunder we heard it wasnt thunder no it wasnt thunder they walked around the barricade several of them glanced nervously toward the forest i dont like this why you think those hippies would be stupid enough to attack this many men we dont know anything about them we know that theyve likely killed more people i dont mind admitting im scared so what you think we ought to go back for more help you think that we dont have enough already i cant tell you what i think lets leave it that way altick is in trouble thats all anybody has to know or was in trouble its the same were here to put a stop to them if altick still needs help were here to give it if hes long past help were here to make them pay for that the odd part was that parsons didnt have to say a word the group had formed a common personality and for a time as they had driven up the loggers roads he had been satisfied that he would not be blamed if things went wrong but as they drove higher he had gradually felt uneasy up here and when at last theyd left the jeeps and trucks to continue on foot he started feeling scared for one thing he had never liked the mountains oh hed gone up hunting with his friends but that was part of his position hunting was expected from him but hed never really liked it or the wilderness up here his best surroundings were his office and the towncouncil chambers these men were at home up here however and for several hours they had grown in strength as his diminished they had used terrain maps plotting which direction was the best way to the base of the escarpment they had hiked up past the lake where alticks men had disappeared theyd traveled sunday afternoon and evening then today through monday morning all told theyd been ten hours on the move now mostly in the trucks and jeeps considering how poor the loggers roads were and how hard it was to hike up through these mountains sixty miles was some achievement although they had another fifteen yet to go the things behind them traveled only in the night so they would not catch up until tomorrow at midnight if they moved as fast as they were able in the hills above the group however there were many others sleeping waiting although of course that information came out only later in the meanwhile there was nothing in the forest near the barricade to indicate what finally had happened to the men within the barricade the sun was high above the forest and the group was tightening their knapsacks taking time to eat some beef jerky or to urinate then they were moving higher as one member of the group would later say it was like climbing toward another country four slaughter flinched from every treetop they scudded over jesus go down any lower and youll have us pulling pine needles from our asses hammel grinned if you want a smooth ride call united airlines did i promise anything except to get you off the ground but watch it look out the helicopter tilted its rotors nearly colliding with a tree slaughter clutched his harness as hammel worked the controls and the helicopter tilted on a different angle frantic hammel fought to gain altitude abruptly the helicopter was steady again slaughter realized that hed stopped breathing its the wind i didnt count on this much wind hammel said can you get us there or cant you if you want to take your chances i can keep on trying hey you didnt talk about taking chances when we were back on the ground well that was easy talking as hammel grinned again slaughter said oh i get it now youre crazy sure id have to be to try this youre a little nuts yourself well youre not far wrong about that slaughter heard a noise behind him when he turned he saw that dunlap had his hand up to his mouth as if he might be sick lucas was ashen staring at the treetops i think everybody in heres crazy slaughter said they were past the treetops swooping across a meadow slaughter briefly felt relieved at least there wasnt anything for them to hit although the wind was tugging at them again the helicopter twisting then the trees loomed before him and the helicopter struggled to rise above them slaughter thought he heard a branch scrape on the landing struts he closed his eyes and swallowed when he looked again the trees were thick a few feet underneath him i dont see a sign of anyone he shouted to be heard in the roar of the engine and the wind we dont know which way they came hammel shouted back im simply heading straight toward the escarpment once we get there we ought to have a good view of the ridges below us but weve got another problem this thing isnt any honda look at how much fuel were using slaughter did the gauge was just below the halfway mark but weve been gone just a couple of hours overloaded in a wind thats stronger than i figured thats the reason ive been flying low to avoid the wind and save on fuel with this much weight if we were higher the wind would hold us back worse than it is the chopper would have to work harder wed have even less fuel hammel paused between each sentence drawing breath to shout more then we cant go back slaughter said right wed never make it ill keep flying until were using fumes and i have to set her down i dont know if well manage the escarpment you mean get above it its too high for all this weight ill have to set down at the base hammel paused if we have fuel to get that far slaughters temples throbbed the landscape was wild below them ridges hollows rockfalls struggling in the wind the helicopter narrowly missed trees if we crash now slaughter thought were finished then something flashed ahead of him and he was pointing there i see them hammel aimed the chopper toward the flash no its the vehicles they used i dont see any people they swooped toward the surreal image of a parking lot across this distant mountain meadow jeeps and vans and trucks all parked absurdly in a pattern of straight lines as if at a supermarket or the kmart then they were past them sure i understand now what they did hammel said they moved up the long way through that chain of loggers roads and meadows you see on the map they must be hiking toward the base of the escarpment if we keep on a straight line toward the mining town from here well have to see them if the forest doesnt hide them theyll move through as many clearings as they can that many men well see them all right we might wish we hadnt but well see them right now thats the least of our worries the helicopter swayed again and slaughter gripped his harness sweating everybody feeling all right back there oh yeah fantastic dunlap groaned just think about your story what im thinking about is straight ahead of me dunlap pointed the land curved up past wooded ridges higher past the cliffs and rockfalls far beyond to where the snowcapped peaks loomed hazily in the distance where two peaks were close together in the pass between a cliff glinted in the sunlight it was massive beyond belief slaughter saw that even from this far away the cliff was like a dam or a huge stone glacier and on top somewhere the mining town had been established slaughter felt a chill pass through him as he saw it getting larger as he gradually came near it and he knew what dunlap meant he really didnt want to go there five parsons and his men stumbled through the forest up a gametrail that theyd discovered past an open ridge before them far off they could see the high cliff they were heading toward the wind was fierce but it failed to moderate the force of the sun and as they sweated working higher one man slumped off the trail to lean against a boulder this is wrong i have to rest a few men stopped beside him scowling with contempt when you were riding in the jeep you thought this was great that was then now i have to rest the wind shrieked through the trees this goddamned wind what difference does it make how soon we get there because everyone agreed to reach the cliff by sundown why we cant do anything at night well have to wait till tomorrow morning anyway hes right another man said so what if we spend the night down here well end up sleeping in the woods no matter where we are because i dont like knowing they might be around me you guys saw how well that barricade was built but it didnt do any good i dont intend to sleep until i know that this is finished as a branch snapped in the forest they pivoted startled its the wind the first man said im telling you i have to rest well damn it rest then but youll do it by yourself the others are ahead of us now and i dont intend to stay behind the man hitched his knapsack tighter to his shoulders and proceeded along the gametrail you must be stupid hanging back like this hey wait for me im coming with you they hurried to reach the main group which was out of sight among the trees but the first man didnt have the energy to push himself away from the boulder as another branch snapped in the forest he looked all around in panic and suddenly did have the energy hold it wait he stumbled up the gametrail at the crest he saw the main group filing through a wooded hollow angling up the other slope he ran to catch them seeing the men whom he had talked to join the main group he lurched toward the hollow then up the other side and at the top he swung around a lip of rock before he saw the men stopped so closely before him that he almost bumped against them whats the matter we dont know yet the overweight man breathed hard as he glanced toward the group before him they had left their singlefile formation spreading out to stare ahead some were slumped against fir trees and then the words came drifting back through the wind they found something up ahead what is it i dont know yet the men whod leaned against the fir trees straightened to stare past the heads and shoulders of the men before them its a uniform the words were muffled by the wind what kind a state policeman there was no way that the overweight man could see from where he was he veered to the side to get around his companions he climbed a slope of fir trees looked down toward the men on the gametrail and saw parsons plus two members of the town council searching through bloodstained clothes the shirt has a captains insignia the overweight man heard parsons say this was alticks but what happened to him do i have to draw you a diagram this gametrail leads up to the mining camp what do you think happened apprehensive the windblown men flinched and raised their heads directing their gaze toward the rockwall miles above them even that far away it dominated the overweight man stared at it wishing that he hadnt come here this was wrong the notion had been fine as long as he was in town but up here everything was strange and different youre just a little scared is all he told himself just keep your eyes on parsons he knows what hes doing all the same he didnt understand why there were no policemen here hed heard about the trouble slaughter was in about slaughters holding back not acting until it was almost too late even so that didnt sound like slaughter and he wondered if the rumors were true it could be that we shouldnt be here he thought but he knew that the group could not turn back now that hed be considered a coward if he went back on his own he had to stay to go with them although he wished desperately that he had stayed in town then he heard the helicopter peering up he saw it roaring toward him it was just above the trees it must have used the gametrail as a line to follow and it swooped up past him slaughters grim face distinctive through the canopy the helicopters rotors added to the wind the overweight man saw the choppers belly and the landing struts the other men stared up frowning pointing parsons stared up as well the bloody clothes he held were contorted by the wind on the slope the overweight man stepped higher peering through an open space between the trees at where the helicopter roared past him getting smaller and he strained to catch a final look he lost his balance he slipped on the slick mountain grass thrusting his arms out to grab a branch but he missed the branch and rolled when he hit the slickness beneath him muffled his impact and he felt the slickness soaking through his pants and shirt and he gaped beneath him seeing mashed lungs bowels liver and kidneys he screamed but it wasnt just the guts that made him scream it was also the bones ribs and legs arms and pelvis shoulders and most of all the skull its lipless tongueless teeth bared smiling at him throat raw shrieking the overweight man tumbled down the slope six in the helicopter slaughter pointed there they are the men were bunched out on the gametrail wearing redcheckered shirts and khaki hunting jackets examining an object they had found at first the trees obscured them the men were small then growing larger as the helicopter neared them then they must have heard the rotors and they peered up and slaughter saw one man on a wooded slope above the group the man was squinting up at him the helicopter roared past and as slaughter looked back he had lost them he was glancing forward at the final rising sweep of ridges disturbed by the rockwall looming miles ahead just as well we found them weve got less than a quarter tank of fuel hammel said take her down my business isnt on the escarpment its with parsons well i dont know where to land this thing they stared ahead there wasnt any clearing all they saw were wooded ridges stretching toward the mountains and the rockwall far above them look there has to be a way for you to land a few more minutes and well be too far ahead of parsons for me to walk back and reach him before sundown there were open spaces behind them far behind i still wouldnt be able to reach him before sunset well i dont see a clearing so youd better sit back relax and enjoy the ride the wind tugged at them buffeting i dont think well have a chance to find a place to land the wind will choose it for us i dont understand but then he did he saw the higher ridge of pine trees they were heading toward he felt the helicopter jolt to one side felt the snap of branches underneath him jesus i dont think youve ever flown a helicopter until now he braced himself as green obscured the sky metal scraped against wood the helicopter tilted slaughters head slammed back through the canopy down among the trees his stomach swooping he saw granite rush toward him seven slaughter crawled from the wreckage stunned moving slowly there were broken branches in the boulders all around him and his shoulder throbbed and there was something hed forgotten then it came to him is she going to blow he blurted to hammel more than likely hammel squirmed out on slaughters side the far side was impassable the helicopter wedged among boulders and shattered trees the broken rotors adding to the chaos slaughter stood and slumped against the helicopter he was dizzy we have to get these men out he leaned in feeling offbalance until he realized that the helicopter had tilted when it hit the trees falling head first its tail in the air now he wiped at his eyes to clear their double vision reaching in for lucas who was slumped above him hanging from his seatbelt dangling across the seat that slaughter had been in he had snapped ahead then back then forward again and lucas now was moaning i smell gasoline hammel said hurry slaughter unhitched the seatbelt and pulled at lucas bracing himself to take the weight but even so he stumbled backward nearly falling in the rocks and broken branches as he felt support behind him and hammel clutched at lucas have you got him slaughter asked hes mine go back for dunlap slaughter struggled back into the wreckage dunlap was slumped behind the pilots seat and slaughter had to climb up to reach him he stretched his stomach hard against something and gripped dunlaps suit coat tugging dunlap can you hear me dunlap moaned we have to get you out of here slaughters chest was pressed so hard against the top part of the pilots seat that he almost couldnt muster enough breath to talk he tugged again you hear me he gasped this things leaking fuel we have to get you out of here slaughter tugged again and this time dunlap moved a little good thats good youre going to make it slaughter told him unhitch your seatbelt try to climb down toward me dunlap peered groggily toward slaughter and his face was bloody what unhitch your seatbelt let me grab you dunlap nodded but his eyes were stupid and he didnt move youve got to yes i heard you cant you see im trying dunlap murmured jesus try harder this things going to blow dunlap nodded again he blinked fumbled to release his seatbelt and tried to push himself toward slaughter then slaughter had him tugging and they both slid downward tumbling low against the instrument panel on the upended helicopter slaughter felt dunlaps weight upon him gasping dunlap i cant breathe slaughters voice was muffled by dunlaps chest against his face ill get him off you slaughter heard he felt hammel reaching in and then the weight was off him slaughter inhaled deeply get moving what about ill bring the rifles and equipment leave them cant well need them get away hammel almost argued abruptly he lifted dunlap and stumbled through the boulders slaughter strained to raise his head and then he stood and stretched up to grab the knapsacks which had fallen behind the seats he threw them out then he grabbed the rifles he was just about to leave when he saw the camera he had lent dunlap gripping it he lurched from the helicopter he fell gasped wavered to his feet hoisted the knapsacks and rifles and he was running the odor of fuel was everywhere he stumbled over a branch but he managed to keep his balance and he kept running although he didnt know where he was going over here he saw hammel on a slope above him tugging lucas and dunlap fir trees thrashing in the wind slaughter struggled up the slope but they were moving higher cresting disappearing down the other side he rushed to catch them smelling fuel he slipped and almost fell but kept surging higher then he reached the crest and lurched across it saw them and tumbled toward them falling he fought to breathe huddled among sheltering boulders those packs werent worth the risk hammel said the rifles are and anyway were stuck up here we have to eat i still say are you hurt is anybody hurt slaughter asked well he is they frowned at dunlap who was propped against a boulder his eyes closed blood across his forehead dunlap can you hear me slaughter asked let me rest a minute hold still while i check your head dunlaps hair was bloody matted slaughter saw the gash above his hairline is it deep hammel asked i dont know theres too much blood oh jesus dunlap muttered youre all right the blood is clotting jesus jesus take it easy lucas slaughter turned to him he saw that lucas was awake at least the eyes were cloudy narrowed but nonetheless open i hear you lucas said this knapsack slaughter tossed it to him theres a firstaid kit some bandages and disinfectant help me slaughter could have done it by himself or he could have asked hammel but he wanted lucas to get moving to regain control and now he turned to dunlap just hold on apart from your head does the rest of you feel okay im sore but nothings broken at least i dont think so jesus dunlap winced and slaughter watched as lucas found and opened the firstaid kit slaughter took a bandage then he fumbled in the second knapsack for a canteen wet the bandage and swabbed at dunlaps face youre looking better dunlap shook his head and grimaced as slaughter dabbed the gash above his hairline theres no more dirt that i can see i dont see any bone these head wounds can be awfully bloody even when theyre nothing slaughter you dont need to lie to me im telling you its deep but not too bad well make sure you dont go to sleep well watch for signs of a concussion if you get afraid though youll only make it worse now hold still while i do this slaughter opened a tube and squeezed disinfectant onto the wound he put a square of gauze on top then wrapped a bandage around the head and tied it dont touch the bandage it might slip off dunlap nodded slumping lower against the boulder jesus jesus slaughter opened a canteen here these pills will help the pain he watched as dunlap took the pills drank and swallowed then slaughter turned to lucas and hammel both of you are sure youre all right both men thought a moment felt themselves and nodded what about you hammel asked a little dizzy lets hope that doesnt mean youre going into shock at least the chopper didnt explode lucas said slaughter leaned against a boulder wincing well i guess things could be worse although right now id hate to think exactly how well rest a little then well look for parsons better make it soon the sun is heading down they all looked up then and the sun was dipping toward the rockwall up there the wind thrashed the forest how soon i dont know a couple of hours and if we dont find parsons by then slaughter said in the dark we might never find him eight the gruesome discovery of the mutilated organs and the dismembered skeleton had not been anything that theyd expected theyd anticipated the possibility of finding corpses yes but not organs that had been chewed and bones from which the flesh had been gnawed no one had imagined that further degree of horror for a time they were distracted by the need to calm the man whod fallen onto the guts and the bones then they directed their troubled attention toward the rockwall and were forced to decide if they intended to go farther look in nineteen seventy i helped kick out those hippies but im telling you that this bunch isnt like those others sure that first bunch they were pacifists what do you mean pacifists they fought us but they didnt want to they knew they were whipped before they started christ whats wrong with you guys we just found i know what we just found dont talk about it but they i dont want to talk about it did you think wed just hike up kick their asses and chase them down the mountain hey you were as eager to come up here as the rest of us yeah and now i wish to god i hadnt they were silent as the wind howled well we have to make a choice we either go on or go back theyll catch us in the forest what we dont have a choice you saw the barricade the blood hell you saw altick what was left of him theyll trap us and theyll kill us weve got too many men for that you think so there werewhatfive hundred hippies in that commune there could be less a man said hoping or a shitload more the hopeful man frowned why not say two hundred thats still more than we have and they know these hills they live up here we havent got a chance then what i say we go up and get them before they come down for us again the group was silent parsons stood to one side he listened careful not to add his comments because he was frightened almost to the point of panic they would hear his fright and they would lose respect for him if he had his way theyd all be running down the mountain to reach the trucks and jeeps hed assumed that this expedition would be revisited but now he saw the truth and he was terrified he tried to calculate how to turn them back without revealing his fear he saw the sun dip toward the mountains and he knew that even if the group left now they would still have to spend the night away from their trucks and jeeps but anything was better than the implications of the rockwall they were facing going back at least they had a chance the men continued talking pete makes some sense you know that what to finish them before they finish us its better than just waiting for them sure its what we started out to do but youre not listening i heard you now shut up im going on at least this way weve got a chance of surprising them anybody coming with me they stared if we split our force we dont have any chance at all im going with you someone said count me in as well the rest were nodding but i dont mind telling you you think the rest of us arent scared and that was good enough they all frowned toward the rockwall lets get up there no i cant the man whod found the dismembered skeleton said stay behind then you cant leave me its your choice im sorry you found it but you have to get control the two men glared at each other and the weak man swallowed looking at the ground he nodded the group walked up the gametrail parsons joined them near the front still maintaining the pretense that he was their leader but he needed all his will power to keep from screaming youre all crazy lets get the hell away from here nine slaughter waited ready with his rifle as he heard the noises in the forest he glanced toward the wooded slope on his right where hammel lucas and dunlap huddled where hammel had the other rifle ready where slaughter would have to run if there was trouble they had left the area of the helicopter and climbed toward a higher ridge to find a vantage point on one side the rockwall had towered cast in shadow by the lowering sun on the other side ridges had descended toward the valley straight below close and vivid was the gametrail they had worked down through the forest choosing a spot on the trail where slopes came down on the right and left and the trail itself was wide and there they had planned their tactic and they waited slaughter didnt like his back exposed he didnt know what thing might creep behind him the light dimmed with every moment and the noises in the forest now were louder even in the wind he thought he knew what was approaching especially when he heard the voices and he felt slightly more at ease although not much then he saw the men in redcheckered shirts and khaki hunting jackets parsons near the front and when they saw him they slowed then halted slaughter someone asked in surprise he didnt answer just stood straighter his rifle ready whered you land the helicopter we heard you were in jail another man said but slaughter only pointed rigidly toward parsons you and me i dont we can do this in the open and let everybody hear or else yes i want to talk to you parsons amazed slaughter stepping readily from the group slaughter glared as parsons reached him i should jam this rifle keep your voice down parsons said what these men are crazy parsons whispered no dont look im telling you they want to go up to that mining town for christ sake thats exactly what you wanted not any longer not after we found parsons explained and slaughters face went cold look weve got to get down out of here parsons said in the dark how and to where were not safe as long as theyre around us parsons stiffened have you seen them you stupid i ought to hit you over the head and call it a kindness first you bring them up here then you whine the second theres trouble but this isnt like the hippies back in nineteenseventy theyre going to kill you thats right slaughter said now its turned around youre going to find out what it felt like and i hope to god you suffer you dont mean that almost but ill fix you in my own way listen to me all of you get over here the group hesitated then approached our fine mayor here made a slight miscalculation it seems he thought that this was open season that hed bring you up to do a little hunting and then grin as you went back to town well this is how its going to work were going to find a place to camp were going to spend the night and if theres trouble well defend ourselves in any case well head back in the morning and well calculate exactly what were dealing with well get the trained men we need he paused then hear me trained men not a bunch of weekend heroes and well bring in all the gear we need and well do this properly my guess is a few planes dropping some kind of sleeping gas up there will be enough to let us move in safely well use straitjackets as restraints and then well take the commune back to town and help them but were not about to shoot them if weve got another choice its one thing to defend ourselves but im the law here and what you men planned is murder if the word gets out if our buyers discover theres an epidemic business here is finished one man said well never sell our cattle i cant take one side against the other all i know is what the law is well you came here from the east id say the same no matter where i came from youll have to kill me before i let you kill somebody else without a reason have you got that they glared anyhow i think youd like a graceful way to stop this you dont have the vaguest notion what youre up against we saw the so you know enough to want to quit now slaughter told them he felt their tension start to ease as he took the burden from them im in charge now and youll all do what i say they brooded and nodded good slaughter studied them before he signaled to his companions up on the slope the group turned toward where lucas dunlap and hammel stepped from the trees and bushes dunlap still had the bandage wrapped around his head why were they hiding someone asked so they could be my witnesses if you made trouble one of you was in hammels rifle sights the group frowned at the rifle theres no time the sun is almost down we have to move that ridge up there at least well have the high ground christ this wind will tear at us up there i prefer the wind to whatever else might be in this forest slaughter said ten the wind persisted slaughter hunkered by some boulders on the ridge the place was barren just a razorback above the treeline here and there mountain grass had caught hold but the ground was mostly bare and the men had either crouched among other boulders or else dragged dead trees onto the ridge and lay behind them waiting shaking from the cold or so they told themselves that they were shaking from the cold hunched low to escape the wind slaughter was reminded of the cold in detroit of when hed walked into that grocery store that winter night and found those two kids and been shot and how his world had changed for the past five years hed lost his nerve what puzzled him as he hunched waiting here now was that he wasnt afraid any longer oh he was apprehensive that was to be expected but he wasnt frightened and that puzzled him pride he guessed once his pride had started to grow it had smothered his cowardice exactly when the pride had started he didnt know perhaps when he had broken out of jail perhaps before that when hed gone against what parsons thought was best some moment in the past few days had been a turning point for him and if this night would be his last at least he knew that he would acquit himself with dignity he wished his exwife could see him now but then he realized that he was thinking too much memories like that were bad ones and he shut them out and concentrated on the forest the night was thick eerily so inasmuch as the sky was bright the stars sharp the moon an almost perfect brilliant circle glowing coldly in the wind the moon seemed extra large also as if it had been magnified and slaughter felt its brooding power once he thought he heard a howl down in the woods but in the shrieking wind he wasnt sure and clutching to the woolen shirt that hed taken from his knapsack and put on he continued to study the forest someone moved beside him when he looked he saw that it was hammel and he nodded then redirected his gaze toward the trees below him theres something i want to tell you hammel said what is it that big speech you gave i know im embarrassed no listen what you said about those hippies about wanting to protect them i admire you for standing up to parsons slaughter shrugged i watched a lot of kids get pushed around back in detroit and this is one place where it isnt going to happen i dont care how sick those things up there might be were not about to kill them unless were forced to they once were people still are if we find a way to help them and i mean to try my best to do that slaughter shook his head ive seen enough hate some of it i felt against myself i think its time this town looked ahead instead of backward unless they come for us no reply slaughter he was silent staring toward the forest and he groaned then whats the matter something hit me he rubbed his shoulder something cracked against the boulder next to him something whipped hard past his head its stones get down theyre throwing stones a man nearby him shouted slaughter winced and crouched low by the boulder but the stones kept falling pelting all around him he held up an arm to shield his head he heard the men around him shouting and felt the rocks crack down upon him well it looks like they dont feel the same as you do slaughter well soon have to fight but theres a difference i dont see it were not looking for a fight theyre forcing us this towns getting back what it gave out they called these hippies animals and now their words have turned to fact and with a vengeance slaughter gripped his rifle and the stones abruptly stopped he swung toward hammel puzzled hear it even in the wind he couldnt help but hear it far off in the woods slaughter heard the howling he saw the flash he heard the blast it came from a ridge above him a massive fireball blossoming into the darkness the helicopter thats where we left the helicopter whump whump whump in the opposite direction the valley exploded whump whump whump pivoting staring down slaughter saw more fireballs dozens of them the valley reminding him of a battlefield even at a distance he felt the shockwaves the jeeps the trucks a man nearby him shouted they set fire to them the gas tanks whump whump whump a steady sequence of explosions mushrooming fireballs lighting up the night and slaughter even with the ridges that obscured his vision sensed the wider blaze the parched mountain grass now burning and he turned to peer upward toward the blaze from the helicopter again shocked to see how far and fast those flames were spreading torching trees and bushes becoming a fire storm the wind its fanning everything the blaze consumed the upper ridge illuminating the faces of the men revealing the rocks and ground quite clearly were a target now even as slaughter said that more rocks pelted on them get down its the wind the wind will push the fire toward us itll sweep down across this ridge to reach the other trees and scorch us slaughter clutched his injured shoulder dropping men were screaming shouting in the lowland burning mountain grass had led up to the underbrush and then the trees the hills below were all ablaze now and the howling was around them and the rocks kept pelting them now the roar of flames blended with that of the wind and slaughter struggled to his feet to scan the slope above and behind him where the blaze was treehigh looming toward them when the next rock struck him slaughter made his choice some of the men were shooting toward the bottom of the ridge stop it he shouted you cant see your targets theres no chance we have to get away from here the flames below them roared closer everybody get over here we have to move along this ridge stay away from that ridgeslaughter pointed toward the burning slope above themand get around the fire to higher cover no one listened they were shooting screaming as more rocks struck all around them slaughter glanced frantically from the flames on the upper ridge toward the burning lowland on his opposite side he could see hills for miles around now lets get started help he blurted to hammel then scrambled toward dunlap lucas parsons anybody get these men to follow me we have to work along the ridge away from these flames toward higher cover a rock struck slaughters back another walloped his thigh ignoring the pain he pointed toward a dry streambed that veered upward away from the fire he shouted more instructions as rocks hailed all around him and from above he felt the scorching heat approach the ridge get moving it likely wasnt so much what he said as what they sensed they couldnt stay here they were shooting less they glanced around they stared down at the fire the rocks were hurtling toward them and the blaze in the lowland kept getting wider brighter stronger there wasnt any sense in running toward it they were forced to move along the angle of the razorback toward the dry streambed that slaughter had noticed and that would lead them away from the fires up toward the rockwall lets do it frantic they started slaughter didnt realize until later that the route they followed had been calculated for them that they had been pushed in one direction and were headed for a trap but no one else took the time to figure it either all they knew was that they had to get away and they were shouldering their knapsacks grabbing rifles stumbling across the boulders up the razorback toward the streambed and the rockwall their silhouettes made vivid by the flames below them easy targets as the rocks kept coming watch for anybody hurt make sure you bring them men were falling moaning others kneeling staring at the blood on their hands and their clothes slaughter tugged a man to his feet and struggled up the razorback with him around him others were limping moaning flinching they reached the streambed and kept going then the fire was a distance from them even so the flames kept roaring pushed by the wind and the men didnt dare rest soon the blaze would come for them again the rocks continued to pelt them as they stumbled higher on occasion shooting mostly fleeing working upward and the rockwalllit by the moon and the blazing treeswas vivid high above them as they struggled time was telescoped it seemed like twenty minutes but it must have taken several hours for their panicked flight the streambed sloped high up toward the rockwall and the rocks kept striking them all the while they ran and stumbled screaming then the flames were far behind them as they came rushing from the streambed onto flat ground they ran up to the rockwall and stopped abruptly puzzled gasping staring all around finally they understood christ theyve trapped us rocks swooped toward them from three sides the cliff was behind them and they bunched there facing outward shooting one man and then another fell the group consolidated crowding closer tighter slaughter was the first to notice pausing to reload he glanced to his left and saw the ancient wooden structure in the shadows that were half lit by the flames in the lowland whats this thing here its the railroad someone said and chambered a fresh cartridge railroad when they mined the gold they built a railroad thats the trestle it slopes toward the valley slaughter almost couldnt hear him amid the rifle reports amid the blasts from shotguns and handguns he was almost blinded by the muzzle flashes a rock struck his throat and he felt as if he was being choked we can climb it someone said climb the trestle others echoed slumped on one knee slaughter fought to breathe to overcome the swelling in his throat a rock whizzed past his head while others clattered against the cliff behind him he swayed to his feet leaned against the cliff and massaged his throat as the group surged toward the trestle lucas stopped to help him i think i can manage slaughter gasped his voice was hoarse disturbing him as he stumbled to catch up to the men they all tried to climb it at once no it wont hold a few men at a time hammel ordered but no one listened they were clustered on the trestle on the zigzagging beams that supported it one beam started creaking slaughter overwhelmed by anger now charged close and jerked several men from the trestle you and you shoot to give us cover you get off the rest of you stay the hell back while these men climb his voice was raspy distorted they glared at him and unexpectedly they obeyed kneeling among the beams they shot toward the blazing darkness while above them other men climbed slaughter heard the scrape of their boots the groan of old wood the clatter of rocks striking near him the flameravaged valley echoed from their shooting you five men slaughter groaned now its your turn the pattern was established small units of men climbed in relays while the other men shot at unseen targets in the trees guided by the trajectory of the hurtling rocks slaughter remained at the bottom rasping orders shooting flinching from stones that periodically struck him more men now were climbing and again time was telescoped the next thing slaughter realized hammel was beside him now its our turn slaughter glanced around he saw hammel lucas a few other men he didnt know where dunlap was or parsons but he understood that this was the last of the group he gripped his rifle and he reached up toward a beam and he was climbing once he almost lost the rifle and he wished it had a strap but there was no way to provide one now and he kept climbing reaching he felt the old beams sag the soft wood crumble in his hands but the trestle was holding when he heard the scream he looked down and one man slipped falling the man struck two beams and thudded in the darkness where he didnt seem to move around the man grotesque figures swirled cant look down slaughter told himself i have to keep climbing he was worried that it had been lucas or hammel who had fallen but as he glanced toward the beams across from him he saw lucas and hammel climbing still puzzled about where dunlap and parsons were slaughter strained and reached and kneed and stretched peering over the top he saw the group waiting in the moonlight and the glow from the fires below their expressions were unnervingly stark slaughter clutched for a handhold crawled up from the final beam and limped across the railroad ties toward solid rock the trestle never should have held he knew that he never understood why it had the fire that scoured this area of mountains eventually burned the trestle so nobody had the chance to examine it in the daylight and understand the miracle of its construction but meanwhile the wind intensified funneling toward them from the lowland surging up the draw that they were in and pushed by it they followed its urging one thing favored them whatever had attacked them was below them granted the figures were no doubt climbing the trestle pursuing but for the moment slaughter and his group were safe they struggled up the narrow pass the glint of snow on each peak flanking them the wind howled at their backs they worked onward too exhausted to run we have to find cover before they catch us someone said no another man objected we have to keep going if we reach the other entrance to the pass we can get the hell away from here thats stupid theyll be waiting for us theyre behind us maybe they plodded forward without energy or reason slaughter squinted back toward the burning lowland as he turned ahead the wind propelled him like a fist and at last he saw dunlap parsons other men he recognized but many others were missing some men moaned while others cursed still others were too weak even to murmur they stumbled limping spread out through this narrow draw like refugees or soldiers in confused retreat then slaughter heard the howling close behind him theyre up here now he said theyll be coming look for cover but there wasnt any there was just the narrow draw the steep windscoured rocky slopes on each side leading toward the snowcapped peaks and they kept moving then they saw it what the town weve reached the town one of the men had a flashlight he scanned its beam toward a dangling weathered sign that told them motherlode then other men fumbled for flashlights turning them on they saw listing shacks tumbled sheds crumbled walls toppled roofs sagging doorways there were slogans on them in a language no one understood and no one ever would stark cryptic signs and scrawls and symbols and the streets were like a midden heap the garbage from the mining town and from the culture that had been invented up here a sprawling mass of junk and wornout objects which as everyone approached turned out to be huge piles of bones some human others unidentifiable the curses of the men combined with the roar of the wind and the howling that approached them okay then damn it if they want a fight the flashlights lanced across the darkness in the lowland everything was burning from the valley far across the night sky was pierced by lightning thunder rumbled toward them it was madness the first man who reached in his pack to pull out a bottle filled with gasoline inspired all the others parsons had instructed them well theyd come prepared the bottles were softdrink empties their twiston caps sealing their dangerous contents the men now unscrewed the caps they pulled out handkerchiefs or tore off strips of clothing and stuffed them into the open bottlenecks a frantic man lit his braced himself thrust his arm back and threw the flaming bottle others watched as it flipped blazing through the darkness and struck a shack the shatter of the breaking glass was followed by a whoosh a surge of light and the shack was suddenly in flames that shot skyward with stunning abruptness someone made a sound as if he watched fireworks another bottle had been lit and after it arched toward the other slope it struck a shack exploded and the street was flanked by flames now as the group huddled gaping toward the trestle and what neared them gimping spastic growling frenzied hairy figures cloaked in furs their mouths frothing their limbs jerking lightning flashed in the valley ridges flamed in the lowlands winds fanned the burning shacks and spread destruction to their neighbors slaughter shot and aimed and shot again as did the others near him burning bottles burst among the jerking figures the things were moaning howling screaming but they kept coming relentlessly stumbling toward the gunfire nothing seemed to stop them they had risen from the dead too many times confident of immortality they were unafraid ignoring the wounds that halted them a moment but didnt drop them some were in flames as they reached the group that shot them the things struck with clubs they howled they slashed they clawed they kicked and bit slaughter shot one then another as his rifle clicked on empty for the last time he drew his handgun aiming shooting aiming other flaming bottles burst before him men screamed as they fought handtohand with the figures friends around him fell back those behind him tried to regroup half the town up here was burning cryptic symbols gone forever as slaughters handgun clicked on empty as well and while he lurched back attempting to reload something struck him it was big and solid hairy it was foul with stench and rot and it was on him slashing with its teeth and claws he tried to push it off him but its teeth sank into his wrist and he was screaming jesus no dont bite me but the thing braced its teeth and twisted grinding and the pain the shock of fear was so intense that slaughter didnt realize what he was doing when he regained awareness he saw how he had clubbed his handgun at the figure until fluid oozed from the figures skull and it was motionless on the ground beside him slaughter gasped staring at his shredded wrist ive got it he screamed im like them now christ ive got it that would be his most heroic moment what in memory would be the apex of his life the quick consideration that would save him thinking of the foulness creeping up his arm to reach his shoulder and his brain thinking of the monster he would shortly be he struck out with his handgun toward another monstrous figure turned saw parsons and ran parsons noticed him parsons who suddenly became rigid the fear in his eyes more fierce than any emotion hed ever displayed for parsons must have thought of slaughters anger toward him must have assumed that slaughter was already maddened and changed parsons raised his shotgun firing blindly slaughter faltered as the pellets struck his side but the image of the two kids in that grocery store returned to him and he mustered the strength to keep running as parsons pumped a fresh shell into the shotguns chamber slaughter reached him knocked him flat grabbed the shotgun raised it to his shoulder and he couldnt have accomplished this if he had not been large and tall the way he was but with his great reach he could manage flames around him buildings burning lightning flashing slaughter pulled the trigger and blew his contaminated arm off eleven dunlap huddled in the blackness of the tunnel the sight of the gruesome battle had so unnerved him that hed stumbled backward tripped and fallen raising his frightened gaze hed glimpsed the tunnels murky entrance and raced to it for shelter so afraid that his sphincter muscle weakened making him void his bowels the revolting stench humiliating him as he crouched and whimpered in the tunnel this at last was his great truth the story he had worked for and he couldnt bear to watch it he was a loser not because he drank too much so often or because he had that trouble with his wife or because the big investigations never came his way he was a loser simply because he wasnt the man he thought he was he had run in panic with the other men toward the cliff he had been the first man to climb in a frenzy up the trestle he had known reporters who in vietnam had stood with soldiers in the shriek of battle he had known other reporters who had clambered into burning buildings or had waded into flooding rivers or had argued with a gunman holding hostages not him though he had always said that he just never had the chance but now he knew he didnt want the chance when the opportunity occurred hed persistently avoided the chance now he saw the battle raging closer to the tunnel and in fright the stench of his voided bowels much worse he groped backward farther along the tunnel fleeing he gripped at the timbers he felt along the clammy walls and then he understood that while he had befouled himself and caused this obscene stench another stench was in here too and despite his revulsion he didnt understand his compulsion to fumble toward it from the change in sound he realized that he was in a chamber and he had a flashlight in the pack that slaughter had lent him bringing out the light switching it on he scanned the chamber he moaned no he didnt want this he didnt want to see it dear god he had fled for sanctuary to their secret place of burial on wooden pallets along the floor he saw their bodies fetid ugly lined in neat rows clubs beside them rotted meat their arms crossed gently on their furskinned chests the mass of them were maggotridden horrors others were more recent and as he lurched hard against a slimy wall he saw that one was moving rising from its deathlike sleep groggy drawing breath for energy dunlap screamed as the creature turned toward him it was frowning in a moment it was grinning sure dunlap thought remembering the boy who had seemed dead and then returned to life the virus these things didnt know what death was some returned and others didnt but they all in time were laid to rest here in the expectation that they eventually would rise again dunlap dimly sensed the paintings on the wall the bear the antelope the deer they leapt in rampant silent beauty clubs and rocks drawn next to them as if the animals fled from the weapons about to strike them and the creature was kneeling grinning frothing snarling gaining strength to spring as all the tension dunlap had been feeling clamored for release he screamed in fury lashing forward striking with his flashlight breaking teeth he struck again and then again feeling cheekbones snap eyes burst he hit until he completely lost his strength and what had crouched before him lay still and silent dunlap wept he sank to the floor and sobbed until he thought his mind would crack hitting the creature hed broken his flashlight he was trapped in the darkness from outside he heard the battle heard the shooting and the screaming he was torn between his need to flee this room and his determination to avoid the battle but he couldnt stay here in the darkness he heard noises another figure rising he groped to his knees then his feet and fumbled toward the tunnel then he found it and he shuffled down it bumping against the walls but the tunnel went on too far in horror he understood that by now he should have seen the flames outside dear christ hed gone in the wrong direction he was in a different tunnel no he told himself no he needed light and then he thought about the camera slaughter had retrieved it from the helicopter it dangled from a sling on dunlaps neck desperate he raised the camera and triggered its flash at once although briefly he saw more paintings a bear an antelope a deer the bear who seemed to die in the winter and come back to life in the spring the antelope and deer who when the cunning of the hunt was ended willingly gave up their lives to feed those whod stalked them symbols of a death cult and as dunlap triggered the cameras flash again his edge of vision showed him something high on the wall that both terrified and attracted him he knew what it was he didnt want to see it but he had to and he aimed the camera he pressed the button the flash went off a seconds brightness and a charcoal drawing of his nightmare appeared before him crouched sideways part man part cat part wideandered elk with paws and a tail its deep eyes turning past its shoulder glaring at him dunlap was stunned immobile no he insisted to himself that he hadnt seen it this had to be a trick of his imagination so he shifted and his hands shook but he nonetheless managed to aim again and trigger the cameras flash and this time he saw more of the chamber not just the drawing of his nightmare but something below it quillers car the red corvette the throne room red room and above the car beside dunlaps nightmare was an even greater nightmare the final obscene horror quiller what had finally become of quiller quiller was mounted on a cross upon the wall his arms stretched out his hands and feet nailed his gaunt naked body sagging maggots dripping his hair and beard grotesquely long having continued to grow after he died they had crucified him with fervent belief in the final miracle the expectation of his resurrection something cracked in dunlaps mind he finally discovered peace twelve the townspeople talked about it as if years from now the story would assume the aspect of a legend how the final battle of had taken place years later the traumas of the past expunged with fire how the western section of the mountains had been razed the trestle burned the mining town obliterated only ten men lived beyond the battle slaughter parsons lucas dunlap and six others by all logic slaughter should have died from his selfmutilation but he was strong his frame large his constitution robust and although he was close to death when everything was finished lucas cauterized the stump of his arm then bound it he and parsons carried slaughter through the pass and down the other side where they struggled across the next valley and by afternoon managed to reach a road dunlap almost wasnt found but one man checked the tunnel used a flashlight to learn its horrifying secrets and saw dunlap kneeling wideeyed staring up in reverence at quiller dunlap never spoke again in town they joked that he had found religion but the joke was poor because it wasnt any joke it was the truth and dunlaps eyes were filled with silent wonder ever after hammel had died in the battle clubbed to death until his skull was split in two parsons left town shortly after returning to it before the investigation started owens had already gone and neither man came back one day in late september slaughter managed the strength to go into town he still was weak and lightheaded but he was alive and that was really all he wanted that and his new purity his courage he drove in to see the medical examiner because he had only one arm he had to drive an automatic and he wasnt with the force now rettig ran that so he didnt have a cruiser he parked at the house which he had never been to fumbled to open his car door and got out walking across the grass he felt off balance from the change of weight because of his missing arm and he moved slowly glancing at the boxes and the suitcases stacked on the porch the medical examiner came out to face him i heard you were leaving slaughter said thats right i hate to see you go well its like king john and his pears his what his pears they say he died from a surfeit of them and slaughter only stared you know the magna carta yes i know which john you mean he slept once at a convent hed been screwing all the nuns or so the story goes the outraged monks put poison in his food although his death was caused they claimed by getting sick from eating too many pears i dont quite get the point well its like the medical examiner paused its like im suffering from a surfeit of death too much death you dont know how it was i have a fair idea no you missed it all the cleanup all the bodies they brought in from the commune from here in town i stayed this long because i thought i could forget it but i cant its too much too damned much altogether slaughter glanced at the weedchoked grass he took his time well i wont argue theres no sense im going to chicago hell im going to be a doctor thats what you are now but only for the dead im going to treat the living now i never want to see another corpse again and slaughter nodding continuing to stare resurrection the medical examiner told him thirteen slaughter drove back to where he now was living not to his place but to wheelers ranch where lucas now was the owner sometimes marge came out to cook for them but mostly just the three of them were out there slaughter helped to tend the stock as best he could when he wasnt tending to the needs of dunlap everyone finally had gained what each had wanted lucas had a father slaughter had another chance to have a son dunlap had his story and his mind was now at rest though not his body slaughter cleaned it fed it cared for it he wasnt quite sure why except that this man had become a friend and anyway nobody else would take this man dunlaps wife had finally divorced him life was peaceful the full moon on the summer solstice had intensified the brilliance of the prior night when slaughter had lost his arm the fire though had destroyed the commune all its members those that slaughters group had not already destroyed the town had lived in terror but the help from outside had arrived the infected animals and cattle were exterminated the valley was a wasteland that at last had started its revival part of what had helped had been the storm that followed with the wind and cleansed the valley after flames had purified the mountains one discovery had been important after the figure who had staggered into town at last had died samples of the creatures blood had been enough to produce a vaccine that would stop the infection from spreading the virus was no longer a threat and as slaughter sat now on the porch he noticed that the blanket he had placed on dunlaps knees was sagging slaughter stood from where he rested in a hammock he walked over and used his remaining hand to arrange the blanket there thats better therell be a frost they say tonight we dont want you to catch a cold dunlap rocked and gazed in peace toward the rangeland thats the stuff you thirsty slaughter asked dunlap continued rocking have a drink slaughter poured a glass of beer and tipped it up to dunlaps lips the reporter swallowed drooling there thats just the answer slaughter wiped dunlaps lips and drank from the same glass nice place dont you think do you guess youre going to like it here dunlap kept rocking sure you are its lovely just the place for us then slaughter returned to the hammock where he lay back sipping life was good now he had earned it as he glanced out toward the rangeland he saw lucas riding on his pinto admiring the other horses there were cattle on the range as well when marge arrived tonight she would watch over dunlap while the onearmed man and the son in need of a father would ride out to check the steers and in the meantime slaughter leaned back smiling as the setting sun cast an alpenglow on lucas who rode straight and strong and a colt veered from its mother and they gamboled in the sun about the author my father was killed during world war ii shortly after i was born in my mother had difficulty raising me and at
