army and never say die general sir william slim disbanding the forgotten army the wild life in medan was something neither night nor ddt could stop beyond our steamy windows the darkness held all the breathability of a sailors armpit a winged and nameless shitbag came hurtling in from the murk full of offence and fury its manner was of one intent on shattering preferably for ever the world speed record for tropical hirsute insect nuisance flying it burst across the room at drunken velocity maintaining an altitude of approximately two inches above the heads of the assembled drinkers the drinkers were tanking themselves up for the arrival of a lorryload of unleashed dutch girls and failed to notice this freak of evolution still accelerating the shitbag gained height and ploughed its way through a cloud of assorted mosquitoes flies moths and fluttering uglies which had appropriated our central light as a zone for combined aerial combat and propagation of species i saw it because i was leaning against the far wall of the mess listening with jock ferguson to johnny mercer on war the generals have done their best but its been a bloody untidy war all along he was saying do you wonder were stuck here in such a right old cockup you cant say the war is over even now och youre exaggerating man said jock ferguson straightening up squaring his shoulders and pouring a halfpint of whisky down his throat youll be saying next it didnt begin properly either when did it begin then september of course when britain went to war against germany over poland jock and i said together with minor variations johnny shook his head he had been a teacher in civvy street and liked to lecture wrong im talking about when the world war began the one were still involved with not the little local european war starring adolf hitler the world war began in when japan invaded china the poor old chinks have been at it ever since that was when japanese aggression started it was at this point that i spotted the winged shitbag cutting a swathe through the lesser phyla of its kind ah but the real war started in said jock if so then it ended in said johnny after the fall of france in the summer of all of europe was at peace unified by hitler nothing else was going on except the british buggering about on the fringes the yanks were reading their comic books the russians were frigging around doing nothing in particular it was only later that the yellowbellies got things stirred up again johnny gave his highpitched laugh and scratched his arse some of us had heard his weird version of history before whatever you say ve and vj days finished the war all the separate bits of it i said balls there are wars going on everywhere still in china everywhere what about spain what about here what about indochina yes but they arent real wars theyre not called wars horrys right and youre wrong as usual mercer ferguson said theyre just local conflicts mercer was not discomposed speaking for myself i prefer a war like a good book its got to have a beginning a middle and an end he laughed and tottered off in search of a drink the fellers no heard of armistices jock ferguson said and also stomped off leaving me exposed to the drunken mercies of sgt wally scubber shellshocked survivor of the arakan and already as pissed as he was every night of his life he clutched my arm cunningly detaining me and supporting himself at the same time the winged shitbag executed a few crafty immelmann turns overhead without in any way losing flying speed merdeka wally howre you doing time for beddybyes i was shaying to charlie meadows in blighty you got proper househesh to live in with proper shanny with lavatories that flush properly and all that not like bloody medan horry see what im getting at curtains carpiss on the floor i took a deep drag on my cigarette as wally rambled on i tried to listen to other conversations my old mate charlie meadows was saying since we are an army of occupation we must conduct ourselves accordingly there are certain laws which armies of occupation have to follow but we are so bloody under strength that the mess gramophone started up ron dyer was playing the wellworn hitrecord terang boelan and the glutinous words drowned out what charlie had to say i took a deep swig from my beer glass and sank into an armchair wally perched himself on the arm without interrupting the flow of his talk he had even invented a way of drinking without swallowing which allowed him to go on spouting while the liquor trickled down everyone agrees that blightys the cunt hup sorry the country with the highest culture good roadsh before the war i was a member of the automobile asshociation well thatsh special to england the automobile asshociation its all part of the shit what shit are you on about hup the shituation as i shee it the shitbag infuriated by the smoke and heat of the mess had worked itself up to maximum speed making a sudden banking turn it dived and struck the wall just above my head with a resounding thhhwerrujjjkk fast on the wing slow on reaction time the shitbag hung there for a moment its head pressed thoughtfully against the wall its multitudinous members still vaguely propriocepting patches of distemper and odd wingcases flaked off at point of impact then the creature dropped it spun tangentially away from the wall and nosedived into my beer wally noticed nothing only the british horry my dear old mate only the british are truly shivershiverlised i must go in a minute wally ive got a date you wouldnt call the french or the belgiums shiverlised would you i stared down at the shitbag it made vague motions in my direction either swimming or beckoning america theyre shiverlised wally china theres a very ancient culture for you giggling wally jogged my arm my glass slopped the beer revived the winged shitbag it caught my eye and made a spunky attempt to heave itself out i experienced a moment of fear in case it washed up on my flies and burrowed in before i could check its progress it looked like the kind of creature that devoured sexual organs every morning for breakfast ancient yes yes ancient all right too fucking ancient by half thats china no automobile asshociation there i know the chinks horry ra the rickshaw asshociation thats them he laughed leaking cigarette smoke and his wrinkles opened and shut like the pleats of an old accordion christ wally the fucking aa isnt the beall and endall of shiverlisation the chinese were cultured when we were running round naked with our arses painted blue the aa wasnt invented then either he stirred restlessly on the arm of the chair dropping ash in my lap leave the aa out of this were talking about the chinks now and what a dirty lot they are youve only got to look arseholes chum theyre a sight cleaner than we are and more shiverlised you only shay that because youve got this chinese pusher down the bazaar the chinks shiverlised theyre a tropical race horry a tropical race and you cant name me one tropical race thats shiverlised look at africa india and burma dont talk to me about burma mate i was there in the thick of it with fucking div lighting up another cigarette i glanced at my wrist two watches were strapped there one was a beauty in a black gunmetal case it had been made in holland unfortunately it did not work very well the other was an expensive indian watch with a red sweep second hand which looked good although it kept poor time taking a mean reading i decided it must be eightfifteen or eightthirty or perhaps a little later i could soon leave politely and go and see margey the party was nominally in my honour since i was flying home in only four days time but there would be another party in the sergeants mess on the following night just as there had been one the night before the winged shitbag was a terrifying mass of claws and antennae and legs not to mention four stubby wings with which it was whipping my lifeless indian beer into foam its body comprised a chunk of chitin and armourcasing from which a mass of pubic hair burst in all directions it was a perfect scale model of a tank squashed in a bramble bush fixing two dull black eyes on me it redoubled its efforts to home in on my flies or throat the chinks are really beaten schmashed just like the dutch i mean the dutch are practically a tropical race too theyve lived here for centuries the terang boelan record finished i was able to hear charlie meadows again still talking about army conduct a good man charlie and an old burma hand but jackie tertis kept butting in thats okay as far as it goes charlie but take it from me that no native population has ever yet been kept down by leniency you must show em a firm hand thats all they respect by god if i had my way thank heavens you arent going to get your way jackie charlie said mildly jackie tertis was a slightly built man unlike the rest of us he was always dapper his uniform always smartly pressed tertis was different leading his dark sexless life under another star the sun which baked most of us a solid brown had turned tertis a hot foxy hue he was always stoked to furnace temperature wally was the temperature of cold irish gravy blowing cigarette smoke over me he continued his lecture horry youve been away from home too long talking about getting demobbed here there isnt a man in this mesh tonight that wouldnt give his head to go home next monday in your place im telling you this for your own good horry these little chink hoors with all their dirty shexual habits just for a moment wally scubber interested me more than the winged shitbag the latter had dived to the murky depths of the indian beer to see if glassdrilling operations would get it anywhere what dirty sexual habits do you happen to fucking well have in mind wally his mottled face was lopsided with reproof as if he suspected that we were talking at crosspurposes there i think you know better than me horry isnt that right i dont wish to be spesh speshicif give details but chink girls arent brought up like english girls are they no churches or schools or general discipline no knickers bloody slanteyed hoors itll spoil you horry onnis going with your chink bit down in the bazaar when you meet up with some nice english girl i belched and heaved myself out of the chair finish up my beer wally theres a good lad i handed him my glass which vibrated with the enraged activities of the shitbag i wove my way across the room you cunt they do wear fucking knickers i announced to the assembled company johnny mercers laughing face loomed into mine johnny was shorter than i a redfaced ratfaced cockney who made an indifferent rasc sergeant i was watching you catch that bit of wild life in your beer mucker he said it reminded me of what the old venereal bede said about human existence that it was like some horrible hairy flying abomination belting in through one window of a great hall straight into some poor cunts wog beer he started howling with his homemade brand of laughter and i joined in smiting him on the shoulder i pushed through the crowd towards the mess door it stood open to let the heat and smoke out i blundered through emerging almost at a trot into the steaming night you could tell blindfold that medan was just one degree off the equator the air suppurated like primaeval broth a million monstrous little things unknown in england expressed their beings in sound so urgently that it was hard to know what was air what noise i stood there swaying slightly and flipped my fagend away into the night its parabola was cut short in midair something had gobbled it up before it fell the headlights of a battered fifteenhundredweight truck penetrated the darkness and moved down the road from the direction of the guardhouse they turned uncertainly in at the mess gates revealing themselves as two eyes the colour of mule urine they backed away to one corner of the enclosure there was a smashing sound sustained and quite leisurely as the fifteen hundredweight struck our old wooden summerhouse and ignored it rsm dickie payne was returning drunk as always i stood there listening with remote pleasure as payne drove forward and then presumably more by accident than in a spirit of revenge back again continuing the demolition of the summerhouse johnny mercer staggered out of the mess to see what was going on merdeka our beloved rsm still battering his way through life i need a pee he turned to a nearby bush the sound of his urine streaming on the grass reminded me of similar needs as i moved to one side of the building lobbing my tool out the rsms vehicle swerved forward again the glow of his headlights swept the ground ahead two frogs lay clasped together one on top of the other in a shallow puddle it had rained heavily at sunset the frogs were motionless staring ahead into a cold nirvana of amphibian copulation i directed a scalding jet of piss on them with such force that they were flipped over showing their deathyellow bellies i laughed as i pissed churning them up watching them struggle the damned truck was nearly on me i was so taken up with the frogs that it almost ran me over payne you pissyarsed fuckpig i yelled jumping backwards as the ghari reared forward payne had the truck door open holding it with one hand while he steered with the other he was half falling out of the cab as he backed the truck towards one side of the mess he shouted something incoherent as he shot by sweaty face gleaming and then the amazing happened at the time standing there clutching a dripping prick i thought only how appropriate it was that the rear end of the truck should begin to sink slowly into the ground the rsms response was to rev his engine the ground collapsed the truck settled down on its haunches cab rearing into the air mud splattered from its stillspinning front wheels cursing dickie payne fell clear landing on hands and knees in my pissy puddle among the frogs he scuttled away into the bushes while the engine died as the truck sank backwards still further the yellow beam of the headlights swung upwards till it illuminated the top branches of a nearby tree with avian imprecations a terrible feathered thing took flight and clattered into the darkness johnny was at my side laughing as if his ribs were trapped in a suit of armour the bloody cesspits caved in he kept saying the bloody cesspits caved in isnt that just like life this statement no less than the truth somehow settled the question of whether or not i should hang around the mess politeness had kept me there after all they were standing me a farewell party but there had been a similar thrash the night before and another was planned for the day after all three being designed as a wet run for a grand party on saturday night which it was foreseen would be traumatic enough to require a succession of tailingoff parties continuing long after i had flown to singapore to catch the troopship for the moment enough was enough i checked to see that my revolver was in my holster and my old man in my trousers and slipped away into the night margey i told myself meant more to me than all the sergeants in the british army laid end to bloody end at the far end of the road from the sergeants mess stood an mps guardpost it marked the official entrance into the perimeter of our lines there the redcaps underwent their primitive lifecycles lowering barriers across the road after dark arresting drunks and generally making themselves obstreperous inside the perimeter was a heterogeneous collection of soldiery a small detachment of the royal mendips of which i formed part several squads of th indian division comprising both british and indian troops some sinister dutchmen belonging to pea force and a few other odd bods including some japanese troops who were too useful for nasty jobs to be sent home to nippon and a solitary chinese major who spent his days searching for unmarked chinese graves this miscellaneous rabble formed part of the occupying force we were billeted in varying degrees of comfort in what had been a dutch suburb before war overcame the netherlands east indies four years previously early in the perimeter defences like our duties were illdefined despite many alarms and shootups we could not get it through our thick heads that the indonesians meant us harm after all we had come to liberate them from the rule of the japs the general fuckingabout meant that a curfew was imposed between midnight and seven in the morning during that period those of the occupying force not on duty were supposed to remain snug within their own lines the redcaps on the gate knew me better than that a searchlight burned above their post drawing a tangle of ghastly winged life into its net as i entered the lighted zone a motorbike zoomed up behind me i jumped to one side fearing another drunken driver jackie tertis pulled his heavy old bsa to a halt a few inches from my number elevens pushed up his goggles and grinned evilly he left the engine roaring want a lift into town what about the pissup like you i skipped it better things to do with my time climb on havent got all bloody night he flashed a pass at the redcap who challenged us despite my reservations concerning tertis i climbed on the pillion and latched my hands under his belt he was a dangerous bugger in every way not least as a driver back in our unsophisticated days in india jackie tertis had been a pale little squaddie with wanking problems afraid to enter a brothel or say boo to a gobblewallah burma had changed all that after kohima jackie had become tough and nasty closed to his mates promotion had come his way and he remustered as intelligence now he worked on dutch detachment prising confessions out of indonesian prisoners for prevention of enemy activity force in truth i was partly afraid of him beyond the mp post was a sinister dark stretch of road with empty houses standing on either side tertis accelerated through that bit you going to have a poke he shouted over his shoulder yes you the noise of the engine drowned part of his answer i caught only the last part bloody british army no discipline any longer ahead was a level crossing made melancholy by a solitary light burning above the gates in the darkness the railway lines glinted like oiled rifle barrels two dutch officers had been ambushed and shot dead at this spot only the week before we bounced across the track to one side lurked the dark shape of the railway station beyond it was a small market after that street lighting began each light surrounded by a sphere of illuminated insects after that you were in the centre of medan the great thing was to be alert and drop like a stone if you heard anything we sped over cobbles there were two or three pedicabs moving about otherwise anyone going anywhere went on foot walking purposefully medan was dangerous after dark the centre was rather picturesque succeeding occupations by japanese and british troops had not altered the arrangement of modest dutch buildings among them the hotel de boer reserved for officers which stood round four sides of the large open green the green was fringed with europeantype trees while in its centre stood a fine batak house all timber perched on stilts its steep roofs curling like sails up to the sky beyond the green kesawan the main street began the chinese quarter lay to the right there lived my lovely margey tertis pulled in to the curb when we reached the square i climbed off i did not ask him where he was going watch it he said you too he roared off down the kesawan despite all my mates said it was fairly safe in the chinese quarter the chinese were neutral in the struggle between the indonesians dutch and british also hollands tough colonial troops the ambonese were billeted here and ready to go into action at any moment in these narrow side streets was more humanity than in the main thoroughfares many ambonese strolled about the roadway sat in cafs relaxed at streetcorners in windows or on pavements they played guitars and sang my god there was terang boelan again and they never forgot to tote their yankee carbines with all those ambonese about the forces of soekarno were not likely to try anything in chinatown on the corner of bootha street near margeys house a caf did thriving business its worn tables and chairs spilling out on to the pavement lanterns burned supplementing the erratic electricity supply the chinese who ran the caf had set it up as soon as the japanese surrendered taking over an old shop whose owners had fled or been killed from the depths of the shop came the reedy whineandthrob of chinese music many a time when i took margey there to eat mine was the only white face to be seen as i passed one of the chinese waiters smiled a greeting horatio stubbs was known in sumatra i felt good the heat never bothered me i was born to roast i had on my jungle greens puttees boots web belt with service revolver and battered bush hat which i had worn all the way through india assam and burma and which i had refused to change for newissue berets at the top of my sleeve was the green flash of the royal mendips with my three stripes beneath it i wore my four medal ribbons long service victory burma star and pacific in a bar over my left breast pocket i was neatly turned out i had shaved and showered three hours earlier and applied talc to my prickly heat i clocked in at thirteen stone one was twentythree years of age circumcised brown as an indian sweating gently and eminently ready for a good fuck the metal tips on my boots clipped on the broken paving of the arcade if any trouble broke out i was immediately ready to strike or to shoot i felt like a real good soldier and a spot of bother would not have come amiss at the next side street i paused looking round before proceeding it was a useful position for an ambush numerous yards opened up from the entrances of which it would have been easy to snipe at an enemy and escape laughing all was clear this evening but the area remained illlit a sort of service lane led behind bootha street allowing just enough width for lorries but in these downfallen days lorries had disappeared at the far end of the lane a dim discreet light shone from a doorway i knocked and looked in a flimsy curtain masked the entrance behind it six men sat round a table smoking and playing cards in shorts and vests the room had few basic features a cobbled floor whitewashed walls a flight of wooden steps up to a loft against one wall it had served as a store in preinvasion times now there was nothing left to store and it had been commandeered for human habitation table and chairs an ancient sofa and silk banners on the walls effected the transformation an old chinese lady in blue workoveralls sat on the sofa stitching watching over a sleeping baby she looked up and smiled when she saw me this was auntie of the round brown face i was always glad to see her though she never said a word the men at the table were also chinese varying in age from a slip of a youth to an old man with a straggly white beard they were sharing a bottle of beer between them they had an air of permanence but in emergencies people tend to spend a lot of time sitting at tables margeys brotherinlaw called to me he was a podgy yellow man hwan fat sian harrow missa stuss how you dis eebnin you rike drink one bee wit us hello fat apa khabar i cant stop i want to see margey is she upstairs he made gestures with his hand as if bouncing a large hall yeh yeh margey usstair she wait you missa stuss she tink you not come okay i trotted up the stairs to the floor above here the empty space had been divided into compartments by sheets of material hung on wires there were four compartments each just big enough to house a bed a further flight of wooden steps little better than a ladder led via a hole in the ceiling to the attic i called margey she answered her face appearing radiant in the gap above and i went up to her we hugged each other on the landing i lifted her off her feet and kissed her from the canteen i had brought her a little present consisting of a tin of sardines a tin of gooseberries a fountain pen some dates a bar of chocolate a bottle of burgundy and a packet of custard powder margey accepted these exotic delicacies with small screams of delight and patted my cheeks you too kind your margey aeiya how i love birds custard power the other day i came across a photograph i took in sumatra all those years ago back in it shows margey buying an ice cream from a wooden street stall other people loiter about grinning selfconsciously at the camera there are ruined buildings in the background only margey is elegant there she stands in a europeanstyle dress smiling at me although i remember her as plump she looks undernourished her face is broad her eyes large her head is slightly on one side as if mutely appealing to be forgiven some minor offence or maybe she was just trying to look like rita hayworth her favourite film star it is hard to realise that margey is probably still alive growing older like the rest of us the present tense lies with that faded snap by the street stall she was laughing as we carried the parcel into her little room she had curled her dark hair it was naturally straight now the ends curved upwards like the gables of the batak house her teeth were white and perfect so that when she smiled revealing them corpses stood up and beautiful things happened about her cheeks and the contours of her chin she put her arms round my neck and nuzzled into my shoulder horry is after nine oclock and you so late i think you dont come i must eat some supper you drink too much beer very bad for you sorry there was a pissup in the sergeants mess everyone getting boozed i told her about dickie payne driving into the cesspit and we laughed you sergeants all drunken filthy men all soldiers are so horrible oh i hate soldiers all except you horry you good man when you dont come i afraid you go with that miss katie chae she very low woman katie chae was her pet hate i laughed as i handed out cigarettes i never even saw katie chae i came here straight from the mess no breeze stirred she kept her window closed at night to shut the insects out and it must have been a hundred degrees under the low roof she saw i was sweating and said i go fetch you nice cool beer ive had enough bloody beer make me a coffee and lets go on the bed she clouted me playfully on the hip every day bed bed you terrible randy man horry what you think poor margeys cunt lie down here and have a smoke while i bring you tea no coffee coffee all gone why you no bring me more coffee margey left the lamp with me while she went to prepare the drink the attic had been intended for human habitation of a mean order at the far end of the landing was a cramped area which served as margeys kitchen and bathroom the rest of the space under the roof was occupied by two small rooms separated by wood panelling the ceiling was plastered some of the plaster had fallen away to reveal laths beneath one of the rooms was margeys own it had a curtained window the view from which always delighted me with its spectacle of rooftop decay and a deep sill on which stood a plant and one or two precious possessions i set the oil lamp on the sill and undressed processed beer oozed from my skin as i did so even the mosquitoes had fainted in the heat margeys wooden bed was covered with a faded blue quilt on which i sat to remove my boots an upturned orange crate standing behind the bed served as a table on it stood an old alarm clock and a carving of a balinese dancer which i had given her under the bed was a precious metaltrimmed rattan trunk in which margey stored her clothes on the wall hung a little mirror framed in mahogany with a shelf below lipstick stood on the shelf perfume in a knobbly bottle and an extravagant manicure set which i had bought margey whilst on leave in singapore a snap of me in swimming trunks was tucked into the edge of the mirror the only other items in the room were a towelled bathrobe which hung behind the door and a black and white photograph of rita hayworth wearing an open raincoat and swinging her hips in an inviting way margey worshipped rita hayworth rolling up my ankle puttees which i had refused to exchange for gaiters i tucked them in my boots and set them in one corner it was good to be in that shabby cubicle heat or no heat yet i like margey had my anxieties before stretching out on the bed i padded over to margeys bathrobe and felt in its pockets dreading to find a french letter or similar incriminating evidence of other men i found a small tortoiseshell comb i took it out and turned it over several times it was something of hers i had not seen before who had given it to her slipping it back i relaxed on the bed thinking of her imagining her working by what light came over the top of the wooden partition boiling water on her tiny charcoal fire a mans voice yelled at her in clattering chinese she went to the gap and answered a brief exchange took place before she returned to her stove when she entered the room carrying two small mugs of tea i asked who had called is only my brotherinlaw fat sian she stood before me looking down as i sat on the bed patiently accepting my foreignness what did he want he is only being friendly making an enquiry does fat come up here when you are alone margey i tell you many time horry but you not believe she stamped her foot he not come in here except maybe bring some food he not fuck me like you think i not like to fuck fat sian i am good girl with proper education but you not believe but he has fucked you hasnt he aeiya you damn drunk soldier how i hate when you make such rude question drink your tea in a week less all this would be forever beyond my ken i could never work it all out the thought made me despair the muddle of margeys psychology and her lifestyle was at once pain and delight to me i knew something of her early history she loved relating it to me often with tears running down her face margey and her sister chin lim together with the rest of the family had lived in a village near to the town of tsingtao in shantung province china that musical name tsingtao ran like a thread through much of margeys conversation it was the place she had loved to visit the place she longed to get back to somehow some time if she could not get to london the other city of her dreams where women were all like rita hayworth and everyone lived in gigantic houses complete with cooks dogs and horses little did i understand i was too young way deep down inside i was shallow i regarded margeys vision of hollywood london as one more broken dream in a land packed with them on the other hand i saw no reason why she could not pack a bag and go back to tsingtao if she really wanted to margey was not simply a dreamer she was a practical girl who learned to survive yes now i understand she read the local and singapore newspapers when she could get hold of them so she knew that boats and planes went to london regularly nothing went to tsingtao any more the japanese had sacked shantung and now it was in the hands of the revolutionary communist armies of general mao tse tung margey conducted her dreams like her household practically and in the midst of chaos the japanese shelled and invaded tsingtao many of margeys family were killed including both parents her brother and a rich uncle who had financed the despatch of margey south to be educated at shanghai university chin lim the elder sister had just got married to hwan fat sian fat had a car when the nips were on the march fat cunningly exchanged his car for a cart and an ox which does not need petrol he loaded both sisters and a few household goods on the cart and headed for nanking terrible mishaps befell them they had to survive both snow blizzards and drought as well as bands of robbers after many months of travel often on foot they caught a refugee boat sailing down the coast for singapore the boat was loaded to the water line progress was slow they arrived in singapore only a few hours before the british ignominiously surrendered and the nips took over the plague of civil disruption pursued them everyone was in a panic knowing exactly how the japanese treated the chinese some chinese gangsters shot dead the captain of the refugee ship slung him overboard turned the vessel around and steamed for java there was fighting aboard with more people flung to the sharks in the middle of a storm in the berhala straits they ran out of fuel some days later the ship drifted on to a mudbank off the coast of sumatra everyone was starving by then oh i never go on any ship again cried margey her stories were exciting and confusing to ask for an explanation merely complicated the issue her english was like a halfbuilt house the kitchen was complete and you were safe in the bedroom but most of the other offices existed only as foundations she could bear to tell me only one episode at a time so the stories arrived randomly prompted by chance recollections recreating in themselves the disorder margey had lived through her confusion became mine i liked the chaos of her life thought of it for hours with admiration even with envy my simple experiences were nothing beside hers she had had more adventures than id had naafi suppers the survivors of the shipwreck waded ashore somewhere near a place called muaratungkai by margeys account it was a treacherous strip of coast and the party she was with became separated from a group which included fat and his wife they were arrested by dutch officials and imprisoned in the town of palembang feeling lucky not to be shot as part of an expected nip invasion margeys party became lost in swampland several of them fell ill of fever some died the survivors eventually reached a kampong on the banks of the river hari where they were able to persuade two eurasians with a small motor launch to take them to the local equivalent of civilisation margey fell sick on the morning of embarkation and so was left behind she was still stuck in the native village when the japs as long expected invaded the nei the fates had made a mighty journey after margey not less than the distance from morocco to lapland which is nothing to a ravening young fate palembang is an oil town the dutch garrison put up some resistance and was annihilated the japanese went on a triumphal spree of looting shooting and raping chin lim was raped and bayoneted but fat escaped both fates weeks later he and margey met up again almost by accident they reached medan dressed as coolies travelling mainly by bullock cart in medan they met other people from shantung who helped them and there they weathered out the rest of the war and the time that followed the worlds great storm had blown and was still blowing round the globe a strong force breeze just for a while there was a lull which becalmed margey and me both far from home in this little stuffy room on the equator i had undressed and climbed under the blue cover she put her tea cup on the window sill before beginning to slip unceremoniously from her clothes the shadows of the bars of her lamp curved across her naked back as she pulled her blouse off away came her europeanstyle brassiere with its red polkadots her tender breasts with their little sharp tips swung free as she stooped to remove her peasantstyle trousers and then the dainty pair of silk knickers in the treacly light that beautiful pale body conquered me how far beyond all computation that it should be this particular body shipped all the way from tsingtao as unattainable as a figure in a painting which was snuggling in beside me we lay still for the moment staring innocently up at the swagger of rita hayworth margey you are so bloody gorgeous i put an arm round her and made her feel the hardness of my prick she giggled you evil bad man horry all soldiers so terrible randy men i dont know what you think i do with this big terrible thing you have where i can put it i showed her she screamed with pretended laughter aeiya i am too small girl for that monster thing is like a deformity first i drink my tea then maybe we try as we sipped our tea i egged her on with sexy talk in her ear you just have to concentrate very hard and then it will slip in easily youll see you may be only a little girl but you have a lovely big slippery hole havent you all juicy and soft inside like a tropical fruit i am no tropical girl i am from almost a cold climate just like london sometimes in tsingtao snow falls in winter and makes it beautiful when i am a baby so i have only small cold hole well i can warm it up for you if theres any snow up there i guarantee to melt it she pretended to become indignant oh you speak so filthy what you do in my bed here you foreign devil rapistsoldier get out or i call my auntie i not want that dirty big thing up my body or i catch a filthy disease and die all my fresh fall off my bones what are you talking about i gave it a wash before i came out scrubbed it with a scrubbing brush its as clean as could be i soaped it very carefully under the shower and told it that it would be seeing you this evening at which news it pricked up its ears immediately she smothered a laugh in her hand you are mad you know really a grown man to talk with his penis like that twenty three years old i bet i know what you did i bet you gave yourself a good handwanking in the shower isnt that right by way of illustration she ran her fingers down my stem as if playing a flute is that what chinese men do all the time all chinese man and they dont care who sees handwanking every day even inside the fields and paddyfields is disgusting yes i dont believe a word of it only europeans and americans wank themselves off so im told you are a liar margey what about chinese girls do they get up to the same dirty tricks tickling their sly little clitorises i believe you told me but ive forgotten the details she set her cup down and waved a finger at me you are typical absolute foreign devil always thinking every bad thing is invented in london gunpowder and writing and hand wanking are all invented in china every bit in shantung province very likely but china girls they no do hand wanking she laughed flashing her beautiful teeth and eyes they have other naughty habit i tell you what they do she put her arms round my neck and snuggled down with me until our heads were on the pillow and her tits on my chest when she began whispering hotly in my ear ending by jabbing her tongue into it the essence of her rude little story which she liked to tell me often with amazing embellishments was that girls in shantung province from an early age resorted to gherkins graduating to successively larger and more knobbly ones as they grew up grabbing my fingers pretending they were gherkins she demonstrated to me exactly how the manoeuvre was carried out giggling and squirming as she did so that was one of margeys favourite ploys and before it became too much for me and i flung myself upon her she was off in the series of delighted writhes and squeaks which marked her orgasm to plunge into that sumptuous hole while it was in the throes was my pleasure margey squealed and locked her legs round the top of my thighs under my buttocks our bodies became one plunging machine which worked without our volition powered by sweat and magic joy joy the whole spirit was bursting upwards like a waterspout we lay in each others arms breathing easily and sweating together despite all the hardships she had undergone margey was quite plump still round her meaty little waist were the marks of the elastic of her knickers as i lay with my head on her belly i caught the aroma of that little bivalve between her thighs it reminded me of freshcaught lobster of the tang of the primordial ocean in which first life was born with its salts and chemicals here was where sentient things gave their earliest twitch long before land took shape i could see her face in the halfdark the bridge of her nose was flat but the wings of her nostrils the chiselling of her mouth the curve of her eyes as they moulded into her cheeks these things moved me and filled my thoughts with their perfection never had i known an english girl i thought half as lovely the potence of her attraction lay in her not being english in her being not only margey but cathay far cathay gazing up at the mottled ceiling margey said in a level voice nex monday morning you go singapore leave medan for ever and catch the big steamer for london your poor dear margey will be brokenhearted how you think she live in medan without you i slapped a mosquito which had zoomed in on my arm my soldiering days are done i have to go home i dont want to leave medan or you then why you go she asked sulkily it was a question she had asked before a question i had endeavoured to answer before this time i was spared at least for the moment a footfall sounded the ladder to the attic creaked i became aware of the world outside rain was falling breaking through the oppressive heat the climber emerged on the landing beyond our room and a cautious female voice called in cantonese i could distinguish margeys chinese name tung su chi she called a brief answer propping herself up on an elbow the other woman entered the adjoining cubicle a faint light showed on the ceiling above the bed where we lay framed in giant shadows thrown by the top of the partition the woman sighed heavily as she sank down on her bed daisy had come home whispers faint soggy noises the smack of a wet breast told us that she had her baby with her and was nursing it daisy was no relation of margeys she was simply one of the people who found refuge under this particular roof until affairs in sumatra took a turn for the better she spoke no english so there was never any contact between us all day she left her baby in the care of old auntie downstairs while she worked on a nearby farm returning only in the evening daisy had no husband and the baby was half japanese she and margey were in margeys words friendly but no too friendly shes late its nearly curfew i whispered to margey how about a drink margey would not be deflected wrapping a sheet round her body she got up and closed the window against the rain she had propped it open before joining me on the bed then she turned and looked at me her face in shadow her eyes dark the smooth line of her shoulder gleaming in the lamplight take me to london with you horry you see i will be good girl not tease you or sleep with other man i promise london good prace i dress very beautiful in latest fashion become great fashion sensation like rita hayworth i sat up impatiently margey darling weve been through all this you know i cant take you with me is impossible you jus vanish next monday how can bear that horry i dont know how well bear it margey i cant stand the thought of it even now its just one of those shitty things that will have to happen my times up rain was falling more heavily it drummed on the tiles overhead water started to splash heavily on the landing beyond our door giving me a hard look to keep me going for the moment margey padded out barefoot and set a bowl under the drip immediately a steady pingpingping began marching back into the room margey took up her position by the lamp folded her arms and said you very deceive your margey you got other girlfriend in london you sweaty swine is that girl sonia you tell me about the one with the freckles ive told you ive had one month in england during the last five years its a fucking foreign country as far as im concerned all the girls i once knew are probably married and toothless old hags by now sonia got terrible disease by now she spoke with vindictive pleasure yeah well maybe babies at least already learning to shave instead of laughing she renewed her pleas a moth came over the top of the partition like a flung duster and settled on her bare shoulder margey ignored it you take me with you london darling you and me very good each other all time have fun and make love how you think you can live in foreign country without me dont cry margey honestly i think about the problem all the time i dont know what to do try to understand my time is up christ all my mates think im mad because i dont want to go back to the blight my time is up im timeexpired ive served my seven years and ive got to return to civvy street thats orders i couldnt live on in medan even if i wanted to she put her hands up to her cheeks gazing down at her toes the moth crawled on to her neck and she brushed it away rain fell solidly outside as if it would not be content until it broke down every rotten roof in medan our small lamplit drama was wrapped about in liquid sound margey suddenly climbed back on the bed wrapped the sheet about us both and tucked my shrivelled prick into the palm of her hand she spoke confidentially as if she did not wish daisy to hear one man tell me you can get army discharge in singapore singapore belong britain prenty british in singapore you get job in big firm like cable wireless for good pay i come along too look after you like firstclass china wife speaking her face filled with the vision of us together in a place at peace and she smiled showing those delicious teeth at the same time she gave my prick a playful squeeze i lay back staring at the lamp on the sill with the packet of birds custard powder beside it if only margey would shut up who told you i could get demobbed in singapore johnny mercer it was a possibility i had never mentioned to her instead of answering the question she bent and kissed my idling organ i show you many pleasure in singapore is great good city maybe next best in the world after tsingtao and peking and london and paris we can have much fun horry you know all time go many parties live in big new flats now they build in bukit timah road i not tease you or look at any other man do you hear no feel any penis except this lovely one all the time it at least began to show enthusiasm for the proposed regime ive got to get back to my fucking family margey orders are orders i cant explain its how things are i dont run the bloody world listen to that fucking rain fuck the fucking rain margey looked angrily at me pulling her ugly temple watchdog face she knew i dreaded her temper why you mention about your family you no care them you bad drunk son you never write any letter your mother or papa we go singapore just you and i then i learn speak much more good english and love you every way like a slave okay that really is best for you i know she struck her bosom angrily my god singapore is lucky place of the far east that was a matter of opinion though it was hardly the moment to argue with her as far as the british were concerned the whole disaster of singapore stood out as a prime example of their failure to understand or care about any race east of india during the nineteenthirties it had been fortified up to the eyeballs so as to be impregnable from the sea in the nineteenforties the japanese walked in through the back door and the singapore garrison feebly surrendered they surrendered to an enemy they had always regarded with contempt a race of little men hardly worth fighting i had personal feelings about singapore when div finally pulled out of burma the mendips had been given five weeks rest in calcutta and then our brigade had moved to madras to undergo amphibious training with div we were limbering up for the infamous operation zipper our task was to take the impregnable singapore from the japanese by seaborne invasion bloody madness fortunately harry truman got his finger out and dropped the abomb in the nick of time we were spared our seaborne massacre and shipped over to sumatra to repatriate japs instead the war had been mad enough with its interlocking maze of arbitrary decisions but it was merely a consequence of the lunatic peace which had preceded it what vain hopes singapore represented in that direction its fortifications cost the british taxpayer twenty million pounds sterling a fortune indeed in the twenties and in the very week when those fortifications were started and the first stone laid the financial wizards in london lent the japs twentyfive million pounds sterling to build a navy with which to destroy singapore and the rest of britains power in the east what a masterpiece of imperial idiocy no wonder we lost the bloody empire well i write this a long time later and singapore that elegant ratrace has now gone its own way free of british control i have the advantage of hindsight but its easy enough to see how such lunacies repeat themselves the soviet powers build up their vast armaments steadily year by year while the west subsidises them to do so poland alone has been given millions of deutschmarks with which to buy agricultural machinery when the warsaw pact countries attack us we shall all be astonished and indignant forgetting how for years we have been sharpening the razors with which they cut our throats every decade the distinction between war and peace becomes less their yinyang relationship more obvious but all i said to margey at the time as she clutched my prick and the moth singed itself on her lamp was fuck singapore she began to sob another liquid sound far more noticeable than the others surrounding us oh pack it in margey i love you but my fucking time is up itll break my heart to leave you but thats the way it is kismet checking with my watches i worked out that it must be eleven oclock give or take ten minutes the rain was dying out margey turned away from me and curled up in a foetal position still sniffing you say you love your margey so you say you say you like be in the east so you say then why you go england now you must decide for safety sake since medan is so dangerous we go singapore short time okay you and i later time when generalissimo chiang kai shek throw out the rebels from china and lawandorder come back then i take you shantung show you tsingtao we can go on the railway train i have a prewar timetable in my trunk is easy journey she sat up smiling again stretching out her arms as if to embrace all china aeiya horry just you think you can see the yellow sea and those occasional beaches like i told you with all the trees with flowers on when spring comes down from the mountains i bet you like that horry i really bet yeah i would yeah i would like it sweat rash apart yes i loved the east i loved the extraordinary people the muddle the failure the hope the climate the ghastliness the perennial courage the jack of pretension everything was much more real and exciting than anything i had known in england but and margey temper apart yes i loved margey she was so vulnerable yet so bouncy oppressed yet serene she embodied in her frail plump self the whole teeming confused chinese nation that extraordinary half of the globe that secret and alluring half which existed almost like a female counterpart to the guntoting overcoatclad west passionately i longed to know her and through her her people better i longed to dive deeper and not be jerked suddenly out of context like a carp out of a pool but oh you so inscutable you say nothing she kicked her savage little feet under the cover you say you love me you no love me jus because i china girl i got yellow skin you fool ignorant soldier thats all balls margey look you are far paler than me to make her look i stripped the sheet back there lay our bodies soon to be divided for ever unless i got a fucking move on lying together on the same bed knees touching i struck out angrily at a mosquito feasting on my leg and left a smear of blood years of sun in india burma and sumatra had toasted my torso to a dark mahogany from the waist up i would have passed for a dravidian on his annual holiday in bermuda by contrast margeys soft figure was as tallowy as the sheet beneath us i slid my hand between her legs clutching the lips of her twot china girl skin like ivory horry love his china girl with spirit she said you no go with katie chae or i die that girl got bad terrible disease horry love this china girl stinkpig no make fun how i speak if you try speak shantung dialect i make fun you you foreign devil you take your filthy disease hand out my cunt fast or i scream for daisy laughing i overcame her resistance and kissed her you were full of hope in these days dear margey as i was have you lost it all by new and the years ground you down at the time i told myself that i still had a chance to make up my mind and to plan accordingly matters could be arranged i would have to get military permission to marry margey otherwise there was no way in which she could leave sumatra do you horatio stubbs take this china girl tung su chi to be your lawful wedded wife then we could get to singapore at least not that i wanted to stay in singapore there was india but india was passing from british hands and in england i flinched to think of the cretinous reception margey might receive there the attitude of my mates in the mess gave me warning enough on that score in order to arrange anything i had to get in touch with captain maurice boyer my company officer i had left it a bit late because boyer was not in medan he was in padang on the other side of the island and i would have to speak to him over the air there was another difficulty which i had often tried to explain to margey who steadfastly refused to believe a word of all the unlikely formalities which constituted army regulations i was in medan on detachment from the mendips my battalion was stationed down in padang four hundred or so miles away the other two battalions of brigade having been shifted to batavia in java where the british and the dutch were having more trouble than in sumatra major inskipp had recently been repatriated now it was the eccentric boyer i had to speak to and i knew how difficult it was to hold personal discussions over a wireless link one other possibility existed i could talk to captain jhamboo singh the dandified officer under whose supervision i came officially whilst in medan he was perfectly capable of taking decisions being commanding officer of the british personnel of div and such odd bods as me but i failed to visualise how i could talk to an indian about my chances of marrying a chinese girl too violent to last the rainstorm was fading away the dripping into the landing basin became more slowly spaced and deeper in tone daisy could be heard singing softly to her baby on the other side of the partition theres a good film showing at the deli cinema tomorrow evening shall we go and see it i dont want see any films why you change the subject why you are ashamed to be see with me in london if you dont mind in medan you think i not pretty enough for mayfair or something you bastard anyhow what is this rotten film you mention melvyn douglas and joan crawford in they all kissed the bride comedy aeiya i love joan crawford really great though not so hot as rita will you take me along in spite my bad temper honest what do i get if i do you so kind man horry though you do not love me you so sweet man she rubbed her face against mine so that one wing of that nightblack hair swept my cheek while her naughty little hand teased my prick again as i began to respond she rolled over so that she was half on top of me opening her legs and gently chafing her fanny against my thigh her titties swung into my grasp like two mangoes her nipples became imprisoned between my thumb and first finger in the heat we were juicy together she had that beautiful clear scent which was in part an artificial aid but mainly emanated from her body as we started to stir the covering slid from us on to the floor shadows lay across our flesh partseen margey was wholly lovely she had my prick in a curious grip her thumb pointing up its stem up came her right leg and pwop shed slipped cock and thumb yet it was the tiniest little delicate petalled hole you ever saw up that succulent passage and was immediately working on my knob while smiling impudently into my face as if determined to sharpen the blunt end to a fine point sliding over on the bed i pulled her right on top of me grunting at her in encouragement aeiya you musclebrute she bounced away so positively that i was afraid as i counterthrust from below that i would lose her her legs were spread wide now she clutched at my torso working my hands down between her little tight buttocks i nailed her in place with one finger up her bumhole as ever that induced tremendous voltage on both sides she always came when i did that illegal illegal she cried we went over the top we were having a smoke the downpour ceased margey got up and opened her little window draughts of cool air blew in tickling our flesh outside water dripped from innumerable broken gutters from daisy in the next compartment came only silence she and her baby were asleep checking with my watches i found the amsterdam one had stopped i wound it vigorously the indian one indicated a time somewhere near eleventwenty but the hour hand looked a bit loose it was time i thought about getting back to the billet a shot sounded only a couple of streets away it was answered almost immediately by rifle fire the first weapon replied then a sten opened up firing bursts i stubbed my fag out and jumped to the window pushing the lamp and custard powder away so that i could lean out horry you get shot come in margey called in the alley all was quiet the action was taking place in the street beyond running feet could be heard a dog was barking the sten opened up again for one brief burst then a vehicle engine started a jeep by the sound of it whatever vehicle it was it belted up bootha street from the direction of the kesawan and i caught sight of the wash of its lights as it shot past the entry to the side street in which we were ensconced then silence a minute later i could hear its engine distantly still going like the clappers no more shots night airs moved against my cheek wild dogs yelped dispersedly from the direction of the deli river incredible to think that next monday night only next monday night i would be away from here for ever waiting in nee soon stinking transit camp for the boat to take me home it was like a sentence of death all this would exist only as something shrivelling slowly in memory flowers in an empty vase margey smacked my haunches why you must stick your head out there you foolish soldier why they shoot so close here never before so close i think aeiya never any peace nowhere after the nips are beaten now come these terrible indonesians under dr soekarno to make new troubles will they shoot again horry thatll be it for tonight i drew the curtains and put the lamp back probably just some triggerhappy mps or some nut trying something id better get on back she clung to me with fierce strength damn you why you have no proper feeling what do men think blast them listen to me horry i no speak more of coming to live london with you not london not singapore not tsingtao not any place on this round globe but i much hurt in my heart okay you know i am educated girl with shanghai degree i understand more than you how us two live different places me here you there only no i no can find words my horry tell you all things fuck it forget what i say just stay here with me in this humble room tonight all night just sleep and love no more jig jig just stay in margeys arms my english love i looked down at her half in anger you know i could lose my tapes if i was found staying out all night with no pass she waved her arms above her head and then had to clutch at the sheet whats that answer oh you timeexpired man you not care what army do how often i hear you say that yet for margey not one thing you do not one single thing you think i utter fool because i no can speak english so proper sorry margey ill stay the night if you want you never asked me before thats all i clung to her feeling all her strength and energy her arms went round my neck i get you fruit she whispered you are a terrible girl margey i love you more than anything as i sat down on the bed she looked dubiously at me smoothing down her silky black hair now she saw that she was to have her immediate wish she was calm her lips came together her forehead wrinkled in a thoughtful frown now stay here horry you devil not look out window i go get you fruit and bread and beer then we smoke cigarette and sleep all night together still frowning she slipped into her knickers and the towelling robe from her finger a cautionary wag before she disappeared i heard her carry the bowl of rainwater from outside our door and fling it out of a window as soon as she was gone anxiety possessed me i pulled the curtains over the window and began to dress with immense haste it was not that i distrusted margey but i suddenly felt myself alone in the heart of a hostile city even in the peaceful chinese quarter army training warned me to remain alert for danger of all the races churning about in medan the chinese had least reason to hate the british but they had their survival to see to and i was one man on his own silence from the other side of the partition i stood for a moment then buckled on my belt and revolver i took the gun out of its holster walked out to the landing started to descend the ladder peering through the shrouded dimness as i went as for margeys despair how could she exist without resorting to prostitution penniless and unprotected as she was fat was little use to her except as a pimp she must be a whore however desperately she tried to hide the truth from me why else her perpetual obsession with disease besides johnny mercer had been slipping her a length before i arrived in medan if johnny many others white brown yellow some of them would have a personal interest in this house and would know when i margeys current purchaser was in occupation the bitch could get me shot dear ghost of margey that was how i calculated then i shied from the thought of your whoredom i understood little i was a cold young man from europe brought up with a traditional middleclass suspicion of sexuality i thought i had renounced all that crap but it lay under my surface like permafrost even when the spring of your body was on mine on the floor below people were already in bed horizontal behind their dividing curtains their presence could be felt the air was thick with a sweet chinese smell a mixture of cooking sweat perfumed soap and revolting jap cigarettes taking courage from my revolver i continued on down to the ground floor it was very dark one naked bulb burning in the living area a small oil lamp dim in the kitchen area night had changed the almost changeless scene the cardplayers had gone a battered bamboo screen had been drawn round the sofa behind the screen auntie slept restlessly dreaming of faraway lands two men sat at the table one was fat sian himself still in greasy string vest and shorts smoking with his cigarette almost vertical in his mouth the other was a chinese i had noticed about the place before they had been talking quietly together over a bottle of red fox now they lapsed into silence and watched me i went over to them ostentatiously holding the revolver and enjoying my role man shoot fat said bang bang bang he raised his plump right hand and fired it three times in order to get his meaning across in addition he smiled and nodded thats right i agreed merdeka bang bang bang merdeka was the malayan cry for freedom the slogan of the indonesian campaign i gave fats companion a hard look he returned it he was a slender man neatly dressed with a white shirt the sleeves of which were rolled down against mosquito bites he wore goldrimmed spectacles his hair was brushed to the back of his head margey came out from the rear carrying a plate of apples and mangusteen and a glass of beer she looked tense smiling at me without speaking im checking to see that the place is properly secure i said ground floor windows all shut walking across to the door into the lane i found that it had no lock and the bolt was broken there was only a simple catch fat said something laughing and margey translated fat sian sleep in his bed so no man ever break in here he pull bed in front this door china people all very scare malayan murderthief the back i crossed to the kitchen area a door with cracked glass panels led into a cluttered little yard surrounded by other yards and premises i could make out puddles on the stones my expert eye told me that in case of trouble in the front one could escape out the back it also noted a platoon of cockroaches reconnoitring round margeys sink i tried the lock on the door although it was secure enough an armchair had been pushed against the door another indication of fats commendable concern with security who is this man with your brotherinlaw i asked margey pointing the gun at the man with the goldrimmed spectacles at this point margey showed extreme embarrassment and put the refreshments down on a cupboard to recover herself i stared at her in surprise never having seen her behave like this before i was immediately suspicious come on then sod it who is he he is only journalist at this juncture the man in spectacles spoke up for himself he said you have no need to shout or shoot sir i am only a journalist as tung su chi says acting heavy i walked slowly over and looked at him he countered by rising from the table as i approached and regarding me with a halfsmile you speak english whats your name do you live here i live in medan not particularly through choice i moved a pace nearer do you live in this particular fucking building i live nearby sir is he a relation of yours i asked fat fat had been devoting his attention to smoking and blinking he continued to blink as he said no sir no rela ony fren he tiger balm run china newspaper the other man produced a grubby visiting card you see sir i am known by my journalists name of tiger balm my name is chae lieng sing and i am acting editor of new south china times published from boulan way where i also live glancing hopefully at my two watches i said its nearly curfew tiger balm nodded i shall be on my way soon meanwhile why dont you sit down with us su chi please bring over your friends beer there was something mocking in the way he spoke i mistrusted his flawless english and the point he made by addressing margey by her chinese name she came forward with the beer and the fruit fat immediately seized on an apple and began to munch before his sisterinlaw could fade into the background i looked for a signal from her but she gave none lifting his glass tiger balm said it is a pleasure to talk with you shooting sometimes makes for friendliness may i offer a singapore cigarette perhaps it was time to make amends i sat down opposite the two chinese and pulled out the fielddressing tin which i used for a cigarette case have an english fag all three of us lit up margey stood watching in the background saying nothing let me ask you why the british authorities do not stop all the shooting said tiger balm surely they could do so if they wished its only a few extremists they live in the kampongs and come into town to cause trouble things are far worse in java as i expect you know he shook the match until it went out in an idly contemptuous gesture of course i know it nevertheless what happens in java and what happens here is all part of one process the endeavour of the soekarno freedom party to rid nei of colonial rule it is not just a matter of a few extremists as you represent bang bang bang stremis echoed fat we ignored the man and he gradually disappeared behind a wreath of cigarette smoke swigging down the beer i said heavily as you probably realise the japs here started handing out their weapons to the natives as soon as they were defeated to stir up trouble for their victors the british mission when we arrived here last october was simply to pack the japs off to japan and let the dutch resume their rule what you might call restoring the status quo eh but nobody wants the dutch back so we have to hang around and keep the peace as best we can as i peeled a mangusteen tiger balm pressed his argument excuse me if i say so but you do not keep the peace so very well sir in sourabaya your troops fight pitched battles with the extremists you bomb towns kill innocent people you also use the defeated nipponese to help why are you allowed to ally yourself with a defeated and disgraced enemy in that way it brings unpopularity the real wars are over in case youve forgotten we had hitler to fight as well you know now we want to pack up and go home were short of men owing to the demob programme so we well the trouble is that the local population encourages the extremists you have to inflict peace on them i laughed silence reigned inside and out he smoked his cigarette concentratedly and made a comment in chinese to fat to me he said you see sir what you have to say about the situation is not at all exact you must face one fact that the old world of the nineteenthirties is totally shattered none of us can go back to those times demons are loose he paused as if considering what to say tapping impatiently with long fingers on the table myself i am a wanderer on the earths face but let me give the example of the family who employs me who owns the new south china times they remain here in sumatra under dutch rule since five generations they come from swatow a fine port you should visit if ever you would they are overseas chinese not mere refugees like fat sian and i but who can say what will happen to them before the end of how can they go back to china where civil war rages sumatra is their place they understand everything about it we sit here you and i and talk in this poor building it once housed a spare what do you say an auxiliary printing press of the firms the press was stolen the mechanic who guarded it is killed many unlawful things happen look the curfew he sighed i see you do not care to learn please give me another cigarette i mean no harm i even admire the british in a way but i wish you understand my meaning you hear the shooting you enjoy certain pleasures with su chi you think you are in old medan let me tell you sir that you are not you are in a new place and the hairs on your head should be standing upright in alarm he laughed with sudden ferocity you are in a snakes den you are in a town of the new indonesian republic you appear not to understand that do you know that dr soekarno declared the netherlands east indies dead and gone in we now remain in a militant new republic with its own flag under which certainly no colonialists will be allowed they will kill off all white foreigners ten to one it irritated me to be lectured at swigging the beer i said dismissively well its their bloody country after all he laughed and again made a rapid remark in chinese to fat who blinked expertly my godfather is that the british point of view sir the famous british sense of justice murder is okay on home ground is that what you say if so why dont you clear off every one of you or if you do not clear off why dont you send more troops indians if necessary and crush this whole damned soekarno merdeka movement once for all do one thing or the other for gods sake look here its a difficult restore real peace get business picking up again introduce a proper legal currency open up trade with outside world then if local discontent dies support for dr soekarno dies its a difficult political situation for the british you know the name of jinnah tiger balm leaned back and clasped his hands behind his head smiling you refer to mr ali jinnah the leader of the muslim league party of the indian central assembly naturally i am tolerably familiar with the name then you may be tolerably familiar with his noises about the wrongs of the british using indian troops in a foreign country if our troops took jinnah seriously wed have a mutiny on our bloody hands i cant think why they dont lock jinnah up i laughed he laughed too without humour as you say your hands are already bloody you have already locked jinnah up and jawarhalal nehru and ghandi and it did no bit of good your gaols were not oppressive enough as a result the days of the british in india are numbered thats all the more reason why we shouldnt fight for the dutch in the nei tiger balm got up and walked about smoking on the other side of the table he wore light grey trousers of a local cut and made a dapper figure looking up at the rafters above his head he said you will leave a bloodbath here when you quit at this juncture there was an admonitory cry from behind the screen fat wagged his head a few times to check that it was still there and said in his imitation english missa stuss auntie she say she ha bad head prease you no tor so row she want go slee ignoring him i banged my fist on the table and told tiger balm if there is a bloodbath when we leave it wont be any fault of the british so stick that in your next editorial some indian was trying to tell me the other day that there would be a bloodbath in india when the british left there okay then why is everyone so keen to kick us out if they are going to massacre each other when weve gone the question appeared to me unanswerable enough to pass for rhetorical but tiger balm merely said the reasons of course lie in colonialist history whatever the price people want their freedom as the british in fat put a finger to his lips prease be mo quiet dink a no bee im going to bed and i presume mr tiger balm is going home after curfew i got up and followed the latter round the room so tell me whose side are you on do you want british or dutch rule or do you want soekarno and co to take over it isnt your country any more than it is mine he sighed and helped himself to a cigarette from his pack on the table history is not that simple mr stubbs sir ask your little margey what she thinks of the british she could hardly tell you we chinese respect and slightly admire the british although we do not believe that the far east is your part of the world any more than we regard europe as our part since you have been beaten so easily by the nipponese in malaya and you surrendered so weakly in singapore and elsewhere we think it is time you finished your adventures in the east you have lost face and now you must go home the lion lets say has its tail between its legs at this i felt myself getting extremely angry i sat down at the table and lit up another cigarette wondering whether to hit him youve been reading the china times too much chum you forget how the chinese got mopped up by the japs left right and centre besides the japs caught the british unprepared the fourteenth army really massacred them in burma i was there weve evened up the score okay now so do you want british rule or not he leaned against the wall unmoved by my anger considering his answer theres no question of british rule here sir the british contingent leaves in the late summer as the dutch certainly understand even if you dont you have failed in your mission you have made a mess of it you were too nice you cared too much for political justice and conserved too much ammunition thats fatal and of course the dutch cannot hold down the whole republican movement without british and american support so the new state of indonesia will come soon into full being and the redandwhite flags fly everywhere as you say it is their country you quote jinnah but you do not understand the meaning of what you quote jinnah is a muslim indonesian republic will be officially a muslim state that is one reason why chinese people fear a bloodbath chinese may be christian just a few of them but we are never muslim buddhists never become muslim i dont know why when you and the dutch quit then in the sacred name of religion indonesians may be tempted to kill many thousands of chinese to get their hands on their property who can chinese people turn to then for protection nobody nobody he let the word hang in the air before looking pointedly at margey who waited silently in the background and saying that sir is why many chinese people try many ways to leave sumatra and why you are at least moderately welcome on these premises our next lot of visitors may have less friendly intentions with these words he bowed soberly stubbed his cigarette in the ashtray on the table and walked out of the door into the night fat and i sat where we were saying nothing margey too remained where she was auntie sighed behind her screen addressing the remark to margey i said heavily lets hope that things dont turn out as badly as he supposes tell fat that he ought to take you to singapore as soon as possible fat had understood he made a negative gesture prenty too much men sinapore twice so many men three year no job no house no food no live better we stay here maybe trouble go way he reached out for another apple i took margeys hand lets get upstairs to bed without another word we crept upstairs past the sleepers on the upper floor into our familiar attic we undressed in silence fearful of waking daisy and her sleeping babe spring an english spring visited sumatra for one hour after dawn every day even my fellow sergeants when they got up that early had been known to scratch their hairy arses and exclaim with pleasure at the morning cool breezes wafted through our billets birds called and a decent mist lay over the land the insect population still slumbered in that hour the sun steered close to the horizon losing itself among shaggy palms the air was loaded with rosy hues and steaming bars of shadow oxcarts moving towards the fields proceeded with a ruminative rhythm the natives in their sarongs the women going to the well with bronze pots on their heads walked slowly as if in a dream among the trees later they would appear more bent as the load of sunlight became too great nipping back from margeys at this good hour i cut down one of the out of bounds roads that bordered a kampong the thatched bamboo huts set beside a stream amid tall palms looked too idyllic to be anything but fodder for some fucking travel poster hens clucked among the huts there were tethered white goats cats sitting staring at the water and an old man bent double brushing a path with meticulous care as if each grain of dust were familiar to him it was hard to believe that anyone wanted to shoot me at this hour too soon the scene would be different the sun would be roused from its pleasant lethargy and zoom to the zenith of the sky showering fire as it went the fog would vanish the day would buzz like a saw every squaddy alive would break out in a muck sweat monkeys would start to pass out in the trees climbing down into a ditch i dodged between strands of barbed wire and climbed through a hole in the tall mesh perimeter the hole had been made by illintentioned bors taking short cuts to town my way to the sergeants quarters lay through the other ranks lines some bors were slouching between houses across their neglected gardens they looked like apes with towels about their shoulders as they made their way to the washups as i rounded one of their billets i came face to face with johnny mercer the days duty sergeant an unhappy corporal trailed behind johnny explaining something to him at great length merdeka i said by way of salute he responded but looked no happier than the corporal stubby we cant get these shagging other ranks out of their billets what do you think we ought to do i looked at my watches they seemed agreed that it was approximately seventhirty bit early isnt it whats the drill he gave an abridged version of his laugh agricultural duties theyre supposed to be up and out digging the field for planting potatoes from seven till eight they refuse to get out of their charpoys while i was mulling this news over and having a good yawn the corporal addressing mercer but plainly repeating for my benefit a remark he had made before said you can see why they object they claim that digging fields is not part of their duties they also maintain that even if a crop of potatoes resulted the dutch would get it and they would gain nothing the corporal was div signals i had seen him before his name was kyle he was typical postwar material a thin specimen with pale skin and no service behind him young inexperienced and cocky as you please they both looked hopefully at me as i rubbed my stubbly chin a faint grin showed on johnnys face i plucked a few leaves off the nearest bush asking casually are your sympathies with the men corporal yes very much they are not farm hands i dont see why we should work for the squareheads do you i scattered the leaves never mind what you dont see corporal your job is to carry out standing orders as you bloody well know the indonesians are refusing to supply us with fresh rations so the goc has ordered that where possible units shall grow their own food reasonable isnt it get your men out of their bloody charpoys and on that stretch of miadan at the double give em five minutes after which any man without a shovel at the ready is up on a fizzer corporal kyle looked at johnny johnny looked at me johnny started to grin more openly dont give that old bull stubby fat lot you care about standing orders i know where youve been all night this o section shower is very shitorbust the corporal said apologetically yet i caught an undercurrent of boastfulness which set me off shitorbust is it youve not earnt the right to be shitor bust corporal you jump off the last boat with six months service in clacton to your name and think you can swing that one youre sadly mistaken christ three or four years soldiering in the fourteenth army and then youre entitled to be shitor bust ever heard of the fourteenth army corporal its disbanded its before your time when soldiering was pukka soldiering let me tell you so dont start answering me back i dont know what bloody britains coming to now get in those stinking fucking billets stop playing with yourself and order those admis at the top of your voice to get fell in on the road with their shovels in five minutes flat or else yes youd better do that johnny said turning to kyle stir the buggers up otherwise its a case of mutiny and well have to report it to the co that was the first time the dread word mutiny was mentioned kyles expression went blank you two are coming the old soldier on me what are you waiting for i asked ignoring me he addressed mercer theyll only tell me to clear off they say the iors should do the job will you come with me sarge johnny grinned at me and then said to the corporal thikhai ill threaten to shoot the bleeders if they dont move they wont take any notice i warn you said the corporal he tailed off with johnny mercer i headed for my billet my time was up breakfast restored some of my depleted energies i was shaving in my room when johnny mercer entered he took a look at the chinese servant who was obsequiously cleaning round and told him to get out merdeka youre a krab sight horry getting it up too much thats the trouble take my advice and pack it in a bit or youll be dead before you reach blighty these were standard pleasantries and i ignored them did you get o section out digging spuds no they said they werent a bunch of wogs and that digging was a job for the indian other ranks whos that feeble tit of a corporal steve kyle hes not a bad bloke its the situation the nei isnt burma i dried my face and prepared to brush my teeth do you know how much this bloody toothpaste cost me you realise that the q stores is out of toothpaste and the naafi its all going to the dutch ive got a bit of dutch crumpet who works in the rapwi shop shell get you a tube cheap theres plenty up the rapwi six bloody dutch guilders i had to pay for this toothpaste thats eleven bob eleven and a kick daylight robbery so what did you do they agreed to parade at hours for arms inspection and you should have heard them ticking about that but i couldnt get them out for digging they wouldnt bloody well go he went and stood on the balcony gazing morosely at the distant jungle johnny mercer was solidly built with a big red neck and thin brown hair he had been in burma and knew what was what but this morning he was not his old self he clutched at his big red neck ive got a hangover he said moodily i hate this fucking dump what are we doing here anyway the nei isnt our pigeon we should have left this spot of trouble to the dutch i suppose you realise that we handed sumatra over to the dutch at the end of the napoleonic wars now here we go again privately my sympathies are with the bors why should they go out digging the fields at seven in the morning like a lot of coolies still their refusal is serious isnt it spitting and wiping my mouth i said very serious mutiny were on active service still they could be shot for mutiny youd better go and talk to jhamboo singh hes the officer ic perhaps theres some way round it jhamboo yes i suppose i had what a bloody position he sauntered back into the room still clutching his neck whats going to happen to your furniture when youve gone i like that cabinet in my room tastefully arranged i had an ornate mahogany cabinet a fine mahogany table a little brass sidetable and a heavy sideboard on which my collection of balinese carvings stood all the gear was looted except for the carvings which i bought with cigarettes in the bazaar the cabinet had come with me overland from padang my room gave me a lot of pleasure although i was so rarely in it on my walls i had bright posters of hanuman the monkey god and little pink parvati on her lotus leaf over the head of my bed hung a large pinup of ida lupino slender browbeaten ever courageous whatll you offer for the job lot he laughed nothing ill wait till youre gone and then ill commandeer it when johnny left i scrutinised my face narrowly in the glass prodding at its pimples and folds a blank sort of face i thought yet not undistinguished what was it going to look like perched over a suit collar and tie and what was i going to do in civvy street follow fathers footsteps into the bank no doubt now i was a hero tough pretty independent there id be just one more palefaced clerk now i had a smashing bird and then the first heat of the day was getting through i went to lie down on my bed putting my hands behind my head and staring up at the cracks on the ceiling the chinese cleaner came bowing himself into the room i shouted to him to get out until i called like a bird to a pool the image of margeys face came back to me that mysterious oriental face with those slanted eyes that perfect mouth the lips in repose like something carved only two hours ago i had wakened to find her beside me and my arm full of cramps because she was lying on my wrist i lay absorbing the sight of her the curl of her hair round her ear and neck the inexplicable curve of her shoulder margeys room with all its grotty detail was revealed to me in monochrome beyond the curtains were a thousand broken rooftops all with tiles missing medan falling apart at the seams my happiness had lasted only a moment came the pain the knowledge that it was friday that in three days i would be swept away in one of those directives issuing from the company office i sat up and she awoke then id left her clung to her and left her feeling so sick on my way back to the lines that id almost have welcomed a few extremists rising before me in the dawnlight and shooting me down into some stinking ditch i fell asleep for an hour but circumstances were already at work to ensure that this was my last peaceful day in sumatra the roofs of medan were broken and the town was tumbling its occupying force was also in ruinous condition i had arrived in medan only six weeks ago having previously been in padang or on detachment at fort de kock during those six weeks i had removed myself as far as possible from the army it had ceased to have functional point the closing down of the fourteenth army had been the final blow despite my feeling of severance emphasised by the detachment from my own unit i could no more visualise myself as a civilian than i could visualise margey away from sumatra the army had bred in me a contempt for the cushy civilian life perhaps i clung to margey as part of a more heroic existence however that might be i woke from my sleep with an urgent resolve to marry the girl why fucking not id show my mates how independent i was at least i would see what the score was and today before the weekend set in i would speak to captain boyer over the wireless link and discuss the situation with him with that done i would face margey and settle her complaints one way or the other for her complaints carried weight with me and then we could go and swim i washed the sweat off my face and neck and dressed myself the billet i lived in was beautiful the rooms downstairs were high and cool the staircase had an elegant curl and there was a carved front door before the war the place had belonged to a prosperous planter who headed for australia when the japs arrived and got himself killed in a barroom brawl in darwin under jap rule the building formed part of the neutrals camp where swiss and swedes and their assorted women had been confined for the duration now it was a sergeants billet i tried out a quick daydream about margeys and my living here when the british troops left complete with bearers to wait on us but the bearers would not stay still and became petty officials in the new indonesian order instead nobody was about outside the sun had already achieved tyrannical power and anyone who could scrounge a way off official duties would be stretched out on his charpoy the line of dutch houses with their neglected gardens and riotous shrubs was sheltered by deciduous trees doubtless imported from nurserymen in amsterdam as soon as i stepped out of their shadow my body oozed sweat into my newly laundered jungle greens a butterfly flew past me at waistlevel its wings as big as saucers i strolled over to m section to get a vehicle to take me into town things were a bit jungly in m section it had taken over a large thatched barn and fortified the space all round with rattan screens and barbed wire there was a guard permanently on the gate though he sometimes dozed under his square of thatch a few vehicles stood frying in the sun in the shade of the barn other vehicles were being repaired most of the vehicles and all of the repair equipment was jap it was an indication of feeling in the house of commons as well as of the situation in india and the nei that div had never managed to come up to strength and relied heavily on commandeered equipment the fact that such equipment as was permitted came via singapore added to our problems there was a shortage of everything the q stores could not even provide new socks if div did not pull out soon it was going to be reduced to growing its own food in earnest coloursergeant ron dyer stood at the entrance to the barn smoking he was a regular and had been through the arakan at his waist he wore a jap aviators sword which made him look like a pirate apart from this weapon and his revolver he wore a filthy pair of dungarees boots and nothing else his great chest and glistening belly were streaked with dirt directly he saw me he set up an outcry and moved sluggishly about in mockpanic right lads watch your vehicles watch these tyres or theyll be all gone like shit off a hot stove keep your eye on anything this bloke can lift watch your rings what do you want here stubbs got a ginpalace to flog me cheap youve got fuckall here anyone would want to swipe dyer the ginpalace scandal was something i would never live down not if i served another hundred years in the army if equipment was in short supply in medan matters were much worse in padang padang lay south of the equator on the other side of the island any goods intended for padang had to make a seavoyage from medan of some twelve hundred miles air transport was scarce there was a hazardous trail over the island the trail five hundred miles long by which i had travelled to medan but that had always been threatened by extremists and was now entirely in their hands padang was an outpost an outpost which began to look increasingly forlorn as the political situation deteriorated one thing the garrison in padang needed a signal station their radio equipment consisted of battered old sets these relayed messages up to a hill station above the town a place called bukitinghi from which signals were relayed over the mountains to medan bukitinghi came under threat with a signals captain shot up on the hazardous road back to padang a proper mobile signals station known throughout the army as a ginpalace was ordered the message went to bukitinghi to medan to singapore to calcutta to delhi and so back to div supply base many hundreds of miles away in amritsar six months later a supply ship landed a ginpalace at belawan the port of medan that ginpalace was the reason for my being on detachment in medan i had been despatched from padang to collect the ginpalace by road the mendips had supplied a truck a driver two bors a bren gun and a load of supplies and we had driven that marathon road across the interior of sumatra over a massive mountain range amid stillactive volcanoes past lake toba down to medan what a ride the adventure of my life theres no more marvellous country anywhere in the world we were not shot at once but that was six weeks ago since then the indonesians had gained confidence knowing we were pulling out and closed the overland route there was no way of getting the ginpalace to padang except by sea meanwhile the road between medan and belawan port became increasingly dangerous i was given an escort to drive to the port and pick up the ginpalace when we arrived we found not one but ten ginpalaces there they were in a line sitting out in the flaming sun beside a deserted godown the signal to amritsar had become garbled on its way back to base i drove our one ginpalace back to medan as ordered it was like driving an oven on wheels at div hq i tried explaining the whole thing to an rasc major who took a dim view of the matter eventually he agreed to send a signal to amritsar to get the situation clarified messages went back and forth days seeped by i was ordered by the same dim major to form a convoy and collect the other nine ginpalaces they were to be guarded carefully in medan until they could be shipped back to calcutta our convoy was fired at and one indian driver was killed we arrived at the harbour the nine ginpalaces had gone that was the story and many a bitter laugh it raised in the popular version of the story i had done an armsdeal i was in charge of the vehicles and so was responsible for selling all nine on the black market to the local branch of soekarnos tri i had made a fortune my version of the story was that the rasc major had made the killing what had really happened was that the indonesians had driven them off the vehicles had been left standing on the dockside by the indian rasc with ignition keys in the ignition locks this was why coloursergeant dyer not a man normally given to humour cried aloud watch your vehicles whenever i went near m section the one ginpalace we had rescued stood practically unused in his park it would never reach padang some humorist had stencilled the word merdeka in neat yellow letters on its sides i gave dyer a fag and we had a little chat its all right for some stubbs i shall have to hang on here till the div pulls out at the end of the year they cant do without me ive only got wogs under me were supposed to be patching up any vehicles we can lay our hands on to sell to the bloody dutch when they take over itll be a bloodbath then pm told you wouldnt fucking chuckle it will we sucked on our cigarettes monkeys ran in the high branches above the barn its a terrible thought sumatras such a beautiful fucking island beautiful buggery its easy for you to say mate youre off home thora pechi they can all kill each other down to the last little black baby for all i care once i get out of here youre being unkind ron its not like you you can stuff your hypocrisy too these people mean nothing to us and weve no bloody business being here you know who let us in the shit same as i do the bloody americans in particular harry truman and general fucking macarthur the nei is part of the pacific and the americans should have administered it theirselves instead of offloading it on to mountbatten i suppose itll sort itself out in the end theyve got to sort out their own bloody troubles me all i want is to get out of this fucking uniform as it happened i ran across ron dyer a year or two later in civvy street he had joined the police he had lost a stone or two and looked good in his uniform an indian driver came over grinning and climbed into one of the jeeps parked under the trees theres your gharri stubbylad see that little bugger doesnt bash it up or flog it to the sumatrans i climbed in gave ron a wave and we bowled down the serdenweg and into the centre of town as we were going at a brave smack the whole gusto of life hit me for the moment personal problems were forgotten we were at the heart of things the thought that we could be shot at at any moment just enhanced the tide of the blood and margey was not far away margey mine mine semimine i began to sing i see your face in every flower your eyes in stars above its just the thought of you the very thought of you my love when it was travelling at speed my voice was quite as good as bing crosbys the driver took me a long way round he must have enjoyed my singing he breezed by the deli railway station where the drivers and horses of two ancient gharris dozed in the sun and braked flamboyantly in front of the signal office as instructed this had been the smart end of town before history overtook it like everything else the building before us had been wrenched out of its intended purpose three years earlier it had been a flower shop where prosperous wives and daughters of planters came in their white dresses to buy the exotic flora with which sumatra abounded it was a low wooden building with large windows now the windows were boarded and walls of sandbags were piled before it a rajput naik stood guard at the entrance inside each tucked into its own sandbagged nook six wireless sets were operating their operators working in rt or wt to alfsea in singapore to batavia or to detachments in places like palembang and padang links to smaller outposts such as sabang and benkoelen were worked for an hour or two every morning a couple of the operators nodded to me as a spare bod with some understanding of signals procedure i had been known to take over from them for an hour or two if needed the superintendent came out of the rear room clutching a piyala full of tea it was steve kyle the thin sharpnosed corporal who had failed to get the lads out of bed for agricultural duties i want to put through a call to captain boyer in padang hq i said can i borrow the rt for five minutes theres a lot of traffic this morning sergeant is it important of course its about my demob next week he went over to his desk and set the mug down looking at it rather than me your message will have to go through admin i cant accept private traffic i want to speak to boyer if youre busy then its quicker for us to have a chat over the rt than to send half a dozen messages each way doesnt that make sense to you corporal he faced up to me it may make sense to you but you know very well that unauthorised persons are not allowed to go on the air nor are they even allowed in the signal office okay he looked me straight in the eye pale and peacetime though he was he was a determined bugger lowering my voice i said youve suddenly turned into a stickler for discipline havent you corporal you put on a pretty feeble show this morning let me remind you that you have a mutiny on your hands the consequences of which could be very serious for you as well as the blokes you think youre defending he coloured dont give me the old sweat bit for christs sake sergeant you old soldiers have had it thats why theyre shipping you home youre going to get a shock when you get to britain weve got a labour government now you may have heard its attlee youre under now not churchill and things have changed my chaps refused to dig this morning for the same reason that the british have failed to turn sumatra back into a colony sense prevailed the bloody wars over the ordinary mans going to have his say here at home and anywhere else you care to name so dont use oldfashioned words like mutiny to me some of the iors and bors at the sets were turning round to listen grinning when it came to being shitorbust i could teach these rookies things they never knew but being shitor bust was personal a very different thing from the new couldnt careless attitude coming from blighty with sods like kyle what the hell were they doing back there attlee and the rest of them the fourteenth army had fought for india and burma and many a good man had gone down including my mates the good old lads of the mendips and div now what was going on they were giving india away and no one knew what was happening in burma i said i gave you an order this morning kyle to get your section out on spade parade you failed to carry it out you are involved with the rest of them and thats got nothing to do with politics its a matter of army discipline unless you want trouble pack in the bullshit and give me five minutes air space he began to sweat dont you threaten me sergeant stubbs you have no business in here id be within my rights to fetch the duty officer and have you turned out you had no business to give me orders this morning either that was between johnny mercer and me hes my sergeant perhaps youve forgotten that you were just coming in from breaking curfew thats a serious offence too and dont you forget it he had a point thikhai if thats the way you want it i said ill sort you out later corporal there was nothing for it but to leave as i reached the door kyle came up behind me and said you can see how im placed i dont want trouble the british army has been caught in an impossible political situation and all of us i turned on him angrily dont try and get round me im as pissed off with the army as anyone and ive seen more cockups than youve had naafi suppers but the whole point of the fucking army is to sort out impossible situations thats what its there for which can only be done with a bit of discipline otherwise we all get shot up malum that he shook his head thats where youre wrong weve only saved ourselves from being shot up here by failing to carry out impossible orders reinstating the dutch cant be done in java theyre having a hell of a time because they refuse to recognise realities balls thats all balls and you know it we havent enough troops here or in java otherwise we could get this lot sorted out in no time now get back to your desk and sort yourself out he pressed his hand to his lips then turned away i clattered down the steps of the signal office lighting a fag as i went the bastard had really got under my skin but i told myself that i had better drop the matter and pursue my intention of speaking to captain boyer ordering my indian driver to wait i walked over to the nearest caf and ordered a coffee the shop owner smiled recognising me i thought as i had every day since i arrived in medan how pleasant this sleepy town must be in times of peace tiger balms bloodbath theory must be wrong once the british and dutch had left quiet would descend these euphoric thoughts of a young man i set down here history is rarely on the side of peace and quiet soekarno the fiery revolutionary made a doubtfully successful leader of free indonesia he was deposed in when the suharto regime took power and began by massacring about a million indonesian citizens many of them chinese since they were fabelled communists the nations of the west were not too dejected as news of the killings got about although as bertrand russell said in four months five times as many people died in indonesia as in vietnam in twelve years i imagine that plenty of the victims were ordinary people like margey tiger balm auntie katie chae and optimistic old fat if the british would give me no help in getting through to boyer in padang then my dutch acquaintance ernst sontrop might come in useful i paid for the coffee bought two good cigars and strolled across the road to the dutch hq which stood conveniently next to the signal office it was a building of grey stone four storeys high and so one of the tallest buildings in the city it was constructed in a cumbersome alien style with rounded corners and heavily overhanging porticos and pediments which gave its faade several permanent frowns once it had functioned as a court of justice i believe justice was now suspended the occupying personnel were military two swart ambonese soldiers challenged me at the entrance stepping smartly out from behind sandbags they looked at my army paybook and consulted with an officer i was admitted in the dimlit hall a stuffed tiger prowled inside its glass case fixing glass eyes upon whoever entered on one marble wall were mounted skulls of the twohorned sumatran rhino while the wall opposite supported a bright mosaic map of the indies fringed with exotic tribal figures together with insects flowers and brightplumaged birds beside the lift and the stairs plants grew in brass tubs a grim old receptionist behind a desk tried to persuade me to hand over my revolver he spoke no english we glowered at each other before he disappeared to return with a hulking man who asked me sharply what my business was when i asked for sontrop he shrugged and led me upstairs without a word upstairs were comfortable sofas and a table bearing dutch magazines all this foreign colour made me wonder whether any stubbs had ever been so far from home before i visualised generation after generation of stubby ancestors with big noses grey whiskers and bizarre appetites receding into the mists of time victorian stubbses tudor stubbses anglosaxon stubbses stoneage stubbses all standing on their home hearth and muttering in the manner of my father why bother about the rest of the world when youve not seen all england yet what an affront to those imagined ancestors if i returned to england with a chinese bride there could be no more conclusive proof of the farflung side of my nature as i was rather loftily accepting the envious congratulations of my brother nelson ernst sontrop entered the waiting room sontrop seemed to my eyes tremendously ancient he was thirtyfive years old a neat straight spade beard fringed his jawline sparse hair swept back from his forehead the beard was brown streaked with white the hair on his head was blond his eyes were greyblue his expression set there were deep wrinkles round his eyes and lips as if he had once clung to a sheer cliffface by those features his clothes were ostentatiously neat his bright civilian shirt army trousers socks and sandals might have come straight from a shop that morning good morning horatio how do you do he paused then came forward and formally shook hands with me i offered him a cigarette which he tucked into his breast pocket before showing me down the corridor to his office firstly i must apologise for keeping you waiting the dutch ship the van heutsz arrives tomorrow to take away many dutch persons so we are busy arranging documents i assured him that i had enjoyed the wait not so many britishers come into our headquarters horatio it is a shame that our peoples do not go along better together when we are both european races and have common interests now please to take a seat and tell me what i can do for you time was i had done something for sontrop when i was still with my unit in padang i was given the job of establishing a rapwi area rapwi was the rehabilitation of allied prisoners of war and internees organisation also known unofficially as rape all pretty women in indonesia among the rapwi personnel in padang were several dutch girls whom i had to fetch from the hill station of bukitinghi where they had been interned by the japs i became involved with one of the biggest blondes addy sontrop a fine strapping girl taller than i and milder than a pat of butter one day i was drinking in a bar with a couple of my mates when i noticed addy serving at the food counter a taffy from the south wales borderers was pawing her and making himself generally objectionable when he slapped a hand on addys left tit i went over and punched him in the guts some of his mates showed up and we had a dodgy few minutes of it addy was later shifted to medan i met her again when i arrived there and she introduced me to brother ernst ernst was unexpectedly friendly the dutch had a reputation for being standoffish and he continued being civil after addy boarded the van heutsz and sailed for the netherlands so i gave him an outline of my story telling him just enough to explain why i wished to speak to boyer over the radio link something in his face an expression of disapproval brought the blood to my throat before i had finished my story dont you go for the idea of my marrying a chinese girl ernst he dropped his glance to his neatly manicured nails of course it is not for me to give any opinion about your private affairs horatio go on no it is simply that we found throughout many years of ruling in these islands that mixed marriages never turn out very happily for you it may be different lets proceed to the wireless room sontrop took me to the top floor of the building where two dutchmen were working a jap transmitter of formidable size while they were calling padang sontrop summoned a uniformed native who served us with glasses of fresh iced lime juice i couldnt see anything like that happening in corporal kyles lousy signal office after a certain amount of impenetrable dutch had gone over the air sontrop came and said our friends in padang at the netherlands headquarters are unable to telephone to the british division extremists severed the cable during the hours of night and it is not yet do you say reinstated reinstalled they will send a messenger on a motorbike captain boyer shall radio you back here in two hours time provided that he may be found i checked with my watches it was somewhere about midday as i thanked him he said it is time for my lunch you caught me almost as i left come to my house and eat with me let me first get my carbine my jeep was waiting outside so i invited him to climb in some british troops were strolling by one of them laughed and said something to his mates if there was one thing regarded as more eccentric than associating with the chinese it was associating with the dutch our indian driver ever glad of distraction made a showy turn round the park passed the de witte club and bowled up past the old deserted childrens playground towards the rapwi area buildings on either side of the road were shuttered and ruinous until we came to the little model village where the dutch were now mainly housed the guards at the gate were japs with the insignia removed from their uniforms sontrop gave the driver directions we turned down a neat little side road the trees were deciduous again formally spaced just as on the banks of the zuyder zee ernst lived in something that looked like a shrunken version of an odeon cinema with a strange multiangle tower rising above the roofline curved steps flounced up to an elaborate front door inside the floors were marble and there was a rembrandt reproduction on the wall the night watch we met a couple of dutch women in the hall padding round halfnaked with their hair in curlers i was immediately interested though they were uglylooking cows since sontrop had not struck me as a ladies man it was always hard to tell with foreigners the women took no notice of us they smoked and walked about white their hair set presumably getting ready for some evening event there were dances in the rapwi area every night passing them politely sontrop showed me into his quarters we entered a big room a grotesque stone fireplace was the chief feature his bed was here and a table some novels on a shelf some ammo boxes under the window little else a door led off to back quarters i bring you a beer he said what about the driver he can have water he brought me a milwaukee beer and then disappeared i walked round the room looking at photographs hanging framed on the walk they were all views of some foreign town where it appeared permanently about to rain by the bed stood snaps of addy and an older female presumably mum nowhere in sontrops bare room did i see signs of female occupancy of course owing to the emergency houses in protected areas were always overcrowded one heard funny things about the dutch but that did not mean that all the women in the bungalow had to be sontrops mistresses i stared out of the back window into a patch of unkempt backgarden where unkempt bushes flowered laundered sanitary towels were hanging on a wire to dry five of them in a row like rabbit pelts sontrop came back bearing a plate with some big thick cheese sandwiches i saw he had no beer for himself perhaps he had given me his last bottle hospitable people the dutch as we munched he said you have heard that all the british forces are pulling out from medan within four months is the date confirmed yes as i understand it makes our small dutch force in a very difficult situation but british politicians have recognised soekarnos republic which we cannot do youd be well advised to pull out too the indonesians are determined to be independent support from europe is a long way off he shrugged the natives cannot manage administration they are unprepared for autonomy like children they cannot run hospitals and telephone exchanges and banks and the mercantile aspects they cannot build roads or keep down malaria they can hardly cook a meal without chinese help we must stay here we made this place there was nothing before we came here last century nothing you understand just a few stinking huts beside the river deli addys and my parents arrived here as a young married couple at the start of this century by hard work my father became to own his own plantation growing rubber and tobacco he carved it out of the jungle with his own blade and killed off the snakes and other wild life he and my mother died here defending their land when the japanese invaded i was born here how do we just disappear weakly because we are afraid of a few extremists like soekarno i can see how you feel we ate the sandwiches in silence sontrop laughed you know what we get more volunteers now from the netherlands and i hear tell that after the german wehrmacht disbanded many of its officers join the french foreign legion to help them fight in indochina they also enlist in the dutch army to help fight here and in java so we have both our old enemies the nazis and the japs to give assistances now weevils had been baked into the spongy bread just like the bread in the sergeants mess i said i cant see the british ever using german military aid there would be a devil of a row if we did so he wagged a finger at me you british got scared by ghandi you should have locked him up and throwed away the key suddenly the war ends and you arent tough any more you horatio you are good at punching a man at the stomach when it is necessary but i have a sense you do not want more fighting ive had a bellyfull i was in burma one of the worst theatres of war in the world no forgive me but dutch new guinea is easily first worst what did you did in burma so i gave him a quick rundown on the battle of kohima and how the fighting had raged over the dcs tennis court i told him how charlie meadows and i had climbed a cliff and thrown grenades into a jap bunker were you scared then horatio at the time i didnt feel a thing afterwards i got the shakes they had to feed charlie and me on rum when we came out of burma and were resting up outside calcutta i had a few bad nightmares where were you during the war here he told me his experiences it was quiet in the bungalow now and again the halfclad women called to each other in dutch outside cries of children came faintly ernst sontrops family lived on their plantation some miles outside medan when the japs arrived in a mortar shell landed on their bungalow ernst was knocked unconscious his parents and an elder brother were killed and addy ran away in panic a faithful servant carried sontrop to a native hut and hid him when the japanese troops marched in then followed a few weeks of hell the world was alive with heroes after the war unexpected countries were suddenly thrown open like treasurechests their secrets bursting into the light of incredible truth the most ordinary people had dramatic stories to tell europe had undergone its terrible upheavals but the upheaval that took place in the far east was grander more terrible more farreaching that upheaval still remains largely misunderstood or neglected from the splendour and havoc of the east few stories travelled back to the west those that have done so are largely misleading to give but one example the film of the bridge over the river kwai which dealt with the death railway built largely by british and australian prisoners of war in order to link burma with malaya was a tremendous success because it glorified the white man it showed him building a bridge which the japanese could not have managed on their own the truth was that the japanese were masters of the jungle they were ferociously brave and ingenious enemies and as their postwar success has shown they were fully a match for the european races at building anything from a watch to an oil tanker bridges were nothing to them and they endured conditions that no white races had been trained to endure as it was with the japanese so it was with the other teeming peoples of southeast asia then and now perhaps the west dare not know there was another reason for not being eager to go home as the women were beautiful so the men were amazingly resilient the chinese in particular were to exhibit their capacity for endurance and for an unexcelled ability to flourish in impossible conditions four million of them fled from the communist regime in their homeland and were cast upon the rock of hong kong there they made a worldsuccess of what under four million variegated europeans would have turned into a concentration tamp on a grand scale ernst sontrop the faithful servant and a couple of friends managed to launch a small boat from a desolate stretch of coast and sail up the malacca straits towards the anderman islands they were picked up halfdead after twentyone days afloat by a british naval vessel they were taken to colombo where the servant died after some weeks in india the three dutchmen were given passage on a ship bound for england the ship was torpedoed in the atlantic by a german uboat later he was to discover that he was almost the sole survivor of the ship sontrop drifted on a lifebelt to the coast of france he met up with members of the french resistance and after some months made his way into occupied holland to fight with the underground against the nazis you had a brave time in burma horatio but fighting in an occupied country then you need a different sort of courage each time you have to go to sleep you wonder if you will waken with a german carbine muzzle stuck in your stomach strange experience to get home and find its an enemy country holland is not my home sumatra is my home that is why i come back here as soon as i can to fight for what is mine we had another cigarette smoking in silence we will go back to the hq and find if your captain boyer has made contact will addy return to medan some day of course once we put down this bloody merdeka movement he took up his carbine from his bed and slung it over his shoulder as we made for the fancy door the jeep driver had disappeared we walked around and discovered him down by a little chinese stall sucking a mango flavoured ice cream a message awaited me in the dutch hq they could not contact captain boyer he had left padang nothing was said about where he had gone thanks a lot i said to sontrop as i left his office i shall have to go to div hq and find out where he has gone if hes in palembang or singapore im in trouble its a disappointment not to help you more i will see you again before you leave medan i hope sure perhaps a little celebration that would be great as we shook hands in the hall by the tiger i said emotionally this is a great place medan the heat the bloody insects ive got to go back to england and the thought it kills me just to think of it he said the world owes a debt to your country when you have returned back there it will not be painful for you i think you will quickly forget the east it is not inside you here he touched his chest as it is with me i somehow dont fancy going back to that little dark bombedout island i was in england horatio we had a vacation when my parents were on leave in the netherlands before the war we spent some days in hull a very pleasant and historic city i went to the door oh yes hull hulls great well thanks again for the lunch you are welcome he bowed outside was the sunshine the dusty road my jeep was there waiting its driver a few yards away chatting to some rajput rifles from the nearby british hq he strolled over affably when i emerged you want go back home johnny johnny from a bloody naik he was fresh out from india as kyle was fresh out from england someone else who did not know the rules when i arrived in india three years earlier in jan to be precise no indian would have dared to call any british soldier johnny since then american troops with their easy money and habits had flowed into calcutta and bengal in their hundreds and from them the custom of calling everyone johnny had spread maybe the yanks thought it sounded democratic for anyone who served in the fourteenth army it had a ring of contempt you can return to lines and report back jhaldi to colour sergeant dyer in m section naik thik hai thikhai sergeant that was better and no sidetrips on the way malum acha sir he jumped into his vehicle and drove off grinning a fucking great thing zoomed in from the nearest swamp and landed on my cheek i struck it with unnecessary violence and almost laid myself out i missed the fucking great thing peering groggily at my watches i decided that an average reading made it about onefortyfive the signal office shift would have changed corporal kyle was no longer on duty i strolled into the office and spent the best part of an hour trying again to contact captain boyer only to receive the same answer as the dutch boring old boyer was on the wing maybe he had pissed off to singapore on leave or india you never knew with officers by now he could be bedding one of the memsahibs of ootie who slept only with lieutenants or above i had had enough i was going to see margey i had some money on me dutch guilders and worthless jap guilders which served as currency in the bazaars in one of the chinese shops along the kesawan i found a can of argentine corned beef heavily overstamped naafi going for thirty guilders or almost three pounds sterling some illicit quartermaster was making a fortune i paid up sighing margey loved corned beef her tastes were very sophisticated as i emerged into the street the sky was rapidly clouding over wind scurried down the pavement in four minutes the streets would be awash before i reached margeys alley the first drops of rain smashed against the ground brotherinlaw fat was not seated at the central table that in itself was remarkable the erudite tiger balm was also absent to my relief the morning had been fruitless enough without him someone was at the table sitting there in the gloom over a packet of fags it was one of the mostfrequented tables in the nei the someone was one of the interchangeable little old wrinkled men who guarded the place and kept it well fumigated with cigarette smoke tabeh bapa i said he returned the greeting by offering his fag packet auntie was not to be seen one of her fullmoon smiles would have gone down well the screens were still round her sofa as they had been when i left the house before dawn groans issued from behind them the old boy gestured at them and said something like sakit sakit which i did not understand a chinese came from behind the screens his little black bag and serious air marked him out as a doctor he was sand coloured and wore sandcoloured shirt and shorts he started chatting loudly with the old boy at the table if auntie was ill it was no business of mine margey was my target once not so many weeks ago i had run run up those two grotty flights of stairs with her in my arms couldnt wait to get her up there strong as a fucking ox mad as a mosquito margey i called no reply i looked at the watches on my wrist the amsterdam masterpiece had stopped again according to the other it was ten past two no room like hers anywhere anonymous yet personal rapturous yet melancholy the birds custard had been stored away i stared out of the window at cracked roofs running with rain at broken gutters belching water at the stones below under flood let it piss down i thought let it always be extreme on the sagging pediment of a nearby roof a row of shite hawks sat they were drab brown with white heads scraggy creatures watching for something to salvage from the flood a rat an unwary lizard a fish a sick dog a human corpse all were welcome to the shitehawks it was their war their peace whatever happened in medan theyd do well out of it under the low ceiling it was as hot as ever i took my boots off removed my belt set it with the revolver upmost by the head of the bed i stretched out and closed my eyes sleep came down zonk like the swoop of a shitehawk a slight noise and i was awake again right hand on gun butt someone was coming up the stairs more than one person talking in low voices i sat up and aimed the revolver at the door logic declared that no extremists would break in to this area of medan in daylight hours nor having broken in would they tread quietly up the stairs exchanging pleasantries however logic had little power against a mental picture of being killed on margeys bed a womans voice not margeys daisys it must be daisys she called softly su chi daisys cubicle was dark since it had no window such light as it received filtered over the partition a match scraped in a box lamplight glowed on the ceiling throwing a pale wing of shadow above my head i heard the chink of money then came a chuckle and the sound of someone preparing to fuck daisy the bloody chinese i thought midafternoon they were at it all the time what else was there to do when you were stuck in a country paralysed by revolution preceded by three years of servitude under the scum of the earth as banks closed everywhere thighs were bound to open the lips of those neat little eastern twots to unfurl like buds and fornication to commence the savoury sounds from next door illustrated my thesis i clutched my prick and wondered at the laws of the globe although i had never thought about it before old daisy was not a bad screw her baby had ruled her out of consideration true she was a bit short and rather podgy in the face but one could imagine that good things lurked under the striped pyjamas she wore most of the good things were getting a hammering now she was murmuring making a little crooning noise erotic enough to bestow erections on any mate within earshot be he soldier animal alligator or chicken whoever the guy was he was getting into his stride a decided slurp came from her socket each time his piston drove home echoed immediately by the slap of two chinese bellies coming together i couldnt help fantasising about margey taking up that same comfortable pace with her as we lay side by side something of the sort would be good even with daisy i could imagine her only a few feet away they were getting more excited now those chubby buttocks would be going like a fiddlers elbow his heels were jammed against the partition making a regular drumming sound the sod was grunting and she was going ahahah to entourage him she was encouraging me too suddenly oh shit oh jesus wept i was coming all over my bloody jungle greens what a bloody fool what an ape i had not even realised i had the damned thing in my hand it had fitted in there of its own accord now it lay looking smugly up at me relaxing heaving slightly like an old bull elephant seal on the rocks leaving its trail all over my flies and jacket dead silence next door from my pocket i fished a sweat rag something id been issued with in burma and mopped myself up but the effects remained obvious i lay back in disgust conscious of a tropical headache gathering like thunderclouds behind my forehead a revolting ginger object with perspex wings and countless legs or mandibles belted in through the window it homed in on the comestains vibrating a great curled tongue with glee it could have passed for either a new evolutionary brand of hornet or the innards of a javanese watch i struck it away with fear and loathing and it commenced to gyrate upsidedown on the floor with loud whirring sounds it was the innards of a javanese watch they had finished next door the old chap was panting and wheezing he could be the sandcoloured doctor i had seen down below attending old auntie standard fee one visit one bunkup he was getting paid daisy said something in a low irritable voice then the baby squeaked it was on the bed with them i lay where i was until they went downstairs again propping myself on one elbow and resting my head on my hand life is a knockingshop nor am i out of it it followed from this degrading experience that margey was also just a little whore whatever was happening on the political front whoring like the business of the shitehawks on the roof outside never ceased to prosper how else could she pay her way through life from everyone a price was exacted for a while i thought of margey with hatred she had been so bloody secretive about the other side of her life ever since we met but the hatred went fast like a storm blowing out to sea you couldnt hate margey she had only been tactful protecting me from the rottenness that surrounded her she had to keep old fat in cigarettes in exchange for this billet perhaps that was the arrangement when i had arrived in medan to take delivery of my gin palace before the horrible event of the arms deal johnny mercer was going out with margey he introduced me to her apologetically and the three of us had a drink in a little malayan shack on the edge of town margey said so little that evening that i scarcely realised she could talk english she looked small and not particularly interesting her europeanstyle dress did not suit her as we walked down the road afterwards margey trailing behind us johnny said do you want to take her on horry shes very nice though she doesnt say a lot her talents lie in other directions i didnt know and said as much look she really is smashing though she was acting a bit thick back there trouble is she always wants to eat chinese grub and it doesnt suit my stomach he was silent for a moment then he added quietly its no skin off my nose im going to jack her in ive got a bit of blonde crumpet up the rapwi whose husbands been shipped home with his chest shot up i looked back at the girl behind us she sauntered along so innocently her eyes directed to the ground she was plump the european littlegirl dress was unsuitable and did nothing for her figure as she caught my eye she smiled as at some secret but rather shameful joke i always remember that moment does she dance i asked the very next night i took her to the sergeants mess saturday hop johnny faded gracefully out in the direction of the rapwi and thereafter was always tactful in his references to margey although margey was tactful about johnny i soon found out that she had not been fond of him he had not behaved politely margey had been open and affectionate towards me from that first dance such was her nature such was the nature of the political situation that she had to pay her way with her one natural resource just like daisy and margeys enemy down the street katie chae i devoted a lot of psychic energy to denying the fact to myself you always paid more than you could afford when i got back to the blight only a few days to go i would lose my freedom while pretending not to lose it and would vanish into barclays bank like my father lost for ever to the world of wider possibilities surely it was better to stay in medan but there were few possibilities here either that was why daisy and margey were screwed regularly by whoever had a few guilders or a can of bully beef i sat up and wiped furiously at the patches on my trousers almost ruining my matrimonial hopes in the process if i took margey back to england that would be okay for her and me and yet even here even in medan even in the bloody indian army even ten thousand miles from home i still met with that stupid british prejudice from my fellow sergeants a racialism that it would take a million years to wipe out they would screw the local girls of any shade or persuasion but to love them to treat them as human beings that was not to be thought of these comments set down now are inevitably coloured by all that has happened since those distant days when the warmth between margey and me was a real breathing thing they are coloured by memories of the welcome britain gave to the west indians the indians and the pakistanis who fought beside us against jap and german alike in world war ii they came to work here in what they called their mother country only to find the milk had gone sour grunting about my headache i climbed back into socks boots puttees i stood up and put the ginger machinething out of its agony with the heel of a left army boot size eleven then i clomped downstairs i was going back to the billet a strategically held bush hat concealed the mess on my trousers i left the corned beef all thirty guilders worth on the window sill in payment for my sterile pleasure if it had been pleasure and i closed the window maybe shitehawks liked corned beef at the top of the alleyway margey appeared she carried her little purse her parasol and a small parcel wrapped in newspaper oh hello horry darling how nice i see you you wait for me id given up waiting i was going back to the billet come in sit down and i make you nice coffee darling today coffee again she linked her chubby arm in mine i been shopping a long way to get some medicine for poor auntie she no well today and doctor come poor auntie when i go down chuah street i see in a shop real lovely little hat from paris or some prace like that just is right to wear in london and look smart but costs much price tomorrow i take you and show and you can see me wear it okay ill buy it for you margey no is costing too much price just you see me wear it she grinned up at me saucily then you think you dear margey very sexy want make love to her in shop i laughed ill buy it for you as my parting present her smile vanished immediately it impossible us to part horry now we found each other she clung to my arm we went back in she started scolding the old man at the table who stood up and started explaining something to her with a maximum of gesture margey became very angry and animated i sat down at the table to watch her and keep my flies hidden fat appeared from the rear of the building said something irritably and immediately became a second object of margeys fine scorn she stood there beautifully moulded with her eyes wide letting them have it about something or other daisy also appeared lolling against the wall and enjoying every word of it as she cradled her baby her manner was indolent when the men trooped dejectedly into the kitchen margey unwrapped her parcel on the table i started back in alarm a disgusting oily creature was revealed which looked like a fish with legs it was black it leaked an oily substance on to the table daisy came up to admire it margey burst into laughter at my expression her anger vanishing dont be frightened darling is only medicine make auntie better what is that revolting thing she explained that it was a common sumatran animal which lived on the plantations she held it up by its tail it looked like a baby dinosaur ripped palpitating at foetusstage from some stygian archaic womb it had frogs eyes along its body was a folded membrane which margey pulled out revealing wings rather like bats wings the head was blunt with curious flaps instead of ears i had never seen anything like it before it was a flying lizard believed by the chinese community to have medicinal powers margey trotted it out to the kitchen to cut it up the old man went behind the screen to fan auntie daisy made little crooning noises to her baby fat brought me a bottle of red fox life was going on more or less as usual scraping by that was how average days in medan drifted along not much achieved not much harm done either an easier life than anything i was likely to find at home a life fit for a fucking hero nevertheless a certain dissatisfaction followed me back to the lines when i returned there an hour or so before sunset boyer had eluded me i blamed myself for not doing something about him earlier you never knew where officers were going to be before reaching the sergeants mess i heard the sound of a pump wheezing like an asthmatic trying to climb the great pyramid with his grannie on his back an indian havildar was supervising the draining of our ruined cesspit while the gang of men under him laid freshly sawn planks over the hole charlie meadows stood watching from the mess steps smoking his pipe to ward off the stink merdeka horatio wed better not get too pissed tonight or well be in there headfirst it would be a nasty way to die i can think of better ways to go as i came level with him he turned to face me pulling the pipe wetly from his big mouth and pointing the end at me youre a dodgy bugger and always have been as long as ive known you he said admiringly jhamboo singh has been looking for you most of the bloody day what have you been doing flogging more ginpalaces the sergeants mess this time flogged it to soekarno for a brothel whats jhamboo want do you know youd better go over to admin and see all this bloody army bullshit il be glad to escape from it id better have a shower and a change first charlie stuck the pipe in the other side of his mouth you dont know when youre well off you young lads for all my assumption of indifference the summons to jhamboo worried me i showered fast yelling for the chinese orderly to get out a fresh uniform as i cast the spunkridden one aside quick dash of powder over foot rot and prickly heat fast dress and i was ready as i made my way over to admin the sun was sloping down the western sky without in any way relaxing its animosity towards mankind the duty clerk was on me as i entered the doorway and a moment later an indian orderly showed me upstairs to jhamboos office captain jhamboo singh was a small man perhaps that was why he stood up as i entered and saluted him as ever he was immaculately dressed in khaki uniform with razorsharp edges to his shorts his belt and boots shone his little moustache was deadly symmetrical ah good afternoon sgt stubbs i have been trying to get in touch with you all day may i ask where you have been his voice was soft almost pleading i had some business down in town sir i am timeexpired flying out on monday and the rsm has excused me duties well we are very short of men sgt stubbs we dont get the replacements you see it may be that we shall be forced to call upon you for some duties he smiled the army always needs us till the very last moment when it releases us as a regular soldier you will understand what did you want to see me for sir his fingers drummed on the desk perhaps you would be kind enough to wait one moment white i work on some papers when i learned you were here i have summoned also sgt mercer and cpl kyle of o section i hope they will arrive immediately he came halfway round his desk to offer me a chair i sat on it in a rigid at attention position please you may smoke sgt stubbs perhaps you will take one of mine he extended a sumptuous silver cigarette case it opened like the jaws of a crocodile as it approached me over the desk they are english cigarettes de reszke i took one and lit up rumour had it that jhamboos family were fantastically rich and ate their curries off beaten gold plates while being served by naked slavegirls before i had finished puffing away the door opened and johnny and kyle clumped in they halted side by side and saluted i heaved myself up beside them and stared at a spot six inches the other side of jhamboos head thank you gentlemen no need to be formal jhamboo whispered we have a painful subject to talk about it is the question of why o section did not turn out to dig the field this morning as you sgt mercer reported that is why i have invited you to come here cpl kyle you are in charge of these men why exactly was agricultural duty not carried out as per orders our thinnosed pale friend said sir i asked the men very reasonably to turn out on parade but they refused they said that their job did not include digging they claimed to be skilled tradesmen sir they said i just report what they said sir that such a job was a task for the indian other ranks jhamboo singh nodded very methodically at all these points as if meeting them head on a fly buzzed about and sat on his left ear he ignored it so the men refused duty as laid down have you anything to add to that sgt mercer he asked the question mildly putting his head to one side like a family doctor prepared to listen to any description of any symptom however revolting mercer stood rigidly at attention as he spoke the men would not budge from their charpoys sah when not descending to the level of common abuse such as telling cpl kyle to get knotted sah their argument ran that they saw no point in the proposed agricultural activity sah johnny loved to parody the military manner the whole point of the proposed agricultural activity sgt mercer said jhamboo suavely is that we can become a little independent of the hostile local community by growing a vegetable crop for ourselves do you personally like fresh potatoes sgt mercer sah particularly with a little butter sah but begging your pardon sah my culinary tastes dont enter the issue at hand the gist of the argument as presented by the bors sah in among their epithets to cpl kyle here was that supposing the field was dug and the potatoes planted div would have evacuated sumatra before the aforesaid root crop was ripe enough to benefit the military cuisine in other words sah they claimed that digging that field would benefit the indonesians and not the troops hard to produce a counter argument to that sah jhamboo looked as if he agreed with every word that had been said and was prepared to agree with many more but he said unfortunately orders are issued from ghq as instructions to be carried out and not as arguments to be discussed similarly your duty was to implement those instructions and not play any socratic role kyle stuck his nose forward at this and said with respect sir i cant think that remark really represents your private views im sure you feel as i do that wrong orders have in this instance been issued it is an injustice that the british army should be here at all suppressing the freedom of indonesians as you sir as an indian must be aware so it must be unjust that we should dig fields which probably belong by rights to indonesian farmers i see jhamboos face betrayed nothing he lit a de reszke never removing his gaze from kyle then he said softly i will not listen to criticism of the british army from a conscript in any case such policies have nothing to do with us as soldiers we are discussing an order that has been defied and what we should do about it he stubbed out his newly lit cigarette the war is over sir we should be trying to build the peace corporal indian division is unfortunately on active service for us we have a war it is difficult to command if nobody obeys impossible to be frank kyle ignored these remarks if we went to the goc sir and complained of flagrant injustice all the lads would be behind you believe me that was too much for me as kyle spoke i saw terrible anger flash in jhamboos eye then his countenance was again lamblike for one second some ghastly bloodyminded ancestor had been glimpsed swinging a twobladed battleaxe i said what kyle is saying is beside the point not to mention a right load of nonsense an army exists by following orders even if it thinks them idiotic thats how we won the great war and the war against the japs and kyle interrupted and look at the millions who got killed obeying fool orders issued by stupid generals its more courageous to defy an order you know is nonsense like this rubbish about planting potatoes dont you talk to me about courage cpl kyle what do you think these medals are naffi fruitcake i thumped my chest before turning to jhamboo theres no problem here sir the only problem is that youre stuck with a corporal who cant or wont give orders you heard what he said he went into o section billets and he asked the men reasonably to turn out of course they told him to piss off i guarantee that if you give me the job ill have em on parade and digging away tomorrow at sunrise jhamboo gave me a straight look and said tomorrow is saturday sergeant in any case remember that you are excused all duties as you were telling me there was a sort of silence while we looked at each other jhamboo got up and paced a bit behind his desk he took another cigarette from his silver case selecting and lighting it with care johnny said permission to ask a question sah i gather that it is pukka that div will pull out of sumatra and return to india in september the goc wants the field dug this month not in september jhamboo said curtly would you like me to get up a petition among the lads sir asked kyle theyll all sign if i ask them to we feel that you are being victimised too having to enforce such a silly order this is a test case as i see it jhamboo smoked rather heavily but said nothing so i spoke sir with respect would you like me to fetch rsm payne what we have here is a case of mutiny on our hands clear infraction of army regulations jhamboo gave me a tender smile as of bride to groom when i require the presence of the rsm i will summon him by my orderly he thought for a moment pacing then went and sat down again he drummed his fingers on the desk all right i do not wish this matter to go any further for the present you three ncos will not speak to anyone else about it in particular cpl kyle you are not to discuss the matter with the men you understand yes sir please do not simply say yes sir also obey my order there are still such things as orders even in a peacetime army now you may dismiss no digging parade tomorrow being saturday i will have the weekend to consider the matter i want you to keep silence until i speak to you again what is it cpl kyle kyle leant forward in his anxiety resting one hand on jhamboos desk if i might just make a general point about the overall situation sir i would like to offer my personal sympathy for your own particular predicament as i see it the british invasion of sumatra and java is a rank example of imperialism this being a predominantly muslim country and you sir being also of the muslim persuasion it must place you in a painful conflict dropping his cigarette and clutching the edge of his desk until you waited for it to splinter jhamboo rose two inches off his chair from his face the lamb had fled the butcher took over the docile nose became a hawks bill those lambent eyes blazed like overflowing cesspits spirits of rapine and slaughter which caused the indian subcontinent to sink kneedeep in blood every century came galloping out of that trim tensed figure cpl kyle you boned fathead you may dismiss sir i only but even kyles unctuous heart quailed at the spectacle before him he clicked his heels and marched out with all the military precision of a pox doctors clerk johnny mercer followed him jhamboo motioned me to stay behind when the door slammed shot we confronted each other jhamboo came out from behind his desk and paced about a bit still in a tremendous state what kind of a bloody fornicating pacifistical bugger is this foolish corporal jhamboo demanded waving a fist above his head as he paraded how dare that turddevouring cocksucker question me about my religion to my astonishment i found myself blushing there was a faint insane hope that my deep tan would hide the colour but my cheeks were bursting with heat never had i heard such language from jhamboo or any other indian officer before he was still on the march smiting his skull with a clenched fist as he went i tell you sergeant if i was a cursing man i would bloody jolly soon say what i thought of such crawling arseholecreeping vaginaphobes jesus christ almighty excuse me what sort of a pisspoor ninny is that man where did he crawl out from which arsecrack more to the point he steadied himself before me still blazing away so that i drew myself up to full attention partly to avoid the rich aromas of vindaloo and de reszke cigarettes on his breath more to the point how do such men come to serve in noncommissioned rank in a oncegreat army answer me that if you will i understand his family comes from tonbridge wells sir jhamboo smote his palm with his fist that is not sufficient explanation the british empire is going to the matrimonial old hounds no backbone any more i was at sandhurst let me tell you sgt stubbs and in my day any little conjugal toffee applenosed socialist bastards like kyle would have had their scrotums removed with a blunt instrument i weep i weep indeed real tears stood in his eyes what has happened in your country who can tell it my private theory is that the death of george v caused the settingin of the rot he was a fine man soldier foxhunter a real monarch married to a proud queen since then a decadent excrement edward viii running away with that poxedup american bitch mrs simpson it clearly spelt the end of any stable system of fealty and the loss of respect near and far overcome by emotion he steadied himself by clutching the desk how can you capture now i ask you how can you capture the loyalty of your indian subjects if your king is intercoursing the orifice off some yankee cow all the way about europe you may think inwardly that i am just one more picturesque wog sergeant you may you may but i have been on leave all round europe yes all round it even including the black forest in germany and it is simply a despicable place not so beautiful as britain and totally without respects for morals i could tell you some hairrousing anecdotes about what happened to me in europe he fished out his cigarette case thrusting fags between my lips and his own he lit them with his gold lighter his hand trembling i speak as one who has uncontrollably good friends in hampstead heath sergeant well well thats all over now good days are over i have no optimism none none the british empire is finish and i suppose it is for the best he patted my arm clumsily you cannot know what a man of sensibilities like me feels sergeant split apart split apart absolutely top to stern my life finish and my career what will india be alone after all well bugger that and please excuse my outbreak of cursing but really that familiar lickspittle little leftwing masturbationer of a corporal to lecture me about my religion sir if i might suggest it despite the regrettable antics of edward viii we have on our hands a case of mutiny cpl kyle has refused to carry out an order he should be placed immediately under close arrest pending further proceedings otherwise his sort of attitude will spread sir retreating behind his desk jhamboo looked out of the window at the weary plane trees smoking furiously as he did so then he turned back to me giving no sign of having heard what i said sergeant i have behaved disgracefully in front of you forgive me perhaps you are my enemy i dont know but that is not what i wish you see i admire the british regular soldier to the highest degree the very highest well there is a saying a rotten fish stinks from the head corruption spreads very quickly and the end of everything is in sight he appeared wretched and bowed his head sah stubbs man make an effort will you to treat me just as another man not as a bloody black officer simply kyle did that sir and it marked you a bit he sat down and became very mild going so far as to toy with a ruler i must explain so you will understand india is about to achieve independence when independence comes and the union jack is hauled down and burnt it will mean war between muslim and hindu populations and much blood will be spilled nevertheless in policy we shall be pacifistical and who knows what will become of the excellent britishtrained army i am trained only to be a soldier without an army i am nobody suddenly he brought a bottle of gin out of the cupboard in his desk followed by two greentinted tumblers he filled them to the brim and pushed one of them towards me drink it drink it and good health he waved his hand dismissing ceremony you see i am a rotten muslim also to touch this alcohol your good health sir and best wishes for the future sir whatever it brings thank you stubbs thank you his eyes went misty as we raised glasses to each other and drank you see what the future will bring is uncertain the time is out of joint but at least i stand a fighting chance very excellent phrase that a fighting chance i can possibly survive in the forthcoming free india if i am retired with a perfect military record now stubbs if i have a case of mutiny under my command then the military record is not perfect by a big chalk so it is important that this matter of o section and this nasty corporal is kept quiet you understand perfectly sir the gin took a bit of getting down excellent you see how i would be obliged if you stepped outside this room and never mentioned it again after all you go back to blighty next week so why should you worry but it is important to me that my perfect military record is not blotted in the few months left before everything breaks up i see how you feel sir but discipline will go to pot if the blokes find they can defy orders and get away with it he drained his glass yes yes perfectly so but between you and i the goc must have been pissed when he thought up the idea of the men planting potatoes i dont think british troops should have to do such menial things evening was coming down the sun bobbed along a line of distant palm trees on the far side of the disputed potato field it had lost all power to wound and mosquitoes were already awing an indian sweeper was sweeping the road bent double with his little bundle of twigs in the office behind me a clerk was singing his song floated through the open window we dont know whats coming tomorrow maybe its trouble and sorrow but we travel along singing a song side by side i took a couple of minutes off to light a fag and stroll about under the plane trees the gin had made me feel squiffy vaginaphobe i said wonderingly poor old jhamboo was in a bad way he had almost broken down in front of me he was going to return to what would be a new nation and i could not muck up his chances not when he had made a direct appeal to me sontrop was in as bad a position it really hit me when he referred to sumatra as home but home for him was going to be a stormy place for a long while if he didnt get killed first the fag tasted good i rolled down my sleeves as the sun ploughed behind the palms dusk fell almost at once after the days abortive performance better not to think of margeys future nobody knew what was happening in her home of tsingtao india sumatra china from that point of view england was preferable as for all my muckers crying aloud to get back to civvy street there i reckoned i showed more sense than they i could not see anything wrong with sumatra apart from the fact that we were also in the army after seven years in the army three and a half of them abroad home was an unknown quality war had changed the whole bloody world cushy for some said a deep voice and the clerk from the orderly room a little stunted chap called wallace went by he had been out from the blight about five minutes with his terrible low hairy brow his glistening nostrils his blubber tips and stooped gait one shufti at him would have saved charles darwin ten years of intensive research his greeting a shorthand way of saying good evening sgt stubbs you bronzed veteran of the toughest campaign of war was an envious comment on my prospective return home yet what could britain offer that ape which he could not get more of here ah margey if only every screw could have taken place on a broken altar among orchids before a great grinning prostrate idol in marble that would have been perfect i knew she felt something of the same thing about me as i did about her she loved and wanted me because i was the wrong colour and had funnyshaped eyes and came from england where my father was a bank manager and winston churchill a famous old warlord when we got together two exotic miscegenies thrashed about in harmony as i ground my cigaretteend under my boot jackie tertis came along moving among the billets whistling i knew what he had been doing stubbs you eating good idea im bloody starving ive had nothing but a cheese sandwich all day we walked along in step together his face worked in a peculiar way which i tried not to notice again i recalled tertis as a young innocent private back in india breaking out in a muck sweat at the thought of his first gobblewallah now he had three stripes on his arm and belonged to pea force a dodgy action column which worked in liaison with the piratical dutchman turk eastermann tertis was a freckled man with wiry hair he had supplemented his uniform with brown yankee ankleboots a band of yellow chiffon round his bushhat in place of a pugharee and dutch flashes on his shoulder all highly contra regulations of course at his waist dangled a big gurkha kukri he really fancied himself these days did tertis he slapped me on the shoulder and walked along with his hand still resting there weve got a right bloke in clink today a bugger called luat a captain in the tri the tri was the indonesian republican army i dont want to know jackie tertis cackled do you know what he was saying in his bloody krab english he was appealing to the atlantic charter that churchill and roosevelt invented back in or some time we told him that the atlantic charter had nothing to do with black bastards like him he pointed out some blood drying on the leg of his uniform i was practising my golf on him very good shots with a mashieniblick more cackling and there was a cow and another bloke we halfdrowned him in one of those dutch baththings i mean really wwrrrrr he bobbed up with the water streaming off him all purple in the face then down you bastard down drown drown he went through the motions as he spoke laughing and halfchoking once tertis had been known as babyface since then his little pudgy cheeks had grown heavy and foxy red its torture it should be bloody fucking stopped he gave me a sneering look well just you fucking try to stop

derision and vomit as if he could not bear his own secret feelings youre sick you bastard i dont want to hear i got away from him and walked rapidly ahead towards my billet youd love it too once you fucking well tried it he called out that flat laugh again wrrrrrr drown em rape em hole in one thank god he wasnt in my billet i slammed the door behind me and went upstairs the terrible thing was that i knew the violence in my own nature i believed in part as he boasted that i might love it if i tried it it was almost getting dark up in my room ida lupinos smile was just a blur i left the light off so that the windows could remain open without too much wildlife bursting in i stripped down bollocknaked from my billet i could see tertiss torture house in the distance or part of it at least glimpsed between other houses indonesians were beaten up there regularly no one said anything a perverted part of me always wanted to watch it wasnt every day you got the chance to see some poor naked sod bashed to death with golf clubs in his cups jackie tertis loved to talk about it many of the sergeants claimed he was making it all up that was their defence i stomped into the shower and leaned against the slate wall cold water descended like nutmeggraters upon my prickly heat when i got to the sergeants mess for a bite to eat there was tertis boozing and holding forth his face dark charlie meadows pitched into him others put their oar in from time to time but nothing stopped tertis he had a long story about a young malayan girl and two men who had been caught in an ambush the previous evening one of them the luat he had mentioned to me earlier he was very excited and drinking heavily i tried not to listen as i attacked my soup we questioned the girl all morning he said she was guilty all right confused in her answers we stripped her off and tied her to the table with her legs open wwrrrrr fought like a tiger she did we tore every strip of clothes off of her and then raped her all four of us and then we mashed her tits and head in with golf clubs wwrrrrr he coughed and laughed striking at the air before him johnny mercer gave his high nervous laugh then looked down at his plate youre a criminal tertis a thug said ferguson the scots colour sergeant the goc ought to know whats going on at yon eastermanns place i willne drink in the same room wi you he set down his glass angrily and got up tertis rose too forget it jock thats the sort of treatment these people expect dont forget theyve been under jap rule all these years aye well were not japs thank the living christ and your talk turns my stomach treating the other sex so shameful tertis began to show flecks of spittle on his lips you bloody hypocrite jock wasnt it you telling us how youd had a kneetrembler with some bloody malayan cow in singapore up against the fucking walls of the cathedral wheres the fucking difference all the fucking difference said ferguson he turned to dickie payne who as usual sat there saying nothing sipping on a beer rsm how come you tolerate such filth in our mess dickie made a slurred but expansive gesture jackie could be right at that murdering buggers ach thats no the issue said jock he marched out of the mess slamming the door behind him youve got to civilise them somehow said wally scubber it was his sole contribution to the discussion in the silence that followed charlie meadows motioned to tertis lets have no more of this kind of talk sit down and keep your trap shut you talk as if youd gone over the top dont bloody lecture me tertis said he lurched to the bar sticking his tumbler out to the mess orderly while it was being filled with indian scotch he said over his shoulder youre all a lot of old women thats what face facts like a pack of fishwives hiding behind your mothers aprons waiting for saturday believe me up your pipe them two blokes were in possession of jap machinepistols luat a captain in the tri thats not bullshit you know

you up with knives malum thats what the malays do chop you up what were we supposed to do catch em let em go like it was some fucking kid game butterscotch marbles he paused to stare at us dickie muttered they do chop you up run amok everything the remark triggered tertis off again you chicken bastards look at your fucking faces report me to the goc he said you think the old general doesnt

over spew piss on your frock i left him to it mercer barged out of the mess with me we charged into the open air so fast that we nearly fell over the cesspit now covered with loose planks he should be sent home he needs a trick cyclist remember him in kanchapur back in india i said he was the baby of the platoon fear of death versus deathwish pulling him apart the way he drives around on that bike of his the indonesians will pick him off one day one sniper thats all it needs he drove out to belawan on wednesday all on his jack jones just for the hell of it bloody madman coming down the rapwi i

day lets walk well cool off lets do that ill hitch a lift back just let me grab a couple of things i have for margey he was standing smoking a cigar by the gate keeping the mosquitoes off when i returned he said immediately as if it was a sentence he had been rehearsing i think we should let the mutiny issue drop if jhamboo wants it that way why do you say that jhamboos only a bloody wog he laughed it was his usual meaningless noise work it out for yourself horry to use tertiss phrase were sitting on a powderkeg here if the tri found out what tertis and that bloody mob was up to they would attack here with the mess as target no were way under strength blokes leaving no reinforcements coming out from alfsea or the blight if we raise a stink about mutiny all of o section would have to be shipped to changi for trial and imprisonment leaving us even more vulnerable as i thought that over i lit one of my cigars you realise that that sort of argument leads to the collapse of the army and the discipline on which its built it was fucking mutiny aided and abetted by corporal steve bloody kyle johnny looked askance at me youre a vindictive bastard at times mate what do you care about army discipline you just have it in for steve kyle hes not a bad bloke it wasnt mutiny the lads were all stoned on cheap carioca last night they just felt unable to get up okay lets walk although i saw there was sense in what he said i would not tell him what jhamboo had told me and a sort of delicacy in johnny made him refrain from asking with my package for margey under my arm we strolled past the mp post and along the serdenweg bats were wheeling above the lamppost making stuka raids on the insect population in orbit there it was a wonderful evening blossoming trees overhung the road soon this evening and the others like it would be mere ghosts we walked in silence until johnny said this dutch pusher im going out with was telling me that the local branch of the tri has us all marked all the british officers and ncos a dossier on each of us frightening thought isnt it better wind up in a dossier than on a slab more silence but i had to say it some time johnny you know i really am sweet on margey thats why i need to speak to boyer would you think i was fucking puggle if i went ahead and married her at length he said theres a book in our billet you ought to read by joseph conrad about a white man marrying a native girl i read it but margeys not a savage shes a chinese horry old pal dont do it dont think about it just have a good time while you can youd rot stuck in a place like this i meant take her back to the blight he cast a glance at me her face wouldnt fit would it what would your ma do if you turned up at home with a yellow girl on your arm i know what mine would do what would the kids be like well theyd be bloody smashing you know how cute chinese kids are besides margey isnt yellow shes paler than i am he sighed the longer youre out here the whiter they get you think shes just a whore dont you lets put it this way horry old mate in the long run its just as well you didnt manage to locate boyer we got to town and strolled into the restaurant on the corner of maggalaan and bootha street the big fat smiling chinese who ran the place appeared addressing me as missa stubbs we ordered beers and five eggs and chips each i planned to take margey out to eat later but i was hungry now a trader came in from the street and sold us some black market yankee chesterfields we lit up and looked round at the talent it was an allmale allnative clientele except for three women sitting at a table in an area to the back of the shop which was screened off one of the women i recognised as margeys old enemy katie chae we were clearing our plates when i found miss chae standing beside me miss chae certainly was dishy she wore the traditional dress of chinese women tunic and trousers they were of a light blue and white striped material where margey was plump miss chae was slender though the dress nicely revealed the bulge of bum and breasts her face held those thrilling oriental planes which recall works of art it had nothing of margeys kittenish look miss chaes face was long and elegant with a look about it this was my impression which could be interpreted by a westerner as either serenely calm and benign or cruel to a marked degree it was a dark face with eyes very large and dark the lips of miss chae were finely chiselled full and expressive though it would be necessary to know the lady better to find out what it was they actually expressed she said to me familiarly have you god a briddish cigarette for an ol fren horry although her powers of expression were good her accent was more currupt than margeys as if she had learnt all her english off a couple of drunken dutch longshoremen a none too remote possibility i gave her a chesterfield and struck a match for her johnny and i exchanged winks as she lit up bending over my hand to steady the light breathing vapour trails through her delicate nostrils she also managed to rub a tit against my arm may i siddown wit you horry wont you innerduce me your fren oh johnny this is miss katie chae shes a friend and miss chae this is johnny mercer hes a friend of mine despite the friend business we had only spoken once because of margeys jealousy but in medan one saw people around and about they exchanged greetings i could tell johnny was interested you are from lonnon johnny miss chae asked him leaning forward im a cockney but my homes in swindon thats in wiltshire too bad she looked at him under her dark lashes and then leaned back in her chair blowing out smoke like the very picture of relaxation turning towards me and pointing the cigarette she said as if hardly asking a question at all wheres rosey toni you mean margey miss chae sipped at her cigarette some time she rosey some time she margey diffent trade mark same goods she flashed beautiful teeth at me as if unaware of the havoc her remark caused johnny scraped his chair back and stood up calling for the bill i better get on up the rapwi theyve got a dance on tonight and all the birds will be booked if i dont hurry why dont you come too i was still not looking at miss chae see you tomorrow johnny youre a big boy now just remember the old powderkeg night miss chae he tipped the boss of the caf and went out into the street my companion looked after him with disdain your fren he like orang blanda girl yes yes yes i tink he not wait buy miss chae drink orang blanda girl legs very fat india girls legs very thin only china and malay girl legs very pretty yes you buy me drink horry i must go some other evening id love to saying no played hell with the respiratory system the effect of having that countenance with its lustrous eyes turned upon you was compelling her conversation was a series of small raids on ones privacy you been sumatra long time horry when i speak malay apa mengerti i know that orang blanda means the dutch all people hate orang blanda no want come back orang ingris diffent ingris men nice i like when i say saya kaseh angkau can you unerstan what i say what she was saying was i love you margey had taught me that feeling my cheeks redden i rose from my chair smiling down at her youre telling me that its time i went as i put some money down on the table and left she called see you big boy the quote to end all quotes from all the hollywood flicks of the thirties as i strolled along to margeys place other terrible phrases of miss chaes came back some time she rosey some time she margey diffent trade mark same goods misery the soldiers from amboina were sitting on the doorsteps and window sills of their barracks singing to their girlfriends songs of pacific beaches moonlit nights love for ever fornications past fornications to come and fornications in progress caressing the taut sinews of their guitars as they did so among all the delectable smells of hitherto unknown cuisines lay the insidious gong of drains but it meant only that some gourmet family had just opened a duryan that delicious fruit whose stink can anaesthetise an entire street when the wind is right ah nights of medan at least i had sense enough to relish your mixed pleasures at the time margeys humble home was crowded several old men and women their faces brown and wrinkled like apples stored too long moved silently about the room the men were dressed in blue suits the women in black one by one they went behind the old screen to pay their respects to auntie from auntie came only an occasional moan the curative flying lizard had not done its stuff in order to accommodate the visitors the table had been pushed to one side under the stairs there sat fat in his usual posture a cigarette balanced in his mouth with him were two men one of the brown unidentifiable ones and the scholarly tiger balm spectacles gleaming he and fat nodded politely to me of margey there was no sign according to my watches it was about nine oclock give or take twenty minutes i set down on the table the presents i had brought for margey a jar of chivers marmalade a tin of portuguese sardines two bars of palmolive a tub of indian made andrews liver salts and some envelopes as fat seized upon these items and examined them with policeforce thoroughness tiger balm said affably and are the british still preparing for withdrawal thats up to soekarno to decide my sarcasm was lost on him he merely asked taking another whiff of his cigarette is that the official british attitude now you allow people to have what they want we read in the papers that london lets marshal tito take over jugoslavia poor king peter who was your wartime ally is left out in the cold that this intellectual chinaman should know so much about things that were going on in europe it was none of his business i came to talk to rosey to margey where is she old auntie sick tida bagoose said fat margey look see auntie but in a moment margey appeared smiling and took my hand i put an arm round her squeezing her waist second house of the cinema in half an hour i said they all kissed the bride joan crawford had you forgotten she laughed in genuine amusement i forget cinema with you horry course margey no forget first i nurse poor old auntie a little then we go after that we eat and have fun yes she smiled her lovely smile and you bring me more present you naughty boy now what this time fat yielded up the shopping item by item retrieving each after she had looked at it her slender arms went round my neck why you so kind to me horry poor margey no good for you you very good for margey not a foreign devil rapist soldier any longer eh youre gorgeous margey get a bloody moveon will you or well miss the best seats maybe i give some andrews liver salt to poor old auntie she very ill then we go upstairs for very quick time before pictures okay you like it my god horry i will absolutely drag your trousers down and i will make you come your orgasm in fastest rate ever so be warn after the film the hordes poured out along the safely lighted thoroughfares but margey led me down various unlit and unsavoury alleyways to an area of the town which had only recently been declared safe following the eradication of a nest of extremists this was the busiest time of day with trade brisk and amazing smells of cooking fighting with music in the air not a hint of trouble about though it needed only one pistol shot for the streets to clear instantly i had seen it happen margey trotted along happily at my side this restaurant nice pleasant prace once was a consulate building you know now british have made a deal with soekarno you not get shot at any more times i agreed that this was a good thing when british troops go away then begins more shooting and much trouble for all china people right now indonesians have your people to worry about when you gone then they worry about our people i think somethings worrying me do you ever call yourself rosey we walked several paces before she said in a tiny voice why you ask such thing answer the question i margey okay that my name ever since i go university english names very smart and fashionable who this rosey what you mean to say i no like all so many questions i listened to her working herself up and would not reply the restaurant was a twostorey concrete structure built on stilts overlooking the river its name was the bunga rampaian its faade was scarred by machinegun fire as we entered the sight of customers and the prospect of a meal made margey chirpy again she knew the boss with wide smiles we were shown to a table fragrant odours filled the air it would be strange when first the british then the dutch withdrew but surely the prophets of doom would be wrong and the political takeover prove peaceful here if not in java probably i could get a bank job the indonesian republic would need banks if only i could get in touch with bloody boyer while i fantasised margey conferred with the waiter they have very tasty good sea fish served with ginger also sweet green bean soup how you like that darling sounds great bring it on as we lit cigarettes and smiled at each other a fivepiece band began to assemble on a tiny platform they started up with terang boelan as our fish arrived customers applauded the tune with rapture with my knowledge of banking i could rise to manager ah at the time at the time it appeared that the future was simple if only i made up my mind i did not grasp the fact that i was up against the futility of human relationships international affairs met with little understanding in those days to the crowds who danced in london and other great cities on ve day celebrating the death of fascism evil appeared vanquished they lit their bonfires and exchanged their kisses under the impression that the worlds reserves of hatred were exhausted in the east matters appeared in truer perspective ve day itself was the occasion for a tenminute break for a smoke while we got on with the task of dislodging every japanese installed in thousands of islands and territories which stretched from tokyo to the very gates of india after the japanese surrender their will to fight smashed by the abomb insurrections sprang up on every side in the territories they had freed from white rule no country went back into the box from which the nipponese tide had spilled it new breeds of angry men arose running to new barricades waving new banners many leaders like soekarno rode to power on the backs of nippon in the east the one peace ignited a dozen wars even in medan timehonoured fuses of economic interest of race of faith of colour were spluttering away we kept our weapons clean dry and slightly oiled and listened to terang boelan while we wolfed down the fish margey extracted from me the fact that i had spoken to katie chae only when i swore that she was the ugliest chinese girl i had ever seen did margey relax miss chae is no pure china girl she said that is why she so ugly like you say and so dark skin i hear her father is a very bad man who ran away to penang after a bank robbery he is half mongolian man whats the other half i tell you horry her father one half chinese one half tibet one half mongolian maybe another half negro i dont know she burst out laughing covering her mouth politely that makes two of her miss chae girl of many values i not bore you with description of her quarters she roared with laughter again sobering to say she come from tibet not so nice place as tsingtao where you get this rosey nonsense one day how i wish to take you see tsingtao and the shantung peninsula the people are all good and the landscape so pretty she sighed now for the present i must go home and nurse poor auntie a little more i do not remember asking what was the matter with auntie she was old and old people had a habit of falling ill dont go yet margey your place is full of people who can look after auntie she laughed contemptuously and waved her fingers they no capable they poor fish except daisy and daisy work too much hard auntie need me she rose giving me a smile i saw the enduring woman i admired who went about her daily business the shopping the cleaning the tending however thoroughly the world fell apart round her as we left the restaurant a knot of foreigners dutch were pushing their way forward talking in loud voices orang blanda said margey in lowvoiced contempt as she spoke i spotted johnny mercer in the group a tall blonde girl real officerfodder had her arm entwined with his he did not see me i made no sign allowing margey to lead me through the dark alleys i gave her a goodnight kiss at her door and left her to do her stuff with auntie an hour or so before curfew i took a stroll up the kesawan where shops were still open pleasant daydreams filled my mind i saw the british leaving the dutch leaving the indonesians allowed to get on with their own business building the place up again trading with singapore and the rest of the world why not the island had coal oil minerals endless timber anything grew in the marvellous climate it could become the richest country on earth this logical development has yet to take place a chill breeze sprang up rain was on the way again moving in across the indian ocean i went into the nearest shop and chatted with the shopowner while malayan music twangled from an ancient radio the old man apologised for the poverty of his stock tomorrow the van heutsz would dock in belawan harbour it would unload goods for his shop including swiss music boxes in cigarette cases which troops would like van heutsz was very fine dutch ship in prewar days he had sailed as far as celebes on that ship it was tranquil to be on the sea and watch day break over the waters the rain dried i returned to the street smoking a big cigar everyone was emerging from shelter i stood on the worn pavement watching a roadsweeper who covered the hole where his nose had been with a leaf secured in place by a matchstick pushed into the matter beneath it was hard to decide whether his trouble was syphilis or leprosy then i saw captain boyer farther down the street he had a dutch woman in tow impeding each other in so doing they were climbing into the back seat of a rusty old car they had emerged from a wine shop in token of which the officer was clutching a bottle i paused a yard or so away and called boyers name he did not look round he and the woman had stuck in the door of the vehicle all i could see of him was a leg a backside and an arm holding the bottle frenziedly by the neck like a cripple trying to strangle a cat then the rest of him backed out the woman fell inside screaming resignedly and he began to swear at her was it boyer i tapped him on the back as he prepared for another assault on the car his reaction time was slow he began to look round only as he heaved himself into the back seat so that he caught the peak of his hat and knocked it flying into the dark interior cuddling the bottle he glared out at me who are you wheres my drink give me my cap back the light was so bad that i still could not see his face properly sarnt stubbs sir nd mendips his face protruded slowly out of the door rather like paste oozing from a tube the woman beat feebly on his back under the impression that this would pull him back into the vehicle his face was bevelled so as to climax in a nobly aquiline nose all adjacent features were subordinate to his nose with the possible exception of his eyebrows which emphasised it as acanthus leaves emphasise the height of a corinthian column the eyebrow motif was echoed in his small black moustache which hung sketchily above his lips stubbs these lips muttered blankly sah i grinned it was captain maurice boyer nd royal mendips so it blithering well is like the passing of a rainstorm out to the straits of malacca blankness faded from his face replaced by a sort of idiot joy he had recognised me he was insanely glad it might have been his old mother standing there laboriously he heaved himself out of the car on to the pavement once on his feet he slapped my back in the area where prickly heat was at its most gregarious and tried to force me into the black cavern of the car where unknown and carnivorous womanhood awaited me i hung back breathing cigar smoke into his face he coughed and breathed booze into mine coughing in my turn i said can i speak to you sir personal and urgent course you can speak to me stubbs good to see you man always liked you burma days kohima the dcs tennis court what a nightmare climb into this chariot with me and my light o love come and have a drinkies with us in you go dont know anyone else in all flaming medan he encouraged me forward as i bent to climb in the woman was screaming from the back seat in a dutch accent theres no rewm for any man more in this fewking automobile move over you difficult bitch snarled boyer plunging in and trampling his cap underfoot he pulled me after him i followed just behind the bottle as i gulped the foetid air inside the car i could distinguish sweat cheap perfume sick and another aroma which i disliked boyer fell across me and slammed the door shut the unseen woman fell across him so that i got frowsy blonde locks in my face they both screamed with what could have been laughter and the driver started the car i began to laugh too id dropped my cigar boyer seized the woman with professional ease not a difficult feat considering that she was taking no evasive action and began to talk to her and me at the same time mens welfare my dear dont grumble drinkies ahoy good old signaller stubbs now sergeant welldeserved one of the best lads in the regiment both under fire together fire fire not fire only smewk she said fanning at the nauseating clouds which were drifting about as we gathered speed i had ignited the floor mat i was fumbling at their feet for the cigar butt pretending to be drunk in case boyer suspected me of feeling the womans legs dear god the privations never forget it drive on driver damn you faster faster drinkies ahoy need a pee cough cough cough whatre you doing here anyway stubbs whats the name of that restaurant my dear christ i need a pee step on it driver damn you we soon found ourselves at the bunga rampaian where i had eaten with margey scarcely an hour earlier we tumbled out of the car amid clouds of billowing smoke the upholstery was inarguably on fire though it had not enough strength given the humidity of the night to burst into flame boyer uttered the cry of one bringing forth young and relieved himself against the concrete stilts of the building like his cap his bottle of drink lay forgotten in the car staggering up the restaurant steps behind boyer i found myself next to his dutch light o love her name was raddle or so i received it from boyer she was fat yet withered two undesirable attributes infrequently found together her hair was blonde and curled wherever possible her ample trunk was encased in a dress of navy blue which shone like the seat of old trousers the looks she gave me were either of animosity or amorousness both possibilities scared me three margeys could have found refuge in her blue dress inside the restaurant the fivepiece band was in full charge none of your native muck at this time of night gone was terang boelan instead we had genuine airs from european operettas all the worlds in love with love and i love you the music appeared to upset boyer who twirled about a bit in the entrance knocking over some flowers raddle skipped forward and grabbed his arm saying attempt not to lewk so fewking drunk you twirp her english was very fluent up came the manager who knew margey he did not recognise me waving his hands he announced that no more food could be served because of the imminence of curfew it was the fastest bit of characterreading i had seen in a while bring me a bottle of whisky then said boyer immediately or ill have your restaurant closed down for good sairtainly sair and maybe i bring you some nice kebabs sair for you and the lady and gentleman having shown himself so responsive to threats the manager led us to a table by a window overlooking the river boyer waved expansively threading his way between tables and leaving raddle to take her chance being corpulent she had to make many a detour among the diners grab yourself a seat stubbs drinkies ahoy sir id be glad to have a word with you if you can spare me just a moment i didnt ought to sit down at the table with you sir he hammered on the table with his fist damn it man take a seat i said havent seen you for months whats the matter with you i stood at attention to remind him of his position in society regulations sir nco and officer sir no familiarity no offence sir he made such a violent gesture of contempt that he swept a sauce pot into raddles lap just as she was sitting down unable to find lodgement on that convex surface it fell to the floor and rolled under an adjacent table to the devil with regulations stubbs im giving you an order sit yourself down still i hesitated to be truthful there was a gob of sauce on the vacant chair but the woman who was fairly well oiled herself said in a high voice sergeant unless you are a complete fewl will you sit in that fewking chair and keep this drunken horses arse in quietness i sat a waiter presented himself carrying a bottle of whisky three glasses a small flower in a small vase and a plate of steaming kebabs with chunks of pineapple and mangusteen nestling between chunks of skewered meat covered in a hot sauce uttering shrieks of various magnitudes we forgot our similarities and tucked in from where i sat i could observe johnny mercer his bird and the rest of the dutch contingent gathered round a corner table mercer was signalling frantically at me through a haze of tobacco smoke one by one the rest of his party joined in the gesticulation pointing shaking heads and behaving so wildly that i began to suspect they had detected a bomb under my seat i looked there wasnt they shook their heads and renewed their pointing i shook my head in return gestured questioningly at myself nodding from them blank looks from me i turned to see boyer staring nonplussed at my performance are you pissed old chap he enquired pointing his kebab accusingly sir excuse me i got up and forced my way over to mercers table ignoring the protests of other diners on the way his rabble gave a cheer as i approached just to look at them made you feel slightly drunk six empty wine bottles stood or leaned on the table what are you on about you nutter johnny leaned heavily on the shoulders of the girl next to him forcing her breasts down into a bowl of prawns and waved four flabby fingers at me here stubbsy mazing coincidence you were looking all over for him werent you boyer you fool its boyer boyer sitting at your table jesus i looked down at him in pity pissed again mercer i came in here with him didnt i i tottered back to boyers table and took a steadying draught of whisky an involuntary convulsion seized my digestive tract grasping the bottle and my throat i stared at the blurred print on the label black tartan wombat wiskey made in scottland bottled by p v ramakrishnan bottling mart kuala lumpur good stuff said boyer better than that piss we had in the car drink up cheers salamat datang i thought you were in padang sir i said shuddering at the dire things happening inside me as the wiskey deployed its forces raddle had finished painting her lips and studying the effect in a small mirror now she decided to take some part in the conversation we flew from padang via the raf this morning stewbs did you really raddle maurice kindly accompanied me since i was scared to flew i sail for the netherlands via rapwi on the ship van heutsz tomorrow goodbye to sumatra after four ghastly years tonight we celebrate stewbs medans a step nearer civilisation cheers to the van heutsz she raised her glass high before drinking the van heutsz was a fourandahalfthousandtoo symbol of hope to any nonmilitary personnel wishing to escape from sumatra just to be allowed aboard that ancient vessel to become one of its crowded deck passengers was to savour the redemptive quality of a new life raddles eyes shone at the prospect golly shes lovely stubbs isnt she said boyer looking from one to the other of us as if trying to decide which was which be honest you can be honest isnt she lovely poignant too a fine woman dutch as they come maastrich born he shook his head i want to marry her but shes married already she was raped by the japs of course he laughed and belted into the black tartan wombat thats life talking of marriage sir i wanted to ask you something personally raddle screamed this whiskys mewk oooh stewbs that fewking aeroplane from padang my gosh what bumping we had i was so terribly sick you know she gestured to make the scene more vivid to me clutching her throat to illustrate sick over my seat sick over the flewer sick over my frock sick over my handbag sick over maurice terrible you were a bit icky darling boyer said gallantly per ardua ad nauseam he laughed and sweated a bit more splashing more black tartan wombat into our glasses theres a certain chinese girl sir i cant wait to get on the van heutsz tomorrow itll be the end of four years bad lewk for me say youll miss me darling say youll miss your maurice she started screaming in a confidential manner i just want to get back to the netherlands to my fewking home in harlingen its been snewing hard there this winter snew snew holy virgin snew and home cewking fresh tampax as this conversation developed the restaurant was closing the last of the diners all fairly tight were being bundled towards the door johnny and his bird went out with the tide the band offered a final selection from the merry widow during which boyer sang with ragged vehemence though you sweat though you shave they forget what you gave and crept off home to their terrible bamboo beds eventually we also were bundled off the premises with raddle practically in midscream hymning her homeland immediately we were outside all restaurant lights were switched off a wall of dark descended cries of protest sounded all round as the last of the revellers floundered about in search of vehicles looking at the situation in cold blood our vehicle was simple to detect since a cloud of unpleasant smoke drifted from it we had but to follow our noses to be home and dry unfortunately an inner compulsion made us move with undersea sloth bumping into palm trees as we went black tartan wombat is in one respect at least superior to any other wiskeys made in scottland it can ferret through the stomach lining up the jugular vein and into the cerebral hemispheres like a fit of greased lightning destroying anything it meets a suspicion came to me through the murky liquid that boyer having survived his aerial ordeal by vomit was so far sunk in love of the fair raddle that he would probably smuggle himself aboard the van heutsz with her on the morrow it was essential he give me permission to marry margey before he disappeared as this thought percolated i became very crafty winking and nodding to myself in the dark bumping into him accidentallyonpurpose i grabbed boyers tunic and would not let go he in turn seized a nearby chunk of raddles anatomy and she led us to the car the driver materialised he shone a torch he was japanese he wore the uniform of a jap officer from which the insignia of rank had been removed although he retained his revolver this struck me as immensely ironic i began to laugh uproariously the jap pushed me into the back seat heaving raddle and boyer after me in quick succession it was fumey in the car the back seat consisted of springs and hot patches i choked and laughed mistaking chuckling for cadging noises boyer passed me the wiskey bottle saying you arent going to miss your poor old maurice you cow strue every word of it though you sweat though you shave he began to sing into my ear not wisely but too well sir sir i want to talk privately to you about a chinese girl i said as we drove through the narrow streets boyer took no notice dont speak to him stewbs hes drunken jewst give me a cuddle in the confined space it was rather easier to cuddle raddle than not i put my arm as far round her waist as it would go which was somewhat less than halfway she was fun i thought and really not badlooking her hair was pretty and curly she was very animated her accent was attractive as she moved my hand to her breast boyer cut off the supply of lehar to announce i could tell you something about chinese girls stubbs believe me theyve got no blithering passion no passion at all you think so sir no blithering passion utterly submissive brought up since birth to be utterly submissive its an akkis an accident of history the sayings of confucius analects i believe they are really analects stubbs sir why in china proper where the feet of the women are still bound oh shewt up about the blewdy orientals cant you maurice mmm i like it more what do you know about it really oh yes more of that harder ive had my teeth full of orientals oh ooh you brewt ah darling what im saying im only saying the women have no passion no response christ this cars abnormally smoky they just lie there flat as a pancake no interest no initiative analects not like you darling where are we medan sir i know were in bloody medan the world beyond the car was a world away i was vaguely conscious of darkness trees a glimpse of sky and lanterns burning in huts of kampongs raddle pressed against me on one side boyer on the other and we sipped at the black tartan wombat in turns as my free hand slid up her skirt boyer and i began to sing unpremeditatedly as one i love a lassie a bonny black madrasi shes as black as the fucking ace of spades we collapsed into giggles silence fell i was there her lips clamped themselves to mine we sped on through the thick night as if the driver intended taking us back to tokyo and was not stopping till he hit the ginza my hand was trapped deep in raddles oleaginous organ which felt endless boyer dropped into a slumber on my shoulder existence struck me as extremely comical if smokefilled something tells me i cant stop feeling your vagina i murmured indistinctly raddle removed her tongue from my mouth in order to remark maurice i think im going to be sick again pulling my hand away with a mighty slurp i grabbed boyer and shook him in fear maurice maurice sir for fucks sake wake up shes going to pewk again he started laughing stupidly saying in a scots accent aye weel she was aye a passionate wee woman fortunately at that moment a green wire double gate materialised in the dark before our bonnet we stopped with a tremendous jerk raddle was ejected out of the side door a parabola of vomit springing from her lips to disappear beyond human ken into the equatorial night i think ill have a pee said boyer but remember what i say about the analects bloody stupid word when you come to think i jumped out and had a pee too only in the middle of it did i take in the scene we had arrived smoking at a dutch enclave entirely surrounded by a high wire perimeter on the other side of the gate was a guardhouse complete with businesslike guard with rifles and searchlights both rifles and searchlights were turned on us and our various bodily fluids an electric generator hummed in the background adding to the general obscene noises of the jungle close at hand when raddle had recovered sufficiently from her gargantuan vomiting operation to start swearing at the guard in dutch the gate was opened and we drove in surrounded by our private smokescreen the realisation struck me that we must be some way out of town to my saturated senses it appeared strange that there were bungalows here with bright lights burning and music playing on verandahs and people dancing both indoors and under the trees such gaiety was paradoxical after the ride through darkness as if one went back in a timemachine through the jurassic and arrived at las vegas the car stopped right in the middle of the revels we tumbled out coughing a band was playing a mans voice bawled it brings back a night of tropical splendour it brings back a memory and then we were submerged in laughing faces which shone in the dark huge dutchmen all six foot seven pressed amsterdam beer and sausages into our hands a barbecue party was in progress figures ran insanely among low trees someone i recognised he waved oh yes that chap sontrop i flung him a salute and nearly fell over boyer and raddle started dancing to the music entrusting what was left of the black tartan wombat to me i sat down at a trestle table and lit a cigar fighting off dizziness people were talking to me but i took no notice some while later sontrop came up with a friend although he carried a can of beer he spoke with his usual sober courtesy its pleasant to see you here horatio the dutch are always delighted when their allies the british are personally friendly this is my friend hendrick hendrick nieuwenhuis may we enquire what you do here so late and so far from home hendrick bowed to me smiling politely i gestured with the cigar you see its simple really i mean lifes only complex on the surface because underneath its well its a lot more complicated but we wont go into that but i want to marry rosey i mean margey i want to marry margey what else was said escapes me i was trying to puzzle out why i felt unable to rise from the bench i ate five sausages for their medicinal value the conversation perhaps went on for some hours the next bit i remember was hendrick saying we are planning a little crocodileshoot tomorrow perhaps you will care to come with us dont know how to shoot crocodiles dont be silly its just like shooting people we give you a carbine your revolver is no good for crocodileshooting okay thanks fun id like to bring margey along hey ernst you taking a girl with you sontrop looked at me and said without anything you could call a change of expression i am a practising homosexual i did not know what to say to that practice makes perfect i said with a violent crash captain boyer landed almost at my feet i went on hands and knees bending over him trying to listen to his heartbeat his shirt was wet with sweat ernst and raddle pulled me up i still had the bottle hes not dead you fewl stewbbs she said to me looking redeyed only deaddrunk so much for the fewking analects help me get him to bed if its all the same to you with a certain amount of aid from sontrop mainly of an advisory kind raddle and i heaved boyer into a nearby bungalow he came round sufficiently to make declarations of love and sing in a phlegmy voice as the three of us tottered into a rear bedroom the room contained little more than a wooden double bed the statutory mosquitonet and a bare lamp bulb which glared down on the scene making the eyes ache boyer lay back and opened his eyes full of innocence they seemed to look for protection from the bastion of his nose he started to take his trousers off ill leave you two now i said goodnight sir sleep well bon voyage raddle tomorrow wait outside she said urgently as i passed her sontrop went out i went out and slammed the door it was dark in the hall i leaned against the door drawing on my cigar trying to gather my wits from their various points of dispersal they told me that i was stuck in this parody of a concentration camp for the night that most of the dutch here were in festive mood because they were leaving on the van heutsz on the morrow and that if i was not careful i would get a lot more of raddle than a fistful of pubic hair and labia through the flimsy door i heard her trying to rouse boyer come on you bastard darling never mind the words show the action oh raddle darling darling raddle you know i love you devotedly but i cant i just cant too much alcohol putteth off from the performance drown my sorrows if its our last night dont mewk about then lewk lewk i strip off rouse yourself observe my figure fewk you oh lovely let me feel oh raddle how ill live without you pounding sucking noises as of two goldfish colliding in anger rise up you blewdy tiddler oh oh too far gone black wombat oh you sod you british sod you fewking drunkard sod from roehampton how you like if i go and get your hulking great sergeant stewbbs to make love by me if you are incapable no no darling my precious listen stubbs good man good chap in burma you werent in burma blithering nightmare stubbs doesnt love you he muttered something about chink girls to which raddle replied impatiently and jumped off the bed i moved another door led off the cramped hall i opened it and slipped in fast deep breathing someone was asleep close by my right elbow a person not a cobra thank god cobras dont grunt as they exhale darkness i began to cough and had to smother my mouth with my hand the fingers and thumb smelt strongly of something semidelectable peering back through the door which i held ajar i saw boyers door flung open with a crash raddle emerged her face black with frustration the navy blue dress was open all the way down to reveal secrets of nature at their most titanic ida lupino would never have appeared in such a state as raddle moved from the room at a canny trot she seized some of the wiring which ran down the wall to the light switch and pulled hard the wiring came away in her hand bringing the overhead bulb down with it the light sparked and went out she charged along the hall scattering wires and disappeared into the clamorous night for all the world like a bull leaving a china shop after having tasted porcelain for the first time in its life instinct suggested that raddle would not be back leaving the heavy sleeper to continue his act still thoughtfully sniffing my hand i tiptoed into the other room woozy sleeping noises emerged from boyers huddled shape i climbed on the bed beside him my boots to his face i pillowed my arms beneath my head shut my ears to the racket outside and was enclosed by a suffocating sleep in which cars planes and towns burned down all round as the years of the war continue to float downstream releasing themselves from memory into history it becomes increasingly easy to sentimentalise them the antidote is to recall one marked aspect of war years everywhere how often one was awakened from deep sleep by someone shouting or someone shaking or by a combination of the two whoever was shaking me was not shouting his silence was compensated for by sheer rudimentary vigour i might have been a coconut palm in the grip of a starving neanderthal groaning i sat up and was motioned to keep quiet i did not know where i was or what time it was both my watches had stopped it was still dark or barely light and i could not recognise the man who stood over me now that i was awake he released me bending to whisper in my ear coffee two minute he perorated and crept out of the door i instantly lay down to sleep again the swine had the wrong man then a perfume caught my senses i opened one eye a womans head lay close by mine with a certain sense of dja vu i heaved myself up again and this time came more fully awake orientation returned i was on captain boyers wooden bed he was there and the woman raddle was with him they were both tucked inside the mosquitonet i was outside the net they had changed ends either out of respect for my feelings or because they could not stand the smell of my feet gingerly i climbed off the bed it was obvious that some wellintentioned dutchman was going to take me back to my billet in djalan sennal road staggering to the window scratching and yawning sickly i stared out at the tropical world beyond the great light was about to bound into the sky terrible things were already mating or feeding in the branches of trees celebrating the fact in querulous voices apart from the bed the room was unfurnished in one corner under the window a metal trunk stood on its end on top of it were a pink china figurine of a woman dancing a cracked handmirror a lipstick and a pink comb with some teeth missing i stared at them for a long time whilst trying to get my lungs back into operation as i used the comb my mind chugged into action along a branch line i was looking at all the possessions that raddle had acquired or managed to hold on to in the last four years today was saturday the day she sailed for the netherlands and a new start in life i went to have a good look at the pair of them raddle and boyer sweating together under the net they were lying face to face breathing into each others open mouths boyer was halfdressed raddle had everything off she looked as defenceless as a rather mountainous old dog i thought well of her pissed though she was maddening though boyer had been she had gone back to him just for the last time what a fewking world faithfulness hopefulness and charitableness and the greatest of these was faithfulness if you could possibly manage it as i rammed my bushhat on and tiptoed for the door a calendar caught my eye write boyer a note must speak to him before he flies back to padang well remembered stubbs marry margey get her to hell out of this equatorial hellhole i took the calendar off the wall got a pencil from my pocket and scrawled him a few lines politely thanking him for a pleasant evening wishing his light o love a pleasant voyage on the van heutsz and asking to meet him at the company office at fifteen hundred hours it was a miracle of composition all things considered a microcosm of the world in three sentences the calendar showed a view of the centre of edam with a canal of that blue generally held in reserve for picture postcards of the mediterranean it was designed for the year the world stopped i left it on top of the mosquitonet message downwards and hoped that boyer would not be too hungover to read it the rapwi camp lay embalmed in cool dawn air the trees were absolutely still on a wooden chair a garment lay forsaken the ashes of the barbecue fire were leprous as if someone had been burning snake skins the only movement came from a thin smoke which withered and died among the branches it rose not from the barbecue but from our black car the vehicle stood where we had left it grey cumulonimbus issuing from its gaping windows just looking at the car made me feel worse turning my back on it i stretched experimentally i had been lying on my revolver all night too besotted to move a dead feeling pervaded me not only was i alone and among strangers i hardly knew myself there was a movement at one of the bungalows a figure appeared on a verandah and beckoned when the gesture was complete he still stood there hand in air as i moved slowly in his direction another man came out of the bungalow and stood looking grimly ahead they waited for me side by side they were young and dutch it crossed my mind that i had seen one of them before somewhere but they conformed very much to a pattern being tall fair tanned dressed in jungle greens stern alert when i reached them one said hello again the other shook my hand and said jan de zwaan he gave me a tin mug of coffee letting slip the moment in which i could appropriately have said something in reply i was condemned to silence i drank sweet disgusting liquid seeped through all the furry obstructions in my mouth and throat and coursed down into my stomach the novel and on the whole welcome illusion of being alive overcame me i let out a sly fart which immediately poisoned the air the two grim young men did not twitch a muscle necessity was at work i squeezed out a second fart repressing the guilty smile on my face as i finished the coffee and returned the piyala de zwaan picked up something from behind him and swung it from one finger it was a jap aviators leather cap okay we go he said he and the other man moved forward and i fell in beside them it would be a relief to get back to the billet parked under linden trees was an old battered army truck at a sign from de zwaan the three of us climbed into the cab when the engine started i looked out anxiously expecting everyone to wake in their bungalows and curse us for murdering sleep nothing stirred bumping slowly forward we arrived at the gates a guard came up smartly to let us out and followed us with his red rimmed eyes as we drove through the entrance oh yes i thought this was where raddle threw up bless her and i looked for the place in the grass but the dholes and hyenas would have cleaned it up besides the episode belonged to an earlier stretch of history we moved down the road at a fair rate already day had dawned this was the brief hour of spring natives in wicker hats guided bullockcarts or moved among the fields palms dwarfed their grouped figures over everything lay a faint mist with radiance at work behind it vague in the distance were sumatras high mountains at the next crossroads a figure was awaiting us a carbine slung over his shoulder we stopped he climbed in beside us which made for a crowded cab it was ernst sontrop de zwaan who was driving turned down a narrow carttrack with palm trees on either side we roared up to a bullockcart de zwaan hooted madly and the driver and his wife pulled their creaking contraption over into the ditch to let us by sontrop was talkative hendrick nieuwenhuis and jan de zwaan say that they wish they spoke english a little more but that will not spoil our mornings enjoyment we come in this truck in preference to my car because of the rough nature of the ground this hardly needed explanation we had left the lane and were as far as i could tell driving fast over a herd of dead camels the sun was rising in majesty over the world the mists evaporating close at hand the genuine jungle gleamed dense metallic inviting we hit another track it led us through a burntout village green things were pushing up everywhere through blackened remains a few pigs ran squealing into the bush at our approach not a hut was left standing this was once a batak kampong or village said sontrop nippon burned it all down to the ground a river lay at the end of the village we followed another track which ran beside the river for a while and then led into jungle we stopped we jumped out drink plays terrible tricks only then did i remember the invitation to shoot crocodiles they were not driving me back to the billet they were taking me to piss around shooting crocodiles of all insane netherlandish schemes i began looking round anxiously for cohorts of the indonesian army about to break cover and shoot us up everyone said that the dutch were mad now i knew it the three of them went on methodically behaving as if they were sane and owned the shooting rights of the entire island hendrick nieuwenhuis methodically coiled rope round his body jan de zwaan broke open a wooden chest and issued hendrick me and himself with carbines good he said bang bang he grinned his sudden change of expression made me realise that both he and hendrick if i had them in the right order were probably a year or two younger than i he put the jap aviators helmet on his head buckling it under his chin nieuwenhuis had a parang or native chopping knife with a few expert tops he cut branches off nearby trees and arranged them over the truck so that it was concealed from casual view how long is this expedition going to take i asked ernst just a mornings fun we must return in medan at one oclock then we must make a convoy to drive to belawan so that our dutch people get safely to board the van heutsz this afternoon he nodded affirmatively as he mentioned the fabulous ship on which so many destinies depended we set off in single file through the jungle green things surrounded us tall trees rose everywhere their trunks unpunctuated by any branch until they erupted into foliage their bases were hidden by varied bush each growing thing flourished in its set place according to rank like soldiers in an army from the humble privates beneath our feet to the lofty generals and fieldmarshals far overhead the whole parade formed a gigantic organism of light and shade in the high canopy birds flitted in the undergrowth mousy things scuttled in the space between against the gigantic bars of the tree trunks were draped creepers as thick and hairy as my arm we moved slowly through this rain forest more marvellous than any cathedral as in a cathedral our senses were caught by the paradox of space and enclosure the track twisted where it would and we had to follow it we were in the jungle for twenty minutes i had wound the more reliable of my watches setting it at eight oclock when we left the truck at eighttwenty we emerged by the river again here it was wide and still more like a pool than a stream the far bank rose steeply perhaps a hundred yards from where we stood the pale sterns of the forest were reflected in the tall water some trees had been felled their crowns lying in the water there was nobody about nor was there anyone on our side of the river all was silent under the sun i saw no sign of any crocodile and wondered what it would feel like to shoot one now that my system was functioning again and the last whiskers of black tartan wombat vanquished i recalled hendricks statement of the previous evening its just like shooting people in the clearing some way ahead of us stool a concrete go down near it was a concrete ramp with a jetty which stood out into the dark waters of the river ernst sontrop put two fingers to his mouth and whistled an old brown man in a sarong appeared smoking a cheroot he gave a single gesture hes iwa said sontrop we can trust iwa he works as foreman on my father estates since many years we went forward each of us shook hands with the old man who performed the ceremony awkwardly bowing as he lid so little was said we walked towards the jetty the general air of desolation was emphasised by a small boat which had sunk or had been sunk against the jetty the river was so shallow by the bank that the superstructure of the boat remained above water weeds grew on its roof and deck moored at the jetty was another smaller boat a worn but still serviceable launch its peeling grey paint lending it a military air a muttered consultation with iwa then we climbed in jan de zwaan bent over the engine and tugged the starter cord after a couple of tries the motor caught purring silently iwa unhitched a rope from an iron peg and we began to move downstream the native stood on the bank motionless as he watched us go our situation appeared very exposed i copied the others in crouching low in the boat the river wound and we turned with it jan steering and keeping us close to the left bank we passed a riverside village on the opposite bank where pigs rooted under the houses while naked brown kids splashed and yelled in the shallows gradually the character of our surroundings changed the jungle gave way to mangrove the river became more labyrinthine the banks mere stretches of mud and the water a dull grey colour hendrick pointed to three crocodiles lying dormant on a nearby bank i made to lift my carbine but he restrained me all the coast is swampy said sontrop the tide comes up here but we have now the low tide our sumatra crocodiles like to swim sometimes in the sea before the war they have been almost extinct but now they breed more the japs give them some human bodies to eat i think assuming that this was merely a rather unpleasant pleasantry i smiled and said how many are we going to shoot sontrop held up two fingers we shoot only two thats sufficient the sound of our shots will make people interested who should not be interested we pick up the bodies if we can because of their value and then we hurry fast back to the godown and to safety he gave a grunt of laughter i asked the obvious question you shoot one horatio because you are our guest to sumatra and our honoured friend jan also shoots one because this afternoon he must leave on the van heutsz who knows he may never get the chance to come back to the tropics its sort of his farewell okay listen you shoot just into the eye of the beast between the eye is no good because the skull is so thick you can have one shot only if you miss then hendrick may have a quick shot if he misses then i may have a quick shot but it must be immediate after we have to get home fast you understand bandits about bandits i liked nothing more needed to be said as the launch chugged quietly forward the grandeur of the forest gave way to a meaner growth of mangroves and the confusions of a mangrove swamp where birds darted for cover among the exposed roots dark water gargled round the base of every tree occasionally we moved past long strips of land covered with flowers somewhere not too far ahead was the strait we were already at its margins the transition from land to sea was a stealthy one through the mangrove maze we moved de zwaan crouched over the wheel alert in his absurd helmet he pointed ahead towards a more considerable island emerging among the trees on it stood a hut with curving eaves balanced on stilts some banana trees grew beside it as we drew nearer i saw that there was also a timber wharf or pier which had collapsed into the water the island broke the canopy of mangroves sun shone in lighting the water bathing the small island it bathed too the bodies of half a dozen crocodiles which lay basking on the strip of shore like war canoes ready for launch de zwaan cut the engine we drifted forward slowly and silently apart from a slight watery accompaniment we moved to the buzz of a million flies sontrop clutched my arm and spoke into my ear wait to shoot i will make a sign first shot for jan then you immediately next understand fine beast the sumatran crocodile of the estuaries nodding sternly and pointing he levelled the muzzle of his gun over the prow i followed suit aware of my heart hammering inside my sweaty shirt its just like shooting people the crocodiles looked more like six turds than six people i estimated that de zwaan would aim for the nearest beast i marked out the second in line but was too experienced to aim before necessary in the tropics sweat and heat blur a marksmans sight almost at once the croc was perhaps twice the length of a man it was hard to judge size from where we crouched staring at it across a decreasing stretch of water in which the sunlit banana trees and hut were darkly reflected i saw its eyes open my grip on the carbine tightened the crocs eyes were yellow like a cats the colour of freshfallen jungle leaves we were gliding not directly at the bank but tangentially so that i presumed we would not be directly in their path if they launched themselves into the water birds hopped about the crocodiles perching cheekily on their long skulls the distance between us and them narrowed still further flies buzzed the mud gave off a sickly sweet stench like dying hyacinths jan fired the surprise of it paralysed me now yelled sontrop i was immobilised the crocs were already on the move i fired at them at random twice sontrop and nieuwenhuis both stood up in the boat and blazed away full of excitement and some fury at myself i took careful aim my sights followed the second reptile as he scuttled down his stretch of shore i fired carrying through the movement i hit him just behind his right eye as he struck the water he jerked upwards then disappeared beneath the surface a terrible thrashing took place more than one croc had been hit the water churned madly blood and leaves being thrown up parabolically in the path of lashing tails on the mudflat one croc lay unmoving the racket of our shooting filled the whole world birds and waterfowl rose up from everywhere screaming in protest wheeling about and breaking free into the upper air beyond the trees even before the last reverberations of our fire had rattled into the distance jan was standing up calling in excitement hugging ernst hendrick had the steering wheel he started the engine cut it again and we glided in the bottom of the launch bumped against mud we all jumped ashore i got a boot full of cold black ooze ahead stood the hut utterly deserted a patch of maize grew by its broken steps a large crab scuttled away and sank under the water bubbling putting his carbine to the unmoving crocs skull jan squeezed the trigger the reptile gave an enormous heave and lay still i was amazed to find myself so close to the creature hendrick unwound his rope and started to secure the beast behind its front legs do we tow it i asked no other crocs eat him put him in the boat with us as we tied it up i looked across the black waters behind us listening to their endless slurp among the mangroves the surface was still silence returned with some effort we heaved the poor bloody thing broken skull and all into the boat it lay belly upwards we sat on it and jan passed round a flask of genever from which we all swigged heartily grinning at each other in triumph hendrick clapped me on the back good he said good fun great i said i laughed feeling my heart bound in my chest we were wet and filthy the crocodile was covered with mud and so was the old grey boat jan went over to the engine starting it as hendrick and i jumped out and pushed the bow free of the mudspit once we were aboard again the boat made a wide curve and started back among the mangroves the island with its derelict hut fell away behind birds were settling down in the tops of the trees already forgetting the excitement one bird swooped in low and flew close by the launch sometimes darting among the arched mangrove roots in its pursuit of us it was grey above and white below i caught the reflection of its breast in the water it homed in on the scent of death and would not be deflected in my carcass triumph burned i had been initiated into a new mystery of sumatran life for a moment i considered some of the consequences of my act it was saturday morning and margey would wonder where i was i had too been missing from lines overnight and was therefore guilty of a chargeable offence i dismissed these considerations i could make things right with margey shed be proud of me and jhamboo singh would see that i got into no trouble after all i had leverage on him thus reassuring myself i turned my attention to the satisfactions of the present the sun broke through on the dark water the mangroves cleared the river banks became clearly defined soon all too soon the godown and the jetty with the sunken ship showed ahead we floated in to the jetty there was no sign of iwa sontrop jumped out and moored the launch silence reigned beyond the godown jungle grew surrounding us with a creepy privacy the superstructure of the sunken riverboat including the wheelhouse was above water tufts of foliage sprouted on the blistered deck the wreck added a sense of ruination in which my heart perversely exalted as we dragged the crocodile ashore the kitehawk which had followed us alighted on the funnel of the sunken vessel sontrop drew out his parang and started to slice up the belly of the crocodile grey matter and red intestine bulged from the widening slit we must gut it to carry it he said looking up fetch iwa from the godown the old boy has gone to sleep he will do this work we must not wait about slinging my carbine over my shoulder i walked briskly up to the concrete building a sliding metal cargo door on one side of the building was open a few inches i tried to budge it further but it would not move the metal almost burnt my flesh squeezing through i found myself in near dark until my vision adjusted something slithered away from me and i was immediately alert for snakes i once encountered a cobra facetoface in padang and hoped never to repeat the experience iwa i realised i had shouted in a whisper now i saw better i moved forward with more confidence the internal space of the warehouse was empty except for offices and a wc in one corner and some wooden crates piled in the centre of the area the crates looked as if they had been standing there for years across one of them i saw an incongruous name stencilled manchester i crossed to the lavatory calling iwas name again and kicked the door open inside was a chinesestyle shitter and a washbasin both were clogged with shit ancient shit too old to attract many flies i turned away and as i turned a movement caught my eye a soldier of the tri stood in the doorway levelling a sten at me he was without features seen as a silhouette in the narrow rectangle of light he shouted a command jerking the snout of his gun for emphasis although i did not understand what he said the message came across i could jump into the office behind me but the flimsy door offered no protection from bullets the heavy manchester crates offered better cover they were too far away i visualised myself diving for shelter behind them while a stream of bullets tore into my body the image froze me the moment for action slipped away the extremist took a couple of steps closer and was no longer merely a silhouette his finger was curled round that well known crude trigger which is a vital part of a sten i slid my carbine off my shoulder and let it clatter to the floor he planted himself by the crates he was a slender man with a hawkish face no older than i we looked at each other a tension in his attitude told me he would fire if i did anything except stand still i stood still he shouted another order im english orang ingris no understand tida mengerti i pointed to my shoulder flashes to the div sign of the tiger coming out of the black triangle look ingris not that i imagined that he would have any affection for the english as such but it gave him something to think about i just didnt want any member of the merdeka squad to imagine that i was dutch he made no reply sontrop and his pals i imagined were still skinning the croc down by the waters edge my throat was dry i did not cry out to warn them the extremist kept me covered without moving filled with the bloodlust that whites imagined overtook all malays or just stupid tuan ingris thank god just stupid and respectful i nodded yes ingris london you speak ingris he just stood there pointing the sten inflexibly and listening i listened footsteps were approaching from the direction of the wharf it must be the dutchmen as soon as this bugger took his eyes off me to look round i would jump him i still had my revolver but a quick commando chop on the correct vertebra right up under the occipital bone should do him most good where it was needed most an indonesian officer arrived in the godown slick operation in back to wall jap machinepistol aimed at all and sundry not a man to muck about he took in the situation at once eyed the carbine on the floor between me and his man barked an order the sten man came forward collected the carbine backed out of harms way with it i stood where i was the officer was solidly built with a heavy piggy face and blue jowls a scar led down one check and puckered the corner of his mouth giving him a quirky expression it looked like a fresh scar he had the red and white shoulder flashes of the tri and the two pips of a subedar or first lieutenant there were rings on two of the fingers of the hand that held the grip of his weapon he moved round so as to command the door in marched sontrop de zwaan and nieuwenhuis clutching the tops of their trousers two armed tri soldiers hustled them in when he spotted me ernst sontrop gave a ghastly smile and said apologies for this misfortune horatio bandits generally take saturday off the lieutenant barked at him to be quiet the netherlanders were made to line up against the rear wall of the warehouse their trouserbelts had been removed so that they had to hold their trousers up their carbines and ammunition belts had also gone and were now draped over the shoulders of their two guards de zwaan was still wearing his jap aviators helmet i saw that the two guards were excited by their capture the lieutenant spoke soothingly to them they looked pretty nasty chaps they spent some time making my pals line up properly caps of boots and foreheads against the wall i watched for the moment to go for my gun but the sten remained pointing unwaveringly at my belt buckle i could only stare helplessly at three sweaty backs and the weapons that covered them at last they were arranged according to the lieutenants satisfaction the stengunner said something to him at which he turned the full power of his attention on me he came forward standing with legs apart and fists on hips surveying me an ugly and aggressive sod his scar went white when he spoke you are ingrish no from netherlands i pointed to my shoulder flashes see these div english london churchill make your gun down on ground be very care he pointed to the floor unbuttoning the holster flap i dropped the revolver at my feet he motioned me angrily to kick it across to him which i did he ignored it where are you stay at medan an unbidden vision of jackie tertis swinging a golf club flashed across my mind i saw the view of his torture house as glimpsed from my window in the billet i thought of the fate of the indonesians who had fallen into his hands the thought occurred to me that it was the japs who set the fashion for all this cruelty now it was going to be my turn for the first time i was really afraid afraid all over and all through the fear expressed itself as severe chill of skin and internal organs my bladder and bowels felt as if they were about to slip loose from their moorings nobody could ever want the tertis treatment i felt my lips tremble as i answered evasively off the serdenweg serdenweg he studied me keeping his machinepistol ready time inside the godown had solidified show to me your pass i groped in my upper lefthand jacket pocket and produced my battered old brown paybook when i leaned forward to give it to him he took it without removing his gaze from my eyes almost as if he hoped to hypnotise me then he looked down at the book riffling its pages onehanded i drew breath looking round in search of help nothing there encouraged me the dutch stood motionless facing the wall holding up their trousers the two tri soldiers guarded them my pal with the sten now stood in the doorway where he had a good view of all of us as well as keeping an eye on outside no sound came from there inside bluebottles buzzed endlessly under the asbestos roof the lieutenant finished his inspection of my paybook and my photograph he shut it and handed it back as i put it away he said contemptuously you good friend all netherlands men we were hunting crocodiles not military operation the bastard still looked me over his eyes bulging you speak netherlands language no what your name horatio stubbs sergeant as written in paybook where you are borned i named the east midlands town written in my paybook he stood there i was aware that our fates were being decided jan de zwaan started to call something in malay he was kicked viciously in the thigh and fell silent with a grunt the officer ran a hand along the line of his jaw the peel of stubble against his palm was audible then he came to a decision he pointed to the office door behind me you go in opis look im going back to england next week my friends are going back to the netherlands on the van heutsz this afternoon okay let us go we are all leaving sumatra as soon as possible then it will be your island okay the jaw angle became more pronounced now is our island you go into opis lekas chopchop like i say as i moved he moved kicking my revolver to one side with his boot it was a good heavy kick the weapon went scuttling to the far end of the concrete floor unable to think of anything else i walked over to the office and entered turning quickly in case the lieutenant shot me in the neck i backed against a desk and we confronted each other across the intervening space he raised the machinepistol and levelled it at my eyes glaring at me across the barrel he came nearer each step a threat his mouth became smeared across his face you wait here and no make move or i shooting you to pieces okay i nodded the sentence was important to both of us he repeated it with some relish you wait here and no make move i shooting you to pieces yes understand he shook his head scowling ingris army finish at medan he moved out and shut the office door the key turned in the lock there was a frosted glass panel in the door covered in dust i had an impression of his retreating back then could see nothing i stood with my thigh against the desk waiting as ordered trembling fuck it i could hurl myself through the window and run for the river but they would be outside and firing before i made it besides anything i did would only make the position of sontrop and co more perilous the lieutenant had all the power we were helpless a discussion began on the other side of the godown it took place in malayan but i recognised the tones of ernst sontrops voice caught the anger in it the lieutenant started shouting i caught the word merdeka repeated several times looking back i cannot recall that i held anything more than a simple soldiers viewpoint of the political situation the dutch owned sumatra and the indonesians who were making trouble were extremists parallel cases exist in palestine and northern ireland and other countries today though parallels like analogies never prove cases but in those simple early days after the war when the shutters of international business had only just gone up the notion of colonial populations being it to govern their own countries or entitled to govern whether it or not had barely penetrated merdeka could not really mean freedom since it was a native word which was why the british troops used it among themselves with their customary surly cheer as a comic password the indonesian state has survived for many years on the whole it prospers it is remote from britain our mutual trade is negligible as for sumatra itself little is ever heard of it in britain the times only a week or two ago reported an earthquake in west sumatra without mentioning any names or reporting casualties it was a fourline filler sumatra has sunk beneath the greater abstraction of indonesia and we know and care less about the island than we did a century ago as a nation we have largely lost interest in the world as i grow older i regret that what was good and liberal in the british empire is dead and that the little having largely overcome the great remains obstinately little well it is proper that my generation should regret we were among the sods who shrugged our shoulders and laughed it all away like steve kyle we forgot how to give or take orders three shots rang out they rattled about the harsh confines of the godown with petrifying din as they died one more shot reawoke the echoes then silence fell thick and dismaying as i crouched down against the desk arms round my head a rusty rain of dust fell from the ceiling i thought of the great silences of the forest of that awful neutrality for an unreckoned time i sheltered against the desk there was no further sound finally i tiptoed to the window and looked out my body shook with fear through the dusty glass lay a view of wharf and river the launch we had used for our fool crocodile hunt had gone the halfsunken boat still lay at its last anchorage the door to its wheelhouse hung open that was where the lieutenant and his men had hidden waiting craftily until we returned on the wharfside lay our crocodile twenty or more kitehawks fed on it tearing shreds from its body and gobbling them down they jostled and fought for positions in the carcass the picture was picked out in share detail in the blazing sun of the tri there was no sign the landscape lay there impaled by sunlight in the background the felled trees and the standing trees reflected in the calm river in the foreground the terrible feast that magnificent land which has everything food cash crops minerals that magnificent land of mountains volcanoes rivers jungles why has it not risen to become one of the most enviable of all countries of the globe standing trembling in the office next to the stinking latrine i seemed to know the answer to the question the tribes of man became the dominant animal in temperate zones in the tropics where man began his position remains less assured below cancer the fevers of the equator work against him the heat and its allies make a perpetual war grinding him down and some dreadful thing in human nature defeats human nature tears came to my eyes as i stood at the window for i was innocent i whispered i loved sumatra i had been about to leave it against my will as a soldier must take farewell of his wife now my dutch friends having been shot down the guns were being reloaded for my execution over and above the fear i felt was an awful depression at the uselessness of everything the bloody war the fucking peace i stood and listened for them only gradually did it dawn on me that the extremists might have gone that fear of reprisals from the british might have caused them to spare my life silence the buzz of flies nearby outside the occasional cries of the scavenger birds sweat burst out upon me behind the desk stood a metal wastepaper bin i picked it up hurled it through the frosted glass pane of the office door and ducked under the desk after a clatter of falling glass the noise of the bin rolling over concrete then silence again making a great effort i came out from cover went over to the door and located the key on its outer side i unlocked the door and stepped out on to the floor of the godown ernst sontrop jan de zwaan and hendrick nieuwenhuis lay huddled together by the far wall a communal pool of blood spread under their bodies jan still wore his old jap helmet he lay face upward his eyes open looking sternly at the ceiling his two friends lay face down i could not see which of the three had needed the extra shot weakness overcame me i leaned against one of the old manchester crates feebly wiping my face i broke into enormous sobs which rose from the centre of my guts they came pumping up in reverse peristalsis disgorging all that had to be suffered after midday in medan the city in its trance of sunlight the smart native cop on duty at the kesawan crossroads with little traffic to direct except for a few leisurely bullockcarts making for the railway station i stood with captain jhamboo singh by his jeep in the shadow of the grim dutch hq he was all concern come back to the lines with me sergeant have a meal take a rest or i will drive you to the field ambulance and you can enjoy peace and quiet under observation for a day im fine captain sahib thank you i just need a drink no no you come back to the lines and have a clean up at present you are in a bad state especially with regard to your appearance get in get in he tapped the side of the jeep with one fingernail he was himself immaculate as usual i climbed in behind him and we were driven back to the lines on the way i tackled him about my missing revolver losing it was a chargeable offence jhamboo brushed the question aside he would indent for a new one no charge would be brought he was happy that i had come through the incident with my life as to what had happened it was best that i spoke to nobody about it nobody he would be seeing general hedley in the morning when he would report the incident personally such events occurred in difficult situations this was a bad campaign in which nobody had any glory for the rest the three killings that was the business of the dutch i must not concern myself if i had been killed that was different then the division would have been forced to mount retributive action with a general hotting up of tension all round mercifully we were spared such unpleasantness all that could be said was that there must be no breaches of discipline he and i were old campaigners and had survived in difficult theatres of war now it was peacetime despite appearances and both of us were entitled to retire with honour to our peacetime destinies peacetime i said and laughed he presented his case and offered me his de reszkes pressing them on me when i refused no no sergeant take one and smoke later after your shower there are different conceptions of wartime and peacetime as we come now to realise i took a fag and lit up automatically when he did i let myself be taken by surprise asking for trouble i feel responsible for their deaths yes yes i understand but you must tell yourself that is not so to survive is not a disgrace but rather a virtue confidentially give me just one platoon sergeant one platoon and you and i would wipe out these murdering swine for ever the jeep dropped me before my billet in djalan sennal road i climbed out drew myself up and ripped jhamboo off a smart salute he returned it his expression lamblike again as he regarded me as i peeled off my filthy uniform and climbed into the shower recent events kept returning vividly before my mental gaze after i left the godown i had to make my way back through the jungle alone the indonesians had removed jans truck from its place of concealment i walked on through the burntout kampong and eventually emerged on a road where a dutch patrol found me good old dutch they never gave up they drove me straight to their grey medan hq where ernst sontrops office was there i was given a cup of coffee a ham roll and a cigar while four officers assembled to question me one of them was a greyhaired man with mild goldrimmed spectacles and a brutal mouth he belonged to pea force and introduced himself as a friend of jackie tertis the room filled with smoke more coffee was brought a good deal of phoning went on jhamboo arrived i greeted him with relief a friendly face the dutch had tried to contact the elusive boyer without results throughout the interviews the dutch even the villain from pea force were unfailingly courteous unrolling their faultless english like staircarpet down each step of the enquiry all the white i felt like a prize shit i knew they thought i should have died with my pals from my description they identified the tri lieutenant with the scar as a man called hamil hes just returned from java we happen to know said pea force hes not a good man but we shall get him hamils a tough egg agreed one of the other officers with a cool mastery of english slang by not executing me by refusing even to take me captive hamil had avoided a possible confrontation and snubbed both dutch and british authorities he showed that he knew we were withdrawing and that that withdrawal meant the beginning of the end for the dutch the tri wanted us out of the way with as little fuss as possible their battle was half won all of which must have been gall for the dutch but they just made a few more serious phone calls the questioning was over they rose and thanked me for my cooperation apologised for my misadventure congratulated me on my escape from death and hoped that i would return to medan after the uprising had been quelled when they would be happy to see i had a pleasant visit and could shoot crocodiles in a more congenial atmosphere i shook hands all round and left with jhamboo by now as i stood wearily under the cold shower an armed escort would be out at the godown if the three bodies werent collected quickly the shitehawks which had feasted on the crocodile would be greedying it in the building how do you eat people its just like eating crocodiles iwa no doubt the terrible men in pea force would sort out his role in the ambush to their satisfaction if not to iwas when i had dried myself i stretched luxuriously on my charpoy and reached for my tin of cigarettes i never made it some maniac some vaginaphobe with his hand on my shoulder was asking me if i wanted to buy a battleship groaning i heaved myself up and looked blearily round you want to lay off the kyfer before it kills you i thought you were bloody dead mate ive brought you a late lunch there was johnny mercer behind him the chinese mess servant standing grinning with a tray of food and a beer my indian watch told me that i had been asleep for only twentyfive minutes all the same i felt better putting a towel round my middle i sat on the edge of the bed and began shovelling the food in the top johnny took it for granted that i had been with margey and proceeded to go into great detail concerning his adventures of the previous evening which revolved about the twin axes of alcohol and women it appeared that he had had a good time it was impossible to concentrate on what he had to say before my eyes floated a picture of three bodies lying against the wall of the godown while ants meditatively inspected their lifeblood i wondered how i could behave naturally before my friends now that this terrible knowledge was in me coming back alone through the great forest with nature at its most luxuriant all round i had been startled by a chain of monkeys swinging in the branches high overhead screaming as they went perhaps the monkeys knew death but monkeys were innocent they did not know harm it was harm that i had discovered and instinct demanded that i should conceal that discovery from my friends how about a game of badminton ive been on ration duty all morning no thanks i bloody must go back into town i scraped up the last of my treaclesponge pudding mercer looked a bit embarrassed and stuffed his hands into his pockets did you speak to old boyer last night about this problem of yours you know about marrying this chinese girl you mean margey of course he gave his neighing laugh then why not fucking say so you know her dont you you fucking well used to screw her didnt you keep your bloody hair on i only asked if you spoke to boyer i put my plate down rose and started to dress boyer was pissed as arseholes his birds off on the van heutsz this afternoon i checked with the watches one said twelvetwentyfive the other onefifteen whats the time oneforty im supposed to be seeing boyer this afternoon at the company office three pip emma ten to one he wont turn up i heaved myself into a clean uniform look horry for fucks sake take the advice of an old mate forget this idea of marrying margey its not on there are oodles of bits of crumpet back in the blight lying around with their legs open and their little twots pulsating just waiting for handsome young sergeants like us to come home i looked at him young piss off well old then its a bugger horry i was a kid when i joined up now i feel about fifty where have the years gone still i still think youd be mad to marry old marge if i may say so without offence you dont have to do it just to impress your mates you know whod want to impress you give those ginpalaces back and ill tell you i punched him lightly on the chest come down the bazaar and ill buy you a drink with the illgotten gains at the canteen i bought five hundred blighty players a tin of colemans mustard a packet of edwards desiccated soup a bar of chocolate and some branstons sweet pickle at the company stores i left a note for captain boyer telling him where i would be at the office i collected a green slip from jhamboo which i handed to the armourerhavildar at the armoury he was an enormous man with handlebar moustaches he issued me with a new revolver and made me sign without comment pistol revolver webley in mk as i emerged into the sunshine mercer rolled up in the mess jeep i climbed in beside him bloody tertis has just gone tearassing by on his bike business as usual theyll get him one day today i hope we drove past the grey fortress of the dutch hq poor jan de zwaan would never catch the van heutsz on which many of his countrymen and women were even now embarking i could not get over the sight of his face in death with the absurd jap helmet still on his head the memory came between me and the outer world death followed me like the speeding bird which had shadowed our launch back to harbour id have to write to addy about ernst a thunderstorm was building up with high vivid clouds the shape of anvils piling above the rooftops sunshine became a searchlight we pulled into margeys alley and stopped i saw that something was pinned to her door bright objects glittered among what was faded and grey we drew near elaborate chinese characters had been cut out of red and gold card and attached to the entrance strings of little white flowers painstakingly threaded together hung wilting on the old blistered doorway i put my hand against the stone to study them better they conveyed a meaning but not to me the door stood ajar mercer pushed in and i followed of course hed been here long before i had the room was transformed it was draped in white dozens of small candles in tin holders burned about a coffin which occupied the centre of the space the coffin itself was smothered in little foil decorations which gleamed in the candlelight a heavy scent hung about the room languorous yet threatening for a crazy moment i thought they must have collected sontrop many people stood by the coffin in their best clothes they kept their deep chinese gaze away from johnny and me some of the old women clutched flowers in their weathered hands daisy was there carrying her baby she glanced at us then away as we paused someone hurried from the rear of the throng and blocked our path raising his hands before him it was the chinese journalist tiger balm immaculate as ever you may not come in here today sir it is not convenient i am in mush im not going to cause any trouble whats going on he shook head and hands you must depart quietly please sir buddhist ceremonies are in progress following the death so we have to require you to leave this is not a place for british soldiers go please the old ladys dead im sorry she was a nice old girl i tried to push forward as i spoke but tiger balm remained unmoving yes old aunties spirit has departed and you must not interrupt the ceremonies the military have no business with mourning look drum im not going to break up your bloody ceremonies i just want margey where is she lets sod off stubby mercer suggested we can come back later lets go and have a drink while i hesitated tiger balm said good idea sgt stubbs go and have a drink or two its in your line margeys brotherinlaw came panting up from the shadows shaking his head tutting waving his plump paws ah missa stuss poh auntie pinnish you no come you go i give cigalet i dont want your fucking cigarettes chum wheres margey more waving of hands margey no here margey go brastagi brastagi what the fucks she gone to brastagi for why didnt she tell me she was going keep your voice low sir if you please said tiger balm edging johnny and me towards the door acts of devotion are in progress and must continue during two days such is our form of worship to the dead margey will return tomorrow escorting some relations the coffin and the mourners confused me existence suddenly appeared threadbare and i was inclined to be pugnacious about it she didnt tell me she was going to be away whats going on margey could not speak with you because you did not come here this morning as you promised please leave without further high spirits fat echoed the suggestion yessah missa stussa prease lee see margey moller so did johnny lets go and get a bloody drink coming or not okay okay i looked angrily at the chinese tiger balm bowed slightly fat bowed and smiled exposing gold teeth behind them daisys baby uttered one brief cry the room was stuffed with sweet and sour smells i pushed the things i had brought for margey into fats arms and left with johnny almost opposite the deli cinema was a little malayan bar where we sat and drank carioca and red fox no sooner had we arrived than rain fell in great gusts filling the streets with noise thunder pealed morosely overhead brastagis miles away johnny said wiping his lies i could guess what he was thinking if the bitch just keeps out of the way for two more days stubbs will be safely on his way home it grew dark inside the tiled room a number of sumatrans dashed in to shelter in the doorway the main source of light the manager greeted johnny like an old friend and summoned his wife from a back parlour the wifes name was che jah or something similar she spoke some english having worked in the british consulate in prewar days she sat at our table and talked pleased to air her knowledge of the language che jah wore a sarong and a smart white muslin jacket fitting tightly about her generous breasts dark hair pulled back from a handsome olive face with broad cheekbones sitting talking to johnny with controlled ease she leaned forward across the table smoking a cigarette smiling as she spoke her teeth were perfect her wrists her smooth hands her fingers one adorned with a silver ring moved with delicate precision as she lifted the cigarette to and from her broad lips the fabric of her tightly buttoned sleeves chafing against her arms made a faint sound as of thigh moving against thigh how magnificent women were lifes answer to death what an experience it would be to share the existence of such a vivid creature in her was the spirit of sumatra incarnate rather than in my pale margey brastagi was a long drive from medan approximately fifty miles margey had spoken of some distant relations there whom she had once visited with the old auntie it was an agreeable mountain village with a cool climate i had driven through it early one morning as a seagrey dawn was breaking i remembered long houses on stilts by the roadside and three women standing in a striking monumental group dressed in tight black clothes wearing heavy turbans we could have been in tibet rather than on the equator that had been during the momentous drive overland from padang that arsebreaking unforgettable trip the day before reaching brastagi we stopped at a village called prapat on the shores of lake toba it seemed one of the remotest places in the world lake toba itself must be all of seventy miles long you could heave the grand duchy of luxemburg into it and leave but a splash yet only the dutch have ever heard of the place its beautiful cool and high the lake itself is formed out of one crater of a string of volcanoes which blew themselves out long before man emerged on the planet in the middle of the lake lies an island samosir you couldnt miss samosir from prapat its malachite cliffs rise sheer across a narrow stretch of water i had stood on the bank looking across at it there were people on that island then one of my mates called to me and we had to move on in my minds eye i still saw samosir its peak crowned with jungle i had resolved that one day i would return to prapat and go across to the island now i knew that was impossible people died men were shot like crocodiles there was no place for the dutch and british on sumatra the events of the morning made it clear that if i was going to marry margey we were going to have to live somewhere else and wasnt it the spirit of sumatra itself i really wished to embrace that animated face only three feet away with those moulded lips those liquid eyes those fine eyebrows and that clear skin was still talking to johnny mercer a batak woman orang batak cannibals ferocious people said margey in her face dwelt a sort of fire yet it was difficult to see her clearly so sharp was that dusty image of de zwaan lying against sontrop and nieuwenhuis in a spreading pool of blood che jah turned and darted me a direct look my eyes flicked away from hers lest she saw the dead bodies she said as if we were long familiar with each other you will go back to england next week and that is best i met her gaze and then looked down at the cane tabletop i shall never forget sumatra is best for all mens go back to the land where they belong only a day earlier i might have interpreted her words as consolatory now i wondered if they concealed a threat perhaps she and all the other inhabitants of medan had already heard of the tris coup that morning in any case the good simple sense she appeared to speak was meaningless upon examination not everyone had places to go this was ernst sontrops country as much as hers margey would not be welcomed in her dreamedof shantung province what rude awakening was i in for when i returned to the blight leaving the table i went to peer out of the doorway at the rain which hit the pavements so hard that it sent up a kneehigh mist there were displacements for the whole damned lot of us in the pitcher of time i recalled fragments of old abca lectures passages from history books both the english and dutch were of that indoeuropean stock whose origins lay in the subcontinent from which the british raj was now being expelled come to that the bataks were descendants of nations driven south from indochina by mongolian invaders despite all territorial claims nobody belonged in che jahs sense to any particular land only to the globe itself there was no real settling down they called me back to the table coffee had arrived bitter and black i smoked a cigar while the others talked i was trying to work out how bad i felt and whether i felt bad because id been nearly shot or because id not been shot the woman and her husband were coaxing us to go behind the shop and eat with them johnny was all for it and wanted my company but restlessness forced me to excuse myself it was a good moment to leave the caf the rain had suddenly tapered away and died in the street compulsive anxiety took over supposing lieutenant hamil appeared walking casually down the road should i shoot him would he perhaps shoot me and why in hell had i not told johnny what had happened i hated the vein of selfprotective secrecy in my character de zwaan lay dead before my eyes slumped in his ridiculous helmet while ants investigated the liquids draining from his body shooting people is like shooting crocodiles tertis went roaring by on his motorbike he called to me a savage shout whose meaning i could not determine it was the hottest time of day evidence of the recent downpour was vanishing rapidly and the streets steamed red and green lights danced across my retinas when nausea moved in my throat and stomach i tried to amuse myself by thinking of raddle being sick but the exercise was too dangerous there was a shop to my right i lurched through its open door and sat down on a wicker stool inside weakness made me rest my head on the counter although i became aware of shuffling noises near me i was unable to look up the dizziness slowly cleared still i kept my head down fear of death fear of fear fear of spewing they gradually gave way to a fear of social embarrassment i felt a right cunt sitting there at last i lifted my head and tipped my bushhat straight a thin old man with a little fat lady beside him stood regarding me perplexedly the shop contained so little stock that it was hard to decide what kind of a shop it was a cardboard box shop judging by the evidence on the other hand a few hats six or seven lay in his small window together with a bolt of cloth and a bowl containing yellow heads it was a head shop or a hat shop or a bolt shop the old man said something excitedly in malay pointing to the door thikhai thik hai i said im going dont worry im not going to hurt you or your girl friend he still kept pointing first at me then at the street letting off a stream of malay the little fat lady joined in relax will you fuck it tida bagoose how do you know i dont want to buy one of your sodding hats has sodding has he asked i made a puttingonhead gesture which he imitated fetching a blue felt thing from his window he attempted to fit it on my head its not for me you old cunt blue isnt my colour i started laughing the little old man joined in without looking any less anxious it occurred to me that i ought to buy the hat for margey just to please him she had said she wanted one but the bitch was in brastagi probably plying her trade for all i knew flogging her flesh hawking her hole a desultory haggle began from which i could not see how to extricate myself the old man was writing down prices in dutch guilders jap guilders and cigarettes when a shadow fell across the threshold and a young lad entered leading katie chae she looked as if she had changed only a minute earlier into crisp new pyjamas oh miss chae hello i was as sweaty as she was damp proof hello big boy this shopkeeper send along his son fetch me case you die in his shop he know you fren of me i thought he was trying to tell me to get out of his shop why you should think that this is

im fine thanks just a touch of the sun please thank the old man and tell him that i do not want to buy the hat she and the old man exchanged short bursts of malay miss chae stood there very calm and collected the old man appeared somewhat apologetic she turned back to me arching her eyebrows this shobkeeper he say you to take the hat as presen if you no can afford to buy he give christ i dont

my place eh i no tell margey honnis to god anyway that girl go away medan this morning i know katie but thats not the reason okay you tell me reason katie chaes place was grander than margeys she had two rooms over a small shop and a lavatory and washingcooking place behind the shop on the ground floor of her two rooms the front one was a lounge with sofas and tables the rear a bedroom with a big bed a mirror and a desk used as a dressingtable she watched me as i prowled about i sat down on one of the sofas still clutching the blue hat while she went to pour us some tea as soon as i began to drink it i felt desperately ill excusing myself i staggered downstairs to have a shit shutting myself in katies little earth closet as i crouched there with my trousers round my ankles arms wrapped round the cold sweating flanks of my belly the murders came rushing back blood leaked irretrievably on a concrete floor my bowels fell out of my body shaking violently i had to crouch there for a while before i summoned enough strength to use the paper provided as i wiped my arse good feelings poured into me fuck it not being shot was more fun than being shot england held all sorts of excitements i knew not of and so on even world peace cant stop hope from springing eternal the massive bowel movement had literally taken a weight off my mind christ here i was with the mysterious katie chae this was hardly a moment for grief even illness could be fended off awhile whatever her game was two could profitably play it i dragged my trousers up and buckled my belt reflecting on the mystical aspects of a good crap tottering out of the crapper i almost collided with katie she had followed me downstairs i was embarrassed by the ripe old stink that followed me out of the closet but she took my arm and said you kinda sick big boy come i give china bath then you feel much better this punk climate no good no no dont worry your katie plenty useful girl one time work as nurse know how take care soldiers i did not protest much if there was one thing i already guessed about katie chae it was that she knew how to take care of soldiers once again she got her way well i was feeling weak in no time she stripped my clothes off and i was squatting in a stone stoup trying to look like walking wounded she ladled water over me with a bowl and when i climbed out she dried my flesh from head to foot then we went back upstairs i lay on the bed white katie painted me with potassium permanganate a favourite whores trick at this point i was all anticipation and showed it yet i let katie play her little game she arranged a light cover over me lying beside me she began to massage my neck and temples with supple fingers how innocent even childlike she looked that long face on a level with mine her almond eyes serious upon me she whispered gently in an alien tongue against my own intentions drowsiness descended upon me like a fog my lids would not stay open lazily i put an arm about her and sank into deep sleep it was not at all an ordinary awakening it seemed as if i was taking up some old favourite conversation katie chae was naked against me and i was already screwing her god knows what witchcraft it was but i swear that for the one and only time in my life i had begun to fuck someone whilst in a complete sleep not only that but i was about to come the first faint foghorns of orgasm were already sounding through the mist and her unprecedented body was telling me that it was high time i came it gathered from my scalp and from the purplepainted soles of my feet and tossed us yards up the beach from the ocean at the very moment when i believed myself drowning oh oh oh oh katie katie you incredible oh she held me i held her i drifted back into sleep smiling as blissfully as perpetually as a dolphin when i roused again katie appeared to be lightly asleep in my arms a few heads of sweat lay on her upper lip i gazed at that loaded oriental face with gratitude and delight as i gazed i felt with joy that my prick was rising up again she sensed it against her stirred opened her eyes for a moment while we stared at each ether her expression did not change then she gave me a conspiratorial smile slipped her hand down the bed took my prick and guided it into her luscious body well theres no use going on about it after all these years after all enough good things have happened since but oh my darling katie chae there really was something you had that nobody else ever did you really were some sort of a witch one of those delicious succubi that men are not supposed to go with if they are to retain their souls or keep any of the marrow in their spinal cords that really was communication of a high order we finally staggered out of bed and got dressed i felt pretty delirious fit but delirious because of a kind of awe of her i found little to say she brought beer we sat and drank it as the world grew dark outside beyond all the changes of the light is something permanent rarely glimpsed in no time i imagined myself in love with katie chae and presented her with the felt hat if you have ever seen an englishwoman lumping about in a cheongsam you will know how silly katie looked in a blue felt hat silly but cute she herself was amused but she held both sides of the brim and bent almost double laughing with delight as well as amusement so that i saw the ridges on the roof of her mouth and felt lustful all over again again that primaeval stirring in the trousers reminiscent of a conger eel preparing to belt back to the sargasso sea where it belongs there was a call from the bottom of the stairs and katie leaned over the banister to answer the spell was broken i thought back over the events of the day again the three figures appeared on the concrete floor of the godown poor old sontrop but after all he was only a fucking queer and they were soldiers the same as i was and its a soldiers duty to get himself shot occasionally it was none of my business id come through the incident just as id come through all the hell of kohima and burma that was war now here were the spoils of war in the shape of katie chae i sidled up behind her and ran a hand lightly across her thigh katie chae took firm hold of my wrist and continued shouting angrily at the man below looking down i admired her slender arm the beautiful line of her breast margey had always said katie was a whore of course it was natural to think of katie as a whore with her talents what else could she be war with its scuttling morals was her natural element grateful thoughts of captain jhamboo singh arose there was a way in which i could show gratitude i could introduce jhamboo to katie chae he could enjoy himself before returning to india and the scrap heap katie got rid of the intruder and turned her miraculous laughing face into mine still wearing the silly hat oh you lovely sexy briddish boy do you have a briddish cigarette for your o fren katie i produced cigarettes and we lit up i grasped her bottom katie you are the most gorgeous bit of goods i ever came across just fantastic she looked at me with almost closed eyes very chinese very sexy blowing smoke from her lungs mm your little margey warn you bout me i think she know the genuine hunnerd per cent quality item take my word this was not a moment at which i particularly wished to discuss margey i said im feeling better lets get back on the bed katie astonish me again you give me present this hat not enough anything oh you bring me five hunnerd player cigarette i was dismayed at the demand but dared not argue i said i would deliver as soon as possible if we could get back to bed no i must smoke now rest cigarettes first then more bed you unnerstand um that subject was dismissed she stood up now you not feel punk you like something to eat with visions of the way margey cooked for me i thought if she cooks likes she fucks and agreed it would be a good idea judging by my watches i estimated that it must be seven oclock you take me somewhere i know good place we go you strong enough oh you so strong man horry you take me good place eat she clapped her hands and looked very pleasantly at me she deflected a further attempt to return to bed almost before i knew what was what we were going down her stairs with katie chae clutching my arm in the friendliest way at least she left the felt hat behind dear addy its been too long since i wrote to you last but i suppose you recall all too well how days pass in the tropics how unable you feel to sit down and write letters so i will not make too many excuses anyhow thanks very much for your last letter leiden sounds like a very nice place and i was glad you had got a good office job and were feeling that you could settle down in the cold european climate soon you can think of me doing the same sort of thing somehow or other and i will write to you next from england meanwhile i have to give you some awful news i hardly know how to tell you you will have heard officially but i must also drop you a line at least you understand how bad things are out here in sumatra still clutching my fountain pen i began to examine my left foot i caught sight of it lying on the carpet moderately close to my right foot i rested it on the edge of the chair and picked at the callouses on the side of the big toe it smelt all right i had just had a shower and was clad only in a towel knotted round my waist there was still a trace of foot rot foot rot had followed me all the way from kohima almost two years ago a little bit of assam carried as indelibly on my body as in my heart this is sunday morning here in medan only yesterday morning your brother ernst took me out on a crocodile shoot with two of his friends only yesterday but two weeks would pass before addy got the letter yesterday would gradually sink back into the past like a dead log in a swamp but addy was always going to stub her foot on it my foot was still resting on the chair next to it fat and complacent slept my prick the towel had fallen back to reveal it it took no notice of me i tried to take no notice of it but christ it did look a bit red could be just natural soreness only to be expected five hundred players i padded over to a drawer in the bookcase and brought out a magnifying glass i had bought in padang under the glass my knob definitely looked spotty beneath the innocuousseeming surface lay a virulent scarlet rash just waiting to break out i inspected carefully round the rim nothing definite but that too was worrying in its way of course she had been with the shagging japs and it was well known what terrible diseases they brought with them out of the jungle when you caught that sort of thing the mo gave you a pack of krations and ordered you to march off into the bush and die despite my unease the bloody thing was stirring in my hand what fucking impertinence as if it had not had enough more than enough on the previous day i tucked it away under the towel where it could not see me the way old ladies cover the cage when the parrot swears too much i am sorry to have to tell you that we were ambushed by extremists things have got much worse here since you left worse for the dutch better for the british worse for just about everyone except the british who are pulling out presumably it was a gross military error to send us here in the first place some sort of mad global strategy involving the lunatics in command those wellknown good guys winston churchill joseph stalin and harry truman swathed in a welter of cigar pipe and fagsmoke had called together such chums as chiang kaishek and smuts and de gaulle and cooked up a series of instructions for various admirals and generals hanging about in the antechamber accordingly with a rattle of sabres zhukov montgomery eisenhower and macarthur trotted off with poland the suez canal half of berlin and all the pacific in their respective fangs lord louis mountbatten got lumbered with the nei well done masterstrategists the americans had been so busy clobbering british imperialism that they had hardly noticed the way the soviet union was sweeping various european states up its left trouserleg you can see with hindsight how the nei fell a bit beyond any major sphere of interest leaving aside the simple geographical fact that it lay somewhere to the south of singapore the only advantages accruing from the whole farcical operation was that the british under the splendid general templer became experienced enough to cope with communist infiltrators in malaya to kick them out and keep them out also we acted oncebitten twiceshy thereafter and refused to get involved in reinstating the french in indochina the good old americans stepped in to help promptly there so what if they lost the war they got lots of publicity internationally things seem to be in a terrible mess as before whatever became of peace im sure you will weep and ask yourself that poor dear addy and everyone else will ask themselves the same question alas for hope what should have happened in our time is simple the us should not have been so isolationist in the thirties then her diplomats and all the rest of them who proved so bloody unrealistic would have understood that the most feasible plan for world peace lay with the english speaking world by which i include people who can nearly speak english like indians australians and norwegians then the states would not have hung about on the touchlines for three years white britain took such a pasting from the fucking krauts mind you its possible that the yanks saw through the british weve fumbled all our chances the twentieth century hasnt even begun in england yet how we came out on top in two world wars ill never understand you have to admit we did need the americans to bale us out right so the soviet union signs that pact with hitler thereby showing its true colours underlining the basic similarity between fascism and communism so when hitler starts invading russia the allies cease chivvying him in the west and let him get on with it bombing germany stops and with the aid of the good old duke of windsor and mrs simpson hitler agrees in exchange to stop mopping up the jews so fast while this is going on in europe similar crafty moves are afoot in the east the japs are allowed to march into india the wogs are permitted to see how much they fucking well enjoy that within a year they are on their knees begging the british to come back none of our brave buggers are lost in one single lousy jungle out there throwing away their lives for sod all the japs who never know when enoughs enough stream northwards out of the khyber pass and start attacking the ussr through georgia the ussr strikes back jap kamikazi planes strafe vladivostok soviet air force bombs imperial palace jap sub fleet takes leningrad gradually the whole war is centred on germany poland and the soviet union right across to the pacific and including the japanese islands british and americans sit back peacefully now and then grabbing odd bits of the globe such as borneo malta africa the west indies iceland and tierra del fuego no one mucks about with poor old china meanwhile were making a whole mass of abombs when the germans the poles the ukrainians the russians the kurds the japs and anyone else who gets in the way are down to a few platoons slugging it out in yakutsk or some other dreadful place nobody has heard of the british and the yanks plaster the whole damn place with abombs we wipe out every single city and put the entire area under the plough from the rhine right the way east to the pacific including japan plant the whole bloody sheebang with oak or pine or whatever suits with barbed wire all round the perimeter and huge signs saying trespassers will be prosecuted peaceloving people who do not or prefer not to speak english such as the basques the israelis and the welsh are settled in new homelands in inner mongolia the arabs not to put too fine a point on it get the gobi quiet reigns the rest of the world receives free english lessons when you can speak english as fluently as any inhabitant of detroit or liverpool which isnt asking much you get a world passport not before then all we have to do really is conquer south america discover a final solution to the irish problem and sort things out with the blacks in comes an era of world peace such as has not been known before the chinese will be encouraged particularly the women chinese restaurants and knockingshops in every village its a simple plan it could work but what good are such utopian schemes supposing you did all that bastards like tertis would still float to the top and spoil it all ernst and his two pals were shot down in cold blood i shall be attending the funeral today and will think of you at the graveside fat lot of good that will do addy or ernst god im such a shit that sod hamil should really have done for me too instead of handing me a chit saying british excused death i mishandled that and ive mishandled the business with margey its no good ill just have to go home tomorrow as ordered as directed by global strategy fucking global strategy its just a few bastards at the top the trouble is theres always a constant supply of bastards underneath there is so much i could say which i cant write perhaps we shall be able to meet some day somewhere in europe ernst was very brave so you must be brave and try not to grieve too much i hope there are people to comfort you in leiden i send love and kisses to you from poor old brokendown medan yours lovingly it was difficult to imagine leiden or any dutch town had i once seen one of those traditional netherlands paintings showing chaps and girls skating on ice with folded arms and windmills and little brick brueghelesque houses complete with stalls and oxroasts labelled leyden fair i had left england when i was a mere kid now i was virtually an old man and europe was all a story to me the whole world was a story a sprawling picaresque telling itself on and on until some sort of contrived happy ending became possible last night when i took katie chae for a meal she had regaled me with episodes from her past life there was an exotic tale indeed katie had been born the only daughter of a rich chinese merchant in the province of sinkiang since i was forced to reveal that i had no idea where sinkiang was katie imperiously summoned a waiter and had paper and pen brought to our table she drew a map which i have to this day a big x marks the spot where katie chae was born it is one of the westmost parts of china almost as far west as delhi though thousands of miles north of delhi sinkiang lies north of the himalayas north of tibet and borders on afghanistan and some of the grottier bits of the soviet union the sort of remote place that no rightthinking englishman could ever get straight in his mind in the prosperous chae household three languages were spoken the sinkiang tongue which was the grand language the uighur tongue which was the language of servants and the kazakh tongue a language used only for boasting and swearing the chaes had two homes a stone house in the mountains for summer a wooden one for winter in the plains in the city of urumchi one spring the young katie and her mother and her two brothers were being driven to their summer residence bandits appeared and captured them they were taken into the mountains to await ransom the bandits were fierce kirghiz tribesmen of nomadic habit and for three years katie was continually on the move with them over the limitless grasslands of central asia this was her formative period she learned to ride ponies like the wind on this unending trek her mother died the ransom was never paid during a drunken fight the chief bandit suffered a headwound the tribe made its way to a desolate region of mudflats which extended further than eye could see in the distance snowcapped mountains floated on blue air everyone tied planks to their feet to serve as skis while they waded across the dangerous mudflats they walked over the mud for four days bandits and dogs drowned in the clinging stuff the survivors arrived at a low island rising above the mud it was no more than two hundred yards long and covered with stinking weed as the party dragged themselves exhausted on to the eminence they saw that on its far side lay a sullen river winding into the distance among shoals on the island remarkably a large wooden house had been built its windows were shuttered it was deserted here the bandits remained week after uncharted week they pulled fish from the sullen river and hunted crabs and a species of wild cat found on the mudbanks the chief bandit was going mad from his wound and filled the house night and day with his cries one of katies brothers drowned in the river whilst swimming the day dawned when a boat was sighted distantly on the waters the bandits became alarmed katie was sent out to signal to the craft the bandits took cover the boat pulled in to the island a handsome white man reefed the sail and climbed out the bandits sprang from their hiding places and seized him they flung him in the cellars of the house and tortured him this torture continued for many weeks one moonless night the bandit chief went raving mad he broke his bonds burst through a wooden wall and fired a musket at all and sundry he killed katies surviving brother in the general panic katie crept down to the cellar and released the white man together they escaped to his boat and cast off into the darkness when they had drifted some distance from the house from which shots and cries came faintly they ran up the sail by morning the old wooden building was almost out of sight the mans name was john he was an english explorer he spoke a little kazakh and he and katie conversed in that language he said that he had escaped from kazakhstan where he had been held prisoner by russians he was gentle and kindly and took katies virginity in the bottom of the boat before the sun was an hour above the horizon as during our meal dish followed dish so adventure followed adventure katie and john were completely lost at one time they remained many months in a country where the people were so impoverished that they lived off dried apricots and small birds caught during annual migrations in another place john performed simple conjuring tricks which so alarmed the inhabitants that they presented him and katie chae with their one means of transport the ancient village yak on condition that john left immediately and never returned they rode the yak for a period which could have been two years forging ever eastwards until one bitter night the animal died they passed days beside its carcass drying strips of its meat curing the hide to make themselves warmer clothes and eating the brains and more tender parts by now katie spoke fairly fluent english and could recite those parts of the rubiy t of omar khayym which john remembered as they were leaving the bones of the yak they were attacked by two savage brothers one of whom had had his tongue cut out by chinese soldiers both of them had their way with katie who was now possibly fifteen after that they proved friendly promising to escort john and katie towards the fabulous city of peking that haven was still a thousand miles away over impossible territory the incidents in the story multiplied richly there is delight in hearing tales of starvation whilst tucking into great bowls of fried rice crab octopus sea cucumber and nameless things katie and i refilled each others glasses with a poisonous wine while i goaded her on with her story i came to the conclusion that she had invented all of it just as one of my first loves virginia had invented a more desirable version of her past such tactics seemed to me then and still do a recipe for misery except of course for the listener and even he has to have a special taste for such inventions among other highlights in her imaginary career katie claimed that she and the mysterious englishman john were captured at a customs post ruled over by a luxurious customs official called ha ha bum a name not lightly forgotten attracted by katies youth and beauty ha ha bum made her his favourite concubine john was imprisoned and each one of ha ha bums fornications was scored upon johns back with a leather whip one day in spring the customs post was attacked by a party of men from the hills they claimed they were not bandits but revolutionaries their conduct was not easy to distinguish from banditry since they killed ha ha bum took john prisoner set fire to the customs post and raped katie although they read passages from karl marx while so doing the revolutionaries formed a small communist army they numbered some two hundred men they had a stronghold in the hills together with a very old armoured car which had to be pushed everywhere women and children lived among them the communists were suspicious of all foreigners after a mocktrial they decided to execute john as an imperialist before the entire company they heard him recite passages from omar khayym and that was enough katie however discovered their plans from one of the women and persuaded the leaders that john could be exchanged for another armoured car or possibly for petrol when they reached civilisation katie gave birth to a child in this camp a little girl with fair hair who was put to death after another mocktrial you must have wept i exclaimed katie chae laughed i wanted to weep a lot she said but the climate was plenty dry a plate full of satie came along as we tucked in she continued her saga leaving the hills behind the ragged army entered a terrible barren area destitute of grass destitute even of a single stone it was a frigid desert of rock in which some of the revolutionaries went mad from drinking their own urine in the middle of a dust storm they stumbled upon an amazing city built of white marble and totally uninhabited the city was constructed in the shape of a great square with sixtyfour buildings to a side the outermost buildings facing the desert were modest but each succeeding row of buildings as they progressed towards the centre became larger and more grand finally in the centre of the four thousand and ninetysix buildings they came across a gigantic structure where the centremost four buildings merged into one this structure towered to the heavens its antechambers were panelled with gold the army crouched in the golden antechambers and slept until the sandstorm passed such were the resonances the buildings set up with the wind currents that by morning the whole city was swept clear of sand in this way the city could never be buried katie chae had been pressed into military service as a nurse she was tending the sick when scouts came in and reported that this magnificent token of human life in the midst of the death of nature was nothing more nor less than a mortuary the thousands of houses were but glorified tombs each enshrining a mummified corpse the central building enshrined the king of this lost nation in alarm the revolutionaries rapidly quitted this megapolis of death and shrine of capitalism they forged eastward again eventually they entered the inner kingdom through a break in the great wall john had by now been elected a leader of the revolutionaries his manner became remote and dedicated katie went through a form of marriage with one of the other leaders bearing him two more children both boys somewhere in the north of shansi the main body of the army was ambushed in a pass and had to fight john was slain katie was captured and of course raped some time later they arrived by boat at a port on the gulf of chihli katie fell desperately ill some spanish nuns looked after her and with one of them maria katie had a lesbian affair which aided her convalescence in the town she met a chinese journalist and fell in love with him her first real love affair only to find that he was one of her older brothers who had long ago left sinkiang for the cities the japanese armies were advancing she and this brother were the last to escape from the port both disguised as nuns following many travels they found sanctuary in sumatra after a year the japanese entered medan and there was no further escape she showed me a photograph of her brother over a last glass of wine it was the journalist chae who called himself tiger balm perhaps her incredible story was partially true we staggered back to her flat arm in arm i spent the night with her lying in her spotless arms embracing history geography as well as a tender female body she woke me just before dawn and i made my way grudgingly back to our lines with my revolver ready in my fist i owed her fifteen hundred cigarettes it was one of those mornings sunday heat guilt at least i had written to addy that was a decent act even shits act decently on occasion since doing good is as tempting as doing harm the incipient sores on my prick were nothing to the sores on my conscience i had spent the night with margeys enemy the hated katie chae margey would be bound to find out or katie would see to it that she found out the sooner i got away from medan the better that was the other worry i had to tell margey properly that marriage was off had never been on the cards that id been mad maybe she already knew as scores of girls in her position had found out that necessity rules despite all protestations of love yesterdays killings had persuaded me working on my cowardice and my age that sumatra was no place for europeans ernsts and jans fate would be mine if i stayed medan was under the curse of change so i should steel myself to inform margey that i was yellow no that was the wrong expression in the circumstances that i was scared that way she would keep her selfrespect she would survive bloody margey what a pain in the neck she was making me feel so bad just because we went to bed together and separately all the things i had given her guilt guilt if i got rid of her smartly enough today then maybe i could have another look in at katie chae christ what a fantastic gift katie chae had her gift was no less than the gift of being a poet musician or philosopher while that radiance shone on me i must bloody well bask in it margey could go to hell if it allowed me one more session with katie chae that slender elegant creature older now and wiser i can see that there was something in katies makeup which encouraged full response everywhere there are women like that who instinctively fan the great masculine fire just as there are women who instinctively quell it i fell into an intense erotic daze tomorrow the plane there were things to be done if i could exert myself to do them somehow or other i must face margey this morning she would be back from brastagi then this afternoon was the funeral of sontrop de zwaan and nieuwenhuis to which i had volunteered to go after that katie chae from the canteen i bought fifteen hundred players in thirty round tins of fifty each katie you understand you want no promises you utter no promises you would never regret that i was leaving tomorrow you are always on good terms with men and so another man will always come along to treat you well to worship your gift you are truly fortunate katie even war only brings you more profit you dont piss around with marriage and security arrangements youre a priestess of the worlds oldest religion or maybe i should shoot myself i took my revolver out and placed it on my little green table next to the envelope addressed to leiden my gaze went to it as i dressed as i sat and put on my boots and puttees a compact businesslike machine i weighed it in my hand pressed the muzzle against my temple holstered it and went downstairs into the bright the burning sunshine cushy for some said a deep voice and wallace from the orderly room mess tins dangling at the end of his simian arm ambled by that man i shouted in my sergeants voice get your back up walk like a man not a ruptured fucking dromedary he looked back grinned offered me two fingers one of bloody corporal kyles men of course the sergeants mess was regularly full of walking wounded at breakfast time i was late five bods remained there ron dyer sitting alone on one side of the table resting his hairy belly on its edge and rsm payne jock ferguson scubber and charlie meadows in a desolate huddle at the top end watch your vehicles dyer called as i entered the others just twitched get knotted i responded pleasantly taking a seat opposite dyer our dining room was undistinguished painted in a pale lime green calculated to make anyone entering with a hangover feel ten times worse only a year before jap officers had lodged here they had filled the room with grotesquely heavy gothic furniture looted from the dutch eagles bears and corpulent rosettes studded this menacing woodwork there was also a large coloured print of fujiyama which dickie payne had insisted should not be removed the chinese orderly appeared to tell me that breakfast was all pinnish i cut him off with a request for coffee a neglected piece of toast lay on the table as i scoffed it i inspected the quartet on my right payne had eyes like pissholes in the snow jock was no better charlie somewhat worse wally scubber looked like a ghost ever tried black tartan wombat i asked charlie answered in a frail husk of a voice conveying as much information as possible in as few words as possible malacca refined palm spirit death you lads never learn dyer belched looking pale yourself stubbs what have you been up to i contemplated one of the eagles perched stiffly high behind his head ive been wondering whether to shoot myself if you must know dont waste the ammunition we might need it for a better cause i suppose you realise that the bors held a party for you last night only you didnt show up discourtesy bad for relationships between ncos and other ranks wouldnt you say or i suppose you couldnt care less like everyone else in this shower fuck the bors ive no doubt they managed to get blind drunk without me as on every other saturday night the orderly brought coffee and poured me a cup dyer reluctantly pushed the sugar across and relaxed his inquisitorial act as he lit a cigarette ah first of the day always the best yes they were really going at it last night a bacchanalia disgusting dont mention drink payne whispered clutching his head never again ron dyer blew smoke into the air and continued as if he had not heard mind you they had provocation give them that the jap stores delivered them a whole crate of crme de menthe yesterday afternoon you know cr me de menthe that green muck windmill street whores drink in the bar of the regent palace youd know more about that than i would the coffee was almost cold i swigged it with distaste watching charlie light a fag with trembling hand and half listening to dyer the jap officers must have indulged in similar conversations while the same waiters served the same lousy coffee i had a sad feeling that here i was involved in this sordid affair of drink spunk and shootups and all the white there was another horatio a saner kinder man who had become lost amid the machinery of alternatives which proliferate in time of war i wondered if i would ever find him again but a whole crate thats fortyeight bottles the silly so andsos were going at it like nobodys business all clutching pint glasses full of the stuff howd you fancy a nice fresh pint of crme de menthe right now jock away with ye husked jock ferguson coughing fruitily into a handkerchief i looked in on them at curfew and they were going full blast like savages throwing up everywhere you never saw such a night ah well ron brutal and licentious soldiery as shakespeare has it not once or twice in our fair island story has the road to ruin proved the path to glory i thought that was fairly bright for a man in the throes of terminal syphilis but dyer ploughed on unmoved shaking ash into the remains of marmalade on his plate at two in the morning you could hear their gramophone still going they debagged corporal kyle so i heard raving drunk bad soldiering there will be some thick heads round there this morning i poured myself another cup of coffee undrinkable if truth be told good news about that cunt kyle anyway i had completely forgotten the bors party happy though i was to have missed total immersion in cr me de menthe appearing to snub the other ranks was just one more thing to feel bad about i rose from the table nodded to the rsm and clapped ron dyer on his bare shoulder as i went by cheero ron see you in the bar of the regent palace some time merdeka outside the mess three swart members of the indian pioneer corps were pulling planks and tarpaulins about trying to repair the cover of the cesspit their sluggish movements suggested that they were not optimistic about the outcome medan on a sunday morning was quieter than usual all the shops were shut the dutch and such of the local population as had been converted to protestantism were at church singing european hymns to a european god this might be one of the chief cities of the new indonesian republic but it chugged along still under the mores of a netherlands provincial town one of my watches said five to ten and the other nearly a quarter to eleven so i reckoned it must be at least eleventwenty when i wound them both vigorously i was making the loudest noise in the street my last days in sumatra return vividly as i write although they have been stored away forgotten for years yet i cannot remember any part of the way from our lines to the kesawan except for the railway crossing a point of danger only an old faded photograph reminds me of what the de boer club looked like this must be because whenever i walked that way my head was pleasantly filled with thoughts of women my surroundings scarcely registered which suggests a new reason why people recall the days of their childhood so clearly childhood is the only time of life when ones brain is not preoccupied with hopes regrets recollections lecherous anticipations of the other sex naturally the story of katies adventures was stuffed with lies all those rape fantasies for instance she gloried in sex i asked her where she acquired her knowledge of the art of love she replied that it all came from the spanish nun that could have been said in order to titillate me you would never get to the bottom of all the mysteries about katie chae tomorrow my flight to singapore there i would have to hang about in nee soon transit camp until the old otranto arrived for the voyage home which could mean a wait of up to a fortnight would katie come over and visit me for that period if i paid her we could probably get a room in nee soon village there were some quite striking houses where the arabs sold rugs and pouffes i had plenty of backpay but how many cigarettes would it take what a swine i was to even think of such a thing above all first i must get things straight with margey in the chinese quarter the ambonese were taking over the pavement strolling and stretching and calling to each other big amiable black men sat at the open windows of their billet tuning guitars or cleaning machineguns christ amboina must be some place shitehawks swooped above the street hoping that the guns would go off on the corner of bootha street the restaurant was open and doing no business two waiters lolled outside smoking we exchanged greetings i made an effort to quicken my pace the signs of mourning were still on margeys weatherbeaten door the exotic characters had curled up in the sun like flabby hedgehogs an overnight rainstorm had caused the red dye of the paper to run down the door where it resembled the blood of a leukaemia victim the white flowers had died and were infested with small flies a paper casket stood on the table in the middle of the room surrounded by fresh flowers it was an emblem of the real coffin now decently buried the processes of corruption are fast on the equator maggots burst out of eyes not closed twentyfour hours since several old people with the wrinkled walnut faces age etches on the chinese were shuffling round the room the brastagi relations no doubt inevitably boring old fat was there sitting in one corner smoking watchfully on a bamboo chair tipped back against the wall he called to me beckoning with a languid paw ha so missa stuss you so kine come bag this house gain after rong ti i no spec you come bag this house any more ti you go fry bag ingrant he made plane noises and zoomed his hand around to help convey his meaning i didnt think much of the standard of imitation all the same he deflected me enough to try and solve a minor mystery i asked fat how it was that tiger balm katie chaes brother came here when margey so hated katie chae as far as i could understand his answer the tiger balms of this world were lofty pillars of the local chinese community while the hwan fat sians of this world were lowly worms the tiger balms had established the hwans in accommodation in their hour of need money also changed hands but from whom to whom and exactly why or how earned i could not determine cutting short a rambling socioeconomic survey in pidgin i said wheres margey fat upstairs you priss no worry margey he jerked his thumb towards the back yard margey busy do prenty wor he spoke feelingly as if suffering from the same complaint going moodily to the rear i caught sight of margey through the glass door she was in her working pyjamas bent double over an old bucket sunshine hit the wall behind her as i pushed the door open i saw that she was doing something vigorous with water washing a pair of fats winter trousers or drowning a turkey were two possibilities that sprang to mind hello margey spoken rather coolly this could be my last meeting with her and i wished everything to be dignified and decent she looked up from the bucket smiling and frowning as she straightened i saw how small she was how lost she would look on number one platform kings cross or in the bar of the regent palace then she flicked her head scowled and went back to the washingdrowning operations turning her back on me if anything this response made me feel worse than the terminal syphilis did entering the yard i circled her in order to get a look at her face missed you yesterday margey furious scrubbing was her answer you didnt tell me you were going to brastagi margey savage scrubbing the turkey was getting hell stop that margey and pay attention ive got a present for you without ceasing operations she said i no want your beastly present you give to one your other girls this was going to be tricky sounds as if you had a bad time in brastagi im off if you wont speak to me properly she gave a grunt her face was red with anger like a little fury she whirled round swinging the turkeytrousers above her head i was trapped in a corner of the yard as i instituted the first impulses of retreat margey struck me with the sopping object squarely across the head and shoulders caught off balance i fell backwards and sprawled in the filthy yard the bag with the presents broke scattering goods across the flagstones margey leapt upon me still beating me with the lethal object and screaming as she did so water drops flew up into the air sparkling as they dropped again why i speak you properly hogpizzle what you do deserve i speak you properly you low thing i go brastagi only for family duty first i watch for you like proper faithful china girl you no come here yeserday like you promise why you no come here like you promise aeiya you dirty disease soldier you no care where margey am if i live or dead protecting my face with my arms i struggled to my feet she continued to beat me by now i was drenched from head to foot and the turkey hurt pack it in you stupid bitch im soaked i had to go crocodileshooting how did i know you were suddenly going to disappear why didnt you leave me a note youre so bloody educated arent you she stopped beating me as she gathered what i had said we stood staring at each other panting heavily even flecked with suds she looked immaculate dirty water poured from my shoulders i heard a scuffle behind me fat and the brastagi relations were jostling for a good view of the quarrel in fury i grabbed up the jar of red currant jelly which lay by my font and hurled it at fats face fortunately i missed the window the jar struck the stone wall and broke enormous wasps the size of carrots descended on the red chunks of goo as they hit the flagstones you call it crocodileshooting now hey you manpig i know what you get up direct moment my back is turn you same like all men no sense only for that stinking thing in your pants she kicked one of the tins of sardines flying why you not have more respec go and stick that that hairy blood sausage up any dirty disease hole comes along you foreign monster pig shit pizzle bumhole she shook her head as she spat the words out with a scream she began to larrup me with the drowned object again i grabbed it and wrenched it from her cut out this bloody senseless useless yelling for christs sake what the hell are you going on about i did bloody go crocodileshooting yesterday and nearly got myself killed while you were pissing about in brastagi instead of showing any remorse she jumped at me and grabbed back the drowned thing there she stood silent and dramatic regarding me with haunted eyes clutching her elbows as i had seen ida lupino do she held the pose long enough to strike terror into my heart ignoring the wasps which zoomed about us then she lifted an accusing finger and began on a new tack speaking slowly at first i see i unnerstand all what you say horatio you shit sergeant you go crocodileshooting yeserday and thats why today in the bazaar katie chae wear new blue felt hat with matching silk ribbon is it on the last words her voice rose to a bloodchurning scream of triumph even the onlookers flinched she knew i was undone i was undone pointless to try and argue that there was in fact no casual connection between the crocodileshoot and the hatbestowal after one or two false starts during which i was screamed down i tried the redherring tactic of explaining that the hat in no way represented payment for services rendered or at least had not been obtained originally as an object intended for presentation in exchange for services rendered and indeed had been procured only with extreme reluctance by the accused who had regarded himself as rooked at the time of the transaction and who furthermore had not in his innocence anticipated any services whatsoever being offered never mind rendered and moreover who had he had the wit to anticipate the full generous delicious and oftrepeated nature of those services would probably have procured not one but half a dozen fucking blue felt hats lying diseased dogswine pizzle shit she waved her fists above her head stamping her foot at the same time how you think i feel i just turn my back only one day for duty go and fetch honoured relatives to this place of mourning and gloomy reverences and you you who say you love me you swine liar you at once go madly fucking and distributing hats to all biggest whores in medan what are you saying you bitch all all not all but at least biggest that katie chae how many times i warn you about katie chae every day i tell you i hate that disease whore i tell you stay away katie chae no speak her even you smile like a puppydog then direct moment my back is turn bish you in bed with her and stick that filthy prick of your up her dirty evil hole jesus god cant you understand you fucking deprave blighty soldiermurderbastard i no want touch you any more after you go lie with that whore i pulled the drowned thing from her grasp it was a garment of some totally inscrutable kind and flung it into a pile of crap at the back of the yard look for gods sake margey calm down will you and stop calling katie chae a whore too or ill get angry we met by chance if you must know so what we did wasnt whoring okay im sorry if you are upset but it wasnt planned and no whoring no whoring she screamed shaking her head so that her hair swirled round her neat neck you say no whoring what you think that katie chae is how much she charge you eh how much ill bloody belt you in a minute dont you talk to me about whoring rosey why i no talk just why when i ever make charge to you horatio maybe you like better deprave girl who charge high price you scumsergeant you may just have noticed that ive come round this morning to see you not katie bloody good welcome you give me i give you some good welcome i hate her i hate her she started slapping me with her hands i caught her thin wrists the feel of her made me more angry i lifted her off the ground and swung her to and fro i dont know what katies done to you but just dont take it out on me calm down or ill beat you oh oh oh you kill me margey struggled furiously in my grip she take all my men thats all why i hate that poxy whore what she got thats so good poor margey dont have i like to know every time every time katie chae make poor margey disgrace margey real good girl and be faithful to her horry yet this terrible katie chae she take him away so easy in one day just one lousy day and charge too high price i bet when i set her down she covered her face and wailed now the selfpity act intuitively i saw what would follow the cuddles the kisses the making up the unbidden promises to take her with me to singapore to england the offers of marriage i knew my own weakness in that respect bringing up my hand i gave her a wallop on her shapely little bum she let out a marvellous yell of rage once started it sounded as if it would never stop heads popped up over the wall and popped down again while margey was still in no more than midyell she shook her head letting her dark hair scatter across her face while she waved her fists at my nose you dare hit china girl you smelling rapist dog oh oh oh may the gods see this bad hit and pass judgement to cut off your pisscock you bastard man ged out of here out out out away murderer never speak me once more time again another scream decibels flying i decided that was it turning to flee i struck my head on the lintel of the door wasps wheeled about me bearing blondlike gobbets of jelly the pause gave her time enough to snatch up the bucket of dirty water with aim and energy born of fury she flung it even as i reeled from contact with the doorway striking at stars and wasps i got the works in the nape of my neck i blundered through the establishment scattering water over cowering brastagi relations barging past fat running for safety yelling for help youll be lucky if you get off tomorrow stubbs you know that nothing in sumatra ever runs to time the bloody van heutsz never turned up at belawan yesterday charlie meadows and johnny mercer were helping me pack my two tin trunks were full ida lupino and the monkey god were down off the wall they filled me in on the van heutsz the rapwi convoy under an escort of south wales borderers had arrived at belawan the previous afternoon to await the ship it never came the whole party was forced to return to medan before darkness fell later a message was received from singapore to say that engine trouble had developed the boat would arrive twentyfour hours late so today the convoy was setting out hopefully again the raf will do better by me tomorrow i said face it horry in your subconscious youre longing to get back to a heros welcome said mercer i kept thinking about the city of the dead katie chae had described wondering that even people who lived in frigid deserts should be prodigal enough to provide so grandly for their dead the revolutionaries with whom katie was living at the time claimed that the nearest marble quarry was a seven week journey away what were such people like i asked myself nobody could tell me that only if i went there travelling the ground myself would i be able to find some sort of answer to the question and when i got home to england when people asked me what kind of people lived in medan in sumatra there was no sort of answer i could give that would satisfy me let alone them there was no answer the people who lived in sumatra were absolutely like everyone else and totally different it was possible that nobody would ask the question they would not want to know i visualised england itself as a sort of mortuary in a frigid desert sweatinghot sumatra was where the marble was quarried meanwhile my bloody neck ached from the impact of that wellaimed bucket the dutch cemetery occupied a site on the outskirts of medan near the deli river it was entirely surrounded by a low piaster wall with yew hedges on the inner side of the wall shelter was afforded by catalpas and plane trees such as you might find i suppose in any small dutch town i was touched by the way the dutch clung to their dutchness on the equator though i grew impatient when the british did the same kind of thing in india a smart ambonese guard paraded at the entrance to the cemetery where one of their jeeps was parked in the shade sitting in the jeep was a white officer operating a wireless set the dutch were maintaining their customary state of alert they knew what a good opportunity an event like a funeral provided for indonesian surprise attacks also parked under the trees was a threetonner and a jeep with div flashes the threetonner had brought a military escort of south wales borderers who were parading at ease inside the cemetery the jeep belonged to jhamboo singh representing british officialdom there was a section of white dutch troops in the cemetery together with civilians with black crepe bands round their arms relations of the dead men all told not a large turnout a good percentage of the dutch community was at belawan enjoying the timehonoured sport of waiting for the van heutsz i ripped jhamboo singh off a salute and said i dont suppose this will take too long will it sir jhamboo rammed a cigaretteholder between his white teeth and said sgt stubbs you have come to this place to render your final respects to three brave men as such you are a representative of both the british and the indian army your turnout is a disgrace why is that he was himself dapper as usual twinkling from capbadge to shoes his kd uniform was freshly starched and ironed without wrinkle or sign of sweat he was fragrant by contrast my jungle green was already wet under the arms and between my shoulderblades my old bushhat veteran of assam and burma campaigns drooped nonchalantly over my face my bar of medal ribbons also slanted a little across my left breastpocket sorry sir im an old campaigner sir i done myself up smart as i could i did sergeant not i done i detest slovenly english in ncos that way leads to slovenly discipline your belt has not seen blanco at least one whole week please get it attended to yes sir you know im timeexpired indeed so are the dead we are here to honour his expression was lamblike but grim a sheep contemplating destiny i dismissed and moved away either he was regretting being so friendly earlier or he was just staging a little public officer behaviour as we were speaking a vehicle drove into the cemetery a bluejowled dutch army chaplain jumped out and began to supervise in a businesslike way the unloading of three coffins each coffin was covered with a dutch flag on the top of which lay three small bouquets of flowers at the same time three kitehawks arrived and perched in the highest tree nearby to remind us that even if mens souls belonged to god their bodies were excellent protein it was my feeling that the dutch civilians knew who i was and wanted nothing to do with me they did not even look in my direction we fell into file behind the coffins and the armed escort our heads bent in the hot sun directly we were drawn up beside the newly dug graves the chaplain started to speak his delivery was brisk and unsentimental his pace reminded me of the crocodilehunt in time of danger everything is done at the double all eyes were on him or downcast on the fresh earth in that earth little avid things moved worms centipedes beetles in particular their carapaces glinting blue or viridian as they scurried down into the hole it wouldnt take them long to bore into the boxes their work too was done at the double although i couldnt tell what the old boy with the dogcollar under his uniform was saying i hoped he was making reference to the shitehawks and the beetles and having a word to say about how the tropics are much better than cold climates at setting life and death slap up against one another practically in a copulating position it was hard not to think of death in medan as hot and ardent rather than cold the image came back to me of the three men lying in curious attitudes on the godown floor but its force had been eroded by the ministrations of katie chae perhaps the old boy was chuntering on about sontrop being a practising homosexual well that was another thing you couldnt practice six feet under there was a law against it down there plus a similar law against fucking as the stream of dutch flowed by us i let my gaze wander a british army vehicle was drawing up on the other side of the wall someone was late the coffins with their bouquets already wilting in the heat were about to be lowered the vehicle was a ginpalace that was curious i found myself looking for something before i knew what i was looking for the word merdeka stencilled in yellow paint just behind the cab it wasnt there it was not our vehicle this was one of the ginpalaces stolen from belawan this ginpalace would be packed with indonesians because of its british origins it could slide in beside the unsuspecting ambonese guard at the gate without being challenged i was standing with jhamboo behind the south wales borderers who were raising their rifles to fire a salute as the coffins were lowered i seemed to stand there for ever frozen while that dark vehicle glided in under the shading trees then i grabbed the arm of the second lieutenant who was in charge of the borderers detail i blurted a warning jolly good he said thanks so much everyone take cover behind the wall schnell schnell take cover haast haast people were pretty haast mourners and soldiers alike jhamboo grasped immediately what was happening as a dutch major turned angry at the interruption jhamboo explained and pointed out the ginpalace the majors grey eyes lit his head thrust forward i never saw pugnacity overtake a man so fast his little white moustache crackled with static he was a wellbuilt man with greying crewcut hair and one of those distorted mouths you find on people condemned to spending a lifetime talking dutch he made it to the cemetery wall at a run cleared it with a flying leap and gave the word to the ambonese the indonesians seeing their ruse was discovered flung wide the rear doors of the ginpalace and opened fire they had a japanese machinegun mounted on the floor of the vehicle the sod behind it bared his teeth as he let go his first burst from the cab another extremist fired a light machinegun the whole sunlit afternoon started to go up in smoke take cover dont panic yelled jhamboo he ran up to the wall drawing his revolver the coffinbearers let go of the ropes down went the coffins plunging headfirst into the ground everyone dived for cover one matron jumped in after the coffins the good old borderers commenced rapid fire molotov cocktails started to explode among the graves amateur things in old red fox cans without great force the indonesians had been caught on the hop their quick strike had misfired even the machinegun mounted as it was on the floor of the ginpalace was incapable of firing over the top of the wall into the cemetery it could only create havoc outside the gates yet the place quickly looked like a battlefield with the explosions from the molotov cocktails the ambonese those guitarplaying brigands were in the thick of the fight jhamboo and i were behind a tree firing intermittently with poor vision forward our little universe consisted almost entirely of lunatic noise with bullets flying everywhere it was easy to imagine that the ambonese had been killed every last man jack of them in that first spray of machinegun fire the threeton lorry on the other side of the wall was hit in its petrol tank its cab was immediately enveloped in flame the fire jumped upwards catching the canvas which burned fiercely next minute the flames were in the catalpas above our heads and smoke blew across the scene the borderers kept up their fire the sod in the cab of the ginpalace was knocked out cab windows burst outwards and screaming came from inside the ginpalace gave a convulsive jerk and began moving off in a series of lurches its rear doors swung to and fro the machinegun was still firing the gunner lying flat on the floor heat from the blazing lorry and tree drove jhamboo and me to find fresh cover the ginpalace moved through the smoke up the cobbled street ambonese scrambled from beneath it they had dived for shelter between its wheels when the firing began the major with the crewcut had climbed on top of the vehicle and was trying to ram a mills bomb through its ventilator he sprawled on the roof with his legs dangling as the vehicle wove its course away from the scene of battle inside the vehicle behind the machinegunner two members of the tri were running from side to side in complete panic the borderers abruptly held their fire they would not risk hitting the major comparative quiet fell we watched as the vehicle jerked away up the road both its rear tyres flat one of the ambonese who had taken shelter under the gin palace was still hanging on and being dragged along on his back over the cobbles he had his left arm hooked over the generator towbar at the rear of the vehicle in his right hand was a grenade he lobbed it in it exploded the force of the blast came our way leaves from trees swirled past us the shock released me from a kind of spell i tore myself from cover and ran out through the gate into the street all danger was over i heard myself laughing insanely the ambonese who had flung the grenade was lying on the cobbles protecting his head with one arm as if dead the interior of the gharry was in flames filled with smoke and ghastly bloody things writhing about the dutch major had been flung clear by the explosion and actually landed on his feet he stood in the middle of the street shouting and shaking his fist at the ginpalace which retreated in a series of frantic leaps and bounds up the road veering first to one side and then the other like an epileptic wallaby orders were shouted in dutch and english metalshod army boots clattered on cobbles jhamboo was reassuring the civilians the military assembled in the street the borderers spread out to guard the area while chaos was regularised despite the havoc only one man had been killed the radio operator in the dutch jeep one ambonese had been shot in the upper arm he was a meaty fellow his mates brought him to sit in the grass against the wall while his sergeant examined the wound he smiled showing white teeth several other people suffered minor scratches and grazes nothing serious the dutch major declined to be examined the threetonner was a writeoff we got the jeeps to safety and let the trees burn with commanding calm the dutch padre returned to the graveside and completed the service he finished by saying a few words in english our duties here today are to those who passed over but we pray that the lord will also bring comfort to the hearts of those who still frequent the scene of events we all hope to gain life everlasting until such time life is more important than death ernst would not have been displeased by the manner of his burial i felt a pricking behind the eyes as we filed out of the cemetery under the smouldering trees where the stink of cordite lingered like an ugly perfume the incident convinced me that i no longer had stomach for the incidents of war it really was time to go home the radio operator had sent a warning message through before he died as the last amens were said fresh vehicles and troops arrived a lieutenant directed them in pursuit of the enemy ginpalace the mourners retired to the funeral parlour which stood almost opposite the burial ground first aid was given to the lightly wounded and big tots of genever to everyone the ambonese of course were left outside on guard jhamboo was the only nonwhite present in the parlour the general consensus of opinion was that my timely warning had saved everyone from following sontrop and co into the grave drinks and big fat cigars were thrust upon me i was engulfed in broken english and goldtoothed smiles an aged aunt of jan de zwaans who had spent the war interned in a jap prison camp made everyone drink a toast to me shame rose red in my cheeks if only they knew how the heart to fight so strong in assam had left me if theyd seen me crying in the godown i thanked them when i announced that i was starting on the road back to england the next day they cried and protested and more drink went the rounds jhamboo insisted on shaking my hand too acute observation on your part sergeant stubbs you add one more small detail to the heroism of the british and indian armies the empire depends on such valour tomorrow i shall break this wretched o section mutiny by facing the men myself that im determined you will be in the air then but you must think of me facing my very last challenge as a commissioned officer i shall shoot to kill if they charge at me and you will read the incident in the times actually i think it was hangovers as much as mutiny sir nonsense nonsense mutiny is mutiny and i shall stand firm ill be thinking of you sir good luck sir thank you sergeant stubbs his moustache vibrated we saluted each other the dutch major with the crewcut applauded after all this it was inevitable that we moved en masse to the dutch majors bungalow in the rapwi area there was a sense of surprise when we emerged from the undertakers parlour into the street to find that the burntout lorry was still there and the trees by the cemetery still smouldering i was bundled into a civilian car where i immediately started to weep ginflavoured tears on some womans shoulder at the majors place music flowed as well as drink the major began to laugh a great deal several attractive pushers showed up wearing lowcut dresses a party got under way everyone became lighthearted even the older people and jans aged auntie a gramophone was brought in a big gleaming blonde took charge of it and played dark town strutters ball over and over ill be round to meet you in a taxi honey better be ready bout a halfpast eight everyone was dancing jhamboo grabbed a small blonde i grabbed the big gleaming one ya gotta be there when the band starts playing she sang warmly moistly in my ear after a little while i went into another room and wept again my indian watch had stopped during the shooting i wound both watches and wept for their inefficiency which embodied nameless things the crewcut major tiptoed in with a woman patted my shoulder and said we all owe our lives to you bullshit i seized his hand and said i wish i had your superb courage proud to know you then we both wept or maybe that did not happen at all i was not so much drunk as intoxicated theres such a difference between friendly people and people who are friends some while later a surge of new guests entered the bungalow cries and uproar preceded them it was sunset time had passed laughs groans cheers shrieks wild shouting in a foreign tongue greeted the newcomers a woman left me rushing towards the door and throwing herself into the arms of a blond male replica of herself the commotion was a mystery to me alienation closed in i did not know how to get away the major jumped on an armchair and called for silence he made an announcement greeted with mad catcalls and jeers and a sort of generalised frenzy i realised that the dutch were stark flaming mad two little ugly orderlies rushed in with boxes full of lager bottles and the party started up again the wrong party i shouted at one of the orderlies grabbing up a bottle of lager im at the wrong party i determined to escape i lurched into the other room and there thats silly i thought there before me were maurice boyer and his light o love they were surrounded by a crowd of people predominantly female all in a high old state of animation something remarkable was happening on or to raddles face the head was nodding in a manner suggestive of laughter the mouth was hanging open tears were running from her eyes slime from her nose at the same time her whole considerable body was heaving back and forth with such a violent motion that saliva tears and slime were scattered about the crowd happily the crowd was engaged in similar activity although to a less marked degree recalling raddles ability to vomit i marvelled at this new feat of expression before realising that i was watching someone simultaneously laughing and crying at the top of her bent boyer was standing with his back to raddle talking emotionally to two men gesticulating in a manner foreign to him when she caught sight of me she burst past the dutch women and threw herself into my arms in a scatter of various moistures oh stewbs stewbs i never think i see your drunken face more she gave me a big perspiring kiss like a smack in the face with a hot slug i clutched a lot of her oh you are a darling i thought youd gone for good plaything of fate she was incoherent i mopped her face a nice woman for all her faults we started dancing round boyer arrived he had stopped laughing i had started laughing what the fuck are you doing here sir its the blewdy van heutsz stewbs began raddle when boyer produced a large handkerchief and also mopped her face he worked with broad punitive strokes what are you doing here stubbs this is an officers party i was invited along well lets not hear any more about your personal troubles right everyone here has got blithering personal troubles you dont see any other noncommissioned officers do you dont be like that maurice said raddle starting to go into her laughingcrying routine again its not his fault the blewdy van heutsz ran ashore on the sandbag have a drink sir i said proffering a bottle not black tartan wombat is it a look of paranoia crossed his face its lager sir heineken stomach hasnt recovered from that other filthy muck yet he took my bottle and started to swig between swigs and interruptions he adopted a mellower tone now that i had put raddle down and explained what had happened as the old girls just intimated the blithering boat ran against a sandbank or a sunken wreck nobody knows which exactly in belawan harbour about two miles offshore you know how shallow it is there or maybe you dont i do he had finished off my lager destiny plays a charade with us stewbs fate amewses himself with abrupt twists of the tale there its stuck until they can get a tug from singapore to tow it off everyones had to return to medan second day on the trot so raddle and i have been granted a few extra days bliss together it was meant to be maurice my husband will be so fewrious but such coincidences are in our stars we are their pewpets they fell on each other as different couples were doing all around belawan harbour was extremely shallow and the channel had not been dredged since before the war boats with any draught worth speaking of had to stand off two miles or more out to sea their goods and passengers were ferried ashore in lcts geography had assisted raddles destiny i needed a pee on the way out i grabbed more alcohol boyer and his light o love scarcely noticed me go they were moving i observed into the first phases of a mating process which was going to take all night it reminded me that i had similar commitments ahead in particular an obligation to make things up with margey and say goodbye honourably i also had to deliver some cigarettes the crewcut major red in the face to the roots of his hair swept me up with a great crowd of jostling girls they had brought their luggage back from belawan and it stood about their feet making progress across the room difficult more drinks went down among continuous exclamations of joy and chagrin at the reunion finally i blundered towards the door only to be caught by boyer didnt mean to be curt with you stubbs just keep your place i cant bear to see anyone with their paws on my charming lady look here i dont want to let you down about this chinese bit of yours you didnt show up at the company office or id have spoken to you then its difficult to talk with all this luggage under foot sir if youre crazy about her well we all have our impulses ive told you my opinion of chinese girls bless their little slanteyed holes but thats only my opinion frankly the way i look at it is miscegenation is just an extreme form of heterosexuality quite a bit of the attraction of raddle for instance its not raddle by the way its raddl lies in her foreign god i must have a pee sir sorry preferably within the next two point five seconds stumbling over suitcases i gave boyer a despairing look and made for the night the darkness was intersected by lights punctuated by music and shredded by shouts and laughter the area was impregnated by inevitable barbecues i rushed behind the bungalow lobbing my tool out i pissed with some force and splendour into the nearest bush no doubt striking a profound blow at its livelihood for reasons i could not fathom i felt immensely weary bitter and drunk sinking down on the nearest wooden verandah step i rested my face in my hands the coriolis effect became rather selfevident i slumped sideways against a railing disaster came back to my mind and the thought of sontrops body pitching head first into the earth in its box i attempted to recall the sympathetic sights of katie chae with her legs open or margeys laugh all that returned was the face of the wounded ambonese soldier smiling smiling as his sergeant prodded his injuries brave bastards those ambonese you might well ask why did they side with the netherlanders against the indonesians but the army was their business they fought for whoever paid them in those days amboina was a long way from sumatra as i write these paragraphs the news headlines feature a sensational military operation in holland outside bolingen not far from where addy now lives sinister people the media refer to as south moluccan terrorists seized a train full of hostages demanding that the dutch government put pressure on indonesia to let them return to their native land negotiations came to nothing after twenty days of deadlock the dutch sent in six starfighters to blanket the area with smoke bombs then the marines went in two of the hostages and six of the socalled terrorists were shot now the area is being cleaned up as if nothing had happened the bulletridden train was towed away into a siding and who were these south moluccan terrorists the title shows how history and the understanding of it can be destroyed in a phrase the south moluccans are our old pals the ambonese the chaps on the train were probably sons of the boyos who used to sit on the pavements of bootha street cleaning their guns and singing terang boelan ad nauseam in the dust up the ambonese chose the wrong side how were they to understand at that time that global changes were under way medan was almost as foreign to them as to me amboina is as far from medan as london is from cairo they were soldiering on at a period when half the world was soldiering far from home but try telling that to the tri when soekarno finally won control of indonesia thousands of ambonese had no option but to leave with their families where were they to go but to the distant land of their masters in the cool reaches of north europe poor sods miscegenation in world war ii was global now they have no way back there is no place for them in indonesia any more than there was a place for sumatraborn sontrop in sumatra except six foot under as i slumped with my head and the wooden post feeling practically interchangeable i became aware of an exceptionally nasty sound hovering behind one or other or both of my ears i prepared myself for death taking a swig from a bottle i found in my fist leopards have been known to pant before pouncing the cobra must occasionally clear its throat of venom before striking the rare white rhino of sumatra bound to be on the side of the indonesians indubitably gives a few short pants before the fatal charge in any case fuck it i was too fucking shagged to move goodbye margey goodbye katie chae you luscious syrupy creature someone shook my shoulder i opened an eye two faces were glaring into mine one had a big white moustache one a little black one this struck me as amusing internal instability warned me against laughing stubbs sgt stubbs hello merdeka the faces belonged to the dutch major and captain boyer but i didnt see what that had to do with it the major tolerated only a little of my idiocy before slapping me on the shoulder and walking away boyer settled on the step beside me careful theres animal or something behind us pointing vaguely stubbs youre drunk you poor stupid uneducated soldier theres no animal here even pets are forbidden in rapwi areas shaking off what in more amusing circumstances could be called weltschmerz i heaved myself into a sitting posture and said big animal just behind right ear ten paces maybe five ah said boyer brightly raising and then waving one finger im with you now not a real animal the old twobacked beast to be precise dont look round a young dutch chap with his bags down is enjoying intercourse with a young dutch lady with her knickers down theyre on a blanket of some description not more than two metres from where we sit judging by the pace which is pretty fast and furious they cant last out much ah yes there they go now by golly he clicked his tongue with a mixture of disgust and envy funny thing to do when you consider it in cold blood wheres raddle sending a cable if its any of your business to her husband im sorry to say my head was clearing my mood veered wildly now tipping towards drama and metaphysical speculation what a hellhole this is no offence to your i really like her sir honestly and wish you could marry her miss raddle or whatever the fuck her name is but the bloody dutch in medan are absolutely depraved degenerate you wouldnt catch the british behaving like that or the chinese he put an arm patronisingly round my shoulders and became nonchalant thats just where you are mistaken laddy thats just where youre mistaken limited thinking these folk men and women theyve been through absolute hell with the japs some day the story will he told now another crisis with the natives they stand to lose everything to have their homes burnt to be shot up and killed a chap and a girl walked past us laughing together dragging a blanket behind them take these false alarms with the van heutsz yesterday and today today we could see the damned vessel stuck out on the sandbank think of the psychological effect of that sort of thing lifes reduced to a wretched series of packings and unpackings its okay for me because i see a bit more of my light o love but think of the psychological impact on them they cant win pure torture pure torture the whole setup personally i feel very badly to think that we are pulling out and leaving them on their own but you cant argue with the blithering war office how can they possibly bear up under such stress except with escape valves like fornication and inebriation speaking of which as he began to rise i started laughing whats so funny in what i said he glared at me nothing nothing i just think inebriation is a funny word for christ sake man pull yourself together he looked round anxiously but my laughter had not stopped the revelry stubbs you may not realise it but you too are living on your nerves youre distracted by love or lust arent you emotionally torn isnt that it poised on a veritable knifeedge wouldnt you say i dont know whats the matter admit it you are arent you i suppose so yes yes everythings falling apart i lit a fag enjoying myself im telling you what the trouble is you are essentially a romantic at heart like me loving a girl in distant lands across racial frontiers never mind if she happens to be a bloody chink caring for her longing to have children by her longing for a place in the sun well the shade yet the two of you torn apart ripped asunder thats not pitching it too strong you cant pitch it too strong ripped asunder by the tides of war the tides of peace just as bad tristan and iseult all over again id better go and see her now sir now youve reminded me its getting a bit late i stubbed the fag out in the soil and had a good cough he stood up and towered over me pointing a finger as if in accusation stubbs stubbs im going to do something for you im perfectly sober understand for myself i can do nothing im powerless im a victim of circumstance destiny as she says the bitch is married and theres nothing i can do about that but i can do something for you i will do something for you jhamboo singh will back me up hes a white black man if ever there was one he thumped the wooden railing to express his determination we can ground that plane tomorrow we can stop your repat we can authorise you to marry this chink girl if thats what you most want i believe in it its romantic in a way its pure or would be if it was anyone else but you above all its heroic defy your destiny defy history stay here and marry the chink girl i will support you we can go to hq now and ill send a signal to alfsea well remove your name from the list for the uk boat for once love shall triumph and the world will be well lost i rose during his speech by standing on the verandah step and straightening up gradually i managed to reverse the situation so that i towered over boyer he was carrying the matter further than i wanted it taken sir the trouble is i hated to spoil his rhetoric you see there are two girls two chink girls he staggered back in disgust dont be so bloody stupid stubbs you know very well that even in sumatra you are allowed only one wife no no sir i didnt mean that i meant i know what you meant well i gave you your chance im going to get myself another drink and see what raddles doing ill waste no more time on you you and your filthy black wombat and your nests of chink girls im disappointed stubbs frankly disappointed i need a drinkies a blithering big deep drinkies he made his way back into the crowded bungalow where the music was going full blast i tried to keep pace with him blundering over suitcases sir i appreciate what you say you have me wrong your offer it would be romantic ow shit that was the edge of a trunk like something out of a novel to be or not to be thats not a novel you fool that happens to be a play boyers manner was rather offhand perhaps because he had just caught sight of raddle in the far corner kissing a young blonde lieutenant i know sir but the principles the same i mean what im trying to say is oh sod it that i am having a bit of trouble with two girls chink girls sir at present i just have to go into town and sort things out im all confused in my mind oh shit this time i fell against him and we knocked two dancing couples flying i probably need a drink too i wouldnt be surprised can we leave your kind offer open while i sort of sort things out a bit he looked grimly at me with even grimmer sideglances across at raddle pulling his moustache and visibly regretting his earlier generosity you have got till midnight stubbs report back to me here without fail i shall be here enjoying myself until midnight after which raddle and i will proceed to bed and certainly wont wish to be disturbed by the likes of you now clear off thanks sir good luck mind your own business sergeant i took this as an indication of dismissal and went as i charged into the dark i saw jhamboo standing so close to a mousy little dutch girl that his cigarette holder was halfway up her left nostril i waved him a cheery farewell but he was otherwise engaged up the antivaginaphobes i called encouragingly to anyone coming straight from the great cities of the west medan must have appeared a poor provincial place no great architecture grand vistas arts or even vices to rank on an international scale but there is perspective in all things to anyone who had spent three years soldiering in places like burma and who moreover approached medan by the overland route from padang driving down from toba and the volcanic chain it was a city indeed every alleyway had its own splendour besides i was young then young and impressionable it seemed to me the very arena of life the centre was bustling despite the afternoon alarm at the cemetery in the paralysis that gripped the city the nonarrival of the van heutsz produced fresh currents of activity the two hundred people who had failed to leave represented two hundred extra visitors extra customers my last fucking night i could forget all about the girls and have a last boozeup in the mess with my mates in fact i hired a local gharry and was driven back to lines i saw their faces watched dickie payne jock wally scubber and the others through the window i went to my dark and silent billet next door walked upstairs without putting on the light the thirty tins of players stood in their box on the table i picked them up and went back to the waiting gharry at least i could pay off my debt to katie chae she was not in her flat on the beat no doubt thought i with more resignation than regret goodbye katie chae i gave the tins with a note to an old woman who lived below then i went to pay my debt to margey i was sweating like a beaver a storm was brewing as i dived in the chinese quarter heading for bootha street a familiar detachment overcame me it was familiar because i had experienced it often enough during my years in the far east how could it matter what happened to me provided i was not wounded or killed as long as i remained part of that exotic bustle that great obscure traffic of various businesses whatever i suffered was of little account beside the sensation of belonging to a community which i hoped some day to understand if i was hurt by love or whoring it didnt matter it didnt matter just as long as i was still entangled with the great affair of living other people would always be there to embrace the clatter of pakia the cry of streetvendors the nasal whine of chinese music relayed over a cheap radio even the silent flash of lightning overhead such things had entered my heart they told me that suffering was also part of enjoyment better these things by far than isolation and silence better jungle than desert i still feel that vision time since is but a moment every street lamp was surrounded by a nimbus of gold comprising dozens of horrendous and winged shitbags intent on frying themselves to a frizzle beneath each lamp lay a pile of expiring bodies they were gobbled by toads and lizards which lurked in the gutters fresh insects perpetually zoomed in to the sphere of light like comets to the sun only to fall away again angrily buzzing in a fury of pain poor bloody insects that was why i had to get out of medan however much it attracted me i was going to get burnt i had been in danger enough and being killed was too much my nerve was gone the toads were waiting and i had slightly more savvy than the winged shagbags pausing at the top of margeys alley i lit a cigar my stomach churned somewhat now i had to face the weaker sex according to my watches it could be twenty to nine or maybe eightthirty fucking time was catching up with me fast even by my reckoning it had come to the pinch we looked at each other a bit guardedly perhaps she like me was uncertain what she really felt we went to a restaurant called the haven a big rambling wooden place where there was music and dancing poor margey she was penitent for her previous outburst of anger and grateful perhaps surprised that i had shown up again when i saw that i experienced a sneaking regret that i had not sought out katie chae and let her earn a few more tins of players yet margey looked pretty smashing with her sleek jet hair curling inwards about her neck and her kittenshaped face gleaming she wore a blue silk dress of a european style and white shoes with buttons she carried a white handbag all told she was a cool and delicious sight she appeared as eager as i to give the subject of katie chae a miss but some painful subjects could not be avoided the waiter brought our dish tender hunks of an unknown animal were bedded on rice and served with coconut and a peppy brown sauce as we ate margey looked at me askance and said horry you go away morrow morning fry to singapore thats right you never come back medan afraid not our little time was so short horry silence they were playing ruddy terang boelan again mouthfuls of meat found their way down between the lumps in our throats it was ninefifteen or maybe somewhat later horry what maybe we go back my place we pretend be husband and little wife one last time i dont know margey weve come to the end of the road no no one last time i tell you what i do when i see that terrible thing stick up at me she began a soft and erotic recital of what i might expect in the circumstances my spirits sank lower everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves a squaddy i knew was dancing with a ravishing indonesian woman with her hair coiled in a bun at the back of her sleek head was it che jah i felt as if i had wasted my weeks in medan why had i not had an indonesian woman with her hair coiled in a bun at the back of her sleek head she would have made no impossible claims on me i drank down my beer and angrily ordered another almost as soon as we had entered the haven the heavens had opened such a flood was coming down outside that it looked as if our windows gave on to gigantic aquaria flashes of lightning revealed in frozen gesture denizens of this submarine world in flight from puddle to puddle a batch of these denizens landed themselves at the restaurant door shedding laughter and water everywhere they were squaddies i knew among them the prognathous wallace and jesus price as they passed our table wallace gave me a simian wink cushy for some he said price said still at it then horry we held a party for you last night but you never turned up crme de menthe by the gallon lovely grub i tried to make it but i was busy i can see that price said and he and wallace went into peals of scabrous laughter well be having a few again tonight if you care to look in the billet horry youre not a bad bloke despite them three stripes thikhai i said they paused and gave margey an insulting look of evaluation as they moved on shedding water wallace began to sing in a high nasal tone representing cantonese song one night down in old wanchai some dirty bastard spat in my eye it was intended as an insult to the chinese and to me i jumped up red in the face longing to plant a bunch of fives right in wallaces mush but margey dragged me back into my chair no make scene he no good man singing silly song you just listen your margey the red fox reinforcement arrived temptingly warm and i flung it down my throat margey continued with her erotic recital to which i was able to pay little attention where had my affection for her gone i was ashamed during my time in india i had found sex and looked for love pined moped for it now was i so much older so much eroded by experience that when i had found love i wanted only sex these were questions i formulated without attempting to answer whilst feeling that i had betrayed margey i was myself betrayed by circumstances by the whole impossible situation horry you no listen your poor margey i really want we play that disgusting husband and wife game one more time i really stick my savage little red hole out at you because i know you never marry margey her heart and her body it had to be said i felt myself speaking in slowmotion as i formulated the words margey you are a lovely rare girl but the husband and wife thing is not on its not possible for me to stay in medan thats the way things are understand its the system im only a bloody soldier my times up as a matter of fact i nearly got bumped off this afternoon silence she was so fragile her bones were so dainty her flesh was so smooth and pure i stared down at her downcast face which the cataract of time was about to sweep away margey would still live so would i but we would live far apart well say something go on i no speak her face puckered up as if she had been hit bloody cheerful evening this is turning out to be horry please understand i very sad and no want cry what margey can do when you leave her you never intend you marry margey you just want jigjig and make joke of poor margey for her body i put my knife and fork down and tackled a fresh red fox i patted her leg under the table until she withdrew it margey please dont say or believe that ever i did i do love you you are marvellous and i cant think how i would have been without you really but im too mixed up its not you its me and this place and what the hell happens to me back in england what in gods name am i going to bloody do there i just cant visualise the future for myself never mind the two of us im not putting this very well but i dont want to hurt you and i cant find it in myself to well to commit myself you might hate england god knows i think i might is not so worse as this dump that i know well its not a paradise like bloody tsingtao i dared not look at her some squaddies over the far side of the room were getting hilariously drunk wallace among them you no want me in england because i china girl she looked up and anger made her eyes sparkle why you not say so for a change you no understand china girl best girl in world for marriage better than your sexy french mistress china girl cook and fuck and be faithful her man always smell nice too she lifted her faultless arm so that i could see one faultless armpit like the inside of a peach when the peach stone is removed she just more good as europe girl all ways and teeth and legs better too i know margey i accept all that she leant forward speaking into my face buckethurling time was coming round again then why we no go singapore set up house like we plan why you say such thing if you dont mean aeiya i know why you meet up that damn sexcat miss katie chae you jigjig with her so now you really gone bad in the head i know how much you pay her i like to know what i give you free that girl run like poison in the artillery of a man thats what thats what for fucks sake margey dont start working yourself up into a rage leave katie chae out of this will you im going to have a piss calm down while im gone and order me another beer it was somewhere in the region of a quarter to ten according to my watches or thereabouts in blighty id at least be able to get someone to fix the bloody instruments so that they kept proper time i had to report back to boyer before midnight if only margey would let me off the hook that whole affair had been a disaster from the start round between the tables behind a potted palm through a rattan door another door solid wood standing behind it gasping i tried to piss against the filthy wall provided angry with the world and with myself one hundred degrees fahrenheit i understood nothing what was i a puppet of the stars as raddle put it i was tempted to nip out of the back of the restaurant but id left my bushhat at the table with margey cowardly shit rain still belted down outside like the liquid pouring out of me dogs howled army boots sounded on the step outside the jakes the door was flung violently open catching me between the shoulderblades it slammed me against the tacky wall pee flew everywhere haaaah the intruder marched forward giving a stretch and a bellow as he went you clumsy bastard i said he turned it was corporal steve kyle i planted one smack in his ribs my prick still hanging out it was a real good blow with my right fist my right shoulder behind it one for you you mutinous turd kyle was drunk or halfway though he buckled a bit he hit back i went for him unfortunately i tripped on some anonymous slimes and fell white i was down on my hands and knees he delivered a hell of a kick on my thigh a parting present you bleeding fhrer he shouted and tried to escape but i grabbed his leg ill teach you to get some service in you cunt fuck off youre bloody puggle i hauled myself up on him and gave him a pasting he caught me a stray blow on the nose something rang like an alarm bell in my head and all my filthy temper exploded i was beyond anyones control as i struck out at him driving my fists and the side of my palms into his arms and body if there had been a golf club handy i would have used it on him i feared that foul temper of mine and still do for some years i have managed to suppress it because i know how it takes control under its spell i experience no pain know no fear its like intoxication kyle escaped from me only when some of his muckers including wallace and price happened to barge in and haul him away they had to fight me to do so when they were gone i spent a long while hanging over a tap in the corner of the squalid room splashing cold water over my face sick sick as a dog dab the blood away sick hot every sodding thing falling apart nothing to hold on to sick fucking life take it away and bring me something more my kind of thing other people entered the bog i didnt look up couldnt face them margeys arm came round my waist she mopped at my face with a tiny handkerchief poor horry margey look after you you so worry poor man you drink too much drink her tone became wheedling and coaxing you come home your little margey last time i no mad you horry i very sorry all trouble margey understand this very difficult year for all concerned astrologers say it still feeling reasonably badtempered i looked round my vision was poor but i made out the restaurant manager standing by the door with him was someone i recognised katie chaes brother tiger balm his spectacles gleaming efficiently the manager started to address me at length in malay but tiger balm interrupted and said in his colourless english possibly i can help here this is the manager of this establishment he requests you to settle your bill and leave the premises as soon as possible he says that fighting is sternly forbidden and he threatens to summon the red caps if you will not go quietly ill go when im ready im not drunk if thats what he thinks correct he thinks you are drunk for the record i have the same opinion i was eating here in a private room with a friend where the food is marginally better than that served to the troops when i heard you swearing and fighting please leave immediately as the manager implores take tung su chi with you one watt bulb dangled in the centre of the fakes its sickly illumination made everyone look ill i began splashing water over my face and neck shit it was hot ill go in a minute just leave me alone you are sick sick of everything just leave me alone ill go in a minute selfpity flooded me nobody wanted me pushing margey away i fumbled in my hip pocket and produced a stack of jap guilders which i thrust out towards the manager here help yourself bloody forged jap currency if thats what you live on take it the manager understood this gesture and looked highly offended which pleased me he began to talk rapidly with tiger balm margey tried to butt in and was swept aside turning to me tiger balm said ignoring your comments on the economy for which the british occupation is responsible i ask the manager how much he is owed now he declares with the pride of his race that if you will leave in peace now immediately he makes no charge for you or the lady you understand frankly between us he is a little afraid my anger rose again i told you ill go in a minute ill go whether he wants my money or not my fucking nose is still bleeding margey waved her handbag at tiger balm and the manager go way and leave him like he ask cant you hear i look after my man you take care both you he strong man nearly kill that corporal his friends take him away being carried the ability to focus my eyes returned i saw that margey was crying her words had no effect on the men by now renewed anger was making me feel better i was just looking for a bit more trouble trouble arrived the jakes door opened and in stomped jackie tertis wearing monsoon cape and big boots and looking extremely ugly he glared at everyone in turn before addressing me stubbs you okay cocker a bloke outside told me you were having a spot of bother want any help ill soon pitch into these admis with you say the word i dont need help i was sorting out bloody kyle thats all he stood unmoved in all his foxy hue kyle good want a lift home my bikes outside what are these natives sticking about for money is this your chinese crumpet you were on about he bent his gaze at margey not bad as chinks go are you darling flat in the chest of course his hawk gaze swooped to the manager who had stepped forward whats your trouble chum you want to say something the malay moved back again bowing politely perhaps he had encountered tertis before margey was made of different stuff i saw her go almost rigid with anger you talking large bully what you mean i got frat chest she spoke in a kind of scream could your mother with disease feed you only on pus not milk why you stinking hairy foreign pigscum i know your spotty pizzle fell off in the cradle with vd a wooden shovel stood in one dim corner of the bog margey seized it and bought the edge of its blade down hard on tertiss foot despite the protection of his boots he gave a yell of pain you slanteyed yellow whore ill murder you come on i scratch your damn rotten eyes out tiger balm said waveringly let us not exchange ethnic insults in a public urinal i shall leave it looked as if tertis would murder us all beginning with margey for a moment he stood quivering then he bent to pick up the shovel which margey had dropped if he started wielding that implement in the confined space there would be murder done i grabbed tertiss arm and twisted it smartly behind his back he yelled in pain come on matey lets all leave together i didnt enjoy that remark about flat chests either as he straightened and tried to turn i gave him another quick wrench to let him know what was what youll have my arm off stubbs you tricky bastard margey was about to fling herself at him but tiger balm caught her and gave her a brisk rattle of cantonese she bit her lips and fell silent looking helplessly at me but i was occupied with tertis when he was pale enough i marched him out up the steps and through the restaurant keeping up the pressure all the way a fresh surge of sadism made me feel good i murmured in jackies ear you dare give me that flatchested bullshit you fucking torturer i know you need a big ugly pair of tits like bolsters to wallow in or else you cant get it up thats what makes you such a vicious little bastard isnt it i never did you any harm whores is all youre good for my lotll settle with you stubbs you wait it was still raining when we were outside i gave him a shove and stood back on your way jackie you bloody fascist if you ever insult a pusher of mine again ill have your guts for garters malum now piss off in my stomach i felt a numb fear of him he gave me a sick and deadly look water dripped on his unquenched eyes i had sudden visions of us having a shootup in the roadway as if medan was dodge city his lips came apart revealing the edges of his teeth one of us would finish lying riddled in the gutter lightning dazzled turning the flooded street into a ruinous antechamber of some lost underground city tertis turned away as darkness swooped back became suddenly shapeless under his monsoon cape a minute later he drove off revving his bike his wheels furrowing the great puddle through which he made his way i breathed a deep breath the rain ran down my hair and across my face i retired into the porch of the restaurant the more reliable of my watches said that it was ten minutes to eleven the other had stopped i wound it without conviction my nose burned i leaned against an upright and closed my eyes for a moment tiger balm was standing by me shaking me carefully he carried an open umbrella i have procured a pedicab share it with me you need help im okay sorry for all that roughhousing in there it was not pleasant he looked hard at me through his spectacles which were spotted with rain there was something i had done or said which pleased him lets go the man is waiting the storms nearly over as i went forward with him under the umbrella i asked where margey was su chi was upset she returned home she requested me to say farewell and good journey a little old malay was sitting under a waterproof on his flimsy saddle the hood of his vehicle was up sounding like a drum under the downpour tiger balm and i squeezed into the seat together god i need a drink you sent margey away didnt you she returned home as i said she cried and was ashamed i suppose shes really only a whore isnt she the malay buttoned us under a tarpaulin and pulled the hood further over so that we could hardly see the way but the rain was abating the air smelt of tarpaulins your criteria of judgement are wrong excuse me you should not think someone is only a tailor or only a wife or only an englishman or only a whore those are incorrect perceptions there was nothing i could do for margey he called sharply to the malay then said to me you raised her hopes then dropped them you feel bad so you wish to think of her as only a whore she wished to escape from the sumatra disaster but you are part of the disaster as part of the occupying force all military occupations bring depraved times when injuries of all kinds cannot be avoided christ you make it sound like hell on earth to that he said nothing i did not wish to pursue the subject the rain ceased as if a sluice had been turned off its retreat left a strange silence in the world we bumped over cobbles suddenly i felt cheerful again recalling how i had laid into kyle jhamboo would be pleased when he heard i laughed and produced cigarettes from my tin we lit them awkwardly in the confined space whatll happen to you the chinese when the british pull out didnt you ask that question to me before there may be some difficulties during our first meeting you were talking about bloodbaths soekarno is rather a severe man i hear we shall stay it may be difficult at first unlike the dutch we have nowhere else to go so we stay silence fell between us the malay called out slowed down stopped his vehicle by digging both heels in the ground he came round and removed the tarpaulin from our knees we had stopped outside katie chaes house there was a light in her window overhead tiger balm sat where he was he made a gesture of invitation cigarette in hand enter please my sister will be pleased to greet you i must go elsewhere so it is goodbye between us embarrassment overcame me as i climbed out i peered at him in the dim light you trust me to behave myself do you i know the capacities of my sister do you disapprove of me i suppose you think im a complete shit he shook his head you are a soldier sgt stubbs so you are not a complete person you are partly a uniform we wish to be rid of you but there are worse soldiers than british soldiers he signalled to the malay the old boy bent his shoulders and started to pedal an ambiguous bugger tiger balm when they were a long way down the road i knocked at katies door and went in it was eleventen give or take fourteen minutes i had just threequarters of an hour in which to report back to captain boyer but for the moment i was at peace in the presence of katie chae it was hard not to feel at peace with oneself she looked gorgeous with her slender legs hooked across an arm of the sofa and a deep blue cheongsam riding up above her knees she wore white tears of earpendants which went well against her long elegant face she was smoking a cheap singapore cigarette the thirty tins of players i had given her were not to be opened they were for trading i was drinking an atrocious little drink she poured me i sprawled on the floor with my arms on the sofa and my chin practically in her sexy lap she smelt of powder and scent and my sore nose was forgotten we were having a conversation some day maybe i get marry but not in this dump i see girls after

get killed everyone she asked in astonishment everyone except one or two soldiers it sounds exciting i like her expressive eyes shone yes it is pretty exciting apart from some of the dialogue i started to unbutton my shirt katie you marvellous creature tear off those beautiful clothes and stand naked before me so that i can remember you when im back in england she kicked her shoes off and stood on the sofa smiling at me with slit eyes what you do when you remember me you do something naughty to yourself she made sly wanking gestures with a dainty hand it could even get to that okay big boy then i do for world peace she laughed as she began to unhook the cheongsam i pulled my boots off and flung them across the room off came her dress sliding down her body she was not wearing any knickers i clasped her round the bottom and kissed her delicious thighs katie put a hand over her smart little crutch you mus give me present horry you know i poor girl very punk life jus now yes yes i didnt care to enquire how much she wanted a pulsating penis asks no questions i fished all the cash i had out of my hip pocket a damp and crumpled collection of forged jap rubbish dutch guilders a fiverupee note and some new british pounds straight from company office an international collection for an international girl she pouted and continued to cup her crutch a wisp of black pubic hair curled round the base of her thumb with barely the shadow of hesitation i added the better of my two watches to the little pile okay that is all you got she counted the money quickly so that i got a look at the goods in question why had i expected her to be grateful its all ive got every penny come on katie love you get more pay in singapore give me other watch also darling she covered up again and waited i pulled the second watch from my wrist fucking thing never kept time any way katie chae took it looked down at her pelvis and slowly removed her hand from her twot as if allowing a little bird to escape she pressed the hand to my mouth i bit her fingers also your cigarettes she said all what you got please you give for keepsake she swept the little collection together and whipped them out of sight in a drawer before turning back to me this time she made no attempt to conceal her body but stood brazenly legs apart giving me a real comeon glance despite the haggle i had a towering erection i nearly snapped it as i tore my trousers off it thumped against my belly like a drumstick katies face was alight at the sight she jumped back on to the sofa unbuttoning her brassiere this was the life she really enjoyed the brassiere went flying behind a chair and her scrumptious little tits flowed free i moved in well placed to plunge a finger between her thighs and up into her luxurious hole grabbing a spiral of pubic hairs with my thumb twitching them crisply between her flesh and mine she bent down to me and held my head i straightened making her left breast vibrate with my tongue as i did so gorgeous dark aureoles set off her nipples always the sign of a passionate woman pressing my tool against her belly i cupped my hands under her bottom and lifting her in that manner carried her over to the table you terrible man so strong you heavenly bitch katie as she curved backwards over the table she opened her legs with my hand i felt her pretty cuntlips part i slid the tip of my prick in grunting it tunnelled its way forward into territories hitherto unknown to man or beast she wriggled to help it along and with every wriggle it seemed to navigate another succulent pair of lips salmon leaping upstream to spawn know no finer pleasure sighs of delight just a yard more to go finally it had plumbed as far as it would go yet she knocked her little mons against me sucking at the ultimate millimetre of rude joy my body started working of its own accord arse plunging forward and back working at first only from the bum but gradually getting entirely involved with thighs legs whole trunk becoming part of the rhythm we were a unity her arms about my shoulders like my arms my arms about her lean buttocks one finger licking into her moist bottom like her arms her finger each knew entirely what each wanted each gave there was no finesse about holding back neck or nothing it was her gorgeous juices spread from my root through our tangled hairs down my thighs round to the rear up my belly mad excitement snorts of pleasure her teeth biting into my shoulder her ear in my mouth that tremendous sensation that this was marvellous katie chae and no one else we fell back on the table my arms still protectively under the rocking curve of her spine in that position her legs came up wrapping about my back opening her twot wider so that i could thrust still deeper aware of the perfume she was releasing that perfume that motion that unity they made the most eloquent of all languages the most convincing of all communications my sweat ran with hers her eyes were against mine deep dark blazing her breath was one with mine we came in a clatter of hip bones and sobs and her being was one with mine after a while she said ohhh what kind of a manners you call that to do me on my own dining table come properly to bed like a gentleman with proper manners i giggled weakly what a day ive had im too feeble to manage it again its too late you no know katie you too rough now we try little bylittle i give you good value for two watches they both need repair as she dragged me to the bedroom i went weakly laughing and protesting no i should report to boyer what a mess boyer and raddle so sad it makes you laugh one last sweet time katie if i can my last bash in the far east of course i never reported back to captain boyer when i woke later with a guilty start grey dawn was filtering into katies room that beautiful head was on the pillow beside me that face i would never see again was like a buddhas serenely turned away from me in sleep as i kissed its cheek my spirits sank i remembered what the day was charlie meadows and johnny mercer were also in the jeep they had volunteered to see me off at polonia airfield my kit and luggage were piled up at my back although the day was still new the equatorial sun was up the placid countryside already glowed with heat to our right in the distance slumbered the blue flanks of the mountains of the interior sumatra had never looked more beautiful more peaceful more pristine as we rounded a bend and sighted a dakota through palm trees our driver spotted a black car ahead he slowed charlie johnny and i drew our revolvers and crouched lower fearing an ambush the car was stationary drawn in to the side of the road a fat figure climbed out into the middle of the path and waved to me its okay i said with relief putting my weapon back in its holster its fat whats he doing here it was soon evident what fat was doing as we moved slowly level with the black car one of medans venerable prewar german taxis fat opened the rear door out stepped margey dressed in her best white dress and wearing a hat step on it johnny yelled banging the indian driver on the back stop you bastards i shouted stop its margey her face registered surprise that we were so close she hesitated fat pushed her forward the jeep accelerated for a moment margey and i were no more than a yard apart she reached out her arms to me as i responded our gaze met margey she called my name i rose i was going to jump out but charlie grabbed me forcing me back stubbs youre thick as they come we were past her i was looking back at once she and fat were a long way behind us standing forlorn in the road by the black car their hands were at their sides johnny and charlie were cheering saved you from a fate worse than death you sod johnny said he gave his high inane laugh the jeep rounded a bend and the sight of her was cut off i kept looking behind we roared up to the barrier of the airfield a couple of members of the raf regiment came smartly out of the guardhouse to meet us bayonets fixed the barriers went up sumatra fell away beneath the plane away in space and time swampy coast was visible almost immediately islands flecked the sea which reflected the morning sun like a shield the air was filled with brilliance somewhere ahead concealed in light lay singapore and all my further destinations automatically i glanced down at my watches my wrist was empty
