anne perry the shifting tide one the murder doesnt matter louvain said abruptly leaning a little over his desk towards monk the two men were standing in the big office next to windows that faced the pool of london with its forest of masts swaying on the tide against the ragged autumn sky there were clippers and schooners from every seafaring nation on earth barges from up and down the river local pleasure boats as well as tugs ferries and tenders i have to have the ivory louvain gritted the words between his teeth ive no time to wait for the police monk stared at him trying to frame an answer he needed this job or he would not have come down to the louvain shipping company offices prepared to undertake a task so far outside his usual area of skill he was a brilliant detective in the city he had proved it time and time again both in the police force and later as a private agent of enquiry he knew the mansions of the wealthy and the back streets of the poor he knew the petty thieves and informers the dealers in stolen goods and the brothelkeepers the forgers and many of the general ruffians for hire but the river the longest street in london with its shifting tides its constant movement of ships and men who spoke scores of different languages was strange territory to him the question beat in his mind insistent as a pulse why had clement louvain sent for him rather than someone familiar with the docks and the water the river police themselves were older than peels city police in fact they had existed for nearly three quarters of a centurysince it was feasible that the river police were too busy to give louvains ivory the attention he wanted but was that really his reason for calling in monk the murder is part of the theft monk replied at last if we knew who killed hodge wed know who took the ivory and if we knew when we might be a lot closer to finding it louvains face tightened he was a windburned slenderhipped man in his early forties but hardmuscled like the sailors he hired to work his ships to the east african coast and back with ivory timber spices and skins his light brown hair was thick and sprang up from his forehead his features were broad and blunt on the river at night time makes no difference he said curtly there are lighthorsemen heavyhorsemen night plunderers up and down all the time nobodys going to inform on anyone else least of all to the river police thats why i need my own man one with the skills im told you have his eyes swept over monk seeing a man reputed to have the same ruthlessness as himself an inch or two taller darker with high cheekbones and a lean powerful face i need that ivory back louvain repeated its due for delivery and the money is owed dont look for the murderer to find the thief that might work on shore on the river you find the thief and that will lead you to the murderer monk would have dearly liked to decline the case it would have been easy enough his lack of knowledge alone would have provided grounds for it in fact it was increasingly difficult to see why louvain had sent for him rather than one of the many men who must at least know the river and the docks there was always someone who would undertake a private commissionfor a fee but monk could not afford to point that out he faced the bitter fact that he must make himself obliging to louvain and convince him against the truth that it was well within his power to find the ivory and return it to him in less time and with greater discretion than the river police could or would do necessity drove him the spate of recent trivial cases which paid too little he dared not go into debt and since hester had given her time to the clinic in portpool lane which was wholly charitable she added nothing to their financial situation but a man should not expect his wife to keep herself she asked little enoughno luxury no vanity only to be able to do the work she loved monk would have served any man to give her that he resented louvain because he had the power to cause him acute discomfort but far more than that he was troubled that louvain showed more concern about catching a thief who had robbed him of goods than a murderer who had taken hodges life and if we do catch him he said aloud and hodge is buried what evidence do we have we will have concealed his crime for him louvain pursed his lips i cant afford to have the theft known it would ruin me would it serve if i swear a testimony as to exactly where i found the body and how and when the doctor can swear to his injuries and you yourself can look too ill sign the document and you can have it how will you explain concealing the crime from the police monk asked ill hand them the murderer with proof louvain answered what more could they want and if i dont catch him louvain looked at him with a wry delicately twisted smile you will he said simply monk could not afford to argue morally it set ill with him but in practical terms louvain was right he must succeed but if he did not then the river polices chances were even less tell me as much as you know he said louvain sat down at last easing himself into the padded roundbacked chair and indicating that monk should sit also he fixed his gaze on monks face the maude idris put out from zanzibar fully loaded with ebony spices and fourteen firstgrade tusks of ivory bound round the cape of good hope and home shes a fourmasted schooner with a nineman crew captain mate bosun cook cabin boy and four able seamen one per mast thats standard for her tonnage he was still watching monks face she made fair weather most of the way calling in for supplies and fresh water up the west coast of africa she reached biscay five days ago spithead the day before yesterday and tacked the last few miles upriver with the wind behind her dropped anchor just east of the pool yesterday october twentieth monk was listening intently but the account held nothing useful to him he was certain louvain knew that nevertheless they both continued to play out the charade crew was paid off louvain went on as is usual been away a long time close to half a year one way and another i left the bosun and three able seamen on board to keep things safe one of them is the dead man hodge a flicker passed across his face it could have been any emotion at all anger sorrow even guilt four out of the nine stayed monk confirmed it as if reading his thoughts louvain pursed his lips i know the rivers dangerous especially for a ship newly come in all the watermen will know the cargos still on it not much on the river is secret for long but any fool could work that out you dont come up this far if youre empty youre loading or unloading i thought four men armed would be enough i was wrong his face was filled with emotion but which emotion was unreadable how were they armed monk asked pistols and cutlasses louvain replied monk frowned those are closequarter weapons is that all you carry louvains eyes widened almost imperceptibly there are four cannons on deck he replied guardedly but thats in case of piracy at sea you cant fire that sort of thing on the river a slight flare of amusement crossed his face and vanished they only wanted the ivory not the whole damn ship was anyone else injured apart from hodge monk concealed his annoyance with an effort it was not louvains fault that he was obliged to work out of his depth no louvain said river thieves know how to come alongside and board in silence hodge was the only one they encountered and they killed him without arousing anyone else monk tried to imagine the scene the cramped spaces in the bowels of the ship the floor shifting and tilting with the tide the creaking of the ships timbers and then would come the sudden knowledge that there were footsteps then the terror the violence and finally the crippling pain as they struck who found him he said quietly and when louvains face was heavy his mouth drawn tight the man who came to relieve him at eight oclock before or after he saw the ivory was missing louvain hesitated only a second it was barely discernible and monk wondered if he had imagined it after if he had said before monk would not have believed him in selfpreservation the man would have wanted to know what he was dealing with before he told louvain anything and unless he were a complete fool he would have thought first to make sure the killer was not still on board if he could have said he had captured him and kept the ivory he would have had a very different story to tell unless of course he already knew all about it and was party to it where were you when you got the message louvain looked at him stonily here it was nearly half past eight by then how long had you been here since seven would he know that he watched louvains face closely one of the ways he could judge the men left on the ship was by louvains trust in them a man in louvains position could not afford to forgive even error let alone any kind of disloyalty yes louvain replied a flicker of amusement in his eyes any seaman would expect it that doesnt tell you what you think it does monk felt the heat burn up inside him he was clawing after answers not grasping as he usually did this was not the right pace at which to play games of wits with louvain he must be either blunter or a great deal more subtle all shipowners are in their offices at that hour he concluded aloud louvain relaxed a little yes he came here and told me hodge had been killed and the ivory stolen i went with him immediately he stopped as monk stood up can you retrace your steps and ill come with you monk requested louvain rose smoothly of course he said nothing else as he led monk across the worn carpet to the heavy door opened it and then locked it behind them putting the key in the inside pocket of his waistcoat as he took a heavier jacket from a coat stand he glanced at monks attire as if to consider its adequacy and decided it would suffice monk was proud of his clothes even in his most financially restricted times he had dressed well he had a natural elegance and pride dictated that the tailors bill had come before the butchers but that had been when he was single now he might have to reverse that order and it already weighed heavily with him it was a kind of defeat however he had realized that a man involved in shipping as louvain was might well have business that required them both to go on the river so he had come with that in mind his boots were heavy and well soled his overcoat was easy to move in and would cut the wind he followed louvain down the stairs and across the outer office where clerks were bent over ledgers or sitting on high stools with quills in hand the odors of ink and dust were in the air and there was an acrid sting of smoke as he passed the iron heating stove just as someone opened it to put more coke in the top outside in the roadway towards the dock the rawedged wind struck them immediately making the skin smart whipping the hair back catching in the throat the taste of salt on the incoming tide it was heavy with smells of fish tar and the sour overbearing effluent of mud and sewage from above the waterline beyond the wharves the water slurped against the pier stakes in endless movement rhythm broken now and then by the wash of barges laden so they sank deep they moved slowly upriver towards london bridge and beyond the mewing of gulls was shrill yet it was a sound that brought back echoes of meaning for monk flashes of his life in northumberland as a boy a carriage accident seven years before in had robbed him of most of those manycolored fragments that build the past and form the pictures of who we are by deduction he had pieced much of it together and now and again windows opened suddenly and showed him whole landscapes for a moment the cry of gulls was one of those louvain was crossing the cobbles down to the wharf and striding along without looking right or left the docks with their vast warehouses cranes and derricks were all familiar to him he was used to seeing the laborers and watermen and the small craft coming and going monk followed louvain to the end of the wharf where the dark water swirled and slapped under the shadows its surface spotted with scum and drifting refuse on the far bank there was a stretch of mud below the tide line and three children were wading in it sunk halfway up to their knees bent over searching with busy skilled hands for whatever they could find a snatch of memory told monk it was almost certainly for coal off the barges fallen by chance or deliberately pushed a piece at a time precisely in order to be picked up by the mudlarks louvain waved his arm and shouted across the water within moments a light boat twelve or fourteen feet long drew up to the steps with a single man aboard at the oars his face was weatherbeaten to the color of old wood his gray beard little more than bristle and his hat jammed down over his ears hid whatever hair he might have had he gave a brief half salute of recognition and waited for louvains orders take us out to the maude idris louvain told him stepping easily down into the boat adjusting his weight to keep his balance as it tipped and jiggled he offered no assistance to monk behind him either assuming he was accustomed to boats or uninterested in whether he made a fool of himself or not a moment of fear rose in monk and embarrassment in case he did it clumsily he stiffened and then physical instinct told him that was wrong and he dropped down loosely bending his knees and adjusting with a grace that surprised both of them the waterman wove between the barges with practiced skill skirting around a threemasted schooner its canvas lashed timbers stained and peeling from long days of tropical sun and salt wind monk glanced down and saw the crusting of barnacles below the waterline the river was too murky for him to see more than a foot or so below the surface he looked up quickly as they passed under the shadow of a much larger ship and caught his breath with a sudden thrill as the sheer beauty of it gripped him it towered into the air three tremendous masts with yardarms eighty or ninety feet long and dark against the gray clouds sails furled rigging in fine lines like an etching on the sky it was one of the great clippers that sailed around the world probably racing from china to london with tea silk and spices of the far east first one to unload won the stupendous prices second got only what was left his imagination teemed with visions of roaring winds and seas worlds of sky billowing canvas spars thrashing in a wild dance of the elements and there would be calmer seas flaming sunsets clear water like glass teeming with creatures of myriad shapes and windless days when time and space stretched into eternity monk jerked himself back to the present and the loud busy river the cold spray off the water whipping his face ahead of them was a fourmasted schooner lying at anchor rolling slightly on the wake from a string of barges she was wide beamed and quite deep of draft an oceangoing carrier of heavy cargo swift under full sail easy to maneuver and this close the gun ports on the foredeck were plain to see she would be neither caught nor captured easily yet here in her home port she was a sitting target for two or three men creeping up over the black water by night swarming up the sides to the deck and taking an inattentive guard by surprise they were almost alongside and louvain rose to his feet balancing with a slight swaying of his body to the motion of the river ahoy maude idris louvain coming aboard a man appeared at the rail looking down at them he was broadshouldered shortlegged powerful right sir mr louvain he shouted back and a moment later a rope ladder hurtled over from the deck and uncoiled down the side the waterman maneuvered the boat underneath it and louvain caught the bottom rung in his hand he hesitated an instant as if to question whether monk was capable of climbing up after him then he changed his mind and went without turning around hand over hand with obvious practice reaching the top to swing over the rail and stand up on the deck waiting for monk to follow monk steadied himself grasped the rope ladder to hold it firm then raised his foot as louvain had done putting his hand out to grip the third rung and hoisted himself up he hung suspended for a perilous instant neither balanced on the boat nor on the ladder the water churned beneath him the schooner rolled swinging him wide then banging him back against the hull bruising his knuckles he threw his weight upwards and took the next rung and the next until he too went over the rail and stood up beside louvain they had neither of them made any sound he controlled the breath rasping in his lungs with an effort and how would they do that if no one let down the ladder for them he asked the thieves louvain said it must have been more than one with an accomplice to stay in the boat possibly hired for the job he glanced towards the rail again and the water beyond the sun was lowering already and the shadows were long though in the gray light it was not easy to tell theyd climb up ropes he said in answer to monks question throw them up from below grapple the rail simple enough a brief hard smile curved his mouth for a moment ladders are for landsmen monk looked at louvains tightmuscled shoulders and effortless balance and was quite certain that the lack of a ladder would not have stopped him had he been intent on boarding would the grapple leave any marks on the wood monk said aloud louvain drew in his breath sharply then let it out again as understanding came to him you think the crew were in on it were they monk asked do you know each one well enough to be certain louvain thought before he answered he was weighing some judgment in his mind his eyes reflected it and the moment of decision yes he said finally he did not qualify it or add any assurances he was not used to explaining himself his word sufficed monk looked around the deck it was broad and open scrubbed clean but still it was a small space to imagine in the vastness of the ocean the hatches were closed but not battened down the wood was strong and in good repair but the marks of use were clear this was a working ship even at a glance one could see the ingrained stains of hands on the surrounds of hatches of feet on the tracks to and from the way down nothing was new except one piece of shroud going up the foremast high into the rigging to be lost in the web above its pale color marked it plainly from the aft hatch which was standing open a hand appeared and then a huge body climbing through and up he stood well over six feet his round head was covered in a bristle of brownish gray hair his chin similarly it was a coarse face but intelligent and it was apparent he made no move without thought now he walked slowly over to louvain and stopped a little distance short of him waiting for his orders this is the ships bosun newbolt louvain said he can tell you all he knows of the theft monk relaxed a little deliberately he regarded newbolt with care the mans immense physical power his callused hands the weathered clothes dark blue trousers worn and shapeless but strong enough to protect him against cold or a loose rope lashing his jacket was thick and the front of a rough woollen sweater in fancy stitches was visible at the neck monk remembered it was an old seafaring habit to wear such garments the different stitches identifying a man by family and clan even if his dead body had been in the sea for days or weeks three of you here and the dead man monk asked him yeah newbolt did not move at all not even to nod his head his eyes were fixed on monk steady clever unreflecting and where was it you found hodges body monk asked newbolts head moved fractionally to one side a minute acknowledgment bottom o the steps from the aft atchway down to the old what do you suppose he was doing there monk asked i dunno mebbe e eard summink newbolt answered with illconcealed insolence then why didnt he raise the alarm monk enquired how would he do that newbolt opened his mouth and took a deep breath his huge chest swelling something in his face changed suddenly he was watching monk quite differently and with far more care shout he answered cant fire a gun around ere might it someone else you could fire it in the air monk suggested well if e did no one eard it newbolt replied id guess as they crept up on im mebbe one of em made a noise like and when e turned ter look another one whacked im over the ead as ter is bein found at the bottom o the hatchway steps thatd be where they threw im if theyd a left im lyin on deck someone else couldve seen im an knowd there were summink wrong thieves aint fools least not all of em it made excellent sense it was what monk himself would have done and how he would have answered such an enquiry thank you he turned to louvain may i see where he was found louvain took a lantern from newbolt and moved to the aft hatch climbing over onto the steps twisting his body in a single movement he went downwards disappearing into the dense shadows of the interior only the space immediately around him illuminated by the flame monk followed with less grace feeling his way rung by rung ahead of him floorboards and bulkheads were visible and beyond the dark the open maw of the hold denser outlines of the cargo emerging as his eyes became used to the gloom he could just make out stacks of timber lashed tight he could imagine the destruction if it broke loose in heavy seas in weather wild enough it could pierce the hull and the ship would sink in minutes even through the wrapping of oilcloth and canvas he could smell the strange spices but they were not strong enough to mask the mustiness of closed air and the sourness of the bilges below his own boating experiences had been above deck open to the wind and the seas he had known the coast not the ocean and certainly not africa where this cargo had begun there louvain lowered the lantern until the light shone on the ledge nearer the steps down onto the floor of the hold it was clear enough to see the marks of blood monk took the lantern from louvain and bent to look more closely the stains were smears not the stilldamp pools he would have expected if a man dead of a lethal head wound had either been killed here or placed here within moments of being struck he looked up what was he wearing on his head he asked louvains face was upward lit giving it an eerie masklike quality that accentuated his surprise at the question a a hat i think he answered what kind why what has that to do with who killed him or where my ivory is there was tension in his voice if a man is hit over the head hard enough to kill him theres usually a lot of blood monk replied standing up to face louvain levelly even when you nick your skin shaving comprehension flared in louvains eyes a woollen hat he answered it gets very cold on deck at night air off the river eats into your bones he drew in his breath but i think youre right he was probably killed up there he glanced upwards towards the ladder and the darkening square of sky through the hatchway as newbolt said theyd have thrown him down here to stop the chance of his being seen by a passing boat and the alarm raised monk turned back towards the hold lifting the lantern higher to see the space more clearly how do you unload the timber he asked is there a main hatch which comes off yes but it has nothing to do with this its locked fast could that be why they took the ivory because it could be carried up the steps and out of this hatchway possibly but so could the spices what does a tusk weigh dependseighty or ninety pounds a man could carry them one at a time youre thinking a chance thief opportunist monk replied why what did you think louvain weighed his answer carefully theres a lot of theft on the river everything from piracy to the mudlarks and people know when a ship comes in and has to be at anchor before she can find a wharf to unload it can be weeks if youre unluckyor dont know the right people monk was surprised weeks wouldnt some cargoes rot louvains face was sardonic of course shipping is not an easy business mr monk the stakes are high you can win a fortune or lose one no errors are forgiven and no mercy is asked or expected its like the sea only a fool fights with it you learn its rules and if you want to survive you obey them monk believed him he needed to know more about crime on the river but he could not afford to expose his ignorance in front of louvain he loathed being obliged to court a job and equivocate about his own abilities could anyone assume you would be anchored here for several days before being able to unload he asked yes thats the only reason i can put off my buyers louvain answered youve got no more than eight or nine days at the outside to find my ivory and get it back whether you get the thief or not we can prove his guilt later monk raised his eyebrows of murder wasnt hodge your man louvains face hardened his eyes as cold and hollow as a winter sky how i deal with my men is not your concern monk and youd be advised to remember it ill pay you fairly or better and i expect the job done my way if you catch the man who murdered hodge so much the better but im concerned with feeding the living not revenging the dead you can take your evidence to the river police theyll hang whoevers responsible i assume that is what you want a sharp retort rose to monks tongue but he bit it back and merely agreed where is hodges body now he asked instead at the morgue louvain answered i have made arrangements for his burial he died in my service his mouth formed a thin line as if the knowledge caused him pain monk found it the first comforting thing he had seen in louvain he no longer feared that hodges killer would escape any kind of accounting it might be river justice so the burden upon monk to make sure he had the right man was even greater but perhaps he should have expected that he was dealing with men of the sea where judgments had to be right the first time because there was no mercy and no appeal i need to see him monk said he made it an order rather than a suggestion louvain would have no respect for a man he could dominate and monk could neither afford his contempt nor stomach it wordlessly louvain took the lantern from monk and turned to begin the climb up the ladder again through the hatch and out onto the deck monk followed him up on deck the wind was harder like a whetted knife edge as the tide came in the heavy gray skies made it close to darkness already and there was a smell of rain in the air the wash from a string of barges made the ship strain a little at the anchor and set the boat rocking where it was waiting for them the waterman steadying it with his oars newbolt was waiting for them his arms folded over his barrel chest swaying to keep his balance thank you monk said to louvain he looked at newbolt was there a change of watch during the night he asked yes atkinson was on midnight to four hodge from four till eight newbolt replied then me and no one came on deck before eight in the morning when you found hodge monk let his surprise show and a degree of contempt as if he considered newbolt incompetent course they was on deck newbolt growled nobody went down the old so they dint find odges body his eyes were level and angry the way a mans eyes are if he has been unjustly accusedor is lying monk smiled showing his teeth a little what time just arter six newbolt replied but his face betrayed his understanding yeah the thieves came arter four an afore six an thats cuttin it fine why wouldnt they come between midnight and four monk asked him temporarily ignoring louvain wouldnt you if you were a thief newbolt stiffened his big body motionless what are you sayin mister exact monk did not flinch or move his eyes even a fraction that either we have the facts wrong or we have a most unusual thief who either chooses or is obliged to carry out his robberies on the river in the last couple of hours before dawn rather than the middle of the night watch do you disagree with that no newbolt admitted reluctantly mebbe ed tried other ships an either the watch were too spry or they dint ave nothin as e wanted or could move easy we was is last chance for the night perhaps monk agreed or could he have picked hodges watch for some reason newbolt understood immediately yer sayin as odge were in on it yer wrong mister odge were a good man i knowd im fer years an if e were in on it ow come the poor sod got is ead bashed dont sound ter me like a bargain even a foold make he sneered at monk showing strong yellowish teeth no it wouldnt be hodges arrangement monk agreed the dull color rose up newbolts face well it bloody int mine yer son of a bitch odge is family ter me i knowd im twenty years an es married ter me sister monk felt a stab of regret he had not even thought of personal loss until this moment im sorry he said quickly newbolt nodded monk considered the information it was possible all of it was true some of it or very little atkinson might have been in collusion with the thieves and been caught by hodge at any time from midnight until four or possibly even later monk turned to louvain get me atkinson he requested atkinson was a tall lean man the scar that ran from his brow across his cheek to his chin showed livid through the stubble of his beard he moved easily with a feline sort of grace and he regarded monk with faint suspicion he looked to louvain for orders louvain nodded to him what time did hodge come to relieve you from watch monk asked although he knew the answer was of little use because he would have no idea if it was the truth or not bout alf past three atkinson replied e couldnt sleep an i were appy enough ter let im do my last alf hour i went away ter me bed describe the scene you left monk requested atkinson was surprised nothin ter tell all quiet werent nobdy on deck but me an odge nobdy near on the water neither least not that i could see course anyone could be there wiout ridin lights if they was daft enough did hodge say anything to you how did he look sound newbolt was watching him his eyes angry same as any time atkinson answered much as youd be if yerd come out o yer bed at alf past three in the mornin ter stand on a freezin deck an watch the tide rise and fall sleepy angry bored monk pressed e werent angry but yeah e looked rough poor sod thank you monk turned to louvain may i see hodges body now please of course if you think theres any point louvain said with frayed patience he walked over to the rail and shouted for the lighter to come back and waited while it did so he swung over the rail grasped the ropes of the ladder nodded at newbolt then disappeared down monk went after him a great deal more carefully scraping his knuckles again on the way and bruising his fingers as he was bumped against the ships hull by the movement of the water once down in the boat he sat and he and louvain were rowed wordlessly back to the wharf at the top of the steps a shorter distance with the turned tide racing in the wind was keener and edged with rain turning to sleet louvain put up his collar and hunched his shoulders ill pay you a pound a day plus any reasonable expenses he stated you have ten days to find my ivory ill give you twenty pound extra if you do his tone made it plain he would not accept negotiation but then a police constable started at just under a pound a week louvain was offering seven times as much plus a reward at the end if monk was successful it was a lot of money far too much to refuse even failure was paid at a better rate than most jobs although the penalty afterwards to his reputation might be dear but he also could not afford to think of the future if there were no present he nodded ill report to you when i have progress or need more information youll report to me in three days regardless louvain replied now come see hodge he swiveled on his foot and marched along the wharf all the way to the street without looking back as monk caught up with him they crossed together picking their way between the rumbling wagons it was almost dark and street lamps made ragged islands as the mist blew in and the cobbles glistened underfoot monk was glad to be inside again even though it was the morgue with its smell of carbolic and death the attendant was still there perhaps this close to the river there was always someone present he was an elderly man with a scrubbed pink face and a cheerful expression he recognized louvain immediately evenin sir youll be after mr odge is widders ere poor soul int no use in yer waitin she could be ere some time i reckon as shes makin er peace like thank you louvain acknowledged mr monk is with me and without waiting for the attendant to show him he led the way to the room where a large rawboned woman with gray hair and fine pale skin was standing silently her hands folded in front of her staring at the body of a man lying on a bench he was covered up to the neck with a sheet which was stained and a little thin at the edges his face had the lividity of death and the strangely shrunken absent look of a shell no longer inhabited by its spirit he must have been large in lifethe frame was there the bonesbut he seemed small now it took a force of imagination to think of him as having been able to move and speak to have will even passion the woman looked briefly at louvain then at monk monk spoke to her first i am sorry for your grief mrs hodge my name is william monk mr louvain has hired me to find out who killed your husband and to see that he answers for it she looked at him with leaden eyes mebbe she answered dont make much difference ter me nor me kids dont pay the rent nor put food in our mouths still i spose e should swing she turned back to the motionless form on the table stupid sod she said with sudden fury but e werent all bad brought me a piece o wood back from africa last time all carved like an animal pretty i never ocked it afore spose ill ave ter now she glanced at the corpse yer stupid sod she repeated helplessly monks anger at the thief stopped being a matter of law or some inanimate sense of justice and suddenly became hate and deeply personal hodge was past injury but this woman was not nor her children but there was nothing useful for him to say nothing that would help now and he could give her no assistance in her poverty he looked instead at the dead man he had thick hair and the back of his head rested on the table monk reached across and lifted the head very slightly feeling underneath for the extent of the injury he had seen no blood on the top of the steps to the hold and none on the deck scalp wounds bled his fingers found the soft broken skull under the hair it had been an extremely hard blow something heavy and wide had been used and by a person either of a good height or else standing slightly above he looked at the attendant you cleaned him up washed away the blood a bit the attendant answered from the doorway there wasnt much just made im presentable like there was nothing in his face to indicate whether he knew if the man was a victim of murder or accident there were probably many of the latter on ships and especially on the docks where heavy loads were moved and sometimes came loose not much blood monk questioned he had a woollen hat on louvain explained again im afraid it must have been lost when we were carrying him here i can describe it for you if you think it matters there was no blood on deck monk pointed out and very little where he was found it might have been helpful but its probably not important ive seen all i need to he thanked mrs hodge again then went out ahead of louvain back to the outside room i want the attendants testimony in writing and yours a brief smile flickered across louvains face some oblique inner humor he would not share ive not forgotten youll get your pieces of paper dawson he called to the attendant mr monk would like our testaments of hodges death on paper to help him in his work would you be good enough please dawson looked slightly taken aback but he produced paper pen and ink he and louvain both wrote their statements signed witnessed by each other and monk put them in his pocket did you learn anything louvain asked when they were on the pavement the rain had now eased off and the wind slackened allowing the mist to drift up off the water wreathing the lamps and obscuring the roofs of some of the buildings nearby someone was lying that was what monk had learned hodge had not been struck on deck and then carried below by a single thief there was no blood on deck no trail across the boards either hodge had not died there or there were more than two thieves one from the boat and two on deck or at least one of the crew had been involved he decided not to say that much to louvain possibilities he answered ill start again in the morning report to me in three days regardless of what you have louvain reminded him before if you have the ivory of course ill pay you five pounds extra for every day short of ten that you recover it good monk said levelly but he felt the money slip out of his grasp as he walked forward in the darkness and wondered how far he would have to go to find an omnibus back towards his home he should not spend money on hansoms anymore it was nearly seven oclock by the time he alighted from the final leg of his journey with the two pounds that louvain had given him still unbroken he was in tottenham court road with only a hundred yards or so to walk the mist had settled obscuring the distances there were the smells of soot from the chimneys and of the horse manure which had not yet been cleared but he knew the way almost to the step it would be warm once he was inside there would be food prepared if hester was in he tried not to hope too fiercely that she was her work at the clinic was of intense importance to her before they had met seven years ago she had nursed in the crimea with florence nightingale on her return to england she had worked occasionally in hospitals but her independence on the battlefield had made her intolerant of being reduced to cleaning stoking fires and rolling bandages her temper had cost her more than one position as a private nurse caring for individual cases hester had been far more successful more recently she had turned her attention to helping prostitutes who were injured and homeless in the course of their trade hester had first set up the clinic almost in the shadow of the coldbath prisonthen in a stroke of brilliant opportunism moved it to a large house nearby in portpool lane monks only objection was that the very urgency of the need for such a place meant that hester spent many late hours there he reached the front door and slipped his key into the lock inside the lights were on only dimly but it must mean she was at home she would never have left them to burn otherwise he walked through quickly a surge of pleasure welling up inside him it was far more than simply the warmth of being protected from the wind and enclosed by his own home or even knowing that a long comfortable night lay ahead of him she was in the sitting room which was always tidy always heated because it was the room in which he saw clients it was hester years before they were married who had insisted it be so it was she who had placed the chairs on either side of the fireplace and put the bowl with flowers on the table now she dropped her book and stood up her face full of pleasure she came straight to him expecting him to put his arms around her and to kiss her the sheer certainty of it was almost as sweet to him as the act itself he held her closely kissing her mouth her cheek her closed eyes her hair was untidy she smelled faintly of carbolic from the clinic no matter how much she scrubbed it never entirely went away she was a little too thin to be womanly he had always thought it was something he did not like and yet he would not have changed her gangling grace or her fierce tender emotion for the most beautiful woman he had ever seen or dreamed the reality was always better sharper more surprising in loving her he had discovered a fire and delicacy within himself that he had not known existed she infuriated him at times exasperated him excited him but never ever bored him above allmore precious than anything elsein her presence he could not be lonely the shipowner gave me the job he told her still with his arms around her his name is louvain hes lost a cargo of ivory and the thieves murdered the night watchman to get it she pulled back to look at his face so why doesnt he call in the river police is it even legal not to he saw the anxiety in her eyes he understood it uncomfortably well he needs the ivory back more quickly than theyll be able to get it he explained there are thefts up and down the river all the time and murders she asked there was no criticism in her but there was fear did she know how narrow their finances were now the bills were paid for this week but what about next week and the one after she loved the clinic it would be a defeat of all they had tried to do if she had to give it up in order to earn money as a paid nurse again the clinic would not survive without her she was not only the one reliable person there with any medical experience she had the will and the courage behind the whole venture they had managed through the harder earlier times with the financial help of lady callandra daviot who had been a friend to hester for years and to both of them since long before their marriage but monk was loath to go back to lady callandra nowwhen she was no longer actively involved in his cases and certainly could not help in this onesimply to ask her for money he knew perfectly well he would not be able to repay and could hester ever accept that either he touched his fingers gently to her hair yes of course murders he answered and accidental deaths which is what the authorities seem to be assuming this one is so far louvain has not told them otherwise when i catch the thief and can prove his guilt then i can prove the murder as well i have signed statements from louvain and the morgue attendant he hated the thought of working secretly from the river police he was not a lover of authority nor did he take orders with ease or grace but he was a policeman by training and even if he despised some of them for lack of imagination or intelligence he still respected the concept of an organized force both to prevent and to detect crime im hungry he said with a smile what is there to eat two in the morning the mist had blown away monk left the house by seven to begin his investigation and his education concerning the river and its customs hester slept a little later but by eight she too was on her way to the house in portpool lane almost under the shadow of reids brewery it was over three miles and necessitated the use of two omnibuses and then a walk but she was too aware of the expense to waste money on a hansom except in the middle of the night she arrived just before nine to find margaret already there having made a note of the nights work and busy considering what might best be done for the day margaret was a slender woman in her late twenties she had the confidence that goes with a degree of money and education and the vulnerability of a woman who was not yet married and had therefore failed to fulfill her mothers ambition for herand indeed her own for her social and financial survival she was dressed in a plain wool skirt and jacket and had a pencil and piece of paper in her hand her face lit when she saw hester only one admission during the night she said a woman with a serious stomachache i think its largely hunger we gave her porridge and a bed and she looks better already there was a shadow on her face in spite of the harmlessness of the news since the move from coldbath square there was no need for rent to be paid so hester knew it was not that which caused margarets concern this building was theirsor more accurately it belonged to squeaky robinson who remained out of prison and with a roof over his head strictly on condition that they had the sole use of the house for as long as they should wish it had allowed them to expand their work and now a greater part of london was aware that here prostitutes who were injured or ill could find help without religious conditions attached or any questions from police the building was a warren of rooms and corridors originally it had been two large houses with appropriate doors or walls knocked down to turn it into one and it possessed an adequate kitchen and an excellent laundry its use in squeaky robinsons time had been as a brothel the laundry in particular was an inheritance from that time ideally if more walls were removed they could turn rooms into wards which would make it far simpler to care for patients but that would cost money they did not have as it was it was getting more difficult to afford the necessities coal the raw materials for laundering cleaning lighting and food too little money seemed to be available for medicines where did you put her hester asked room three margaret answered i looked in on her half an hour ago and she was asleep hester went to see anyway she opened the door softly turning the handle with no noise and stepped inside the place was still well furnished from its original use which had been only a matter of months before there was quite a good rug albeit made of bright rags but it kept the warmth and there was old paper on the walls which was better than bare plaster now the bed was made up with sheets and blankets and a young woman lay sound asleep curled up sideways her hair knotted loosely at the back of her neck her thin shoulders easily discernible through the cotton nightgown it was one belonging to the clinic she had probably come in wearing her own gaudy street dress which would show too much flesh and give no protection from the cold hester touched the thin neck with the backs of her fingers the girl did not stir she looked about eighteen but more likely was far less her collarbone protruded and her skin was very white but her pulse was steady enough margaret was probably right it was no more than chronic hunger and exhaustion when she woke up they would give her more to eat but after that she would probably have to go they could not afford to feed her regularly hester wondered who she was a prostitute without sufficient skill or beauty a servant thrown out because she had lost her character either willingly or unwillingly with one of the men in the house a girl who had had a baby and perhaps lost it an abandoned wife a petty thief the possibilities were legion she went back out and closed the door she returned to the main room which had been created with rather simplistic carpentry from two smaller rooms a few months ago margaret was sitting at the table and bessie was carrying a tray from the kitchen with a teapot and two cups bessie was a big woman with a fierce countenance and hair which she screwed back off her brow and twisted into a tight knot on the back of her head she would never have said soit would have been a sign of unforgivable sentimentalitybut she was devoted to hester and even margaret was earning considerable favor in her eyes tea she said unnecessarily putting the tray down on the middle of the table and toast she added indicating the rack with five pieces propped up to remain crisp we int got much jam left an i dunno where were gonna get any more less we get it given us an oos gonna give jam ter the likes of us beggin yer pardon mrs monk and without waiting for an answer she swept out are we really out of jam hester said unhappily and so low we cant afford any more she would have liked to bring some from home but she was far more aware of the need for economy there than she had allowed monk to know she already bought less meat and cheaper cuts and herring more often than cod or haddock she had told the woman who came in to do the heavy cleaning that she was no longer needed and when she had time she meant to do the work herself before margaret could respond there was a sharp bang on the door and a moment later without waiting for an answer squeaky robinson came in he was a thin man dried up and bent over he was dressed in a very old velvet jacket that had lost whatever its original color had been his trousers were thick and gray and he wore slippers he carried a leatherbound ledger in his arms he put it on the table eyeing the tea and toast and sat down in the third chair opposite hester we cut it down he said with satisfaction but youll ave ter do better he had the air of a schoolmaster with a promising student who had unaccountably fallen short of expectation yer cant put out moren you get in hester looked at him patiently but it required a certain effort youve balanced the books squeaky what do we have left of course ive balanced the books he said with satisfaction even if he was masking it by a pretense of being offended thats wot im ere fer he was there under constant protest because at first he had had nowhere else to go when hester and margaret had very neatly tricked him out of his appalling brothel business and at a stroke gained the building for use as a clinic but as he had busied himself with small jobs there he had gained a certain pleasure from it even if he would sooner have given blood than admitted it so how much have we left she repeated he looked at her lugubriously not enough mrs monk not enough well manage food for another five or six days if yer careful no jam he pulled his lips down at the corners ceptin fer yerself praps an miss ballinger no jam fer these women an careful wi the soap an vinegar an the like he took a breath an dont tell me yer gotta scrub i know that just scrub careful an boil them bandages up an use em again he added unnecessarily he nodded pleased with himself he was becoming more and more proprietary each time they discussed the subject carbolic hester asked oh some he conceded but we need more money an i dunno where yer gonna get it lessn yer let me foller a few ideas o me own margaret raised her cup to conceal a smile hester could make an educated guess as to what squeakys ideas might be not yet she said firmly and we dont need to attract any attention that we could avoid give bessie what shell need for food but be sure to keep back at least two pounds tell me when we get that low i can tell yer now squeaky said shaking his head itll be day arter termorrer he sniffed sometimes i think yer live in a dream yer needs me ter wake yer up an thats a fact he rose to his feet slowly clutching the book there was an air of profound satisfaction in him the ease of his body the smug line of his lips the way his hands folded over the ledger remembering his previous occupation and his outrage at being tricked into yielding the house and all its furniture which was his entire livelihood hester smiled back at him of course i do she agreed thats why i kept you his satisfaction vanished he swallowed hard i know that im glad you do it so diligently she added mollified he turned and went out closing the door with a snick behind him margaret put down her cup and her face was grave we do need to get more money she agreed ive tried the usual sources but its getting more difficult she looked rueful theyre all generous enough when they think its for missionary work in africa or somewhere like that speak about lepers and they are only too willing i began two evenings ago at a soiree i was withshe colored slightlysir oliver and the opportunity presented itself to approach the subject of charitable gifts without the least awkwardness hester bit her lip to disguise her smile oliver rathbone was one of the most brilliantand successfulbarristers in london he had not long before been in love with hester but an uncertainty about a step as irrevocable as marriage and to someone as unsuitable in her outspokenness as hester had made him hesitate to ask her not that she would have accepted him she could never have loved anyone else as she did monkin spite of their continual quarrels the erratic nature of his income and his future let alone the dark shadow of amnesia across his past to marry him was a risk to marry anyone else would have been to accept safety and deny the fullness of life the heights and the depths of emotion and the happiness that went with them she believed that rathbone could find that same joy with margaret and deep as her friendship with him still was being a woman she felt most sensitively for margaret and read her with an ease she would never have betrayed but the moment they knew that it was for a clinic for street women here margaret went on they balked at it she bit her lip they make me so angry i stand there feeling like a fool because im full of hope that this time theyll give something i know it shows in my face and i cant help it im trying to be polite and inside i am veering wildly from pleading with them thanking them overmuch as if i were a beggar and the money were for me and fury if they refuse me she did not add that she had been acutely conscious of rathbone beside her and what he would think of her manners her decorum her suitability to be his wife but on the other hand would he lose all respect for her and she for herself were she to do less than her best for a cause she believed in so passionately and they say no hester said gently although something of her own anger crept into her tone cowardice and hypocrisy were the two vices she hated the most perhaps because they seemed to give rise to so many others especially cruelty they were woven into each other she had learned how many men used the street women and she refrained from judgment on that she also knew that quite often their wives were perfectly aware of it even if only by deduction what she hated was the hypocrisy of then turning and condemning those same women perhaps the interdependence was what frightened them or even the knowledge that what separated them was often an accident of circumstance rather than any moral superiority where there really was a moral honor a cleanness of spirit she had found there was also most often a compassion as well margaret was an example of exactly such singleness of intent and then i feel so ridiculously disappointed margaret answered looking across at hester and smiling ruefully at herself and im disgusted to be so vulnerable she did not mention rathbones name but hester knew what she was thinking margaret caught her eye and blushed am i so obvious she said softly only to me hester answered because ive felt just the same she finished the last of her tea but we do need more money so please dont stop trying you know me well enough to imagine what a disaster i would be in your place margaret laughed in spite of herself seeing her amusement it flashed across hesters mind to wonder if rathbone had ever told margaret of some of the social catastrophes hester had precipitated in her single days when she had been newly home from the crimean battlefields and still full of indignation at incompetence even then she had burned with belief in her power to move people to change to reform she had wanted to sweep away vested interest and follow discovery and truth she had spared no one with her tongue and achieved very few of her dreams i suppose so margaret conceded i hold my tongue far more than you do i dont think i like that in myself im thinking just the same as you are im just too used to not saying it it doesnt achieve anything hester admitted in the end it is selfindulgent you feel wonderful for a few minutes then you realize what youve lost margaret rubbed her hand over her brow i hate having to swallow my beliefs and be civil to people because i need their money the women need their money hester corrected her she leaned forward impulsively and put her hand on margarets dont be as frank as i wasit horrified oliver the fact that most of what i said was true made it worse not better give him time to come to it himself believe me he is a lot more liberal than he used to be memory lit sharply in her mind and she found herself almost laughing a year ago he would have been paralyzed with horror at the idea of what we did to squeaky to get this place but i honestly think he rather enjoyed it a smile lit margarets face making her eyes dance he did didnt he she remembered bessie came in as usual without knocking to say that there was a young woman looking for help like an apenny rabbit she is she said wearily all skin an bone never make a livin like that int ad a square meal in weeks shouldnt wonder white as a fishs belly an wheezin like a train hester stood up ill come she said simply she glanced back once at margaret and saw her go to the medicine cupboard and unlock it to check what they had and what they might afford to buy she followed bessie and found the girl standing in the waiting room shivering but too wretched to be frightened anymore she looked much as bessie had described hester estimated her to be about sixteen hester asked her the usual questions and studied her as she answered she was slightly feverish and had heavy congestion in her lungs but her principal problems were exhaustion and hunger and now also cold her thin dress and jacket were useless against the late october rain not to mention the freezing fog which would shortly come up from the river if only they had money to give her a hot bath and decent clothes but the little there was was already in jeopardy hester dearly wanted margaret to marry rathbone but if she did then she might no longer be able to work at the clinic at best her time would be restricted as lady rathbone she could hardly spend as many hours there as she did now she would have social obligations and of course pleasures she had certainly earned rathbone had more than sufficient financial means to give her all she could wish of position and comfort not like monk who understood both hardship and work only too intimately and then why should she not have children that would end her connection with the clinic altogether but it could not be fought against nor would hester have wanted to even were it possible she told bessie to put the kettle on again and use the warming pans to heat a bed for the girl she could at least stay there and sleep until the bed was needed for a more serious case a little hot water and honey would ease her chest and a couple of slices of bread her hunger it is hard to sleep well on an empty stomach we int got much oney left bessie said warningly but she was already on her way to do it by the time hester left in the late afternoon the regular costermonger toddy had called by to give her the bruised apples he could not sell and the heavier vegetables not worth his while to take all the way back home again he had consulted her about his cough his bunions and the blister on his hand she had looked at them all and assured him they were not serious she recommended honey for his throat and he went away happy effie as the new girl was named was still sound asleep but her breathing was less noisy and there was a look of deep peace on her white face the other patients were well enough and margaret was renewed in her determination to hold her tongue at social events no matter what it cost her temper or her indignation squeaky was still grumbling about the responsibility of balancing the books but if there was a man in london who could do it it was he hester was pleased to arrive home even though she was aware that monk would probably not be there at least he had a case to work on rather than looking for business hoping and failing although as she cleared out the grate to light a low fire being careful from habit to use no more coal than necessary in spite of their suddenly improved circumstances she could not keep her thoughts from turning to the problems he would face in an area so unfamiliar to him she lit the fire and watched the slow flame seeking the wood sticks then the smaller pieces of coal but after a brief blaze the fire was not catching the flame had sunk to a smolder she bent down on her hands and knees and knelt forward to blow gently at the small part that was still alive she knew the trick of placing an open newspaper over the whole front of the fireplace to make the chimney draw but she had no newspaper it was an extra expense unnecessary at the moment anyway she was too busy to take much interest in the world and its troubles there was no time to read such things the flames licked up again this was the season of year when stew was a very welcome meal and if the big pan was left on the back of the stove she could add vegetables to it every day and it kept perfectly it also meant that whatever time monk came home a meal was hot and waiting this time she felt free to add a nice amount of fresh meat and when she heard his key in the lock shortly after seven the meal was cooked well she asked when they were seated at the table and the bowls were steaming in front of them he thought before he replied watching her reaction ive never been so cold in my life he answered then smiled widely at least not that i can remember since recovering so much of his past in the recent railway case the fact of his amnesia no longer haunted him as it had from the time of the coach crash which had caused it a month or two before they had first metnow nearly seven years ago it was as if the ghosts were laid the worst known and faced and they had been not giants but ordinary weaknesses after all frailties that could be understood pitied and healed the horror had shrunk to human proportions into tragedy rather than wickedness now he could joke about it she smiled back a longborne weight was gone is the river very different from the streets she asked it feels different he replied taking another mouthful and savoring the richness of it compared with their recent frugality everythings governed by the tides all of life seems to revolve around them ships go upstream and downstream with the ebb and flow get caught at low water and you run aground but try to pass under the bridges at high water and you break your masts the rivermen know it to the foot he thought for a moment but the water has a beauty the streets dont theres a feeling of width the light and shadow are always changing she looked at his face and saw the awe of it in him there was something in the elements of the river which had captured him already again the fear touched her that he was out of his depth might he be too occupied in seeing what was physical to be aware of the differences in the minds of thieves and receivers the subtleties of deceit and violence whose warnings he might not recognize because he was unfamiliar you arent listening he accused her im trying to picture it she said quickly meeting his eyes again it doesnt sound like the city at all where do you start to look for the ivory can you trace where people have passed when there are no tracks no footprints then she wished she had not asked because how could he know it was too soon he looked rueful i learned that today i spent most of the time just walking around the docks ive lived in london for at least fifteen years but i had no idea how separate a world the docks are thousands of tons of cargo go through them every week from every part of the world its amazing there isnt more lost he leaned a little forward over the table towards her his food temporarily forgotten his voice rising in urgency its the gateway to the world in and out ships have to wait to unload until they can find space at one of the wharves sometimes its days sometimes weeks after they drop anchor there are people on the water all the time how are you going to find out who took the ivory she interrupted he took another mouthful of food im not sure that i can begin there he replied i think ill have to come at it the other way find out where it went and trace back from there to who took it i need the thief because he killed hodge otherwise i wouldnt care about him but he sold the ivory to someone or he will everything thats stolen gets sold sooner or later unless you can eat it burn it or wear it burn it she said in surprise coal he explained with a sudden smile most of the mudlarks on the banks are after coal some are looking for nails of course or anything else you could use oh yes she should have thought of that she tried to imagine wading up to her knees in the winter river bending to search for bits someone would buy but perhaps it was no worse than walking the alleys at night in the rain hoping to sell the use of your body for half an hour poverty and the need to survive could change your view of a lot of things thank heaven that if monk did not find the ivory at least they could turn to callandra daviot to help themtemporarily that is if monk could bear to ask her perhaps hester should go to her and ask for something for the clinic callandra of all people would understand she had worked ceaselessly for the good of the hospital and never shrank from asking anyone for money time or anything else she needed she had shamed many a society matron into a larger gift than the woman had ever intended she stood up and cleared away the plates she had a hot breadandbutter pudding in the oven and she brought it out and served it with considerable pride making it so well was a very recent achievement she watched him eat it with pleasure noting the amusement he strove to hide not with great success she caught his smile and shrugged a little ruefully they were still at the table when there was a firm rap on the front door monk stood up immediately but there was surprise in his face it was too late for anyone to call socially and he expected no information on his case for louvain yet either the caller was for hester to do with some emergency at portpool lane or a new case for him hester picked up the dirty dishes and carried them out to the kitchen when she returned callandra daviot was standing in the sitting room her hat was askew and her hair was as wildly untidy as usual curling in the damp and falling out of its pins none of which mattered in the slightest her eyes were bright and her cheeks flushed she had one glove in her hand the other one was nowhere to be seen she was glowing with happiness hester was delighted to see her she went forward to welcome callandra how are you my dear callandra said warmly very happy to see you hester replied letting her go and standing back would you like a cup of tea callandra looked startled oh no thank you my dear she stood still in the middle of the floor as if unable to make herself sit down the smile still wide on her face how are you both hester thought of lying politely but she and callandra had known each other too long and too well the generation between them had not affected their friendship in the slightest it had been hester rather than anyone her own age or social class who had watched callandras heartbreaking love for kristian beck and understood it it had been hester and monk to whom she had turned when kristian had been accused of murder and not only because of monks skill but because they were friends who would not mock her loyalty or intrude upon her grief hester could not deceive her we are struggling to make ends meet in the clinic she answered victims of our success i suppose however deep their friendship she would not tell her that for monk work had been poor of late he could do so if he wished for her to do it would be a betrayal callandra immediately turned her concentration to the subject raising funds is always difficult she agreed particularly when it is not a charity one feels comfortable boasting about its one thing to tell everyone at the dinner table that you have just given to doctors or missionaries scattered across the empire it can stop conversation utterly to say you are trying to save the local prostitutes hester could not help laughing and even monk smiled do you still have that excellent margaret ballinger with you callandra asked hopefully oh yes hester said with enthusiasm good callandra lifted up her hand as if she should have had an umbrella in it then remembered that she had left it somewhere i can give her some reliable names for raising contributions you had better not be the one to ask a smile of profound affection softened her face i know you too well to delude myself that you would be tactful one refusal and you would render such an opinion as to make all future approaches impossible thank you hester said with mock decorum but there was something in callandras words which disturbed her why did callandra not offer to ask them herself in the past she had not been hesitant and she could surely see in hesters face that she was already busier than she could manage with comfort callandra was still standing in the middle of the room as though too excited to sit now she was searching in her reticule for something but since it was more voluminous than most and obviously overfull and in no sort of order at all she was having difficulty she gave up have you a piece of paper william perhaps you would write them down for me of course he agreed but he glanced at hester rapidly and away again before he moved to obey hester was on the edge of asking what it was that had brought callandra unannounced and was so clearly momentous to her that all her usual care was scattered to oblivion but to do so might be intrusive she was a dear friend but that did not destroy her right to privacy monk brought the pen and paper and an inkwell setting them on the table for callandra she sat down at last and wrote the names and addresses herself and then after a moments thought with a flourish added what sums she thought they could comfortably contribute she held the list up in the air and waved it for the ink to dry since monk had brought no blotting paper then she handed it to hester dont lose it she commanded i may not be able to replace it for you monk stiffened hester looked up at him slowly hardly breathing callandras eyes were bright it was with happiness and tears as if she were on the edge of some tremendous step and she was clinging to the last moments of the familiar because it too was dear to her and she could not let go without pain i am going to vienna she said with only the slightest tremor in her voice to live there vienna hester repeated the word as if it were close to incomprehensible and yet it made the most devastating sense vienna was the original home of kristian beck before he had left with his wife to come to london then he had met callandra his wife had been murdered and grief and shattering revelations had followed perhaps as difficult as those of his dead wifes character had been the discovery of kristians own origins turning upside down everything he had previously believed but was callandra going to vienna because kristian had decided to return what was his part in her decision hester was already drymouthed with fear that callandra would be hurt yet again and she had borne so much already but callandras eyes were shining and it did not seem a wild hope but rather a steady understanding kristian and i are going to be married she said softly her voice was tender and absolutely sure he has decided that he needs to face the past look at it honestly and discover the answers whatever they are she turned from hester to monk im sorry william sharing cases with you gave me interest and purpose during many years when i would have had neither without you your friendship has meant even more to meas much in its own way as hesters but kristian will be my husband her eyes flickered down and then up again i wish to be with him and if leaving my home and my dearest friends is the price then i will pay it willingly i thank you with all my heart for the love you have given me in the past and for your skill and loyalty in defending kristian and me i know what we would have suffered without you hester went forward and put her arms around callandra holding her tightly and feeling callandras eager response i couldnt be more delighted for you she said honestly go to vienna and be happy and whatever kristian finds there help him to remember that he is not responsible for the sins or the ignorance of his fathers none of us are we cannot ever undo our own pasts let alone anyone elses but we have the future and i am so glad yours is with kristian that couldnt be better she kissed callandra on the cheek hugged her hard for a moment longer and then stepped back callandra turned to monk her face still touched with uncertainty he did exactly as hester had done go and be happy he said sincerely i cant think of anyone who deserves it more than both of you and when youve solved the problems of the past therell be other good causes to fight for if theres anyone who knows that i do callandra sniffed hard gulped and gave up the battle she let the tears flow standing quite still her face smiling in spite of them then as monk pulled out a handkerchief she accepted it and blew her nose thank you she said handing the handkerchief back to hester i apologize but i cannot add stealing your clothes to my general desertion my carriage is waiting will you allow me to retreat with what dignity i have left of course hester said her own voice thick with emotion goodbyes are ridiculous one is quite sufficient im most grateful callandra said her eyes brimming again she dug in her reticule and this time quite easily found what she was looking for she brought out two small packages handsomely wrapped and tied up in ribbon she glanced at them then handed one to hester and the other to monk from the expectancy in her face she was obviously waiting for them to open the gifts now hester started with hers undoing the ribbon and paper carefully inside was a box and within it the most exquisitely carved cameo not of the usual head of a woman but of a man with an elaborate helmet and flowing hair it was mounted in a rich filigree of both yellow and rose gold hester gasped with delight then looked up at callandra and saw the answering pleasure in her eyes monk unwrapped his more impatiently tearing the paper his was a gold watch a perfect piece of both art and workmanship his appreciation was abundantly clear in his face even before he spoke to thank her so you will remember not only me but how much i care for you both she said a little huskily now i must go she smiled once more and then swept out of the door as monk held it open for her her skirts were crooked her jacket not quite matching and her hat had slipped to one side but her head was high she did not look behind her even once monk closed the door and returned to the fire the watch still in his hand hester was still clasping the cameo she was thrilled for callandra her friend had loved kristian profoundly and hopelessly for so long that to have wished her anything but success would be unthinkable but she was aware with the cold from the open door still sharp in the air just how alone it left them she was not sure what to say the awareness of the difference it would make especially now was like a third presence in the room between them it had to happen she said lifting her gaze slowly to meet his we couldnt have wished it differently if the position were the other way around and it were you and i in their place and they in ours i should go to vienna or anywhere else if you needed meor wanted me with you he smiled slowly would you she knew he was joking fighting the fear so she could not see it she pretended she had not id like tea she remarked shall i fetch some by ten the following day when monk was back at the dockside hester was going through the cabinets in the main room at portpool lane there was conspicuously less of almost everything than there had been the day before no later than tomorrow they would have to buy more disinfectant and at least carbolic lye vinegar and candles it would be nice to have brandy as well and fortified wine to add to beef tea she could list another dozen things it would help to have the girl who had come in the day before was still deeply asleep but her breathing was easier and there was already a little color in her skin if they could have afforded to feed her for a week or two she would probably have recovered completely hester had turned away from the cupboard and was going to the drawer of the desk when bessie came in she had her sleeves rolled up and an apron tied around her waist there was an old smear of blood across the center of it we got another of em as can ardly breathe she said wearily her face puckered in anger because the problem was too big she had spent as long as she could remember trying to cope with it and as fast as she cured one another turned up if not two why couldnt the good lord a designed us better she added tartly or else done away wi winter e cant a not seed this comin it appens every year hester did not bother with an answer not that she had one anyway the question was rhetorical she turned from what she had been going to do and followed bessie to the entrance room where a middleaged woman in brown was sitting hunched up on the old couch her arms folded protectively across her chest she breathed slowly and with obvious difficulty in the candlelight her face was colorless her fair hair liberally streaked with gray was piled on her head like so much old straw hester looked more carefully at her pinched face and saw the whiteness about her lips and around her eyes and the slight flush in her cheeks it was probably bronchitis which could turn to pneumonia whats your name she asked molly struther the woman answered without looking up how do you feel exactly tired enough ter die the woman replied dunno why i bothered ter come ere cept flo tol me ter said as yerd elp daft i call it wot can yer do gonna change the world are yer there was no mockery in her voice she had not the energy for it find you a warm dry bedundisturbed for the most partand some food hester replied plenty of hot tea with maybe a nip of brandy in it at least until the brandy runs out molly drew in a deep breath of amazement and broke into a fit of coughing until she all but gagged hester fetched her some hot water from the kettle put a spoonful of honey in it and held it out for her molly sipped at it gratefully but it was several minutes before she tried to speak again thanks she said finally hester helped her to one of the rooms with two beds while bessie went off to heat a warming pan half an hour later molly was lying on her back blankets up to her chin eyes still wide with surprise and the sheer unfamiliarity of it we gotter get more money bessie said to hester when they were back in the kitchen she poked tentatively at the stove wondering how long it would burn without adding more coke to it it was a fine balance between using the minimum it would take to keep burning and so little it actually went out i know hester admitted margarets trying and ive got a list of names to go on with but people are uncomfortable about giving because of the womens occupation they feel better about sending their offerings to africa or somewhere like that bessie made a snarl in her throat that was eloquent of contempt so they think them africans is better than we are she demanded or theyre colder or ungrier or sicker mebbe i dont think its got anything to do with that hester replied warming her hands above the castiron surface of the stove o course it int bessie snapped filling the kettle up again from the ewer of water in the far corner near the stone sink and putting it back on the hob its ter do wi conscience thats wot its ter do wi it int our fault if africans starve or die its too far away fer us ter feel bad about it but if our own is freezin an starvin then thats summink ter feel bad abaht awright cos mebbe we should a seed they wasnt like that in the first place hester did not answer or mebbe its cos they int no better than they should be bessie went on drying her hands on her apron they sell theirselves on the street which is sin int it an we might get our skirts dirty if we ave anythin ter do wi the likes o them never mind our usbands go ter them poor sods fer a bit o wotever we dont wanter docos we got an eadache or it int decent or we dont want no more kids she slammed the grate door shut on the stove it int nice ter know about things like that so we pretend as we dont so o course we dont want em fed or nursed wed rather play at it as if they int real gawd elp us it int our daughter or sister or even our man thats probably more like it hester agreed hoping the kettle would boil soon a hot cup of tea would warm her through before she went around collecting the linen to wash and turned her thoughts to what they could fall back on if margaret failed she didnt want an idle mind or it would be too quickly filled with thoughts of how monk was progressing on the docks in the blustering rain searching for evidence he might not even recognize if it was there in his hands course it is bessie retorted stick yer ead in the coal cellar an then tell the world there int nobody there cos you cant see a bleedin thing gor i dunno are they stupid or just frit out o their brains hester did not reply she was upstairs changing beds ready to wash the linen when bessie came tramping up about two hours later im here hester replied coming to the door got another sick one poor cow bessie said cheerfully looks like death on a bad day she do shoot erd be the kindest thing she caught a stray length of hair and tucked it behind her ear mind ive felt like that at times it dont last forever jus seems like it but she got a feller with er wots askin real nice all proper dressed an all an e says ell pay us wot it costs ter look arter er an more besides she waited expectedly for hesters approval hester felt a stab of pity for the woman but she could not help the flood of relief that washed over her that someone was here this minute with money not the promise but the actuality good she said enthusiastically lets go and see him whoever he is hes come to the right place and she followed on bessies heels as they went downstairs and back to the front room the man was standing looking towards them he was a good height not unusually broad but strong and supple his light brown hair was thick with a slight wave to it but cut shorter than most and sprung up from his brow his skin was weatherburned his eyes blue and narrowed as if against light that was harsh mrs monk he stepped forward my name is clement louvain ive heard that you do a great work here for women of the streets taken ill am i told rightly louvain she was uncertain whether to show that she knew his name or not you are told rightly she replied intensely curious to know why he was there with a woman who was obviously extremely ill even at the slightest glance that hester had been able to afford her she looked fearful she was all but fainting where she sat on the couch and she had not even raised her head to look at either hester or bessie we help all those we can particularly if they have not the money to pay a doctor she told louvain money is not the problem he countered i shall be happy to pay whatever charges you consider reasonable as i told your woman plus a contribution so you can care for others i imagine such a thing would be welcome folks can be hard to persuade when they can excuse themselves by a nice moral judgment there was a bitter humor in his eyes and he appeared to know that hester understood his meaning precisely he was speaking to her as an equal at least on the subject of irony it would be welcome she agreed warming to the intelligence in him and the dry wit without money we can help no one he nodded what would be fair she thought rapidly she must not pitch it too high or he would be angry and refuse to pay but she wanted as much as possibleat least sufficient to look after the woman well feed her give her clean linen sit up with her if necessary and give her such medicines as would ease her distress two shillings a day she replied he seemed pleased good i will give you fourteen shillings and come back again in a week although i imagine it will be unnecessary she has family who will come for her before then it is simply a matter of caring for her in the meantime and i shall donate five pounds to your charity so you can care for others as well it was an enormous sum suspicions flickered in her mind as to why he would give so much and who the woman really was but the money would keep them open for another week at least and she could not afford to refuse it after that surely margaret would have succeeded in persuading at least one benefactor from callandras list who would give something thank you she accepted equivocation or a refusal for the sake of courtesy would be absurd what can you tell me about her so that we can do the best for her we are able her name is ruth clark he replied she is was the mistress of a colleague of mine she has become ill and he is no longer interested in her his voice carried emotion but no anger that she could see there was an intense pity in him just for a moment then he realized she was watching him and he controlled it until it was hardly discernible he was not a man who wished to have any softness seen in him even here he put her out he added i have sent letters to her family but it may be a few days before anyone can send for her they live in the north and at present she is too ill to travel hester looked at the woman again her face was flushed deep red and she seemed to be so consumed by her suffering that she was almost oblivious of her surroundings can you tell me any history of her illness hester asked quietly even though she thought the woman was not listening to her she still disliked speaking of someone as if they were not present anything you can tell me may help i dont know when it began he replied or if it was slow or sudden she seems to be feverish barely able to stand and since last night when i took her from his keeping she has had no desire to eat is she sick vomiting she asked he looked at her quite steadily no it seems to be a matter of fever and dizziness and difficulty in breathing i daresay it is pneumonia or something of the sort he hesitated i dont wish her in a hospital with their rigid moral rules they would despise her for her circumstances and rob her of any privacy hester understood she had worked in hospital wards and knew the pages of directions the things patients must do and could not do without removal of privileges freedoms many of them were to do with morality in someones strict opinion well do everything for her that we can she promised rest and warmth and as many hot drinks as we can persuade her to take will help but if it is pneumonia it will have to run its course until the fever breaks no one can tell whether that will be for good or ill but we will do all that can be done and i can promise you that at least she will be eased in her distress thank you he said quietly and with a suddenly intense feeling you are a good woman he put his hand into the pocket inside his jacket and pulled out a handful of money he placed five gold sovereigns on the back of the couch and then counted out four half crowns and four separate shillings our agreement he said thank you mrs monk good day to you good day mr louvain she replied but already her attention was on the sick woman she picked up the money and put it in the pocket of her dress then rearranged her apron over it bessie youd best help me get miss clark along to a room and into bed the poor soul looks fit to pass out and indeed ruth clark seemed so deep in her distress as to be beyond helping herself when hester bent to half lift her on one side with bessie on the other it was all they could do to get her as far as the first bedroom bessie propped her up sagging against the door frame while hester freed one hand to open the door and then together they half lifted half dragged her across to the bed she fell on it heavily her eyes were still open but she did not seem to see anything nor did she speak she was dead weight and with considerable difficulty in spite of much practice hester took her outer clothes off while bessie went to get half a cup of hot tea with a drop of brandy in it when she had removed all but ruths undergarments and had eased her into the bed hester took the pins out of ruths hair so she would be more comfortable she touched the womans forehead it was very hot her skin dry she studied her patients face trying to assess what sort of woman she was and how long she had been ill it must have come on very rapidly had it been slowa sore throat then a tight chest then feversurely louvain would have brought her sooner she did not look to be a woman of delicate constitution or prone to infection the skin of her arms and body was firm and her neck and shoulders had a good texture not the loose thin slightly bluish look of someone frequently ill her hair was thick indeed it was very handsome a dark brown with heavy wave and when she was well it probably had a gloss to it her features were regular and pleasing what kind of a man would have cast her off like this simply because she was ill it was certainly not chronic if she recovered she would again be a healthy vital woman she was not beyond her midthirties was she some shipowners mistress whose circumstances made it impossible for him to give her the care she needed was he afraid she was going to die and he would be unable to explain the presence of her body in his house or was she louvains own mistress and for some reason he was unwilling to admit that had the reputation of the clinic spread so far that even on the dockside louvain had heard of it or had monk mentioned something of it when accepting his new job perhaps none of that mattered now she did not ask questions of the others in her care their recovery was all that concerned her why should this woman be different bessie came with the tea and between them they propped ruth up a teaspoonful at a time they managed to persuade her to take it finally they eased her down again put the covers right up to her chin and left her to sink into a sleep so profound she seemed close to unconsciousness outside the room hester fished in her pocket and took out the money she gave one of the sovereigns and the fourteen shillings to bessie go and get food coal carbolic vinegar brandy and quinine she ordered she added another sovereign enough for the rest of the week thank god there isnt rent to pay ill give this to squeaky that should make him smile and with a lift of hope she followed down the corridor after bessie three monk left the house before daylight so he was on the wharfside by sunrise just before eight oclock it was a blustery day with a sharp wind from the fastflowing tide the barges going slowly upstream were dark grays silvers and looming shadows were cut by the dense blackness of masts sweeping the sky lazily barely in motion yardarms lumpy with sails lashed to them the hulls of the ships were indistinguishable except for size no features clear just a shape no gun ports no figureheads no timbers he had learned a little yesterday but most of it only emphasized how different the river was from the cityand that he was a stranger with no old debts or favors to call on people stole for many reasons he realized where louvains ivory was concerned monk assumed the thief could sell it for profitor he had some personal quarrel with louvain and took it merely to make him suffer possibly knowing that he had already committed it to a particular buyer monk needed to know more about the receiving of stolen goods on the river and even more than that about louvain himself his friends his enemies his debtors and creditors his rivals he had realized yesterday that he could not spend time around the dockside without a reason that would occasion no comment so he had come dressed as if he were a gentleman fallen on times hard enough to drive him to seek work he had noticed several such men the day before and studied their manner and speech well enough to imitate them he had good boots to keep his feet dry old trousers and a heavy jacket against the wind he had bought a secondhand cap both to protect his head and to disguise his appearance a woollen muffler and the kind of mittens that allowed a working man to use his fingers he found a cart selling hot tea and bought a mugful he contrived to fall into conversation with a couple of other men who appeared to be hoping for a days work when unloading began shortly he was careful not to let them think he had any plans to jump his place in their queue whats the cargo today he asked sipping the hot tea and feeling it slide down his throat and warm him inside the larger of the two men pointed with his arm the cardiff bay down there he replied indicating a fivemasted schooner fifty yards away come in from the china seas i dunno wot they got but theyll likely be keen ter get it orff the other man shrugged could be teak from burma he said unhappily damn eavy stuff that is an all or rubber or spices or mebbe silk monk looked farther out where another schooner was riding at anchor this one with six masts the liza jones the first man raised his eyebrows south america i eard brazil dunno if thats right could be a load of ogwash wot der they bring in from brazil bert i dunno bert answered wood coffee chocolate mebbe dont make no difference ter us itll all be eavy an awkward every day i say ill never carry that bleedin stuff again an then every night i get so cold id carry the devil piggyback just fer a fire an a roof over me ead yeah an all his friend agreed he gave a warning glance at monk first come first served eh remember that an yer wont come ter no arm less yer fall in the water like or some bastard drops a load on yer foot the implied warning was as clear as the hard light on the water actually monk had no desire whatever to work at the backbreaking job of unloading but he must not appear unworthy or he would awaken suspicion that would be very foolish he observed they went on talking desultorily speaking of cargoes from all around the world india australia argentina the wild coasts of canada where they said tides rose and fell forty feet in a matter of hours ever bin ter sea bert asked curiously no monk replied thought not there was a benign contempt in his face i ave seen the fever jungles o central america an i int never goin there again frighten the bleedin life out o yer sooner see the midnight sun up norway an the arctic like freezin ter deathd be quick saw a feller go overboard up there once got im out but e were dead the cold does it quicker than the fever an cleaner if i got the yellow fever id cut me own throat soonern wait ter die of it me an all his friend agreed they spoke a little longer monk wanted to ask about cargoes being stolen and where they would be sold but he could not afford to arouse suspicion they were all facing the water when a barge went by and they could not help seeing the lumpers knock a few pieces of coal off into the shallow water where at the next ebb it would be low enough for the mudlarks to find it and pick it up no one made any remark it was an accepted part of life but it stirred a thought in monks mind could the ivory have been moved like that dropped off the maude idris in the dark onto the barges on their way up or downstream it would take only moments to move canvas to conceal them he must find which lightermen were out that night and follow it up the foreman came from one of the loading gangs looking for two men monk was intensely relieved he did not want three but he affected disappointmentalthough not deep enough for the men to start thinking of another ship that might want him he did not manage to avoid a small errand for which he was paid sixpence he spent the next two hours asking about which barges moved at night and learned that there were very few indeed and only with the tide whichaccording to the time of hodges deathwould have been upstream towards the morning high water painstakingly he accounted for all of them he bought a hot pie and a piece of cake for lunch with another cup of tea it was late after one oclock and he had never felt colder in his life no alley in the city however icebound or windfunneled could match the cutting edge of the wind off the water and the sting of the salt his recent cases of petty theft when he had spent his time in offices and the servants quarters of other peoples houses had made him soft he realized it now with acute discomfort he sat down on a pile of timber and old ropes which was sheltered from the wind and began to eat he was halfway through the pie relishing the hot meat when he realized that the shadow next to the pile of boxes to his left was actually a small boy wearing a ragged coat with a cloth cap pulled over his ears his feet were bare streaked with dirt and blue with cold do you want some pie monk said aloud half the child looked at him suspiciously wha for well if i were you id eat it monk snapped or shall i give it to the gulls yer don wan it ill take it the child replied quickly stretching out his hand then pulling it back again as if the thought were too good to believe monk took a last bite from the pie and handed it over he drank the rest of the tea before his better nature lost him that as well the child sat down beside him on a stump of wood and ate all of the pie solemnly and with concentration then he spoke yer lookin fer work he said watching monks face or yer a thief there was no malice or contempt in his voice simply the enquiry one stranger might make of another by way of introduction im looking for work monk replied then he added quickly not that im sure i want to find any if yer dont work an yer int a thief whered yer get the pie the child said reasonably an the cake he added do you want half monk asked when i say i dont want work i mean i dont want to load or unload cargo he amended i dont mind the odd message now and then oh the child thought reckon as i might elp yer wi that now an then like he said generously yeah ill ave a piece o yer cake i dont mind if i do he held out his hand palm upward monk carefully divided the cake and gave him half whats your name he enquired scuff the boy replied wots yours monk pleased ter meet yer scuff said gravely he looked at monk frowning a little yere new ere int yer monk decided to tell the truth yes how did you know scuff rolled his eyes but a certain courtesy prevented him from replying yer wanna be careful he said pursing his lips ill learn yer a few things or yerll end up in the water ter begin wif yer needs to know oo ter speak ter an oo ter stay clear of monk listened attentively at the moment all information was a gift but more than that he did not want to be discourteous to this child scuff held up a dirty hand less than half the size of monks yer don wanna know the bad onesmoren that yer don want them ter know you thats the night plundrers what night plundrers scuff repeated dont you ear too good yer better watch it yer gotta keep yer wits or yerll end up in the water like i said night plundrers is them wot works the river at night there was an expression of infinite patience in his face as if he were dealing with a very small child in need of constant watching theyd kill yer for sixpence if yer got in their way like the river pirates used ter be afore there was ever river plice special like another string of coal barges passed sending their wash slapping against the steps i see monk replied his interest engaged scuff shook his head swallowing the last of the cake no yer dont yer dont see nuffin yet but if yer live long enough mebbe yer will are there a lot of night plunderers monk asked do they work for themselves or for others what kinds of things do they steal and what do they do with them scuffs eyes opened wide what der you care yer int never goin ter even see none of em if yerve any sense dont yer go lookin into fings like that yer int got the wits fer it nor the stomach neither yer stick ter wot yer can dowotever that is he looked distinctly dubious that that was anything at all monk bit back the reply that rose to his lips it irritated him surprisingly deeply that this childs opinion of him was so low it took an effort not to justify himself but he did need this information the theft from the maude idris looked like exactly the sort of thing such men would do im just curious he replied and yes i mean to avoid them then keep yer eyes shutan yer moufall night scuff retorted come ter that yerd better keep yer mouf shut most o the day an all so what do they take monk persisted anyfink wot they can o course scuff snapped why wouldnt they take yer ole bleedin ship if yer sloppy enough ter let em and what do they do with what they take monk refused to be deterred this was no time for delicate feelings sell it o course scuff looked at him narrowly to see if he could really be as stupid as he appeared to whom monk asked keeping his temper with difficulty here on the river or in the city or on another ship scuff rolled his eyes ter receivers he replied dependin on wot it is if its good stuff ter the oplent geezers if its poor ter the covtous they pick up the other bits or the revnue men o course but they more often take just a cut int easy ter sell stuff less yer got the knowow or the connections he shook his head yer int never gonna last ere mister leavin yer ere is like puttin a babe out by isself ive done all right so far monk defended himself yeah scuff said with heavy disbelief an ow long is that then i know everyone round ere an i int never seen yer afore where yer gonna sleep eh yer thought o that then if it rains an then freezes which it will sooner or later them as int inside somewhere is gonna wake up dead ive got a few contacts monk invented rashly maybe ill go into receiving i know good stuff from badspice ivory silk and so on now scuff was really alarmed dont be so bleedin daft he said his voice going up into a squeak dyer think its a freeforall or summink yer go inter the covtous stuff an the fat manll ave yer feet fer door stoppers an if yer try the oplent stuff mr weskitll fix yer fer the rest o yer life yerll wake up wi a splittin ead in the old o some ship bound for the fever jungles o panama or someplace an nobodyll never see yer again yer wanna go back ter thievin wi bits o paper or wotever it is yer done afore you int safe ere ive managed so far monk retaliated at last he was angry with himself that he should care what this child thought but he had had enough of being considered a fool meet me here tomorrow ill bring you a damned good lunch it was a challenge a whole hot pie for yourself and tea and cake with fruit in it scuff shook his head disbelievingly yer daft he said with regret dont yer go an get caught it int no better in jail than it is ere rainin or not how do you know monk challenged cos i keep me ears open an me mouf shut scuff retorted now i got work ter do if you aint those lumpers put coal out it int gonna sit there all bleedin day i gotter go fish it up and he rose to his feet swiftly looked once more at monk and shook his head then disappeared so rapidly monk was not sure which way he went but he determined to keep his word however inconvenient and be there the following day with the provisions hed promised he spent the afternoon further along the docks to the north side of louvains offices where barges might have put in on the morning high tide he tried to blend in with the other laborers idlers thieves and beggars who populated the area he took scuffs warning very seriously he stood half sheltered behind a bale of wool ready for loading it served the double purpose of concealing his outline and protecting him from the worst of the wind he watched the men with backs bent under the weight of coal sacks and hoped profoundly he would not have to resort to such a task to preserve his anonymity he saw the intricate outlines of winches and derricks bearing heavier loads out of ships holds alongside the wharves everywhere was the sounds of shouting the cries of gulls and the slap of water barges moved in long strings piled high with coal or timber a threemasted schooner was tacking up towards the bridge ferries were weaving in and out like beetles oars shining as they rose and dipped he watched the river police patrolling so close to the shore that he saw their faces as one turned to another with a joke and they both laughed a third made some remark and they shouted back at him the waves drowning their words but the good nature of it obvious monk felt suddenly isolated on the dockside as if the warmth and the meaning of life were out there on the water in comradeship and a shared purpose there had been much about waiting in the police which had infuriated him as well as the restrictions the answerability to men of limited vision and unlimited vanity sometimes the monotony of it but the very boundaries were also a shape and a discipline the same man whose weakness curtailed his freedom also supported him when he was vulnerable and sometimes covered his failures he had been intolerant then he was paying some of the price for that now as he stood alone on the dockside having to learn everything for himself in a new alien and bitterly cold world where few of the familiar rules applied about midafternoon as his legs seemed frozen immobile and he realized he was shivering and all his muscles were locked he saw a man walk up to another and accost him in an obvious bad temper the first man answered him fiercely within moments they were shouting two of three bystanders joined in taking one side or the other the quarrel swayed backwards and forwards and looked like it was developing into an ugly incident more than half a dozen men became involved and the crowd swirled around a group of laborers unloading brassware monk moved forward mostly to stretch his limbs and get the feeling back in his feet no one noticed him they were all watching the quarrel one of the men took a wild swing at another and connected with his jaw sending him staggering backwards to knock over a third man a fourth let fly his own punch and then it was a melee it was by chance that monk saw two men detach themselves and with remarkable speed and skill pick up four of the brass ornaments and slip them sideways to a youth and an old woman among the bystanders who promptly turned and walked away monk left as well before the police could come to part the combatants and restore peace he could not afford to be caught on the outskirts of the crowd scufflehunting was a trade he had seen a hundred times before and the brass would never be found but as he walked back along the quayside towards louvains offices he resented the fact that he was in effect running away from the band of men he used to be one ofindeed used to command it was a bitter taste to swallow he was acutely mindful of the fact that he had to report to louvain today and he had nothing remotely useful to tell him the search for evidence of barges unloading surreptitiously had been fruitless he had no facts at all and not a great deal of deduction he walked slowly as he thought about it the sounds of the riverside all about him the clang of metal creak of wood hiss and slurp of water the tide was turning sweeping in again upriver driving the mudlarks up the shore and lifting the ships higher at anchor the dusk seemed later this afternoon because the sky was streaked with clear pale strips to the west and the water was all grays and silvers dotted by riding lights burning yellow what had he deduced that the ivory could have been taken by any of the thieves on the river and almost certainly ended up with a receiver who would sell it on to whom who would buy ivory a dealer to pass it on to jewelers carvers of ornaments or chess pieces makers of piano keys any of a dozen artists or artisans that led him to the crux of the question was it a theft of opportunity or a planned crime with a particular receiver in mind the hour it must have happened according to hodges death indicated the former if the latter then monk had very little chance of recovering the ivory because it was almost certainly well beyond the river by now he crossed the street and walked along the narrow footpath as a cart rattled over the cobbles the lamplighter was busy tipping his long pole to touch the wicks and bring the gift of sudden vision and the illusion of warmth there was no mist off the water just the customary driving wind and the faint haze of smoke to the east where it was darkest and the river wound beyond greenwich and the estuary to the sea a few stars glittered sharp and brittle monk turned the corner into the wind again pulled his coat collar higher and tighter around his neck and quickened his pace to louvains offices he was obliged to wait in the foyer for a quarter of an hour pacing back and forth on the bare floor before louvain sent for him but he would know there was no news yet had there been monk would have come earlier the office was warm but monk could not relax the force of louvains personality dominated the room even though he looked tired the lines on his face were deeper than before and his eyes were pinkrimmed im here because i said i would be monk replied i need to cultivate informants is that an oblique way of saying you want more money louvain looked at him with undisguised contempt not more than i have monk replied coldly if i do then ill tell you in a manner you wont mistake he looked at louvain more closely he would be a fool to miss such an opportunity to observe him the theft might have been by chance but it was equally likely to have been deliberate he could not afford any kind of ignorance louvain stood in front of his desk now with his back to the gas lamp on the wall it was an easy and perfectly natural position but it also concealed his expression giving his features an unnatural and somber look and how long does this process take he asked there was an edge to his voice anxiety and perhaps tiredness making it rough he worked long hours it was possible more of his fortune rested on recovering the ivory than he had told monk i should reap some benefits tomorrow monk replied rashly do you have a plan louvain enquired now his face was softer something like a lift of hope in it perhaps his contempt was meant to conceal the fact that the theft mattered to him intensely and he was dependent upon monk he employed him and could pay him or not but he would not find his ivory without help and they both knew that monk weighed his answer carefully the tension in the room prickled as they each watched the other weighing judging who had the strength of will to bend the other who could harness his vulnerability and disguise it as a weapon i need to narrow down the kind of receiver who could handle a load like that monk said levelly a man with the connections to sell it on or a woman louvain amended some of the brothelkeepers are receivers as well but be careful just because theyre women doesnt mean they wouldnt slit your throat if you got in their way the vaguest smile crossed his face and then vanished youre no use to me dead if it happened it would anger him but it would not lie on his conscience there was a certain respect in him a levelness in the gaze a candor he would not have used with a lesser man monk refused to be ruffled he glanced around the office at the pictures on the walls they were not of ships as he had expected but were wild landscapes of fierce and alien beauty stark mountains towering above churning water or barren as the volcanoes on the moon cape horn louvain said following his look and patagonia i keep them to remind me who i am every man should see such places at least once feel the violence and the enormity of them hear the noise of wind and water that never stops and stand on a plain like that where the silence is never broken it gives you a sense of proportion he hunched his shoulders and pushed his hands into his pockets still staring not at monk but at the pictures it measures you against circumstance so you know what you have to doand what it will mean to fail monk wondered for an instant if it was a warning but when he looked at the intense concentration in louvains face he knew the man was speaking to himself its a cruel beauty louvain went on his voice touched with awe theres no mercy in it but its also freedom because its honest then as if suddenly remembering that monk was a hired hand not an equal or a friend he stiffened and the emotion fled from his face get my ivory back he ordered times short dont waste it coming here to tell me youve got nothing monk swallowed the retort that came to his lips good night he answered and before louvain responded he turned and went out he hesitated in the street the wind was knifeedged and a sickle moon was rising across the water ice rimed over the cobbles making them slippery and his breath was a plume of vapor in the air the thought of going home was sweet like a burst of warmth inside him but it was too soon to give up on the day it was only a little after six and he could put in at least another two or three hours the thieves would already have gotten rid of the ivory by now and the receiver would be looking to place it he needed to find it before then he walked back along the street towards the public house on the corner pushed the door open and went in the room was warm and noisy full of shouts laughter and the clink of glasses the floor was covered with dirty straw people jolted each other to move closer to the bar and into the lanterns yellow light the barmans face gleamed with sweat above the tankards topped with foam it all smelled of ale the steam from hot weary bodies wet clothes mud and horse manure on boots monk waited his turn moving slowly closer to the front of the queue all the time listening and watching there were street women among the men garish in red and pink dresses low on the shoulder faces painted with false gaiety their voices forced the laughter and their eyes were tired he listened to snatches of conversation straining to link them together and make sense of them he had worked many years in the city he knew receivers of stolen goods by instinct it was not in their appearance so much as in their manner some were hearty some furtive some talked a great deal others were terse some offered magnificent prices and sang praise of their own generosity and how it would ruin them others haggled over every halfpenny but they all had a watchfulness about them they did not miss a word or a gesture from anyone and they could assess the monetary worth of anything in seconds there was also a defiance a cautious caginess with which other people approached them not as friends but always with a mind to business he saw several transactionssome with a discreet hand in and out of the pocket a piece of jewelry or a trinket shown some were merely words if one of them had concerned louvains ivory he would not have known but only a fool buys something he has not seen and fools do not survive long in such a trade he reached the front of the queue and bought his ale then he found a place to sit and drink it next to a man with a scar down his cheek and an empty left sleeve of his jacket monk took the opportunity to strike up conversation within half an hour he had refilled his own glass and the mans getting them each a pork pie at the same time it was an expense that could go on louvains bill course we still get some like it the sailor said taking up his tale where he had left it when monk stood up but not like the old days real pirates they were his watery eyes were bright with memory me granpa were one o the first in the river plice that were in them days there was crime on the river you wouldnt believe he nodded not now seein as ow its all tame an respectable like near alf the men in the docks was thievin back then he held up his fingers two men they were arriott an colquhoun set up the plice got rid of ninetyeight out of every undred o thieves they did in jus one year he stared at monk challengingly think on it don it eat yer eart out eh they was real men he said it with a fierce happy sense of pride were you in the river police monk enquired with interest the man laughed so hard he all but spilled his ale no no i int an oggler bless yer i bin ter sea most o me life till i lorst me arm but that were river pirates an all comin back from the indies we were he leaned forward confidentially his voice quieter and more urgent as memory flooded back java way them china seas is summink orrible in bad weather an swarmin wi pirates he took a long swig of his ale and wiped the back of his hand across his mouth don trust nobody keep a watch on deck all hours an keep yer gun loaded an yer powder dry but we made it all the way ome down the indian ocean he made a circular movement with his finger round the cape o good ope and up the atlantic past the skeleton coast o africa across biscay are yer followin me like yes of course an ome ter spitead he said triumphantly fivemasted schooner we was wi a good set o guns fore an aft we passed gravesend tacked up fiddlers reach past the marshes on either side of us safe as ouses gallions reach right up ter woolwich he sniffed lugubriously could smell ome it were that close eave to for the night off bugsbys marsh ter make the isle o dogs an the pool the next day damn it if we werent boarded in the middle watch by alf a dozen river pirates an cut loose he banged his fist on the table tide took us onter the mud banks an by dawn there werent a bleedin thing left o the cargo they could shift the sons o bitches on the watch raised the alarm poor sod cost im is life an we all come up on deck wi pistols an cutlasses an it were a right battle but yer cant fight em bastards an the wind an the tide at once monk imagined itthe ship drifting picking up speed with the current the men fighting desperately on deck trying to swing swords in the narrow spaces seeking to shoot at moving uncertain targets in the swaying lantern light the violence the fear the pain what happened he had no need to pretend interest we killed three of em the man replied with satisfaction licking his lips after the last mouthful of the pork pie lost two o us though wounded two more o them pretty bad an put em over the side they drowned then what alf a dozen more of em werent there he said bitterly i ad me arm gashed so bad i bled like a stuck pig got it all stitched up like but went wi the gangrene took it off they did ad ter ter save me bleedin life he said it wryly as if it were a long time ago and hardly mattered anymore but monk saw the pain in his eyes and the memory of what he had been he could feel not the physical agony of the knife but the mental scream as he became less than whole the mutilation that tore through him still monk did not know how to respond should he acknowledge the pain he had seen and attempt to convey some understanding of it or was it better to behave as if he had not noticed are there still pirates on the river even today he asked it was an evasion but it was the best he could do some the man answered the brilliance of hurt fading from his eyes the ogglers is pretty good but even they cant do it all are there pirates this far up the river probly not up by limeouse an that way its opium eaters an them kinds o things but yer never know theres other folks as ad a few runins wif em part from me louvain the moment monk had said it he wondered if it were wise the mans face lit up with pleasure clem louvain yer damn right e cut them up summink beautiful e did yer never seen a better man wi a cutlass than clem they rued the day they messed wi im he sniffed cheerfully mind thats a few year ago now but it dont make no diffrence summink like that yer don forget they don mess wif im still an all monk measured his words carefully im surprised they dont want revenge he said with a deliberate lift of curiosity the man grinned showing gapped teeth come up from ell ter ask for it yer reckon dead monk was surprised course dead the man said contemptuously two killed right there on the deck o the mary walsh an two anged up execution dock i seed it meself went ter watch i did rare sight that no one left to want payment for it monk pressed not for that bleedin lot o sods the man upended the glass to drain the last of his beer reckon as mr louvains ealth were drunk right well in a few ouses up an down the river that night he took his mug and pushed it an inch closer to monk without looking at him rivers full o tales he added monk took the hint and fetched them both another pint although he had no capacity or wish to drink any more himself he was prepared to listen for another hour at least his companion settled down to picking from his memory tales of violence failed robberies and successful ones and eccentric characters in the last fifty years along the river most o em back then he said gleefully he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth monk had bought him a second pie the color with which he painted the river life contained many warnings that might prove useful and it gave monk a far better understanding of the intricacies of illicit trade of lighthorsemen heavyhorsemen lumpers plunderers and crooked revenue men monk heard stories some of the legendary receivers including the presentday fat man the most famous opulent receiver along this stretch of the water monk did not arrive home until after nine oclock by which time hester was concerned the dinner she had made was far past its best and barely edible im all right he assured her holding her as closely as he could until she pushed him away to search his face really he repeated i was in a public house down by the docks listening to an old sailor telling me tales her face was very serious mr louvain came to the clinic today what he was incredulous clement louvain are you sure what for it disquieted him although he did not know why he did not want louvain anywhere near hester and even as the thought was in his mind he knew it was absurd hester dealt with the ugliest and most tragic elements of life every day what did he want he demanded taking his coat off and hanging it up she recounted the story of ruth clark and mentioned louvains generous donation she bit her lip were finding it hard to get people to give he heard the anger in her voice and he understood it why didnt he take her to a hospital he would have to register her there and tell them his own name anyway he might be known hes an important man they would ask who she was and they might not believe he brought her for someone else he smiled touching her cheek gently did you she shrugged i dont care and i wont repeat it to anyone except you did you learn anything more about the ivory not specifically but i gained an informant good youre cold are you hungry not very but id like some tea he followed her into the kitchen telling her about scuff as she filled the kettle and put it on the stove fetched milk from the pantry and set out the teapot and cups on a tray he told her many of the things he had seen and heard but not about louvain and the river pirates there was no need to waken fears in her that she could do nothing about she laughed at some of the descriptions the eccentricity the ingenuity and the will to survive they went to bed tired from the work of the day and happy to be close not only in mind but in the warmth of touch in the morning he woke before she did he slipped out of bed and washed and dressed without disturbing her not shaving in order to keep his image for the dockside downstairs he riddled the stove and carried out the ashes it was not a job he was accustomed to doing but it was heavy and he knew she had dismissed the woman who came to help louvains payment was generous but it must be made to last as long as possible he had no idea where the next reasonable sum was coming from he filled the kettle and set it on the hob then went back upstairs to waken hester and say goodbye to her he had given a great deal of thought to how next to proceed and only one answer pushed itself to the forefront of his mind he needed to find the receiver reluctantly he went to the drawer of his dresser and took out the gold watch callandra had given him he slipped it into the top pocket inside his jacket ten minutes later he was out in the gray light of the october street and half an hour after that he was back on the dockside again the air was still almost windless but the damp penetrated the flesh till it felt as if it reached the bone he huddled into his coat turning up the collar he pushed his hands deep into his pockets and stepped over the puddles from the nights rain it was a while since he had had a new pair of boots and it might be even longer before he did again he needed to take care of these ones the more he considered the ivory the more he believed the thieves would have taken it to a specific opulent receiver capable of selling it on to the highly specialized markets that could use it there was a limited number of such people along the river it was not finding them which was the major issue but proving that they still knew where the ivory was and with each passing day his chances of success were reduced he started at one of the better pawnshops taking out the gold watch and asking what they could give him for it five guineas was the answer and if i have more he asked the pawnbrokers eyes widened more like that of course whered you get more like that disbelief was heavy in his face monk looked at him with contempt what do you care can you deal with them or not no no i int in that business you take em somewhere else the pawnbroker said vigorously monk put the watch back into his pocket and went out into the street again walking quickly avoiding the close walls and skirting wide around the entrances of alleyways he thought of word spreading and his being robbed or even killed and it sent colder knots clenching on his stomach than even the raw air could produce but he knew of no other way to draw the attention of a receiver he could not afford the time to play a slow careful game and he had no police knowledge or help to guide him far from going to them as would have been his instinct he was obliged to avoid them to watch for them and take another path as if he were a thief himself once again he cursed louvain for keeping him from using the regular lawful means he kept his promise to scuff and was at the dockside at the same time and place with hot pies tea and fruitcake he was absurdly disappointed to see no one there waiting for him he stood in the clearing amid the old boxes he could hear nothing but the lost cries of gulls above and the wail of foghorns as mist rose from the water choking the light and muffling sound the rising tide slapped against the pier stakes and in the distance men shouted at each other some of them in languages he did not understand a string of barges made a wash that hit the shore sharply and then died away again swallowed in the fog scuff he called out there was no answer no movement except a rat scuttling into a pile of refuse twenty yards off if scuff did not come soon the pies would not be warm anymore but then he would have no way of telling the time even if he could it was stupid to have expected him to be there he was an urchin just like any of the petty thieves that roamed the alleys of the city picking pockets or running errands for forgers cardsharps and brothelkeepers monk sat down unhappily and began to eat his own pie there was no point in allowing that to get cold too he was halfway through it when he was aware of a shadow across his feet you eaten my pie a voice said disgustedly he looked up scuff was standing in front of him his face filthy his expression full of reproach you didnt oughta do that he accused if you want yours cold thats up to you monk said overwhelmed with a relief that would be absurd to show he held out the other pie it was twice the size of yesterdays scuff took it solemnly and sat down crosslegged holding the pie with both hands as he consumed it he said nothing until the last mouthful was gone then he reached out and took the tea and cake when that was finished he spoke that was good he said with satisfaction wiping his mouth with one filthy sleeve you were late monk remarked how do you know the time anyway tide o course scuff replied with exaggerated patience at monks stupidity i come at the same eight o the water monk said nothing he should have thought of that if there was anything a mudlark would know it was the rise and fall of the water scuff nodded yer bin runnin more errands he asked glancing at the cups that had held the tea not today im looking for a receiver wholl deal in good stuff maybe goldor ivory lots o gold scuff said thoughtfully dunno nobdy wot as ivory worth a lot is it yes the fat man e knows most things wot goes on but yerd best stay clear of im es a right bad bastard an yer int no match for im there was a gentle pity in his voice and monk was almost sure there was concern in his eyes i need to find some ivory monk confided he knew he was being rash telling this young mudlark information he could not afford to have spread everywhere but the desperation was mounting inside him his efforts of the morning had not so far led him to a single receiver whod sell it yer mean cheap of course i mean cheap monk agreed witheringly if i dont go to the fat man who else scuff considered for a few moments i could take yer ter little lil she knows most o wots fer sale but i cant jus do it like i gotta make arrangements how much scuff was offended that int nice i trust yer like a friend an yer go an insult me im sorry monk apologized with genuine contrition i thought it might cost you something ill ave another pietermorrer like i can do a pie fer me lunch real nice come back ere at igh tide thank you i shall be here scuff nodded his satisfaction and a moment later he was gone monk returned to his round of pawnshops and saw at least three he was certain were receivers of one sort or another but only of petty goods he was followed for almost a mile by two youths he believed would have robbed him if they could have caught him alone in one of the narrow alleys but he took care to see that they did not he in turn took care to keep well away from the occasional police patrol that he saw it riled him to do it but he had no choice by four oclock he was back on the dockside again and found scuff waiting for him wordlessly the boy led the way along the wide street parallel with the river up a flight of stone steps and along an alley so tight monk instinctively tucked his elbows in the smells of old cooking effluent and soot almost choked him they were twenty yards in from the river and yet the damp seemed to be absorbed into the stones and breathed out again in a fog as the dusk settled and the few street lamps made yellow islands in the gloom there was no sound but the steady dripping from the eaves finally they came to a doorway with a painted sign above it and scuff knocked monk noticed that his dirty clenched fist was shaking and realized with a stab of amazement that scuff was afraid of what was he betraying monk to be robbed the thought of losing callandras watch was suddenly acutely powerful it made him so angry he would have lashed out at anyone who attempted such a thing the gift was immeasurably precious the token of a friendship that mattered more than any other except hesters it was also an emblem of success elegance the kind of man he wanted to be who could face oliver rathbone as something like an equal he stood stiffly ready to fight or was scuff afraid for himself was he doing something dangerous in order to cement his new friendship or perhaps as a matter of some obscure kind of honor to repay the man who had given him hot pies or even simply to keep his word the door opened and a large woman stood just inside her hands on her hips her red dress was brilliant in the light of the street lamp and there was red paint on her mouth and cheeks int yer a bit young fer this she said eyeing scuff wearily an if yer lookin ter sell yer sister bring er an ill take a gander but i int promisin nothin i int got no sister scuff said immediately but his voice rose into a squeak and his face pinched with anger at himself an if i did ave he added itd be miss lil erself as id wanna see i got a gennelman as is lookin ter buy summink else he gestured to monk half obscured in the shadows behind him the huge woman stared screwing up her face in concentration monk stepped forward he considered smiling at her and decided against it im looking for certain merchandise he said in a low level voice overly polite he allowed an element of threat to show in his unblinking stare she stood still she was about to speak then said nothing waiting for him scuff looked very white but he did not interrupt monk said nothing more come in the woman said at last without any idea of where he was going monk accepted leaving scuff in the street behind him he went through the doorway into a narrow passage and then up a creaking flight of stairs across a landing hung with pictures and into a room redcarpeted and with papered walls and a good fire burning in the grate in one of the soft red armchairs a tiny woman sat with a piece of richly detailed embroidery spread across her lap as if she had been stitching it it was more than threequarters completed and the needle threaded with yellow silk was stuck into it she had a thimble on one finger and the scissors lay beside her on top of a basket of other silks miss lil the huge woman said softly this ones fer you she stood back to allow her employer to see monk and make her own decision little lil was in her forties at least and she had once been very pretty her features were still neat and regular she had large eyes of a hazel color but her jawline was blurred now and the skin on her neck had gone loose hanging from the shrunken flesh underneath her little hands were clawlike with their long fingernails she regarded monk with careful interest come in she ordered him tell me what yer got as i might like gold watches monk replied obeying because he had left himself no choice she held out her hand palm upward in a clutching gesture he hesitated had it been any gold watch it would still have caused him concern but callandras gift was precious in a different and irreplaceable way he took it out of his pocket slowly and held it up just beyond the grasp of her hand her big eyes fixed on him dont trust me then she said with a smile showing sharp unexpectedly white teeth dont trust anyone he replied smiling back at her something in her changed perhaps it was a flash of appreciation sit down she invited feeling uncomfortable he did as he was told she looked at the watch again open it she ordered he did so turning it carefully for her to inspect but keeping a firm hold on it nice she said ow many dozen or thereabouts he answered thereabouts she questioned cant yer count then depends on your offer he prevaricated she chortled with laughter which was highpitched like a little girls do you want them he asked i like you she said frankly we can do business how much she thought about it for several seconds watching his face although it seemed she was doing it now for the pleasure it gave her more than any need for time to think monk wanted to come to the point and then leave i have a client looking for ivory he said a bit abruptly you wouldnt have any advice on that would you ill ask fer yer she said in a whisper unexpectedly gentle come back ere in two days an bring me some o them watches an ill pay yer nicely how much he asked she would expect him to haggle and callandras watch must have cost at least thirty pounds like that twelve pound ten she replied twelve pound ten he said in horror its worth more than twice that twenty at the very least she thought for a moment looking at him through her eyelashes fifteen she offered twenty he could not afford to lose her or to appear to give in too easily this time she considered for longer monk felt a sweat break out on his body in the warm room he had made a mistake he had let his desperation push him into going too far now he had no retreat seventeen she said at last right he agreed his mouth dry he wanted to escape this stifling house and be outside alone in the street to think of a way to extricate himself and still be able to hear any information little lil might give him thank you he inclined his head slightly and saw her acknowledge it with a gleam of satisfaction she liked him he despised himself for playing on it at the same time as he knew he had to in the street he was barely beyond the ring of the lamplight when scuff materialized from the darkness yer got anyfink he asked eagerly monk swore under his breath scuff giggled with satisfaction she like yer does she he said monk realized scuff had expected it and he reached out to clip him over the ear for the acute embarrassment he had suffered but scuff ducked sideways and monks hand missed him not that it would have hurt more than a slight sting he was still laughing they reached the main street running parallel with the docks and crossed into the better light monk turned to scuff again and realized he was not there he saw a shadow in front of him a row of buttons gleaming on a dark jacket a solidity a confidence to him has his wits about him moren yer have mr monk the man observed monk froze the man was river police he knew it with certaintymore than the uniform it was the quiet authority in him the sense of pride in his calling he did not need to threaten not even to raise his voice he was the law and he understood its worth if only monk had that same dignity the fellowship of all the other quiet men who kept order on the river and its immediate shore suddenly the reality of his aloneness was almost beyond bearing you have the advantage of me sir he said stiffly with more than necessary politeness durban the man replied inspector durban o the river police i havent seen you here before a couple o days ago you say youre looking for work but it doesnt seem to me like you want it why would that be mr monk monk ached to tell him the truth but he dared not he was committed to clement louvain and to his own need id rather work with my brain than bending my back he replied putting an edge of truculence in his voice that he did not feel theres not much call for brain work down on the dock durban pointed out least not thats legal theres a lot thats not as im sure you know but i wonder if you really know how dangerous that is you wouldnt believe the number of dead bodies we pick up out of the water an theres no one to say how they got in there i wouldnt like yours to be one of em mr monk just be a little bit careful eh dont go messing with the likes o little lil fosdyke or the fat man or mr weskit theres no room for more opulent receivers than weve already got do you take my meaning im sure there isnt monk agreed hating the lies my interest is in running errands and being of service to people who cant do all their own jobs i dont buy or sell goods really durban said with disbelief his face was almost unreadable in the near darkness but his voice was sad as if he had expected better fewer lies at least monk remembered with a jarring urgency being in exactly the same position seeing a man welldressed wellspoken hoping he was in the rundown alley only by chance and realizing within minutes that he was a thief he remembered his disappointment he drew in his breath to explain himself to durban and then let it out again in a sigh not until after he had earned louvains money yes really he said tartly good night inspector and he walked away down the street towards the lighted thoroughfare to catch an omnibus and then another home four oliver rathbone sat in the hansom as it moved with relative ease through the london traffic from his own home towards that of margaret ballinger he was going to take her as his guest to an evening concert given by a very fine violinist it was in aid of a worthy charity and many people of social importance would attend he was dressed in the height of elegance fashionable enough to occasion admiration and yet not so much as to look as if he cared a real gentleman did not need to make an effort to please it was a gift with which he was born and yet rathbone was not at ease he sat upright rather than relaxing into the padding of the seat he had plenty of time but he could not help looking out of the windows to see where he was watching the yellow glitter of the street lamps reflected on the wet surfaces of the road through the drifts of rain and note the familiar landmarks it had been a hurried invitation offered to her yesterday somewhat impulsively he could not remember exactly what the conversation had been but certainly something to do with the clinic in portpool lane as their conversation so often was were anyone else so singleminded it would almost certainly have been tedious but he still found pleasure in seeing the animation in her face when she spoke of her work there he even found himself involved with the welfare of certain of the patients she described anxious for their recovery upset at the injustices happy for any success such a thing had never happened to him before he governed his professional life with strict emotional discipline he engaged his extraordinary skill in the service of those who needed it by its nature those accused of some crime but he kept his personal feelings well apart but then had anyone a few months ago outlined to him the plan by which hester obtained the use of squeaky robinsons establishment for the clinic he would have been horrified far from joining in or in any way whatever assisting them he would have struggled with his conscience as to whether he should actually report them to the police he blushed even now sitting alone in the dark islanded from the noise and bustle of anonymous traffic outside he felt the heat well up in his face no one else but hester margaret and squeaky robinsonand possibly monkknew what had taken place but there had been a sublime kind of justice in it he did not realize that he was smiling as he recalled squeakys face his horror at being so brilliantly and completely outmaneuvered and it was rathbone not hester who had delivered the ultimatum to him and cornered him so he could not escape rathbone was profoundly embarrassed for having allowed himself to be involved in such dealings he would be mortified if any of his professional colleagues were to know yet he was also obscurely proud of itit had been exquisitely satisfying that was the most remarkable thing the incomprehensible thing how he had changed one would not have recognized him from the man he had been even a few months ago he was at the ballinger house already and the hansom was drawing up he did not feel completely prepared he had no conversation on his tongue for mrs ballinger she was a type of woman he had encountered numerous times before after all he was an eligible bachelor and she had an unmarried daughter her ambition was so naked as to be beyond embarrassment not that there was any society matron in london whose ambition was any different so attempting to conceal it or place it behind a mask of decency was really irrelevant it would simply have spared margaret as rathbone stepped out of the carriage onto the glistening footpath he felt the cold air on his face he went up the steps and pulled the doorbell a moment later the footman opened it and ushered him in and across the hall to the rich dark withdrawing room where mrs ballinger was waiting for him good evening sir oliver she said with more guarded enthusiasm than on their earlier encounters since he had not yet met her expectations regarding her daughter and he had had more than adequate opportunity however the brightness was still there in her eyes the singleminded concentration she was a woman who never forgot her purpose good evening mrs ballinger he replied with a slight smile how are you i am in excellent health thank you she said i am most fortunate in that respect and i thank god for it every day i see friends and acquaintances around me who suffer from this and that she raised her eyebrows so wearing i always think dont you headaches and shortness of breath exhaustion or even palpitations such a difficulty dont you find he was about to say that he had never suffered such afflictions when he realized the double meaning in her words she was not really referring to herself or to concern for the hundreds of women who were so troubled she was telling him in her own way that margaret was from good stock not only healthy by nature but not brought up to indulge herself in fancies and complaints he bit back the reply that came to his tongue yes he agreed one should be most grateful for such excellent health unfortunately it is not enjoyed by all but i am happy for you how generous you always are she said without hesitation i find rudeness so unattractive dont you it speaks of a selfishness of nature i always think please sit down sir oliver she gestured towards the chair nearest the fire with its embroidered armrests and antimacassars over the back to protect the upholstery from gentlemens hair oils margaret will be a few minutes yet you are delightfully punctual she suited her own actions to her words spreading her wide silkandlace skirts around her it would have been impolite for him to decline he sat opposite her and prepared to indulge in chatter until margaret should appear he was very used to guarding himself he hardly ever spoke without thought after all his profession at which he was one of the most gifted men of his generation was to plead the cause of those accused of crime and against whom there was sufficient evidence for them to stand trial no society matron was going to discomfit him let alone outwit him margaret tells me it is a most charming event to which you have invited her this evening mrs ballinger observed music is so civilized and yet speaks to the romantic in us at the same moment he found himself irritated and defensive already it is a function at which they hope to raise a considerable amount of funds for charitable work he replied she smiled showing excellent teeth how i admire your giving of your time to such a cause i know it is one of the qualities margaret finds most worthy in a man many people who are successful in life forget those who are less fortunate i am so pleased to see that you are not such a one she had placed him in an impossible position what on earth could he say to that any answer would sound ridiculous she nodded margaret has such a noble heart but i am sure you are already aware of that good works have brought you together so many times she made it sound as if he had somehow contrived to see margaret at every opportunity he had not indeed he still saw quite a variety of other ladiesat least two of whom might be considered eligible for marriage even if they were widows she was waiting for him to reply his silence was beginning to look like disagreement a noble heartindeed she has he said with more fervor than he had intended and what is more unusual she has the courage and the selflessness to pursue it and create of it deeds that are farreaching a shadow flashed across mrs ballingers face i am so pleased you mentioned it sir oliver she leaned forward towards him of course i am happy that margaret devotes her time to worthy causes rather than frittering her hours away with mere entertainment as so many young women do but this latest cause of hers does alarm me more than a little i am sure it is very noble to be concerned for the morally unfortunate but i think she could place her care to better advantage in something a little more salubrious perhaps with your influence you could suggest to her other avenues that you may be aware of i expect you know many ladies who rathbone found himself suddenly furious he knew exactly what she was doing at one stroke she was manipulating him into spending more time with margaret not because he wished to but as a moral obligation to her mother and also reminding him of social pressures and duty in general it was unbelievably condescending to margaret he could feel the blood rising in his face and his body so stiff his hands were locked where they lay on his knee i came to see margaret because i enjoy her company mrs ballinger he said with as much control as he was able to muster he saw her eyes gleam with satisfaction and alarm rose up inside him as he realized what he had committed himself to but he did not know how to stop i would not presume to influence her in her choice of causes she feels intensely about the clinic and i believe she would regard any interference from me as impertinent and i should lose her friendship he did not know if that was true but even the possibility struck him with extreme unpleasantness it surprised him how very sharp it was oh she would not be so foolish mrs ballinger dismissed the idea with a light laugh her regard for you is far too deep for her not to listen to you sir oliver her voice was warm full of assurance as if she too held him as dearly he wished that that were true or did he hester would have been furious with him if he had tried to dictate matters of conscience to her she would not have allowed even monk to do that in fact he could very clearly remember occasions when monk had been unwise enough to try i have too much respect for margaret to attempt to influence her against her beliefs mrs ballinger he replied mrs ballinger looked both alarmed and excited as if she had gone fishing and caught a whale she had no idea how to land nor on the other hand how to let go she started to say something then changed her mind and sat on the edge of her seat her lips a little parted added to which rathbone went on unable to endure the silence her clinic is run by one of my dearest friends and i would not dream of attempting to rob her of her most loyal supporter it has been the calling of great women down the centuries to care for those less fortunate and to do it with compassion and without judgment no doctor has demanded first whether his patient is worthy of healing only whether he needs it the same is true of those who nurse my goodness she said in amazement i had no idea you were so deeply involved sir oliver it must be a far more noble endeavor than i had appreciated you work very closely with it then margaret did not make me aware of that she was quite breathless at the thought rathbone silently swore to himself why on earth was he being so clumsy in court he could see a pitfall yards off and evade it with such elegance it exasperated his adversaries and he had outwitted matchmaking women like margarets mother for twenty years or more admittedly not always with quite such grace although his skill had increased with time i dont work with it at all he denied firmly but i have occasionally been of assistance with advice because of my long friendship with mrs monk as soon as the words were out he was ashamed of them it was cowardly he had been the prime mover in obtaining the premises for them even if it was hester who had put the words into his mouth and it had been for margarets sake that he had abandoned all his lifes careful rules to do it and if he were truly scrupulously honest he would also admit that for a few wild moments he had thoroughly enjoyed it he had often heard it said that a really good barrister must have something of the actor in him perhaps that was truer than he had appreciated it is through her that i am aware of the work he added defensively and of course margaret has also told me from time to time i have the deepest admiration for them that was true and he met her eyes as he said it his mind was filled with memories of hester she would risk herself to struggle against injustice with a passion he had seen in no one else he had loved her and yet hesitated to propose marriage could he really face such a willful companion in his life a woman with unreasoning unturnable conviction such fierce hunger of the soul mrs ballinger was staring at him confused by his words and yet also satisfied she felt the emotion in him even if she did not understand it and she interpreted it as she wished there was a slight sound behind him as the door opened and margaret came in he rose to his feet and turned to face her she was dressed in a deep plum pink a color in which he had never seen her before it flattered her wonderfully giving her skin a glow and making her eyes look bluer he had never thought of her as lovely until now but quite suddenly he realized that she was it gave him extraordinary pleasure to see her more than he had imagined it could there was a gentleness in her a dignity in the way she stood waiting for him confident and yet not eager she would not allow her mothers ambition either to embarrass him or to move her to defend herself and retreat there was a pool of calmness inside her which made her nothing like hester and it was that serenity which he loved it was unique to her good evening miss ballinger he said with a smile it would seem redundant to ask if you are well she smiled back at him good evening sir oliver yes i am indeed well and ready to face the arbiters of both musical and charitable taste so am i he agreed he inclined his head to mrs ballinger and she rose to escort them out proprietorially beaming with an imminent sense of victory im sorry margaret murmured as they crossed the hall the footman assisted her with her cloak then opened the front door for them rathbone knew precisely what she meant it is merely habit he assured her equally softly i no longer notice she seemed about to respond perhaps even to say that she knew he was lying to comfort her but the footman had gone with them to the waiting hansom and was well within hearing once they were seated and moving it seemed ridiculous to pursue what had been only a politeness after all he was aware of her sitting next to him she wore very little perfume he detected only what might have been the faintest breath of roses or merely the warmth of her skin it was one of the many things about her that pleased him how is hester he enquired working very hard she replied and concerned for the financial management of the clinic although we have just admitted a woman who seems to be suffering from pneumonia and the man who brought her gave us an extremely generous donation as well as paying for her keep her voice was polite concerned and he could not see her face clearly in the flickering light of street lamps and other carriages as they passed it was tactless of him to have asked after hester so quickly almost as if she were the one in his thoughts and not margaret two weeks he said aloud thats not very long he was anxious for her and he was startled to realize that he was worried for the clinic as well i did not know it was so so narrow a margin people are more willing to give to other causes she explained i have tried most of those i know of but hester has a list from lady callandra and we are going to try that we he said quickly it would be far better if it were you alone hester is i know she smiled with both amusement and affection the smile lit her face till the gentleness in her seemed to be something so powerful he could almost have reached out and felt its warmth i was using the plural rather loosely she went on she has given me the names and i shall approach them as i have the opportunity why does lady callandra not do so herself you didnt know she seemed surprised she is leaving england to live in vienna she is to marry dr beck i expect hester will tell you as soon as she has the chance she is delighted for her of course but it does mean that we do not have lady callandra to turn to anymore she was superb at raising funds we shall just have to do it ourselves from now on she looked away from him forward and a little sideways as if she had some interest in the passing traffic was she selfconscious because she had spoken of marriage had she been thinking of it was it really what occupied the minds of all young women if he asked her to marry him she would undoubtedly accept he could not be unaware of her regard for him and he was supremely eligible of course that did not mean that she loved him only that time was on her heels and society expected it of her i am sure you will succeed he said i must write immediately and congratulate callandra i hope i am not too late i daresay her household will know where to forward a letter to reach her i imagine so she replied keeping her face towards the window ten minutes later they alighted and were welcomed to the soiree the large withdrawing room was already crowded with people men in the traditional black and white older women in rich colors like so many autumnal flowers the younger ones in whites and creams and palest pinks jewels glittered in the gleam of chandeliers everywhere there was the hum of conversation the occasional clink of glasses and the trill of slightly forced laughter rathbone was aware of margarets sudden tension as if she faced some kind of ordeal he wished he could have made it easier for her it hurt him that she should have to protect herself from speculation rather than receive the kind of respect he knew she deserved she had courage and kindness far deeper than any of the achievements that passed for value there and yet to say so would have been absurd it would have been so very obviously a defense where no attack had been made lady craven came forward to welcome them delightful to see you sir oliver she said charmingly i am so pleased you honored us with your company we dont see you nearly often enough and missmiss ballinger isnt it you are most welcome i hope you will enjoy the music mr harding is highly talented so i have heard rathbone replied i expect the evening to be a complete success no doubt a great deal of money will be raised for good causes lady craven was a little taken aback at his bluntness but she was equal to any social occasion we hope so we have been careful in our preparations every detail has been attended to with the greatest thought charity is surely next to godliness is it not i believe it is rathbone agreed warmly and there are a great many sorely in need of your generosity oh i daresay but it is africa we have in mind so noble dont you think brings out the very best in people and with that she sailed away head high a smile on her lips africa margaret said between her teeth i wish them well with their hospitals but they dont have to have everything they took seats in the very front row are you sure rathbone said thinking of less obvious seats farther back perfectly she replied sitting down gracefully and with one simple movement rearranging her skirts if i am here right in the middle it will be impossible for me to speak to anyone without being appallingly rude to the artist i shall have to listen to him with uninterrupted concentration which is exactly what i should like to do even if anyone should speak to me i shall be completely unable to reply i shall look embarrassed and regretful and say nothing at all perhaps he should have hidden his smilepeople were looking at himbut he did not bravo he agreed i shall sit beside you and i promise not to speak it was a promise he was happy to keep because the music was indeed superb the man was young wildhaired and generally eccentric in appearance but he played his instrument as if it were a living part of himself and held the voice of his dreams an hour later when silence engulfed them the moment before the eruption of applause rathbone turned to look at margaret and saw the tears on her cheek he lifted his hand to touch hers then changed his mind he wanted to keep the moment in memory rather than break it he would not forget the wonder in her eyes the amazement or the emotion she was not ashamed to show he realized that he had never heard her apologize for honesty or pretend to be unaffected by pity or anger she felt no desire to conceal her beliefs or affect to be invulnerable there was a purity in her that drew him like light in a darkening sky he would have defended her at any cost because he would not even have thought of himself only of preserving what must never be lost the applause roared around them and he joined in there were murmurs of approval gaining in volume the artist bowed thanked them and withdrew for him to play was the purpose and the completion he did not need the praise and he certainly did not wish to become involved in chatter however wellmeaning lady craven took the artists place and made her plea for generous donations to the cause of medicine and christianity in africa and in turn was greeted with polite applause rathbone felt margaret stir beside him and was sure he knew what she was thinking people began to move of course no one would do anything so vulgarly overt as put their hands in their pockets and pull out money but promises were being made bankers would be notified and footmen would be sent on urgent errands tomorrow morning money would change hands letters of credit would make their way to accounts in london or africa or both margaret was very quiet she barely joined in the conversation that continued around them such a worthy cause mrs thwaite said happily patting the diamonds around her throat she was a plump pretty woman who must have been charming in her youth we are so fortunate i always think we should give generously dont you her husband agreed although he did not appear to be listening to what she said he looked so bored his eyes were glazed quite a large lady in green said sententiously it is no more than ones duty i always feel that in the future our grandchildren will consider our greatest achievement was to bring christianity and cleanliness to the dark continent another gentleman said with conviction if we could do that it would be rathbone agreed as long as we do not do it at the cost of losing it ourselves he should have bitten his tongue it was exactly the sort of thing hester would have said there was a moments appalled silence i beg your pardon the woman in green raised her eyebrows so high her forehead all but disappeared perhaps you would care for another drink mr the bored husband suddenly came to life then again perhaps not he added judiciously rathbone rathbone supplied sir oliver i am delighted to meet you but i cannot have another drink until i have had a first one i think champagne would be excellent and one for miss ballinger also if you would be so kind as to attract the footmans attention thank you i mention losing that sublime charity because we also have a great many good causes at home which need our support regrettably disease is not confined to africa disease the bored husband directed the footman to rathbone who took a glass of champagne for margaret then one for himself what kind of disease he pursued pneumonia margaret supplied taking the opening rathbone had given her and of course tuberculosis rickets occasionally cholera or typhoid and a dreadful amount of bronchitis rathbone let out his breath he did not realize he had been holding it in fear she would mention syphilis the bored husband looked startled but we have hospitals here my dear miss ballinger margaret said with a smile rathbone knew was forced unfortunately there are not enough of them and too many of the poor have not the financial means to afford them the pretty wife looked disturbed i thought there were charitable places provided is that not so walter of course it is my dear but her tender heart does miss credit im sure walter said hastily margaret was not going to be silenced i work for a clinic in portpool lane specifically for poor women in the area and we are continually seeking funds even the smallest donation would be sufficient for food or a little coal medicines can cost more but vinegar and lye are cheaper walter seized on the one thing he had not understood and felt he could take issue with surely vinegar is unnecessary miss ballinger can you not feed them simpler food if they are ill what of gruel or something of that nature we do not eat vinegar margaret replied forcing herself to speak softly it is to keep things clean we do use a lot of gruel and porridge when people are a little stronger or for those who are injured rather than ill walter was plainly disconcerted injured yes women are quite often involved in accidents or they are victims of attack we do for them what we can his expression filled with distaste really how very unpleasant i imagine it must be difficult for you i prefer to make my donations to those who are spreading the light of christianity to those poor souls who have not already had the opportunityand spurned it one must not waste precious resources he inclined his head as if he were about to leave margaret stiffened rathbone put his hand on her arm tightening his fingers a little warning her not to respond i know she said under her breath then as soon as walter had retreated to another group where he would not be disturbed by unpleasant thoughts she added i would love to tell him what i believe but it would ruin all future chances of help dont worry i shall bite my tongue but there was no smile on her face and she did not turn to look at him her next attempt fared little better they were engaged in polite but trivial conversation with mr and mrs taverner lady hordern and the honorable john wills such a wonderful man lady hordern said enthusiastically referring to one of the doctors in africa prepared to give his life to saving people he does not even know body and soul truly christian most doctors save people they do not know rathbone pointed out lady hordern looked a little bewildered all that is necessary is to know that many people are ill and in trouble margaret said with a smile quite wills agreed as if she had made his point for him rathbone hid a smile i think what miss ballinger means is that we should also give generously to other causes as well lady hordern blinked whose cause i was thinking of those who work in such places as the clinic run by my friend mrs monk who treats our own londoners margaret responded but we have hospitals mr taverner pointed out and we are christian already it is very different you know margaret bit her lip there is something of a difference between having heard of christ and being a christian yes i suppose so he was patently unconvinced she scented an opportunity surely one soul is as valuable as another and to save those in our own community will have excellent effects all around us save his wife asked suspiciously from what miss ballinger rathbone felt margarets arm tense and heard her indrawn breath was she going to make a tactical error from behavior unworthy of a christian margaret replied sweetly rathbone let out his breath in a sigh of relief lady horderns pale eyebrows rose very high are you referring to that place which caters to women of the street she asked incredulously i can hardly imagine that you are asking for money to support prostitutes mr taverner turned a dull shade of red but whether his emotion was fury or embarrassment it was impossible to say i believe that for the most part they support themselves lady hordern rathbone interposed hearing hesters voice in his head exactly as if she had prompted him which is the heart of the trouble i imagine the clinic you are referring to is to help street women who are injured or ill and therefore cannot obtain their usual employment which is devoutly to be wished mrs taverner snapped is it rathbone asked innocently i do not admire it as a trade nor the fact that so many men patronize it or it could not exist but neither do i think that attempting to do away with it would be a practical solution and as long as there are such people it becomes us to treat their illnesses as effectively as we may i find your opinions extraordinary sir oliver mrs taverner responded icily most particularly that you should choose to express them in front of miss ballinger who after all is unmarried and i assume you regard her as a lady to his amazement rathbone was not furious he was suddenly and intensely proud miss ballinger works in the clinic he said clearly she is perhaps more aware of the nature of these womens lives than any of us mrs taverner looked profoundly shocked and insulted the difference rathbone concluded startled at the passion in his voice the difference is that she chooses to do something to help and we have yet to avail ourselves of that opportunity he felt margarets hand close tightly on his arm and was ridiculously elated i choose to give such gifts as i do to a worthier cause lady hordern said stiffly are the africans worthier rathbone enquired they are more innocent she snapped back i presume you would not argue that since i am unacquainted with them i cannot he responded wills tore his handkerchief out of his pocket and buried his face in it his shoulders shaking he was obviously laughing uncontrollably lady hordern looked very steadily at margaret i can only assume miss ballinger that your poor mother is unaware of your present interests both personalshe glanced at rathbone and back again to margaretand occupational i think in the service of your future it would be the act of a friend to inform her i should not like to see you suffer more than is already unavoidable i shall call upon her tomorrow morning and with that she swept off the stiff taffeta of her skirts rattling mr taverner was still scarlet in the face mrs taverner wished them good evening and turned away leaving her husband to follow you are worse than hester margaret said between her teeth but now it was not laughter she was stifling it was fear if her mother forbade her it would be very difficult to continue seeing rathbone and perhaps impossible to work in the clinic she had no independent means not even a home apart from that of her parents he looked at her and saw the sudden change in her im sorry he said gently i have indulged my anger at your expense and made it impossible for you havent i it was an acknowledgment of fact not a question it was impossible before that she admitted refusing ever to think of the meaning far deeper than the loss of tonights contribution i have a strong feeling that mr taverner may already make his contribution to their keep and mrs taverner is quite aware of it i daresay it is her acceptance of it that she resents the most he agreed then he hesitated margaret will your mother listen to lady hordern and believe her do i need to make myself a great deal more respectable in her eyes in order to be permitted to see you again should ihe swallowedapologize dont you dare she lifted her chin a little higher i shall speak to mama myself it was exactly the sort of thing hester would have saidbrave angry and unwise but so intensely from the heart did margaret feel that in some way she was standing in for hester in his regard that she was here as a substitute and not as herself it was untrue he knew it with overwhelming conviction he loved the courage and the honesty in margaret that were like hesters but there were also other qualities of gentleness and honor modesty and inner sweetness that had nothing to do with anyone else at all one did not love people because they reminded one of somebody else she looked away again her eyes bright i am afraid we have not been very successful at inspiring donations have we i have been a liability so far he confessed i shall endeavor to do better he offered her his arm and she took it together they walked towards a large group of people ready to try again five hester arrived at portpool lane by half past eight on the third morning after monk accepted the job for clement louvain the first thing she did was sit down with bessie in the kitchen and have a hot cup of tea and a slice of toast while she listened to the report of what had happened during the night in its time as a brothel very little cooking had been done there most of the prostitutes who inhabited the place had eaten what meals they had somewhere in the street before their working hours began there had seldom been more than three or four people to cater for at any one time just squeaky robertson himself and a few women kept on and off for cleaning and laundry and a couple of men to deal with any customer who got rough and needed throwing out or who was a trifle slow in settling his bill it had never been necessary to enlarge what was essentially a family kitchen the laundry was another matter that was enormous and excellent with two boiling coppers for the vast numbers of sheets used and a separate room for drying them bessie looked profoundly tired her hair was scraped back so tightly it looked painful but large strands were looped over her ears carelessly as if she had pushed them back in irritation simply to get them out of her way her skin was pale and every now and then she could not stifle a yawn been up all night hester said more as a statement than a question bessie took a third mouthful of her tea with a sigh of satisfaction them two from a couple o nights ago are gettin better she replied one poor little cow only needed a spot o food an a couple o nights proper kip put er out again termorrer knife wounds ealin up nice good hester nodded however she expected the woman louvain had brought in to be worsein fact she was afraid she might be one of those they could not help beyond giving her as much comfort as possible in her last hours at least she would not have to die alone but we got up of a dozen in an theres a bleedin lot o washin ter do bessie answered i bin up all night wi that clark woman int much yer can do fer er ceptin cool towels like yer said but it seems ter elp she still looks like the undertaker should ave er but er fever int so bad so i spose shes on the mend temper in er mind ruths too good a name for er id a called er mona if itd bin up ter me hester smiled i expect she was christened long before she could speak bessie grunted pity we cant take er back ter then rechristen her nahjust keep er mouth shut finish your breakfast and get some sleep hester advised ill do the laundry yer cant do that all on yer own i wont need to margaret will be in later ill just get it started yeah an oos gonna fetch the water fer yer bessie asked hester smiled more widely squeaky itll do him good a bit of fresh air and exercise bessie laughed outright then tell im if e squawks ill come an beat im over the ead wi a saucepan when hester spoke to squeaky ten minutes later he was horrified me he said incredulously im a bookkeeper i dont fetch water yes you do she answered handing him two pails but itll take ten loads o that to fill the bleedin copper he said furiously at least she agreed and another ten for the other one so youd better get started we need them washed today and dry by tomorrow or the day after i int a bleedin water carrier he stood rooted to the spot indignation filling his face right then ill fetch the water she said and you change the beds remember to pull the bottom sheets straight and tight and tuck in only the ends of the top ones youll have to work around the sick women but i expect you know how to do that then you can mix the lye and potash and all right he said angrily ill get the water i int dealin wi sick women in bed bit modest arent you for a brothelkeeper she asked mockingly he gave her a filthy look picked up the two pails and stormed out smiling to herself hester went back upstairs with a pile of clean sheets and pillow slips to begin changing the beds fevers made people sweat and it was inevitable that linen soiled quickly she began with the girl who had come in exhausted and who was already so much better she could be sent back out again today or tomorrow ill elp yer she offered straightaway rolling over and getting to her feet she steadied herself with one hand on the bed frame then wrapped a shawl around her shoulders hester accepted all such duties were a great deal easier with two they changed the linen on that bed then went to the next room in which rested the woman with more severe congestion she was feverish and in considerable discomfort they took off the damp and crumpled sheets easing her from one position to another and replacing the old with new it was an awkward task and at the end of it when the woman sank back dizzy and gasping for breath hester and the girl were also glad of a moments respite hester helped the sick woman to take a few sips from the beaker of water on the table the water had once been hot and was now tepid then they left her and went to the next room and so on until they were all finished can i help yer wash em the girl offered pointing to the sheets hester looked at her pale face and the slight beading of sweat on her brow no thank you go back to bed for a while it doesnt take two to do this that was not strictly trueit would have been much easier with someone else to assist herbut she stuffed the soiled linen into two pillow slips and put them over her shoulder then carried them downstairs once in the laundry room she checked the coppers and found the first one more than half full squeaky must have been working swiftly in spite of his complaints she put all the linen into the copper stirring the sheets around with a long wooden dolly until they were thoroughly soaked she brought another scuttle of coke across and added it to the boiler then carried the empty scuttle back next she took the last of the soap to add to the water in the copper and set about one of the jobs she disliked most the making of more soap it was not a difficult task so much as a heavy and tedious one they bought the potash from a dealer a few hundred yards along the street in farringdon road it was made from burned potato stalks not necessarily the best but the cheapest because it produced a dozen times as much potash as the same weight of any wood one pound of caustic potash combined with five pounds of clear grease would make five gallons of soft soap for their purpose the smell of it was unimportant and funds did not run to adding perfume while she was working squeaky came in with two more loads of water scowling so hard she was surprised he could see where he was going i ate that stuff he said wrinkling his nose when we was a proper brothel we bought soap if youve got money to spare i should be delighted she replied money whered i get money he demanded nobody around ere makes bleedin money yer all just spends it and before she could make any reply he tipped the pails of water into the second copper and marched out again they admitted two more women in the middle of the day and in the early afternoon margaret came in and willingly helped scrub the kitchen floor with hot water and vinegar later she took another two pounds and went to pay the coal merchants bill and brought back a pound of tea and a jar of honey another woman came in with two broken fingers on her right hand which took all hesters skill to set and bind the woman was exhausted with the pain of it and it was some little time before she was composed enough to leave at quarter to six margaret went home hester intended to take a few minutes sleep herself then see ruth clark again before heading home but she woke with a start to find it completely dark outside and bessie standing over her with a candle in one hand her face creased in concern hester pushed her hair out of her eyes and sat up what is it she said anxiously another admission no bessie shook her head its that clark woman wot a miserable piece o work she is an no mistake but shes real poorly i think as yerd better come an take a look at er wordlessly hester obeyed without bothering to pin up her hair she put her boots back on and followed bessie to ruth clarks room the woman lay half on her back her face flushed her hair tangled the sheet was crumpled where her hands had clenched on it her eyes were half open but she seemed only barely conscious of there being anyone else in the room hester went over to her and touched her brow it was burning ruth she said softly the woman made no answer except to move her hands fretfully as if the touch bothered her get me a fresh bowl of cold water hester directed the womans condition was serious if her fever didnt decrease at least a degree or two she might well become delirious and die bessie went immediately and hester picked up the candle on the bedside table and looked more closely at ruth clark she was breathing erratically and her chest seemed to rattle as if it were full of congestion pneumonia the crisis might well come tonight hester could not leave to go home if she did everything she knew she might save her she looked a robust woman definitely someones mistress rather than one of the women who walked the streets selling their bodies to anyone with the money to pay often the latter spent their nights cold and hungry and in the bad weather with wet feet and possibly wet clothes altogether she put the candle back bessie returned with the water and cloths and set them down on the floor hester thanked her and told her to go and see what she could do for the other patients then take a chance to sleep herself not while yer tendin to er all on yer own bessie said indignantly this isnt a job for two hester answered but she smiled at bessies loyalty if you rest now you can take a turn in the morning ill call you if i need you i promise bessie stood her ground ill never ear yer take the room opposite then you will yerll call bessie insisted yes i will now get out of my way bessie obeyed and hester put the cloth in the cold water wrung it out and placed it on the sick womans forehead at first it seemed to irritate her and she tried to turn away hester moved the cloth and gently put it over her throat she wrung it out again and tried her forehead a second time ruth groaned and her eyelids flickered again and again hester dipped the cloth in the water wrung it out and bathed the woman with it at first only her face and neck then as that seemed to have little effect she stripped back the sheet and blankets and laid the cloth over the top of her chest as well the time crept by she looked at her watch and it was ten in the evening then some time around midnight she became aware that ruth had not moved for a while perhaps ten or fifteen minutes hester leaned forward she could not see the rise and fall of ruths breathing she was far too familiar with death for it to frighten her but it never left her without a sadness she put out her hand and touched the womans neck just to make sure there was no pulse ruths eyes opened what is it she whispered crossly it was the first time hester had heard her speak and her voice was startling it was low soft and pleasing the voice of a woman of some education and culture hester was so startled she flinched i im sorry she apologized as if rather than ministering to a sick patient she had crept into someone elses bedroom i wanted to see if you were still feverish do you feel better would you like something to drink i feel awful ruth answered still speaking as if her throat were parched would you like some water hester repeated the offer ill help you sit up ruth frowned at her who are you she looked around the room as much as she could see without moving her head what is this place it looks like a brothel hester smiled thats because it isor was now its a clinic dont you remember coming here ruth closed her eyes if i remembered coming i wouldnt ask hester was taken aback she realized with a shock how used she had become to gratitude from the sick and injured who regularly found shelter there she had come to take it for granted and this woman looked at her with no admiration at all no sense of respect towards a rescuer do you remember mr louvain who brought you here the change in ruths face was subtle so slight it could have been no more than the struggle to focus her mind or the fear that she was losing control of what was happening to her he brought me here ruth said quietly yes hester should have asked again if she wanted water but curiosity stayed her for another moment waiting an odd smile touched ruths face ironic as if there was a terrible humor to her situation that even in her state of wretchedness she could still appreciate what did he say her eyes meeting hesters were hard and angry she would accept help but she would not be grateful for it that you were the mistress of a friend of his who had put you out because you were ill hester replied the answer was cruel but surely a woman who had followed such a path chosen or not must be used to facing truths ruth closed her eyes as a wave of pain washed over her but the smile did not fade away entirely mistress is that what he said she whispered derisively yes did he pay you is that why you sit here nursing me he did pay us yes or more accurately he gave me a donation sufficient to cover the cost of caring for you and for several other women as well but we would have taken you anyway we have plenty here who have nothing to give ruth was silent she was finding it difficult to breathe again and her face was flushed hester stood up and fetched half a glass of water from the stand and brought it back you should take this ill help you to sit up leave me alone ruth said irritably youve been paid to look after me consider yourself acquitted hester controlled her tongue youll feel better if you take some liquid you have a high fever you need to drink a fever i feel worse than i ever thought a human being could then stop being so perverse and let me help you take a little water hester insisted go go to ruth was gasping for breath again and her face was scarlet hester put the cup down leaned forward and put her arms around ruths shoulders heaving her up and sliding another pillow behind her with great difficulty she put the cup to ruths lips the first mouthful was lost sliding down her neck onto her chest of the second she swallowed at least half after that she yielded and took almost all of the rest and finally lay back exhausted hester took away the pillow and helped ruth lie back then began again with the cloth and the cool water a little after two she left ruth for a while and went around to the other patients just to make certain that everyone else was as well as was possible then she went down to the kitchen and boiled the kettle she made herself a cup of tea and had drunk most of it when there was a banging at the front door she roused herself to go and answer there were two women on the step flo whom hester had seen many times before and leaning against her whitefaced and holding her arm in front of her cradling it with the other was a younger woman with auburn hair and frightened eyes the sleeve of her dress was scarlet and blood was dripping onto the step come in hester said instantly stepping back to make room for them to pass her then she closed the door and bolted it as she always did after dark she put her arm around the injured woman and turned to flo bessies asleep in the room to the left at the top of the stairs she directed please go and waken her and ask her to put more water on to boil and get out the brandy she dont need no more brandy flo interrupted her glancing at the injured woman impatiently its not to drink hester replied its to clean the needle if she needs stitching up just get bessie please flo shrugged pursing her lips she was somewhere in her midthirties darkhaired and with a mass of freckles she had a long rather lugubrious face and no one could have called her pretty but she was intelligent and had a quick tongue and when she could be bothered she had a certain charm she had sent or brought a number of women to the clinic and once or twice she had even brought one with money hester was grateful to her for that ill put the water on flo said gruffly yer think i don know were ter find it or i cant lift a pan hester thanked her and helped the other woman to sit down in the chair in the main room still nursing her arm her face pasty white at the sight of so much of her own blood hester lit more candles and began to work it took her over an hour to stop the bleeding clean and stitch the wound and bandage it then she assisted the woman whose name was maisie into a clean nightgown and to a bed yer look orrible yerself flo observed when the two of them were alone in the kitchen ill make yer a cup o tea yer fit ter drop an if yer do ooll look arter the rest of us then eh hester was about to refuse instinctively then she realized the stupidity of it she was so tired the room seemed to waver around her as if she were seeing it through water she did not want to disturb bessie who had more than earned her sleep then yer should catch a bit o kip yerself flo added ill wake yer if anythin appens ive got a very ill woman upstairs i must see how she is we have to keep the fever down if we can flo put her hands on her hips an ow yer goin ter do that then eh work a bleedin miracle are yer cold water and cloths hester said wearily ill look in on her then maybe ill take an hour or so thank you flo but that was not how it transpired hester drank her tea looked in on ruth clark and saw her sleeping then went to a room two doors along and sank gratefully onto the bed pulling the blankets over herself she allowed oblivion to claim her she woke reluctantlyshe had no idea how much laterto hear womens voices raised in fury one was louder than the other and unmistakably flos the other was quieter deeper and it was a moment before hester could place it then it came to her with amazement as she sat up there was no light except the small amount that came from the candle in the passage the other voice was ruth clarks and the language was equally robust and abusive from both of them words like whore and cow were repeated often hester stood up still dizzy with tiredness and stumbled toward the passage she blinked as she reached the brighter lights the noise was worse how could bessie sleep through this the commotion was coming from ruths roomof course it was she was far too ill to be out of her bed hester strode along and pushed the door wide helpful or not she would tear flo to pieces for this the scene that met her eyes was extraordinary ruth was propped up on several pillows an empty cup in her hands her hair was wild her face pale but for the hectic flush in her cheeks and her expression was one of unmitigated rage a few feet away from her stood flo her lips drawn back in a snarl her hair was half down as if someone had torn at it and the front of her dress was soaked in water stop it hester said in the tone of voice she had heard used during her time on the crimean battlefields both women stared at her it was ruth who drew breath to speak first youre paid to look after me she said raspingly get this whore out of here who are you callin an ore yer nothin but a fancy slut yerself fer all yer airs flo retorted thats cos yer lies wi sailorsdoes that make yer summink diffrent well

right back at yer yer manky bitch im sure you have plenty of slops to spare ruth said icily you smell as if you bathe in them silence hester raised her voice sharply but it was to no effect flo lost her temper and hurled herself forward onto the bed landing on ruth then raising her hand to hit her hester grabbed at it catching it almost across her own face and was dragged forward and off balance half onto the floor both flo and ruth were still cursing each other but ruth had no strength to lash back physically it was at that moment that bessie burst in saw the scene and charged across to pick flo up bodily swing around with her and drop her on the floor wot the bleedin ell dyer think yer doin yer crazy lard arse she yelled first at flo then turning on ruth she went on an as fer you yer spotty slag you mind yer tongue or ill put yer out inter the gutter money or no money int surprisin yer lover threw yer out yer iggerant mare yer got a mouth on yer like a midden one more order out o yer an ill throw yer out meself just shut yer face year me there was total silence slowly hester climbed to her feet thank you bessie she said gravely she stared at the woman in the bed ruth was flushed and weak but her eyes were spitting venom miss clark go back to sleep bessie will come to see you in a while flo you come with me and seizing flo by the arm she strode out half dragging her along down the stairs and into the kitchen before she spoke again kettle she commanded make some tea int surprised e threw er out the turd flo retorted but she did as she was told dint give yer much of a kip did she ungrateful trollop she took the kettle from the stove thinks cos one man keeps er not twenty that shes suffink special talks like she was a ladyshes a common slut like the rest of us probably hester agreed too tired to care what the fight was about this time it had been thirtyfive minutes since she lay down on the bed upstairs she felt as if she could have slept on the kitchen tableor the floor for that matter an yer got rats flo called pouring water out of the pail into the kettle yerll ave ter get the rat catcher in dyer know one of course i do hester said wearily ill send a message to sutton in the morning ill take it flo offered yer dont want no more tea or yerll be up an down all night like a dancers knees what night hester responded bitterly bessie came into the room her hair restored to its tight knot at the back of her head and her face scrubbed and ready for business ill go an see er in a couple of hours she announced looking at hester me an floll take care o the rest o the night she glared at flo int that right yeah flo agreed grinning at hester and showing several gaps in her teeth i wont kill er onest swear on me mothers grave yer ma int dead bessie growled flo shrugged and put the kettle onto the stove then bent to open the range and poke the coals to make them burn yer need more coke she said with a sniff spose thats why yer as ter take that kind o pig hester went back upstairs with profound gratitude and sank into a dreamless sleep until nearly seven oclock when the days duties began mercifully when she looked in on ruth she seemed to be quietly asleep hot but not delirious and breathing fairly well downstairs in the kitchen bessie was making gruel for those who were well enough to eat and flo was asleep in one of the chairs her head fallen forward onto the table when margaret arrived shortly after ten oclock she took one look at hesters face and then bessies whats happened she asked her eyes wide with alarm we need more elp bessie replied before hester could say anything and the rat catcher hester added flo was already fetching more water from the well along the street margaret made a slight flinch of distaste but she was not surprised rats were a condition of life in places like portpool lane hows ruth clark she asked hester shell live mores the pity bessie replied she jerked her head towards hester bin up most o the night wot wi mlady clark er an the poor bint wot come in wi a knife cut in er arm which minds me i int never took er no breakfast yet and suiting the deed to the word she ladled out a dish of gruel and went out of the room with it leaving hester and margaret alone we do need more help hester admitted but weve got no money to pay anyone so itll have to be voluntary heaven knows its hard enough to get money ive no idea how were going to persuade someone to give up their time to a place like this she glanced around the candlelit kitchen with its stone sink pails of water and wooden bins of flour and oatmeal unfortunately heavens not telling me margaret made tea for both of them and toast from one of the loaves of bread she had brought she even had a jar of marmalade taken surreptitiously from her mothers kitchen she had left a note in the larder in case the cook or one of the other servants got the blame for its disappearance im not sure where ill ask she said when they were both sitting down but i have one or two places at least to start there are women who have no money they can dispose of without their husbands approval but they do have time it is possible to be very comfortably welloff and bored silly hester was in no position to quibble she would be very grateful for any help at all and she said so it was a hard day two more women were admitted with bad bronchitis and a third with a dislocated shoulder which took hester and bessie considerable difficulty to reduce and of course was extremely painful for the woman she let out a fearful scream as hester laid her on the ground put her foot as gently as she could into the womans armpit and then pulled steadily on the hand flo came rushing in demanding to know what had happened and then was furious to discover it was nothing she could do anything about the woman gasping to cry abuse staggered to her feet and only then realized that her shoulder was back to normal just before five there was a knock on the back door and hester opened it to find the costermonger in the yard his barrow behind him hello toddy how are you she asked with a smile not bad missus he replied with a lopsided grin just got me usual yer dont think as its summink serious do yer a flicker of anxiety showed for a moment in his eyes she affected to give his aches their proper consideration ill get you some elder ointment that you can rub in bessie swears by it for her knees thats right nice o yer he said obviously comforted i got alf a dozen pounds o apples it int worth me takin ome more trouble than itd be worth dyer like em ere that would be very nice she accepted going inside to fetch the ointment she returned and gave it to him in a small jar and found him standing there with the apples and a small sack of mixed potatoes carrots and parsnips margaret left to go home at eight oclock and it seemed a long night hester was able to snatch no more than an hour or two of sleep in bits and pieces catnaps when the chance arose flo fetched and carried but her quarrel with ruth clark rumbled on and by daylight everyone was exhausted the best that could be said was that none of the patients gave cause for fear that they were close to death at half past ten margaret arrived bringing with her two women they walked into the clinic behind her then stood in the main room the first staring quite openly around with a look of disdain she was a tall rather thin woman with dark hair and she was considerably broader at the hip than the shoulder her face had been handsome in her youth but the marks of discontent detracted from it now that she appeared to be in her middle forties her clothes were smart and expensive even though she had clearly selected her oldest skirt and woollen jacket in which to come hester knew at a glance that they were well made and of good fabric five years ago they had been the height of fashion the woman behind her was different in almost every respect she was at least two inches less in height her face was soft featured but there was great strength in the broad cheekbones and the chin her hair was honeybrown and had a heavy natural curl her clothes were also of good quality but less fashionable in cut and looked to be no earlier than last winters in style she seemed to be the more nervous of the two there was no discontent in her face but a profound apprehension as though she feared the place as if there were something in it which was dangerous even tragic this is mrs claudine burroughs margaret said introducing the older woman to hester she has very generously offered to help us at least two days a week how do you do mrs burroughs hester responded we are very grateful to you mrs burroughs looked at her with growing disapproval she must have seen the exhaustion in hesters face her hair untidily caught up and her hands red from scrubbing the floor and feeding hot wet sheets through the mangle there was a tear in the shoulder seam of her blouse from reaching to winch up the airing rack to try to get the bed linen dry before they needed to put it back on again the next time the beds needed to be changed it isnt the sort of charity work i usually do mrs burroughs said coolly you will never do anything which will be more valued hester replied with as much warmth as she could manage she could not afford to offend her full of misgivings as she was and this is miss mercy louvain margaret said introducing the younger woman she has offered to be here as long as we need her she will even sleep here if it would be helpful she smiled searching hesters eyes and awaiting her approval louvain hester was incredulous was she related to clement louvain she had to be it was hardly a common name was it possible she knew ruth clark if she did it might be an embarrassing situation especially if ruth really was louvains mistress and not that of some fictional friend she smiled back first at margaret then at mercy louvain thank you that is extraordinarily good of you nighttimes can be hard we would appreciate it very much indeed not once had mercy looked around the room as mrs burroughs did it was almost as if she had no interest in the surroundings hester did not express her gratitude to margaret in words in case the depth of her feeling alarmed the two new volunteers but she allowed it to show in her eyes for a moment when their glances met then hester showed the women the house and introduced them to their first tasks for heavens sake dont you have servants here of any sort mrs burroughs demanded when they were in the laundry she gazed at the stone floor and the pile of linen on it awaiting washing and then at the huge copper with the steam rising off it her nostrils flaring at the vinegar and caustic in the air she looked at the mangle between the two deep wooden tubs as if it were some obscene instrument of torture we dont have money for it hester explained we need all we can get for medicine coal and food people are very unwilling to give to us because of the nature of our patients mrs burroughs snorted but made no direct reply her eyes went further around the room noting the pails the sack of potash the vat of lard and the large glass flagons of vinegar where do you get water she asked i see no taps from the well down the street hester replied good heavens woman you want a cart horse to labor here mrs burroughs exclaimed i want a lot of things hester said ruefully ill accept what i can get and be most grateful for it bessie usually fetches the water you dont need to concern yourself with it bessie is she the big woman i saw on the landing yes she would do most of the laundry usually but we have a lot of sick and injured here right now and she has learned a little nursing so i need her to help with that skilled is it mrs burroughs asked disbelievingly yes some of it is hester replied again finding it difficult to remain civil some of it isnt like cleaning up blood or vomit emptying slopsthat sort of thing mrs burroughs jerked up her chin ill do the laundry she stated hester smiled back at her thank you she accepted sweetly if mercy louvain saw any humor in mrs burroughs reaction there was no reflection of it in her grave face hester showed mrs burroughs where everything was and the exact proportions to be mixed and put into the coppers she demonstrated how to use the wooden dolly to move the linen how long to leave it and at what temperature she would have to return in order to help her move it all to be rinsed and then mangled and folded and the airing rack winched down the linen put on it and winched back up again and lashed tight it was obvious mrs burroughs had never so much as washed a handkerchief she had a great deal to learn if she was to be of use mercy louvain was of a totally different character but it did not take long to see that she also was completely inexperienced in any domestic work she had seldom visited a kitchen but when hester showed her the saucepans oatmeal salt flour and vegetables she seemed to grasp the essentials at least willingly even if she needed to ask a great many questions hester finally left to go back upstairs wondering if it would not be easier to do it all herself than accept such unskilled help however in the middle of the afternoon she was grateful to be able to leave bessie to teach mrs burroughs how to clean up the laundry and flo to give mercy louvain a lesson in peeling potatoes and go upstairs to rest darkness was coming earlier each evening as autumn moved towards winter and by six oclock it was both dark and cold they bolted the doors at eight and hester thought with a shiver of those outside walking the streets hoping for the trade which kept them alive she went upstairs to see how ruth clark was she had been well enough to take a little thin broth and had expressed her disgust with the quality of it hester wondered again how much of her temper was really directed at the man who had apparently loved her or at least desired her and then when she was ill had put her out on the street to depend upon strangers and the pity of those who wished to do good were hester in the same position she might have resented it just as deeply and with as bitter a tongue had ruth loved the man or was he no more than a means to live well if she had cared for him had even hoped there was something real in their relationship which would last then no wonder she was raw with pain hester retired to her room then she heard flo shrieking again and she strode back into ruths room to find flo standing over ruths bed swearing at her ruth had malice bright in her eyes and her fist was clenched on long black hairs hester lost her own temper stop it she shouted exhaustion draining her voice until it was sharp and highpitched stop it this moment this is a hospital not a bawdy house of course its a bawdy house ruth snapped back its a house full of whoresand thieves im no thief flo said furiously her body shaking with emotion i never stole nothin in me life an yer int got no right ter say i did there was a slight noise in the doorway and hester swiveled around to see mercy louvain standing behind her flo started forward to attack ruth just as mercy louvain stepped past hester to stand between the two womenonly it was ruth she was facing flo nearly fell over her instead veering sideways and bumping into hester who gripped hold of her arms hold your tongue mercy said in a hard quiet voice youre sick and in need these women have taken you in to look after you they owe you nothing they have no need to sit up all night caring for you and youd best remember that you can be put back out on the street to be alone and theres no reason except kindness why they shouldnt do exactly that so unless you want to exchange this bed for the street corner youd better mind your tongue ruth stared at her in disbelief it seemed she could hardly comprehend what had happened do you hear me mercy said sharply yes of course i hear you ruth replied i havent good mercy cut her off then behave as if you do she turned away apparently amazed and now selfconscious at her own words she looked at hester in some embarrassment im sorry perhaps hester smiled at her thank you she said quietly that was most effective flo you had better go and see to the rest of the womenand keep out of here flo glared at her she took it as a reproach a granting of ruths wishes i int no thief she said hotly i int i know that hester answered her do you think you would be welcome here if i thought you were she could not afford to have flo walk out somewhat mollified flo stared once more at ruth then swept out whisking her skirts behind her hester and mercy set about changing the linen on ruths bed and making her as comfortable as possible she was still an extremely ill woman and running a high temperature six monk was becoming accustomed to the dampness in the air and the smell of the tide the movement and the constant sound of water there was something vaguely comfortable about it like the beating of a heart the light was different from that in the streets it was sharper cleaner full of angles and reflections at dusk and dawn it shone back off the polished surfaces of the water in flashes of pink and primrose it took far longer to fade than it did over the dense rooftops of the city now he had something urgent to do he knew enough to realize that seeking the thief directly would be pointless he must anticipate his movements and be a step before him when he sold the ivory if it was not already too late but failure was not something he could afford to think about such thoughts would prove crippling robbing him of the strength even to try if the ivory had been taken by someone who knew of it and already had a buyer then there had never been any chance of getting it back on the other hand if it had been a crime of opportunity then the ivory would be far harder to sell and it was likely that it had not yet been moved more than to keep it safe and today little lil should send for him what would she have to say the thought was not entirely a pleasant one the first lift of hope came in the middle of the morning when he was sharing a sheltered spot out of the damp wind off the outgoing tide with one of the men he had seen in the scufflehunting gang he had just mentioned louvains name the man jerked his head around anger and fear in his face yer workin fer im he snarled monk was uncertain whether to admit or deny it why he asked int nothin ter do wi me the man said quickly what isnt monk demanded moving a step towards him get off me the man lifted his arm as if to shield himself and took a quick scrambling step sideways and backwards i dunno nuffink monk went after him about what clem louvain i dont touch nuffink ter do wif im get off me monk snatched the mans arm and held it why not why not louvain the man was frightened his lips were drawn back from his teeth in a snarl but his body was trembling there was hate in his eyes he glared at monk for a moment then his free hand went into his pocket an instant later monk felt a stinging pain in his upper arm even before he saw the knife partly to defend himself but at least as much in sheer fury he lifted up his knee and sent the man staggering backwards clutching himself and squealing tears running down his face monk looked at his arm his jacket was sliced open and there was a stain of blood spreading on to his shirt and the fabric of his coat damn you he swore looking at the man now half crouched over you stupid sod i only asked you he turned and walked away as quickly as he could aware that he must get his arm seen to before he lost too much blood or it became infected he was a hundred yards along the street before he realized that he had no specific idea where he was going he stopped for a moment his arm was painful and he was becoming worried in case it hampered his ability to go on as he had intended onearmed he was at a disadvantage he could ill afford where was there a doctor who could bind up his wound stitch it if need be would the portpool lane clinic have helped him or was it open only to women of the street pity it was too far away he had not been aware of doing it but he was holding his arm and the blood was oozing stickily through his fingers he must find a doctor he turned and walked back to the nearest shop and went in it was stacked with ironmongery of every sort pots pans kitchen machines gardening tools but mostly ships chandlery the air was thick with the smell of hemp rope tallow dust and canvas a little man with spectacles on his nose looked up from behind a pile of lanterns oh dear now wots appened ter you then he asked looking at monks arm thief monk replied i shouldnt have struggled with him he had a knife the man straightened up oh dear did e get your money no i can pay a doctor if i can find one ere sit down afore yer fall look a bit queasy you do he came out from behind the lanterns and led monk to a small hardbacked chair mouthful o rum wouldnt do yer no arm neither he turned around to face the door at the back of the shop madge go an fetch the crow quick on your way i int got no time ter mess abaht there was a call of agreement from somewhere out of sight and then the patter of feet and a door slamming monk was glad to sit down although he did not feel as bad as the proprietor seemed to think you jus stay there the man told him with concern then bustled away to sell a coil of rope and two boxes of nails to a thin man in a pea jacket then a packet of needles for stitching sails a couple of wooden cleats and a coal scuttle to a sailor with a blond beard monk sat thinking about the response the man on the dockside had made to the mention of louvains name he had been angry but more than that he had been genuinely afraid why why would a scufflehunter be afraid of a man of power louvains influence could help or hurt many he would barely even know monk had seen that kind of fear when he had been in the police in small men without defense who had hated and feared him because he could injure them and he let them know it he had thought it was the only way to do the job but the price was high was that true of louvain also a shadow of the same knowledge and responsibility and use of power louvains stature how would their paths even have crossed ere e is said a small highpitched voice that jerked him out of his thoughts he looked up to see a child about eight or nine years old her hair tied up in a piece of string her face grubby her skirts down to the tops of her boots but the fact that she had boots was unusual here she must be madge behind her was a man of about thirty with sleek black hair almost to his shoulders and a wide smile he looked relentlessly cheerful im the crow he announced using the cant word for a doctoror a thieves lookout bin in a fight ave yer lets see it then cant do nothin useful through all that cloth he regarded monks jacket pity not a bad bit o stuff still lets ave it orff you he reached out to help monk divest himself of it taking it from him as monk winced at moving his injured arm madge turned and ran off coming back seconds later with a bottle of brandy she held on to it cradling it in her arms like a doll until it should be needed the crow worked with some skill pulling the cloth of the shirt away from the wound and screwing up his face as he peered at it monk tried not to think about what training the man had if any or even what his charges might be perhaps he would have been wiser to have taken a hansom to portpool lane after all whatever the time or the money concerned in the end it would have been safer and maybe cost no more but it was too late now the man was already reaching for the brandy and a cloth to clean away the blood the raw spirit stung so violently that monk had to bite his lip to stop himself from crying out sorry the doctor muttered with a wide smile as if that would be reassuring coulda bin worse he peered closely at the wound which was still bleeding fairly freely wotve yer got worth puttin up that kind o fight fer eh he was making conversation to keep monks mind off the pain and possibly the blood as well monk thought of callandras watch and was glad that he had put it away in the top drawer of the tallboy in the bedroom he smiled back at the doctor though it was rather more a baring of teeth than an expression of good humor nothing he replied i made him angry the doctor looked up and met his gaze curiosity bright in his face make an abit o that do yer i could make me livin orff you an thats a fact o course thats only if you dint go an die on me don make nobdy angry enough ter stick it in yer throat next time he was pressing hard to stop the bleeding as he spoke put yer other and on that he ordered directing monk to a pad of cloth above the wound old it he pulled out of his pocket a fine needle and a length of catgut he washed them in the brandy then told monk to release the pad quickly and deftly he stitched first the inside of the wound then the skin on the outside he surveyed the result with satisfaction before winding a bandage around monks arm and tying the ends yerll ave ter ave that changed termorrer an every day till its ealed he said but itll do yer my wife will do it monk replied he was beginning to feel cold and a little shivery thank you she dont come all over faint at the sight o blood then she nursed in the crimea monk replied with a fierce welling up of pride she could amputate a leg if she had to jeez not my bleedin leg the doctor said but his eyes were wide with admiration really yer avin me on no im not ive seen her do something like it on the battlefield in the american war the doctor pulled a face poor sods he said simply oo did yer get across then yer must ave done it good ter make im do this to yer i dont know some scufflehunter the doctor squinted at him studying him with interest yer int from round ere it was a statement down on yer luck eh yer speak like yer come from up west wi a plum in yer mouth he regarded monks shirt ignoring the torn and bloody sleeve cardsharp are yer ye int no receiver yer int alf fly enough daft as a brush ter get sliced like that no monk said stiffly the wound was painful now and he was feeling colder with every passing moment discretion was gaining him little the man who stabbed me did it because i asked him about clement louvain the doctors eyes opened even wider did yer he said making a faint whistling sound between his teeth i wouldnt do that if i was you mr louvain int one ter meddle wi an yer wont cross im twice id put money on that but he has friends mebbe mostly theres them as ates im an them as is frit of im an them as is both he reached for the bottle of brandy and offered it to monk dont take moren a swig or two or yerll feel even worse but thatll get yer on yer way an ill give yer summink else fer nothin don meddle wi clem louvain anybdy crosses im up an es like a pit bull wi toothache if yer wanter keep yer other arm yerll steer clear of im monk took a swig of the brandy and it hit his stomach like fire so whoever crosses him is either very brave or very stupid he asked watching the doctors face the doctor sat back and made himself comfortable against a pile of rope did you he asked candidly no it was a thief and im trying to get the stuff back fer louvain of course off one of his boats likely the maude idris yes why what were it ivory the doctor made another shrill whistle between his teeth monk wondered if the loss of blood had weakened his wits he should not have said so much desperation was making him careless so someone is either sitting on a pile of ivory wondering how on earth to get rid of it without betraying who they are and bringing down louvains vengeance on them he said very quietly or else someone with a great deal of power enough not to need to be afraid of anything louvain can do to him is feeling very pleased with himself and perhaps very rich or very appy ter ave scored one orff louvain the doctor added who would that be the doctor grinned take your pickculpepper dobbs newman any o them big men along the pool or the west india dock or even down limeouse way id go back ome if i was you yer int suited fer this rivers no place fer gennelmen cutthroats is still two a penny if yer knows where ter find em monk gritted his teeth as pain from his arm washed over him let louvain clean up is own mess the doctor added how much do i owe you monk asked rising to his feet slowly and a trifle unsteadily well you probly owes erbert ere fer is brandy but i don need nuffink i reckon yer worth it fer interest like crimea eh honest yes she know florence nightingale yes you met er yes she has a pretty sharp tongue in her too monk smiled and winced at the memory the doctor pushed his hands into his pockets his eyes shining monk thought of telling him about the clinic in portpool lane then changed his mind it was only pride which made him want to better to be discreet at least for now whats your name he would do something later crow the doctor said with a huge smile at least thats what they call me suits me profession wots yours monk smiled back monk crow roared with laughter and monk found himself oddly selfconscious in fact he felt himself coloring he turned away and fished in his pocket to pay mr herbert for his brandy herbert refused the money and monk gave madge sixpence instead and another sixpence when she brought him water and soap to clean up his jacket before he walked outside there was a bitter wind coming off the tide but its chill revived him with a sharper mind and a slightly clearer head came the awareness that if he was going to go back to see little lil then he had to have at least two or three gold watches to sell her not even to earn louvains money was he going to part with callandras watch the only person whose help he could ask for now was louvain himself the thought choked in his throat but there was no alternative the sooner he did it the sooner it would be over what louvain said incredulously when monk told him monk felt his face burn he was standing in front of louvains desk and louvain was sitting in the large carved and padded chair behind it louvain had already remarked on monks torn sleeve and monk had dismissed it i need to convince them that i have stolen goods to sell monk repeated staring back at him unblinkingly he knew exactly what louvain was trying to do by his demeanor because he had exercised exactly that kind of domination of will over others when he had been in the police and had the power to back it he refused to be cowed talk means nothing he answered i have to show them something and you imagine im fool enough to give it to you there was a bitter derision in louvains voice and perhaps disappointment as well i fund four or five gold watches for you hand them over and why should i ever see you again let alone my watches what kind of an idiot do you take me for one that does not hire a man to retrieve his stolen goods without first finding out enough about him to know whether he can trust him or not monk replied immediately louvain smiled showing his teeth there was a flash of respect in his eyes but no warmth i know a great deal more about you than you do about me he conceded with a touch of arrogance monk smiled back his look hard as if he also had secret knowledge that amused him louvain saw something and there was a subtle change in his eyes monk smiled more widely suddenly louvain was uncertain what do you know about me he asked no timbre or lift in his voice to indicate whether the answer mattered to him or not im not concerned with anything except what has to do with the ivory monk told him i needed to know your enemies rivals people who owe you or whom you owe and any persons who think you have wronged them and what have you found out louvains eyebrows rose interest sharper in him perhaps if louvain were to succeed in the hard and dangerous trade he had chosen he needed to appear a man no one would dare cross but was there a gentle man behind the mask was he capable of softer passions as well of love vulnerability dreams was the woman he had taken to portpool lane the mistress of a friend for whom he would perform such a service or was she perhaps his own mistress and he had had to protect his family whoever they were wife children parents what have you found louvain repeated dont you know monk asked aloud louvain nodded very slowly if i get the watches for you you now know that if you steal them england wont be big enough for you to hide in let alone london i wont steal them because im not a thief monk snapped he was overpoweringly aware of the difference in wealth between them he lived from week to week and louvain would know that whereas louvain owned ships warehouses a london home with carriages horses possibly even a house in the country he would have servants possessions a future of as much certainty as was possible in life louvain raised his eyebrows but there was a flicker of humor in his face perhaps no one else was rash enough to give you gold watches i never worked for anyone who lost a shipment of ivory before monk snapped back i tend to specialize in murders and minor thefts louvain added cruelly lately youve retrieved a couple of brooches a cello a rare book and three vases however you have failed to retrieve a silver salver a red lacquer box and a carriage horse monks temper seethed only knowledge of his own dependency on the payment for this job kept him in the room which begs the question of why you asked me to find your ivory rather than the river police as any other victim of crime would have done he said bitterly there were many emotions in louvains face violent and conflicting fury fear a moment of respect and mounting frustration he realized monk was still staring at him and that his eyes read far too much ill give you forty pounds he said abruptly get what you can but if youre going to sell them around here youd better go to the south side of the river to buy them the pawnbrokers and receivers all know each others business on this side now go and get on with it times short its no damned use to me finding out who took my ivory if theyve already sold it on he stood up and went to the safe in the farther corner unlocked it with his back to monk took out the money and locked the safe again he faced monk and counted out the coins his eyes were as hard as the winter wind off the thames but he did not repeat his warning thank you monk accepted turning on his heel and leaving louvain was correct that there was no time to losealso that he would be far wiser to buy his watches on the south side of the river perhaps as far down as deptford opposite the isle of dogs he walked briskly back along the dockside guarding his injured arm as well as he could he should find a tailor to stitch up the gash in his coat but he had no time to spare now the cut was surprisingly small for the pain the knife had inflicted on his flesh it was growing dusk already even though it was midafternoon he had missed lunch so he bought a couple of eel pies from a peddler on the curbside only when he bit into the first one did he realize how hungry he was he stood on the embankment side near the stone steps down to the water waiting until he saw a ferry that would take him across it was half tide and the smell of the mud was sour it seemed to cling to skin hair cloth and would probably be with him even when he left the river to go home the air was damp the sound of water slapping against the stones was as rhythmic as the blood in a living thing faint veils of mist hung over the slick surface the windribbed shafts of silver were bright one moment vanishing the next far to the south along the curve of limehouse reach a foghorn sounded drifting like a cry of loss monk shivered as the wind dropped the mist would increase he had no desire to be caught trying to cross back again if there was a real peasouper he must go as quickly as possible without reasoning the advantage to it he walked to the edge of the steps and down the first two or three parallel to the wall railless the black water swirling and slopping a dozen feet below him there was a boat twenty yards away a man sitting idly at the oars monk cupped his hands around his mouth and called out to him the man half turned saw where monk was standing and dug the oars in deep pulling the boat towards him wanter cross he asked when he was close enough to be heard yes monk shouted back the man drew the boat in and monk went down the rest of the steps it was going to be less easy to board the boat with one stiff arm but he had to move it in order to keep his balance the man watched him with a certain sympathy but he was obliged to keep both hands on his oars to control the boat were yer goin he asked when monk was seated and pulling his coat collar up around his ears just the other side monk replied the man dug his oars into the water again and bent his back he looked to be about thirty or so with a bland agreeable face skin a little chapped by the weather fair eyebrows and a smear of freckles across his cheeks he handled the boat with skill as if doing so was second nature to him been on the river all your life monk asked a man like this might have seen something of use to him as long as his questions were not so obvious as to make his purpose known most the man smiled showing a broken front tooth but yer new ere least i never seen yer afore not this stretch monk prevaricated whats your name gould how late do you work gould shrugged bad night go ome early got a good job stay late why yer wanter come back across late i might do if im lucky i ought not to be long he must phrase his questions so as not to arouse suspicion he could not afford word to spread that he was inquisitive he had already made one enemy in the scufflehunter and the last thing he wanted was to be tipped overboard into the icy water too many bodies were fished out of the thames and only god knew how many more were never found isnt it dangerous to be on the river at night he asked gould grunted can be he nodded towards a pleasure boat lights gleaming on the water the sound of laughter drifting across towards them not for the likes o them but down in the little boats like us yeah it can be mind yer own business and yerll be all right monk heard the warning but he could not afford to obey it you mean river pirates use little boats he asked gould tapped the side of his nose never eard of em int no pirates on the thames odd thieves an the like but they dont kill no one sometimes they do monk argued they were about halfway across and gould was weaving in and out of the vessels at anchor with considerable skill the boat moved almost silently the dip and rise of the oars indistinguishable from the sounds of water all around them the mist was drifting and most of the light was smothered by a clinging choking gray mass that caught in the throat the hulls of the ships loomed up as only a greater density in the murk one moment clearly seen the next no more than shadows foghorns echoed and reechoed till it was hard to tell which direction they came from what had it been like on the night of the robbery had the thieves cleverly used the weather to their advantage or stupidly even chosen the wrong ship could you find a particular ship in this monk asked moving his head to indicate the mist swirling closer around them course i could gould said cheerfully know the boats on the river like me own and i do he nodded to one side thats the city o leeds over there fourmaster she is come in from bombay liverpool pride twenty yards beyond er come from cape o good ope bin stuck ere three weeks waitin for a berth other sides the sonora foreigner from india or some place i gotter know em ter the yard or so or ill be rowin straight into em in this yes of course monks mind was racing picturing the thieves creeping through the wreaths of vapor finding the maude idris having marked her carefully in daylight would it have had to be a bigger boat than this to carry two men or even three and the tusks as well he looked at gould his powerful shoulders as he heaved on the oars his agility as he made a sudden turn swiveling the blade to change the boats course he would have the strength to climb up the side of a ship and to carry the ivory he would have the strength to beat a mans head in as hodges had been were yer wanna go gould asked monk could see little that was distinguishable in the dark blur of the shoreline what he needed was a good pawnbroker who asked no questions and who would decline to remember him afterwards but if he had ever had any knowledge of the south side of the river he had forgotten it now he might as well make use of goulds help pawnbroker he replied one that has some good stuff but is not too particular gould chortled with hilarity will yer want one on the souf side eh i could tell yer a few good ones on the norf int none bettern ol pa weston give yer a fair price an never ask no questions as ow yer got it wotever it is tell im yer aunt annie left it yer an ell look at yer as solemn as an owl an swear as e believes yer monk made a mental note that gould had almost certainly tried that a few times himself perhaps he was a heavyhorseman on the side with all the specially built pockets in his clothes or simply a scufflehunter like the man who had stabbed him monk was glad he did not have callandras watch with him now rather the south side he answered better for me at the moment i unnerstand gould assured him int everything as is easy ter place he made a rueful gesture a kind of shrug and as he leaned forward a ships riding lights caught for a moment on his face and monk saw his expression of frustration and a wry desperate kind of selfmockery monk wondered what trinket gould was trying to pawn presumably the description of it was already known to the police they were only a few yards from the shore now and monk saw the steep bank rise ahead of them and heard the water slapping on the steps a moment later they were alongside and with an expert turn of the oar gould bumped the boat gently against the stone so monk could get out wot yer done ter yer arm then he asked curiously watching monk wince as he fished in his pocket for money to pay his fare monk raised his eyes to meet goulds knife fight he said candidly then he passed the money over plus an extra sixpence same for the way back if youre here in a couple of hours gould grinned don slit nobodys throat he said cheerfully monk stepped out onto the stairs and began to climb upward keeping his balance on the wet stone with difficulty once on the embankment he walked to the nearest street lamp and looked around he could not afford the time to explore he needed to ask and within a matter of minutes he found someone everybody was familiar with the need to pawn things now and then and an enquiry for a pawnbroker was nothing to raise interest he was back at the stairs an hour and threequarters later and within ten minutes he saw goulds boat emerge from the mist and the nowtotal darkness of the river he did not realize how relieved he was until he was seated in the boat again rocking gently with its movement in the water three gold watches in his pocket got wot yer wanted then ave yer gould asked him dipping the oars and sending the boat out into the stream again the mist closed around them and the shore disappeared in a matter of moments the rest of the world vanished and there was nothing visible except goulds face opposite him and the outline of his body against the dark pall of the mist monk could hear the water and now and again the boom of a foghorn and smell the salt and mud of the fastrunning tide it was as if he and gould were the only two men alive if gould robbed him and put him over the side no one would ever know it would be oblivion in every sense i kept my word to someone he replied he looked directly at gould staring at him with the hard level iciness that had frozen constables and even sergeants when he had been in the police it was the only weapon he had gould might have nodded but in the dark monk could barely make out his figure it was only the regular rhythmic movement of the boat that assured him the gould was still rowing for several moments they moved in silence except for the water and far away the foghorns but gould knew the river monk should not waste the opportunity to learn from him are there boats on the water all night long even shortly before dawn he asked gould hesitated a moment or two before answering theres always thieves on the lookout for a chance he replied but less yer know wot yer doin an can look arter yerself better be in yer bed that hour how do you know that monk said quickly gould chuckled deep in his throat i eard he answered but the laughter in his voice made the truth obvious thieves around dangerous ones monk said thoughtfully gould was still amused by monks naivete in their own boats or borrowed monk pursued or stolen for the night anybody ever steal your boat nah gould was indignant it was an insult to his ability and his worthiness on the river how would you know if somebodyd had your boat at say three or four oclock in the morning monk said dubiously id know if somebodyd ad me boat any time gould said with complete confidence i leave it tied wi me own kind o knot but at four in the mornin id be in it meself would you it was an acknowledgment more than a question every morning yeahjus about why some mornin yer got special like monk knew he had gone far enough gould was probably familiar with many of the river thieves he might even be one of them an accomplice the question was did monk want to risk word of his hunt getting back to whoever had taken the ivory except that they almost certainly knew already the large bulk of a schooner loomed up ahead of them almost over them gould made a hasty movement with the oars throwing his weight against them to turn the boat aside monk found himself gripping the sides he hoped in the darkness that gould had not seen him he half expected the shock of cold water on his skin any second it was worth the riskmaybe he could spend weeks going around and around the subject and discovering what had happened to the ivory when it was too late how would he survive anything if his reputation was ruined he lived on other peoples perceptions of him as a hard manruthless successful never to be lied to october the twentieth he answered he wanted to add and look where youre going but tact told him not to gould was silent monk strained his eyes ahead but he could not see the opposite shore yet although in this murk it could be twenty feet away dunno gould replied at last i were down greenwich way around then werent up ere so come ter fink on it nobdy coulda ad me boat so wotever it was as was done it werent done in my boat his voice lifted cheerfully sorry i cant elp yer and the next moment the dark wall of the embankment was above them and the hull of the boat scraped gently against the stones of the step there yare mister safe an sound monk thanked him paid the second half of his fare and climbed out it was another miserable night because hester was not home he knew that the reason would be illness at portpool lane people she could not leave because there was no one else to care for them but it did not ease his loneliness he slept in largely because his arm kept him awake until long after midnight and disturbed him after that he was undecided where to go to have the bandage changed he kept telling himself to go back and find crow he might learn more from him but even as he did so he was putting on his coat mitts and muffler and walking towards the omnibus stop in the direction of portpool lane it was raining steadily a persistent soaking rain that found its way into everything and sent water swirling deep along the gutters even so he strode down the footpath under the shadow of the brewery with a light step as if he were going home after a long absence he entered the clinic and found bessie in the main room sweeping the floor she glanced up and was about to berate him when she realized who he was and her face broke into a transformed smile ill get er for yer sir she said immediately shell be that glad ter see yer workin like a navvy she is she shook her head we got more in ere sick than yer ever seed time o year i reckon an you look starvin cold an all dyer like an ot cup o tea yes please he accepted sitting down as she disappeared out the door still carrying the broom as if it had been a bayonet he had little time to look around him at how the place had changed since he had last been therethe addition of a new cupboard a couple of mats salvaged from somewherebefore hester came in her face filled with pleasure at seeing him but it did not disguise her fatigue he was alarmed at the pallor of her skin and the very fine lines around her eyes he felt a lurch of tenderness realizing how much of herself she spent in the care of others he stood up to greet her keeping his injured left arm a little farther away in case she touched the wound she noticed it at once what have you done she demanded her voice sharp with anxiety a slight cut he replied and saw her disbelief i had a doctor stitch it up for me but it needs looking at again will you please of course take your coat off and sit down she took the jacket from him and look at this she said crossly its ruined that sleeve how am i going to mend that her voice caught and he realized she was close to tears it had nothing to do with the jacket and everything to do with him but she would not say so because she knew he had no choice itll stitch he replied calmly not referring to the jacket either but to his arm she took a deep shivering breath and went to the stove for hot water keeping her back to him she picked clean bandages out of the cupboard and began to work it was early afternoon by the time monk went a second time to little lils establishment and was admitted his arm was feeling a great deal easier the bleeding had stopped it smarted a bit and was stiffer than usual but apart from that it was hardly handicapped hester had said the cut was not very deep and in her opinion crow had made a good job of stitching it up above all it was clean lil was sitting in exactly the same place as before with the same piece of embroidery in her lap the fire was burning and the dim crowdedin room had a reddish glow she looked like an old smug little cat waiting to be served up another portion of cream or possibly another canary louvain had warned him not to underestimate the violence of an opulent receiver just because she might be a woman lil looked up at him her large eyes bright with anticipation she regarded his hair his face the way he stood the fact that he had taken his muffler and mitts off to come into her presence she liked it come in she ordered him sit down she looked at the chair opposite her no more than four feet from her own he obeyed her thanking her quietly she did not turn straight to business and he felt more than the heat of the fire as he realized what she was doing eard yer got knifed she said shaking her head yer wanter look after yerself a man wi no arms is a danger to isself its not deep he replied itll be healed in a few days her eyes never left his face mebbe yer shouldnt be workin by yerself he knew what she was going to say next long before the words were framed it was there in the appetite in her face but he had invited it and there was no escape now the rivers an ard place she continued yer should think on workin wi someone else keep an eye on yer back for yer he had to pretend to consider it above all he must draw some information from her if she wanted flattery attention and heaven knew what else then that was the price he must pay i know the rivers dangerous he agreed as if admitting it reluctantly she leaned forward a little he was acutely uncomfortable but he dared not seem to retreat yer should think abaht it choose careful she urged oh yes he agreed with more emotion than she would understand there are a lot of people up and down this stretch i wouldnt want to go against she hesitated weighing her next words got no stomach fer it int yer she challenged he smiled widely knowing she would like it he saw the answering gleam in her and masked a shudder oh i like to be well thought of he said but i want to live to see it she giggled with pleasure it was a low noise in her throat like someone with heavy catarrh but from her eyes it was clear that she was amused he spoke again quickly who do i keep clear of she named half a dozen in a low conspiratorial whisper he had no doubt they were her rivals it would not do to let her think he believed her unquestioningly she would have no respect for that he asked her why as if he needed proof she described them in vicious and picturesque detail he could not help wondering if the river police knew as much about them im obliged he said when he was sure she had finished but there are more than receivers to be careful of there are one or two shipowners i dont want to cross her big eyes blinked slowly you frit o them she asked id rather swim with the tide than against it he said judiciously again she gave her strange deepthroated giggle then don cross clem louvain she told him or bert culpepper least not until yer sees oo wins he felt a prickle at the back of his neck he must not betray his ignorance to her my moneys on louvain he said she pulled her mouth into a thin line then yer knows summink as i dont like where is ivory went ter mebbe cos if e dont get that back afore march closes in on im e wont ave the money ter pay is debt ell lose is wareouse an he wont be able ter pay up fer that damn big clipper as is comin up for sale when she makes port an ol bert culpepperll get it sure as god made little fishes an then wherell clem louvain be eh ill tell yer a week beind for the rest of is days an you an i but know wot good a cargo is a week beind so yer put yer money on clem louvain if yer want but im keepin mine in me pocket till i sees which way the cat jumps monk smiled at her very slowly then so will i he said softly it was what he had wanted at last she was uncertain just how deep his agreement was she wanted it all but she knew she had to play it slowly she had reeled in many fish in her day and this was a tasty one monk sat back again still looking at her you said something about watches she moved her fingers gently on the fabric of her embroidery yer got watches three for now she held out her hand he gave them to her one at a time hoping she would either give them back to him or pay him something like their worth if not the information shed just revealed would have been bought at a price he could not afford it took him nearly an hour to haggle with her and she relished every moment of it as if it were a kind of game between them she sent for a bottle of gin and it was brought by a thin man with muscles like cords in his neck and a knife scar over the crown of his shaven head he brought it with ill grace and lil barely looked at him she was bored with him her appetite was sharp for monk they sat in front of the fire sipping gin arguing back and forth she leaned forward so close to him he could smell the warmth and the staleness of her but he dared not let her see that he could feel the sweat trickling down his body and knew it was as much from revulsion as from the heat of the room he had walked into this knowingly using what he saw in her face and now he did not know how to get out he was tempted to settle for less than the watches were worthanything to escape but if he did that she would know why and not only despise him for it but be insulted which would be far more dangerous every instinct in him screamed that a woman rebuffed was an enemy no man could afford better a man robbed of his goods or insulted in his honor better almost anything rather than that the minutes ticked by she sent for the man with the corded neck again to fetch more coal apparently his name was ollie he brought it she told him to stoke the fire he did so she dismissed him forty pound she said as ollie closed the door behind him thats me last offer he pretended to weigh it very carefully he had asked fortyfive three pounds more than the forty pounds louvain had given him expecting to have to come down this would mean he lost two pounds but he would not do better well i suppose theres more to a price than money he said at last she nodded with satisfaction gimme he passed over the watches and she stood up and went to a locked box in the far corner of the room she opened it and brought back forty sovereigns counting them out for him he took them and put them in his own inside pockets he knew better than to leave instantly it was another five minutes before he rose to his feet thanked her for her hospitality and said he would be back the next time he had business of a similar nature he walked briskly to louvains office tense all the way thinking he heard footsteps behind him he could not afford to lose the money he went in with a sense of relief so overwhelming it was like exhaustion suddenly catching up with him he asked to see louvain immediately and was shown in within ten minutes well louvain demanded his face dark with anger and impatience monk realized how glad he was that he had something positive to reportand that the coins were in his pocket he took them out and put them on the desk forty pounds he said it bought me information that you should have told me in the first place louvain looked at the money for a moment then picked it up scraped his fingernail across one of the coins and put them in his pocket what information is that he said quietly there was a rough dangerous edge to his voice and his eyes were cold but he did not ask for the other two pounds that your warehouse is surety for a loan from bert culpepper and if you dont redeem it you cant put it up for collateral to buy the clipper when it comes up for auction monk told him louvain let out his breath slowly his jaw clenched so the muscle stood out who told you that and what you say had better be the truth an opulent receiver monk replied if you want to know who else knows i cant tell you i didnt learn that so now they know youre my man im not your man and no they dont know youre my man until i say you arent louvain leaned forward over his desk his hands callused and scarred by ropes spread wide on the polished wood how does knowing about culpepper and the clipper get you any further i told you i needed to deliver the ivory because it was due i hadnt time to tell you all my enemies along the river i have crossed every man on it one time or another and theyve crossed me its not a trade for the squeamish because if youd told me about culpepper i could have started to trace the ivory from the other end monk answered back with equal bitterness following the ivory from the ship im always at least two days behind a dull flush spread up louvains cheeks well go and get on with looking at culpepper but for the love of god be careful youre no use to me at the bottom of the river with your throat cut thank you monk said sarcastically then turned on his heel and went out he felt safer now that he had only a little silver and copper change in his pocket but he still kept to the middle of the road all the way back to the omnibus stop he was standing waiting hunched against the wind when another man came up presumably to wait also only when he stood beside him was monk suddenly aware of a weight pressing into his side he turned to complain and saw the hatred in the mans eyes he had a hat on covering his shaven head and the strangely muscular neck but monk recognized his jaw and mouth it was ollie who had waited on him at little lils yer int ready ter go ome yet mr busybody ollie hissed softly as if someone might overhear him fancy yerself do yer think our lild give yer moren the time o day do yer well yer int gonner ave the chance see cos yer comin wi me fer a little trip down limeouse way he jerked the knife blade in his hand a little more sharply into monks ribs an there int nobdy listenin so don bother yellin out ner thinkin as mebbe i wouldnt stick yer cos i would monk did not doubt it he might get a chance to overpower him later but certainly not now and his mind was filled with the memory of the knife in his arm as a scream filled the silence obediently he turned from the omnibus stop and walked back along the dark gusty street the wind in his face the stones slick under his feet they were alone side by side ollie close and a little behind always keeping the knife bumping monks back he must have done such a thing before because never onceall the way along the road across the dark inlet to the shadwell docks and beyond towards the curve southward of limehouse reachdid he ever let monk move far enough from him to turn or escape the prodding blade monk saw the cranes and warehouses of the west india dock ahead the rain was spitting in their faces and the air was pungent with the smells of fish and tar when ollie ordered him to stop yer goin fer a nice little swim you are he said with malicious delight mebbe our lil wont fancy yer so much when they fish yer out he laughed to himself a sound like a clearing of the throat thats if they do like sometimes bodies get caught up in the piers an no one ever finds em they stay there forever ill make damn sure you come with me monk retorted is this what lil wants dont yer talk abaht er yer ollies voice shook with rage monk felt the knifepoint prick him he moved towards the broad surface of the wharf where it stretched out ten or twelve yards into the dark water before dropping off abruptly nothing beyond but the creaking dripping stumps poking up like dead mens bones the smell of wood rot was heavy in his nose it was dark but for the riding lights of a ship twenty yards away garn ollie prompted shoving monk forward with the knife blade he was too close behind for monk to twist and lunge back at him monk stepped down as he was told and felt the boards slippery under his feet the wood was pitted and slimy with age he could hear the river swirling and sucking around the stakes only a few feet below him now would he have any chance of swimming in that current could he catch hold of the next stake as he was carried against it if it was that easy why did people drown because the tide was fast and the eddies pulled you away clothes soaked with water were too heavy to move in and they pulled you under no matter what you did he had to fight now or not at all and ollie knew that too he gave another stiff prod and monk stumbled forward onto his knees and rolled over rapidly in a single movement just as ollie flung himself into the place where he had been knife blade arcing in the air and stabbing downward monk scrambled to get up as a board cracked under his weight and swung for a moment then plunged into the water below ollie was on his feet again he grunted with satisfaction he knew the pier where the rotten planks were and he had the knife he was between monk and the way back but at least there was space between them now and monk could make out his shape in the darkness would that be enough it had been a long time since he had fought physically for his lifein fact not since that dreadful night in mecklenburg square before his accident and he remembered that only in flashes ollie was balancing on the balls of his feet preparing to lunge this was ridiculous if he were not facing death it would be funny he was fighting a man he did not know for the favor of a woman he would have paid not to touch and if he told ollie that ollie would be so insulted for lil he would murder monk in outrage monk gave a bark of laughter for the sheer lunacy of it ollie hesitated for the first time he was faced with something he did not understand monk moved a step sideways away from the board he knew was rotted and closer to the way back ollie froze looking beyond monk it was then that monk turned and saw the other figure in the gloomsolid menacing huge with the riding lights behind him monk broke out in a sweat of panicthen the instant after when the figure moved recognized the slightly rolling gait of durban from the river police now then ollie durban said firmly you cant take us both an you dont want to finish up on the end of a rope its a bad way to go ollie remained motionless his jaw hanging put that away an go on home durban went on moving a step farther towards monk his voice held such certainty as if there was no question in anyones mind that ollie would obey ollie stood still monk waited underneath them the water sucked and belched swirling around the pier stakes and somewhere something was washed away and fell in with a splash monk was shuddering with cold and relief ollie made his decision he lowered his hand with the knife in it into the water durban directed ollie squawked with indignation his voice high and harsh the knife durban said patiently not you ollie swore and tossed the knife it fell into the water with only the faintest sound monk stifled a laugh that was far too close to hysteria ollie turned and stumbled up towards the street and the darkness swallowed him up another figure appeared behind durban slighter and moving with an ease that suggested he was also younger you all right sir his voice was concerned challenging yes thank you sergeant orme durban replied just ollie jenkins getting a bit above himself again thinks mr monk here has designs on little lil sergeant orme was satisfied the rigidity in him relaxed but he did not leave what exactly is it that youre doing here mr monk durban asked what are you looking for thank you monk said with profound feeling it was embarrassing being rescued by the river police he was used to being the one who helped who did the favor and found the solutions it was made the more so because he respected durban and loathed not being able to be honest with him it was a kind of grubbiness he would have paid a great deal to avoid what are you looking for durban repeated the water gurgled around the pier the wash from something passing in the gloom sloshed against the stakes and the wood creaked and sagged sideways i know youre a private agent of enquiry durban said in an expressionless voice what he thought of such an occupation could only be guessed at did he think monk was a scavenger in other peoples misery or a profiteer from their crimes stolen goods he answered finally so i can return them to their owner still durban did not move what sort of goods anything that belongs to one man and has been taken by another youre playing with fire mr monk an you arent good enough at it at least not down here on the river durban told him softly youll get burnt an i already have enough murders on my stretch without you go back to the city an do what you know how ive got to finish this job durban sighed i suppose youll do whatever you want i cant stop you he said wearily youd better come with us back along the river cant leave you around here or somebody could attack you in the other arm he turned and led the way out towards the river edge of the wharf to where the police boat was waiting on the high tide close enough to the bank to jump down into monk followed and sergeant orme offered him a hand so he could balance himself in the dark he landed moderately well in the boat at least not falling over any of the oarsmen or pitching beyond into the water he sat quietly and watched as orme who was apparently in charge gave the order and they put out again and turned upriver towards the pool they moved swiftly on the stillincoming tide the men pulling with an easy rhythm with that special kind of unity that comes with practice and a common purpose they maneuvered with skill making little of the art and the knowledge required to weave their way between the anchored ships without hitting a boat now and then someone made a joke and there was a burst of laughter a comfortable sound in the wind and the blustery darkness lit only by the glimmer of riding lights they called each other by nicknames which were often derogatory but the affection was too plain to need display the mockery was their way of robbing the fear from the reality of violence and hardship monk knew that as he listened to them and remembered all the better parts of his own police days things he had forgotten until now and lied to himself that he did not miss they put him off at london bridge and he thanked them climbing out stiffly then walking towards the nearest omnibus stop he was glad to feel the solid earth under his feet but his mind was in turmoil his emotions raw he hated having appeared such a fool to durban even when the time came that he could tell him the truth it might not sound a great deal better even though ideas were at last becoming clearer in his mind there were threads to follow something definite to do seven monk returned home for the night but hester was not there the emptiness of the house oppressed him and he found himself anxious for her thinking how tired she must be at least she was in no danger margaret ballinger and bessie would look after her as much as they could in the morning he dressed choosing another jacket with no tear then went downstairs and cooked himself kippers and toast for breakfast at eight he set out to pursue the ideas he had formed from the knowledge gained the day before he began by enquiring for the exact location of culpeppers warehouse then taking a boat down the river to deptford creek just short of greenwich he went ashore on the south bank and walked slowly along the street past ironmongers ships chandlers sailmakers and general stores making a note of the local public house and then went and stood on the dockside as if waiting for someone after a little while watching the laborers come and go he began to appreciate how many men worked for culpepper in one way or another culpepper was obviously an ambitious man in the public house at lunchtime again he listened then when he had heard enough he continued to fall into conversation with a disgruntled dock laborer who said his name was duff its hard monk sympathized with him good work isnt easy to come by good work duff exploded theyre a bunch o cutthroats the whole poxy lot of em pity they dont cut each others throats and save us all our grief monk agreed could appen duff looked suddenly cheerful at the thought culpepper an louvain any road thatd be a start thats what i heard monk agreed he leaned forward confidentially i have interests i need to be sure i put them in the right place cant afford to back a loser duffs eyes brightened and he sat forward a little prepared ter pay a little for yer information are yer if its accurate monk answered he made no threat as to what would happen if it were not but he looked steadily at duffs narrow face and held his gaze and i keep my promises good and bad duff swallowed what is it yer need ter know like ill take a little at a time and test it monk replied if its true ill pay in gold if its false youll pay in blood hows that duff swallowed again i got friends too if yer gold int the real thing yerll never dare come back ere rivers eaten moren one gent as thought e were an ell of a clever sod im sure it has lets start with saving me a bit of time how many properties does culpepper have where are they and what does he have his eye on to buy next easy duff listed three wharves a couple of warehouses and a lodging house as well as a goodsized dwelling an e wants the clipper the eliza may soon as she comes up for sale he grinned so does clem louvain well see oo as the money on the day eh shes a beauty cut their sailing time by a week or more from the indies worth thousands o pounds that is with a good load first in makes a fortune second counts fer nothin a few undred monk knew that already he needed to learn if culpepper had either hired the thieves who had taken the ivory or if he had bought it from them afterwards knowing that it would be the beginning of defeat for louvain he stayed questioning duff for another half hour passed him a gold guinea and sent him to find out more about recent cargoes a mass of questions that he asked disguised the one that mattered he spent the afternoon farther down the river watching making notes of cargoes times of comings and goings and began to amass enough information to tell him how far culpeppers empire stretched the following day he returned with more money to pay duff by now he was learning enough of culpeppers trade to see how important it was to his future profits that he and not louvain purchase the eliza may course e wants it duff said bitterly e wont be top dog down ere anymore less e does louvain neither therell be other ships wont there monk asked leaning on the railing of the pier and watching the dark water churn beneath him the barges going past following the tide were so heavily laden that in places the decks were awash course but losin counts duff replied pulling a clay pipe out of the pocket of his coat knocking the dottle out then shredding tobacco with the fingers of his other hand before stuffing the shreds into the bowl lose one fight an the next time you start out two steps beind like people don back yer no more folks as used ter be scared o yer all of a sudden find out theyre more scared o someone else he put the pipe in his mouth and struck a match to light it inhaling slowly winnin an losin as their own rules he went on the more it goes one way the more folks foller the tide like when it turns thats it yer don wanna lose mister like rats they are the cowards leave yer the bad ones turns on yer all teeth an claws if yer made enemies losin is the beginnin o the end the big bastards cant afford ter lose the likes o you an me it don matter we done it afore an well be low awhile then well come back monk could see the profound truth of that no wonder louvain needed his ivory back and that explained why there was no word of it anywhere along the river it had not been sold it was stored hidden so the loss of it wrought the maximum damage to louvain he thanked duff and left he needed to know more about culpepper so he could find out where the ivory was it would mean endless small questions he would have to disguise them or word would creep back to culpepper at best he would move the ivory and monk would have to start all over again if culpepper was nervous or angry enough he would even sink it in the thames mud and it might never be found there was the chance he had done that anyway but surely he would not willingly destroy a cargo of that much value monk tried several inventive stories mostly about an heiress who had eloped in order to question rivermen as to who and what they had seen on the river around culpeppers wharves on the morning of october twentyfirst for two days he stood in the cold asking painstaking questions and noting the answers almost illegibly his hands were so stiff his body shivering the steps were slimy with salt and weed the wooden piers creaked and sagged under the weight of years the wind scythed in off the river mistswathed sometimes knifesharp in the early mornings always the light shifting in blues and grays cut with silver shafts then finally he had enough it was the evening of october twentynine as he sat at home the kitchen stove open and stoked high the kettle steaming putting it all together that he made sense of it he had his feet in a bowl of hot water and a pot of tea on the table and three slices of toast made when he saw the one fact that tied it all together the boatman gould had told him that he could not have seen anyone rob the maude idris in the early hours of october twentyone monk had verified that gould had indeed been in greenwich but only in checking the ferries and lightermen in greenwich had monk realized that gould had taken no fares that day his boat had been at greenwich certainly but idle what boatman could afford that unless he was being paid more than for working goulds boat had been at culpeppers wharf early in the day and then disappeared without passengers it had been seen as usual up in the pool of london the day after it answered every question if it was the boat in which the thieves had crept up to the maude idris taken the ivory and then carried it down to culpepper at greenwich whether they had done so to order or simply taken advantage of a supreme opportunity hardly mattered if louvains cargo had been betrayed to culpepper by someone in his own company that was louvains problem to discover and to deal with once monk had retrieved the ivory and taken it back he had discharged his obligation he anticipated the relief the sudden weight lifted from him almost as if he were free to breathe again to stretch his shoulders and stand straight he went to bed early but lay awake staring at the faint light on the ceiling thrown up from the street lamp a few yards away he had plenty of blankets on the bed but without hester there was a coldness he could not dispel before his marriage he had dreaded the loss of privacy the relentless company of another person preventing him from acting spontaneously curtailing his freedom now loneliness crowded in on him as if he were physically chilled when he held his breath there was silence in the room a cessation of life itself perhaps he would not have asked her what his next step should be possibly not even told her much about the river to save her worry when she had so many of her own anxieties to deal with but he resented the fact that he was robbed of the choice and it hurt that gould whom he had liked was part of the robbery which had beaten the night watchman to death the theft of the ivory was a crime in an entirely different way louvain could do what he liked about that but hodges murder must be answered to the law it was monks business to see that it was he would have to be careful in capturing gould with the rope waiting for him the boatman would fight to the death having nothing to lose monk could not ask durban for help before he had forced gould to tell him where the ivory was and get it back to louvain after that he must take gould to the police whose help could he ask crow scuff he turned over idea after idea none of them making complete sense until he fell asleep his dreams were crowded with dark water cramped spaces shifting light and flashes of a knife blade ending in pain as he turned on his wounded shoulder in the morning he was on the dockside at daybreak the tide was flowing in fast filling the hollows of the mud creeping up the stone walls and drowning the broken stumps on the old pier the air was bitter the broadening light had the clarity of ice the hard white fingers of dawn found every ripple on the waters face and the wind tasted of salt he stood alone staring at it as the sun below the horizon started to burn the first color into the day perhaps by tonight he would have finished all he had to do here he would be paid and go back to the streets he was used to where he knew the thieves the informers the pawnbrokers the receiverseven the police he would be able to work openly again even if most of the cases were small he breathed in the icy air savoring it watching the light spread across the water he would miss this one could never stand alone in a street and see this kind of beauty there was life on the river already more than just the first strings of barges low in the water humped with cargo a lone boatman was busy oars working rhythmically rising with the eastward blade dripping diamonds as he looked downriver a ship caught his sight it was just a flash of white at first but growing as it came closer until he could make out the five tiers of sails on its towering masts mainsails course lower topsails upper topsails topgallants and royals billowing to catch the surprise wind it was a shining thing a creature of dreams all power and grace he stood spellbound oblivious of everything else the rest of the river other traffic people anyone on the dockside near him not until the sun was fully risen and pouring light into every corner showing the shabby and the new the idle and the laboring and the clipper was at last at anchor did he even notice that scuff was standing next to him his face transfigured jeez the boy sighed his eyes huge its enough ter make yer blieve in angels init yes monk replied for want of anything better to say then he decided that that was quite good enough there was something of the divine in anything that was such a perfect blend of power beauty and purpose yes he said again it is scuff was still rapt in the awe of the moment monk did not want to but he understood why louvain was obsessed with the passion to own such a ship it was far more than money or successit was a kind of enchantment it captured the glory of a dream it spoke to a hunger for greater space and light a width of freedom impossible in any other way he shook himself from those feelings with difficulty he could not lose himself in them any longer i need to find someone to help mefor nothing he said aloud ill elp yer scuff drew his eyes away from the river reluctantly reality had governed him too long to allow selfindulgence wot dyer want unfortunately i need a grownup i can do a lot o things yer wouldnt believe an im nearly eleveni think monk judged his age at probably closer to nine but he did not say so i need size as well as brains he said to soften the blow i was thinking a man called crow might help do you know where i could find himwithout anyone else knowing the doc yeah i reckon yer wont get im in no trouble will yer scuff asked anxiously i don think es no fighter i dont want him to fight just to offer to buy something i know where e lives scuff appeared to be turning something over in his mind loyalties were conflicting with one another new friends against old habit against adventure someone who healed him when he was sick as opposed to someone who shared food with him tell him im here and id like to see him urgently monk requested then well have breakfast before we go ill fetch us some ham sandwiches and tea be back in an hour do you know an hour scuff gave him a filthy look then turned and ran off fifty minutes later he was back and a highly curious crow was with him he was dressed in a heavy jacket his black hair hidden by a cap and had mitts on his hands monk had the sandwiches but was waiting to buy the tea fresh and hot he gave scuff the money and sent him off to fetch it crow looked him up and down with interest his eyes bright ows the arm he asked yer never came back to get the bandage changed i had my wife do it monk replied its fine a bit stiff thats all crow pursed his lips in the clear morning light no softness in its glare the tiny lines were visible on his skin he looked closer to forty than the thirty monk had assumed but there was still a fire of enthusiasm in his expression that made him uniquely alive so what is it you want me for he asked monk had been thinking how to broach the subject and how much to tell him he knew nothing about this man he had made his decision on a mixture of instinct and desperation would he take caution as an insult or as a sign of intelligence i need someone to make an offer for me monk replied watching crows expression i cant do it myself they wouldnt believe me crow raised an eyebrow should they no what im looking for was stolen from a an associate of mine he could not bring himself to call louvain a friend and he was not yet willing to let crow know that he was a client it raised too many other questions associate crow turned the word over an yer want ter buy it back now what kind o a thing would yer buy back if it was yers in the first place an what kind o people do yer associate with that are happy ter buy back things that were stolen an then why use yer why not do it thesselves yer dont do it for nothin do yer monk grinned no i dont and no im not going to buy it back when i know where hes put it im going to take it but hes got it well hidden i need you to make an offer to buy some of it so hell go there crow looked dubious doesnt e ave a receiver for it isself if yer threatnin ter cross up one o the receivers along ere yer daft an yer wont last long i think it was stolen to deprive the owner of its use not to sell on monk explained reluctantly i just want you to make an offer for one tusk crows eyes widened tusk ivory thats right will you do it crow thought for a moment or two he was still considering it when scuff returned with the tea carrying it carefully in three mugs crow took one warming his hands on it and blowing at the steam rising from the top yeah he said at last someone needs ter look after yer or well be fishin yer outta the water an tellin the police who you were yeah scuff added with sage concern monk felt both cared for and diminished but he could not afford the luxury of taking offense apart from that they were right thank you he said a trifle tartly int nuffin scuff said generously and took a huge bite of his ham sandwich so who do i have ter ask fer the tusk crow enquired gould the boatman who works from the steps here crow said with surprise knew he was a thief of course but ivorys a bit much for him yer sure no but i think so right crow finished his sandwich and his tea and rubbed his hands together to signify he was ready to begin monk looked at scuff who was waiting expectantly will you come with me and when im sure where gould is leading us take a message to mr louvain and tell him where we are then go and fetch mr durban of the river police so we can arrest gould and get the ivory back crows eyes widened louvain he said with a sharpness to his voice a sudden wariness as if it changed his perception its his ivory monk replied im going to return it to him thats what he hired me for crow whistled through his teeth did e yer do this kind o thing often all the time just not on the river before he tried to judge whether crow would consider it a compliment or an insult to be offered money monk stroked his face having no idea of the answer then crow grinned hugely showing magnificent teeth right he rubbed his mittened hands together lets go an find mr gould im ready by the way ow am i supposed ter know if es got ivory from an informant who is unusually observant and whom it would be more than your lifes worth to name monk said with an answering smile yeah right crow put his hands in his pockets but if yer comin after me id be appier if yer ad a boatman i could trust ill get jimmy corbett e wont let yer down and without waiting for monks agreement he strolled over towards the edge and started to walk along scanning the water scuff picked up the mugs and returned them at a run and he and monk set off a comfortable distance behind crow as he went to search for jimmy corbett and then for gould it took them nearly an hour before it was accomplished and monk and scuff saw the lanky figure of crow finally step down into goulds boat and pull away just to the east of wapping new stairs and turn back upstream not down as they had expected they climbed hastily into jimmy corbetts waiting boat and pulled away into the traffic on the river turning west as well this was going to prove an expensive business i thought you said greenwich scuff said urgently i did monk admitted equally surprised a pleasure boat passed them moving swiftly people were lining the decks scarves and ribbons fluttering the sound of music drifted across the water from the band on deck some people were waving their hats and shouting there were ferries in the water lighters all kinds of craft about their business it was not always easy to keep gould in sight although the tall figure of crow in the stern helped monk and scuff sat in silence as they wound through the anchored ships monk wondering where they could be going where was there upstream that gould would have hidden a boatload of ivory why would he not have left it near culpeppers warehouses if not actually in one of them jimmy was taking them steadily closer to the middle of the river and then towards the south bank they must be almost in line with bermondsey by now i know where were goin scuff said suddenly his face earnest his voice strained jacobs island its an awful bad place mister i int never bin there but i eard of it monk turned to look at him and saw the fear in his face ahead of them goulds boat was swinging around bow to the shore where rotting buildings leaned out into the water the tide sucking at their foundations their cellars must be flooded wood dark with the incessant dripping and oozing of decades of creeping damp looking at it across the gray water monk could imagine the smell of decay the cold that ate into the bones even in the city he had heard this places reputation he looked again at scuffs face when the boat drops me off go back and tell mr louvain to come immediately he said tell him ive got his ivory and if he doesnt want the police to take it as evidence to come and collect it before they do do you understand e wont know where scuff protested i gotter foller yer till i sees where yer goin he clenched his jaw tight in frightened refusal monk looked at his stubborn face and the shadows in his eyes thank you he said sincerely they were pulling in close to the shore now ahead of them gould was only a foot from landing on a low almost waterlogged pier he reached it and scrambled out tying his boat to a rotted stake and waiting while crow climbed out after him monk could tell by the way crow moved that he was nervous his legs were awkward his back stiff as though he half expected to have to defend himself any moment was it insane to have come here alone too late to change the plan now monk told jimmy to put him ashore at the next landing steps onward around the jutting buttress of the warehouse and out of sight of gould go and get louvain he hissed at scuff who was making ready to follow him now then get durban scuff hesitated glancing at the dark waste of timber ahead the alleys sagging windows and doorways the rubbish and the water seeping everywhere monk refused to follow his eyes or to let his imagination picture any of it go he ordered jimmy and pushed scuffs thin shoulders until he overbalanced back into the boat and it pulled away he turned back to jacobs island in time to see crow follow gould between two of the buildings and disappear he hurried after them trying to move soundlessly over the spongy wood afraid with every step that it would give way beneath him as soon as he was in shadow he stopped again to accustom his eyes to the gloom he heard movement ahead of him before he saw crows back just as he turned another corner and was gone the smell of rot was heavy in the air like sickness and as he went under a broken arch into one of the houses everything around him creaked and dripped it seemed as if it were alive beams settling the scuffle and scratch of clawed feet he imagined red eyes he went after the sounds of footsteps ahead of him and now and then as he climbed up or down steps or went around a corner he saw crows back or his black head with its long hair under his hat and knew he had not lost them yet was crow a fool to trust monk to rescue him if gould suspected he was being tricked louvain would never find them here or was monk the fool and crow had already told gould exactly what he was really here for should monk leave now while he could and at least get out of it alive then he would never be able to work on the river again his name would be a mockery and if he ran away from this what would he stand and face in the future would he run away next time too the thoughts raced in his mind while his legs were still carrying him forward the light was dim through broken windows and here and there gaping walls he could barely discern the figures of gould and crow going through the door at the end of a passage he hesitated the sweat running down his back in spite of the clinging chill then he went after them he pushed the door open it was a small room dim in the gray light from one window gould was pulling a sack away from a pile of something that lay on the floor one long white tusk protruded the outlines of others beyond were plain enough to see monk thought for an instant of the creations that had been slaughtered and their carcasses robbed then he remembered his own peril and stopped abruptly but it was too late gould had seen his shadow against the door lintel and jerked his head up his face froze monk walked forward slowly you had better leave he told crow ill talk with mr gould about the ivory and what should happen to it crow shrugged his relief was almost palpable and yet the darkness was still in his eyes he looked at monk as if he was trying to convey something he could not say in words it might be a warning of some sortbut what that they were watched that gould was armed time was shortthere was no way back might there also be no way forward help would only come from the river when scuff fetched louvain oo are yer gould demanded glaring at monk ill sell yer one tusk each but if yer think yer gonna rob me yer stupider than yer got any right ter be an stay alive his eyes flickered from one to the other of them nervously who am i monk was taking as long as he could im someone interested in ivory especially that shipment from the maude idris goulds face showed no added fear no sudden change at the mention of what he must know was murder monk felt a stab of regret that it meant nothing to him all he thought of was the money monk kept his back to the door his ear straining to hear anything human among the rat feet the dripping wood and the slow subsidence of the fabric of the building into the mud of jacobs island ow dyer know its from the maude idris gould asked his face puckered with suspicion get out monk said again to crow hoping that now he would go and bring the nearest police river or land oo are yer tellin ter get out gould said angrily yer got money ter buy all this then eh an don think yer can rob me cos yer cant i int alone ere i int that daft nor am i monk said with a slight laugh he hoped was believable and i dont want more than one tusk and only that if the price is right oh yeah an what price would that be then gould still had confidence twenty pounds monk said rashly fifty gould retorted with undisguised derision monk pushed his hands into his pockets and stared at the pile of tusks thoughtfully as if considering fortyfive is the lowest ill go gould offered monk was disgusted but he dared not show it he thought of hodge lying on the step above the hold his head broken his brain crushed twentyfive he said they argued back and forth up a pound down a pound monk realized that crow had goneplease god to fetch help though he owed monk nothing no friendship no loyalty but he prayed that scuff had managed to get louvain durban would not need to be asked more than once its worth more than that gould said angrily when monk refused to go any higher afraid of agreement and the end of the conversation i worked bleedin ard fer it gould went on you any idea ow eavy them things are too heavy for one man monk responded someone helped you where is he behind me or are you planning to cut him out of the deal there was a faint movement in the passage ten or fifteen feet beyond the doorway now he wished crow had not gonealthough there was no guarantee of which side he would have been on perhaps a thieves quarrel was his best chance were you the one that went into the hold of the maude idris he asked his voice louder than he meant and unsteady he wanted to know who had killed hodge then he would have no guilt in killing him in return if he had to in order to escape with his own life where the hell was louvain he had had time to get there by now why dyou care goulds eyes narrowed were you monk demanded taking a step forward yeah so wot of it gould challenged then it was you who murdered hodge monk accused perhaps your partner wont be so happy to share the rope thats waiting for you along with the price of your tusks gould froze odge i never murdered no one oos odge he sounded honestly confused the night watchman whose head you beat in monk said bitterly did that slip your mind geez i dint bash is ead in goulds voice rose to a screech there werent nothin wrong wi is ead he looked graywhite even in the gloom his eyes wide with horror had he not seen hodges body himself monk would have sworn it was genuine rubbish he barked rage welling up inside him for the lie as much as the violence it was twisting his own emotions because he wanted to believe him and it was impossible so elp me gawd its the truth gould ignored the ivory and stepped forward towards monk but there was no threat in him only urgency even pleading e were lyin there on the step i thought e were dead drunk he must a fell from the top monk hesitated did you look at the back of his head he asked there werent nothin wrong wi it gould insisted e might a banged it bad i dunno but it werent bashed sos i could see owd you know anyway im looking for the ivory because im paid to monk said bitterly but im looking for whoever killed hodge because i want him to answer for it well it int me gould said desperately monk stood still his back to the doorjamb it was bitterly cold in there so cold his fingers were dead and his feet were growing numb the damp was everywhere heavy with the reek of mud and effluent and the sweet stench of rot everything was sagging dripping full of slight sounds like the soft tread of feet rat feet human feet creaking like the shifting of weight and always water oozing and trickling the slow sinking of the land and the rising of the river he tried to clear his head he was beginning to believe gould and yet it made no sense who would beat in the head of a man already dead there was a distinct sound about a dozen yards away a movement too big to be a rat monk swiveled around to look the shadows changed was there someone there a man coming this way creeping step by step the sweat broke out on his skin and his body was shaking he backed farther into the room looking at gould someonell hang for it he said softly the police are coming and theyll make sure of that itll be prison then trial then three weeks of waiting and one morning theyll take you for the short walk and the long dropinto eternity darkness i dint kill im goulds cry was stifled in his throat as if he could already feel the rope at that moment the other man reached the doorway just behind monk monk saw it in goulds face and twisted away as the man lunged forward and monk caught him a glancing blow on the side of the head bruising his own hand gould stood frozen indecision wild in his face were the police really coming crow was gone and he knew where to lead them back monk waited his heart pounding the man started to get up gould swung his arm and hit the man hard sending him backwards his head thudding against the floor and he lay still i dint kill nobody gould said again but theyll kill you if yer dont get out of ere cmon he started to move past monk wait monk commanded i need one tusk to prove to the police that they were here he stepped back and picked up the largest one from the pile it was startlingly heavy cold and smooth to the touch he hoisted it onto his shoulder with difficulty the effort tearing at his injured arm then he staggered after gould leaving the other man senseless on the floor they did not go the way they had come in but awkwardly veering a little from right to left under the burden of the tusk up a short flight of steps at the top he leaned against the wall and the rotted paneling gave way behind him he swung around and let the tusk slip into the cavity easing the crick out of his shoulder then turned to see if it was still visible it wasnt but he could feel it he would be able to show durban where it was he hurried after gould along the corridor broken windows let in the gray light he caught up with him going down another stair with iron rails then through a door into an open patch of ground overgrown with weeds just as louvain and four of his men emerged from the ruins of a warehouse at the other side they were windburned brawny men dressed in seamens jackets monk and gould stopped abruptly five or six yards from them well louvain said grimly what have you got i dont see anything thirteen tusks of ivory monk replied he jerked his hand back there you might have to fight for them thirteen louvain questioned his face darkening do you think youre keeping one for yourself that wasnt the bargain one for the police for evidence monk replied or would you rather the thieves got away with it he let a slight sneer into his voice thats not good for business youll get the last one back when the case is over keep it for a memento youve got away cheaply a damned sight cheaper than hodge louvain looked puzzled for an instant then realization flooded his face whos he he demanded indicating gould with a jerk of his head instinct made monk lie hes with me did you think id come here alone louvains face relaxed he did not ask who had killed hodge and the omission angered monk right well take the ivory i want to be gone before the police get here no questions come to my office tonight and ill pay you it was curt dismissive he strode past monk and into the shadows of the building leaving his men to follow durban should be here any time now monk realized he glanced at gould whitefaced shifting from foot to foot dont think of it monk warned youll be hunted down like a rat i dint kill im goulds voice was hoarse with fear and his eyes begged for belief i swear on my life very appropriate monk said dryly since its with your life youll be paying for it but he felt a tug of pity he had not expected was it even imaginable that one of the crew had killed hodge a quarrel of some sort perhaps there had even been a traitor in the crew and hodge had seen him and would have told louvain had they stunned him first and killed him after gould had gone perhaps because he would have told louvain there was no point in asking gould it would be offering him an obvious avenue of escape and naturally he would take it and why should monk involve himself in looking for the last shreds of truth and untangling them to save a thief because the man might not be a murderer and no one else would bother to help him someone beat his head in he said aloud if it wasnt you then it was somebody else on the maude idris i dunno gould was desperate yer cant oh geez he said nothing more they stood on the damp sour earth and waited neither louvain nor any of his men passed them they had found another route to take the ivory away swiftly and unseen no doubt expecting durban to come from this side five minutes later monk heard gould gasp as if he were choking and his breath caught in a sob he looked around and saw durbans distinctive walk as he came out of the shadow of the building ahead sergeant orme and a constable behind him go with him monk said quietly to gould ill do what i can good day mr monk durban said curiously stopping a couple of yards away what are you doing here stolen goods monk replied one very handsome ivory tusk but the point is that the night watchman on the maude idris was killed in the theft durbans face was comical with understanding and skepticism that why they took only one tusk is it monk knew without question that durban did not believe it he knew exactly what monk had done i imagine so monk said smoothly maybe there was a bit of doublecrossing going on gould says he didnt kill hodge but somebody did ill show you where the tusk is durban signaled for his man to take gould who let out a cry and swiveled to look at monk and was jerked sharply to face forward as manacles were put on his wrists monk turned and led durban back into the far building going slowly partly because he was uncertain of the way but mostly because he wanted to be sure that louvain had had sufficient time to move all the tusks and leave no trace for durban to find it also crossed his mind to wonder if now that he had his ivory back he would cheat on the payment but monk refused to dwell on that if louvain did then monk would open up the hodge murder case in such a way that durban would plague louvain until hed wish he had not paid monk to retrieve the ivory in the beginning but even as he thought that he knew what a dangerous thing it would be to do it would be a last resort only to be adopted in order to save his own reputation not for the money but for all future work they were inside the long corridor again and the gloom closed in on them monk walked slowly picking his way by touch as well as sight stepping carefully to avoid the rotted boards the refuse and the weeds which had grown up through the floor and died their stems slimy he found the place where he had left the one tusk recognizing it by the newly broken wood he pointed to it and allowed durban to dislodge the ivory and pull it out i see durban said expressionlessly so who does it belong to then when weve finished with it i assume hes going to press charges apart from the murder of the watchman clement louvain monk replied he wished he could be more open with durban every lie scraped at him like an abrasion to the skin but he had left himself no room to maneuver at durbans instruction sergeant orme hoisted the tusk onto his shoulder and durban turned to walk back again monk followed him wanting to say something anything to let durban understand and knowing he could not he found louvain in his office after dark that evening the room was warm a fire was burning briskly in the grate under the ornate mantel the light of the flames dancing on the polished wood of the desk louvain was standing by the window with his back to the somber view of the river it was too dark to see anything but the yellow eyes of other windows and the riding lights of ships at anchor he was smiling he had a decanter of brandy on the small tableand two glasses out polished to burn like crystals in the reflected fire a small leather purse sat beside them its soft fabric distorted out of shape by the weight of coins inside sit down he invited as soon as monk had closed the door have some brandy youve done well monk i admit i had doubts at times i thought you werent up to it but this is excellent i have my ivory back bar one tusk for evidence he nodded smiling and there was no curb or evasion in it you couldnt have done better if i get another problem ill send for you as it is ill recommend you to everyone i like he smiled showing his teeth and ill hope my enemies never find you he poured a generous brandy for monk and passed it to him then one for himself he raised the glass to your continued prosperityand mine he drank with relish theres an extra ten guineas in the purse for you i like you monk youre a man like myself it was a generous compliment and honest thank you monk picked up the purse and put it in his pocket quite apart from the money in it it was a beautiful piece of leather it was a generous gesture he picked up his brandy and took a mouthful it was exquisite old mellow and full of warmth eight squeaky robinson staggered into the kitchen at portpool lane and heaved two baskets of shopping onto the table his fingers were still bent from the weight of them ave yer got any idea ow eavy that lot is he demanded looking at hester indignantly of course i have she replied barely turning from the stove where she was straining beef tea i usually carry it myself i just havent had time to go out lately unpack it will you and put everything away i dunno where it goes he protested then this is an excellent time to learn she told him unless youd rather do something else like laundry or scrubbing the floor or we could always do with more water we seem to be using a great deal at the moment youre a terrible ard woman he grumbled picking the items out of the baskets one by one claudine burroughs came in from the laundry her face pinched with distaste at the smell her sleeves rolled up above the elbows and her hands and lower arms red i have none of that stuffpotash she said to hester i cant work without supplies i got some squeaky said cheerfully ere he pointed to the bag on the floor ill take it down fer yer were gonna ave ter use a little less o all this least until we get some more money i dunno where folks earts is anymore ard they are ard like flint come on missus ill give yer an and claudine looked at him in disbelief she drew in her breath to rebuff him for his familiarity but he was impervious to it he picked up the large bag of potash lifting it with some effort although he had carried it all the way from the next street with greater ease claudine let out her breath again and with as big an effort as his she thanked him and followed him to the laundry flo came in carrying a full scuttle of coal a grin on her face learnin er ow the other alf lives are yer she said with relish if ol squeaky spoke to er in the street shed ave kittens we need her hester pointed out thank you for getting the coal in how much have we left need more day arter termorrer flo replied i know where ter get more cheap yer want it no thank you i cant afford to have the police here i said cheap flo was insulted not on behalf of her honesty but her intelligence i dint say free do what you can hester accepted sorry flo smiled patiently thats all right i don take no offense yer cant elp it hester finished the beef tea put more water in the kettle and replaced it on the stove then with the tea in a large cup she went up the stairs to see how ruth clark was this morning bessie had been up with her most of the night but had reported she now seemed no worse than some of the other women with fever and bronchitis if yer ask me bessie said briskly alf er troubles that er lover threw er out took in someone else with a softer tongue i daresay an oo knows wot side er breads butterd on now shes got no bread at all butterd or not an shes crossern a wet cat she int no sickern nobdy else hester did

and i changed hers shes got a very high fever i dont think the poor creature has had a decent meal in weeks maybe months ill take these to claudine a flash of amusement crossed her face she said nothing but hester knew precisely what was in her mind perhaps you can give her a little help she suggested especially with the mangle im no better at it mercy confessed i got my own apron caught up in it yesterday tore the strings off and had to stitch them back on again and thats something im not very good at either i can paint pretty well but what use is that everything thats beautiful is of use hester replied there are times when it is the only thing that helps mercy smiled but this certainly isnt one of them ill take these down and help claudine mangle the last lot between the two of us well make a passable job of it i might even make her laugh although i doubt it she dropped one of the sheets and bent to pick it up again although if she gets herself caught in the mangle again it might make me laugh and if flos there shell never stop she gave a tiny little giggle then it died as she heard someone along the passage call out and hester went to her margaret came in just after midday bringing with her a bag of potatoes three loaves of bread two very large mutton bones and three pounds six shillings and ninepence in money she was dressed for work and she looked vigorous and ready to tackle anything and enormously pleased with herself hester was so relieved she almost laughed just to see her ive got jam margaret said conspiratorially and i brought a couple of slices of cold mutton for your lunch eat it quickly there isnt enough to share it was all i could take without getting cook into trouble i made a sandwich for you she unwrapped it as she spoke when did you last go home poor william must think youve abandoned him she passed the sandwich across it was sliced a little crookedly but had been made with plenty of butter mint jelly and thick meat hester knew margaret had done it herself thank you she said with profound gratitude biting into it and feeling the taste fill her margaret made fresh tea and brought it to the table pouring a cup for each of them how is everyone she asked much the same hester replied with her mouth full where did you get the money a friend of sir olivers margaret answered she looked down at her cup she was annoyed with herself for allowing her feelings to be so clear and yet she also wanted to share them with hester there was a need in her not to be alone in the turmoil the vulnerability she felt and the acute anxiety in case lady hordern carried out her threat to call on mrs ballinger and repeat the conversation from the soiree margaret had actually broached the subject herself in order to forestall disaster but she was not at all sure that she had succeeded i think he put a certain amount of pressure on the poor man to contribute she said with an uncomfortable memory raising her eyes to meet hesters you know in spite of himself hes awfully proud of you and what we do here she bit her lip selfconsciously not because she had said rathbone was proud of hester which was true but because his emotions were caught up with margaret and they both knew that it had been unmistakable since he had been willing to help gain this building because margaret had asked him tired as she was hester found herself smiling she understood exactly the mixture of modesty of hope and fear which made margaret phrase it as she had if hes prepared to admit it then he certainly is she agreed and im grateful for anything he is able to coerce out of people i suppose its the time of year but we have far more women in here with bronchitis and pneumonia than a month or two ago id have pneumonia if i were walking the streets at night margaret said with feeling i wish i could persuade people to give regularly but you should see their faces when they think im collecting for missionary work or something like that and then the change in them when they know its for street women ive been sorely tempted to decorate the truth a little and just take the money i think it has something to do with acute discomfort that we allowed the misery to happen in the first place hester replied leprosy isnt our fault but tuberculosis or syphilis might be and theres the other side of it too we dont mind thinking about leprosy because we dont believe theres any chance of our catching it with the other things we might in spite of everything we try to do to prevent it syphilis margaret questioned especially that hester answered street women are seen as the ones who pass it on husbands use them wives get the disease she looked down you cant blame them for angerand fear i hadnt thought of it like that margaret admitted no perhaps i wouldnt be so willing either when you think of that perhaps my judgment was a little quick margaret stayed and worked hard all afternoon she was there to help when an injured woman was brought in several bones broken in her fingers but her most serious distress was fever and a hacking cough she looked worn until her strength and will were exhausted and when they helped her upstairs and into a bed she lay silent and whitefaced oblivious of all they could do to help her margaret left shortly after eight in the evening intending to purchase more of the most important supplies such as quininewhich was expensive and not easy to findand such simple things as bandages and good surgical silk and gut hester snatched some sleep for four hours and woke with a start when it was just after midnight claudine burroughs was standing next to the bed her long face filled with anxiety and distaste she looked annoyed what is it hester sat up slowly struggling to reach full consciousness her head ached and her eyes felt hot and gritty she would have paid almost any price to slide back into sleep again the room around her wavered the cold air chilled her skin whats happened she asked the new woman who came in claudine said framing her words carefully i think she has a a disease of a moral nature her nostrils flared as though she could smell its odor in the room hester had a terse answer on her tongue then she remembered how much she needed claudines help unskilled as it was she complained she disapproved but through it she kept working almost as if she found some perverse comfort in it a thought flickered through hesters mind as to what her life at home must be like that she came seeking some kind of happiness or purpose for herself here but she had no time to pursue it what are her symptoms she asked swinging her feet over onto the floor i dont know much about such things claudine defended herself but she has scars like the pox on her shoulders and arms and other things id prefer not to mention she stood very stiffly balanced as if to retreat her face was oddly crumpled i think the poor thing is like to die she added a harsh and sudden pity in her voice and then gone again as though she was ashamed of it for the first time hester wondered if claudine had ever seen death before and if she was afraid of it she had not thought to consider that possibility until now she stood up slowly she was stiff from lying too heavily asleep in one position ill come and see what i can do she said in answer to the summons there may not be much ill help claudine offered you you look tired hester accepted asking her to fetch a bowl of water and a cloth claudine was right the woman looked very ill indeed she drifted in and out of consciousness her skin was hot and dry and her breathing rattled her pulse was weak now and again she moved her eyes and tried to speak but no distinguishable words came hester waited with her leaving mercy louvain to tend to ruth clark and try to keep her fever down claudine came and went each time more anxious cant you do anything for her she asked whispering in deference to the possibility that the sick woman might hear her no just be here so she is not alone hester replied she had a light hold on the womans hand just enough to exert a slight pressure in acknowledgment of her presence so many of them claudine did not like to say die like this but it was in her pale face the tightness of her lips she smoothed her apron over her stomach her hands redknuckled were stiff yes hester said simply its a hazard of the job but its less certain than starvation the job claudine all but choked on the word you make it sound like a decent labor have you any idea what heartache they bring to she stopped abruptly hester heard the anguish in the sudden bittenback words as if claudine had already betrayed herself she turned and looked up at claudine and saw the shame in her eyes and fear as if hester might already know more than claudine could bear to have known hester spoke quietly the best way i ever found of dealing with it is to stop imagining the details of other peoples lives particularly the parts that ought to be private and try to help some of the mess ive made the odd error myself well were none of us saints claudine said awkwardly before she could have any further thought the woman on the bed made a dry little sound in her throat and stopped breathing hester leaned closer to her and felt for the pulse in her neck there was nothing she folded the womans hands and stood up slowly claudine was staring at her her face ashen is she yes oh suddenly and to her fury she started to shiver and the tears welled up in her eyes she turned on her heel and marched out of the room and hester heard her footsteps along the passageway hester tidied the bed a little then went out and closed the door she was walking towards ruth clarks room and from several feet away she heard the voices they were not loud but tight and hard with anger the words were muffled only one or two distinct there was something about leaving and a threat so choked with emotion that the individual words ran into a blur only the rage was clear a pain so intense and so savage that it made the sweat prickle on her skin and her heart pound as if it could reach out and damage her where she stood she shrank from intruding she wanted to pretend she had not heard it at all that it was some kind of mistake a momentary nightmare from which she had awoken into reality she had not steeled herself to do anything or even been quite sure what she should do when the door opened and mercy came out carrying a bowl of water and a cloth over her arm mercy looked angry and frightened she stopped abruptly when she saw hester she thinks shes better she said huskily she wants to leave perhaps tomorrow she isnt well enough im im trying to convince her her face was pale her eyes hollow with exhaustion she looked close to tears i was told she had family coming for her soon hester replied trying to be comforting if they do then they will look after her i imagine thats what she was referring to dont worry about it she isnt well enough to leave without someone to care for her and she must know that family mercy said in amazement who i dont know she was about to add that it was clement louvain who had spoken of them then she changed her mind perhaps mercy had no idea of her brothers private life or that of his friend supposing he existed but dont worry about her she said instead we cant keep her here if she wants to leave but ill try to persuade her how foolish it would be she looked at mercys drawn face shes a difficult woman shes always quarreling with flo even accused her of being a thief and really upset her flos all kinds of things and it doesnt matter but shes not a thief and she really cares about that if someone comes for ruth it would be a good thing mercy stood still im sorry she said very quietly go and have a cup of tea hester said and something to eat when did you last sit down she put her hand on mercys arm we cant help everyone some people just wont be helped we have to do what we can and then go on to think of the next person mercy moved as if to say something then the words died on her lips i know its difficult but its the only way to survive if mercy found any comfort in that it did not reflect in her face she nodded but more as a matter of form than agreement and went on down the stairs the rest of the night passed with little incident hester managed to get several hours sleep in the morning she sent squeaky to the undertaker to have him come and remove the body of the dead woman then set about making breakfast for everyone able to eat claudine looked tired and withdrawn but she carried out her duties with slightly increased skill she even took a dish of gruel up to ruth clark and helped her to eat most of it im bothered whether i know if that womans better or not she said when she returned to the kitchen with the dish one minute i think she is then she has that fever back and looks like shell not make it to nightfall she put the uneaten gruel down the drain and the dish in the sink ill go down the street and fetch water she added through pursed lips its as cold as the grave out there hester thanked her sincerely and decided to go up and see ruth herself she found her propped up very slightly on the pillows her face flushed her eyes bright and angry how are you hester asked briskly claudine says you were able to eat a little a slightly sour smile touched ruths lips better to swallow it than choke she has hands like a horse your pinchedup mrs burroughs she despises the rest of your help but i daresay you can see that a curious knowing look crossed her face even if you havent the wit to see why she added hester felt a moments chill an acute ugliness in the room but she refused to entertain it i am not concerned why miss clark she replied sharply any more than i care why your lover put you out for some friend to bring to a charity clinic to care for you you are sick and we can help that is all that concerns me i am glad you were able to eat a little charity clinic ruth said in a choking voice as if had she the strength she would laugh but there was hatred in her eyes hester looked at her and saw fear also well do our best she said more gently see if you can rest for a while ill come back soon ruth did not answer her the undertaker came and squeaky saw to the necessary details including paying him it was another strain on their dwindling resources which he complained about vociferously just before midday the rat catcher arrived hester had completely forgotten she had sent for him and for a moment she was so startled she did not recognize his outline he was thin a little squareshouldered only an inch or two taller than she then he moved into the light and she saw his wry humorous face and the small brownandwhite terrier at his feet mr sutton you gave me a fright id forgotten what day it was im sorry he smiled at her lopsidedly because his face was pleasantly asymmetrical one eyebrow higher than the other i guess that these rats int too bad then or yerd be a day ahead o yerself rather than a day beind but yer look fair wore out an thats the truth weve got a lot of sick people in just now she replied time of the year i suppose its blowin fit ter snow out there he agreed i reckon as itll freeze by dark even the ratsll ave more sense than ter be out then got a lot ave yer he glanced around the kitchen noting the food bins the clean floor the pails of water dont take no bad feelin if you ave rats dint mind it warm and tidy no moren we do bit o spilled flour or crumbs an theyre appy theyre not bad actually she answered i just want the few weve got discouraged he grinned broadly wotd yer like me ter do miss i can sing to em thatd discourage anyone rats a got very good earin alf an hour o me singin me eart out an theyd be beggin fer peace like or not most of emd be in the next street an yer staff wif em hester smiled at him if that were sufficient mr sutton i could do that myself my mother always said i could make money singingtheyd pay me to move on i thought all young ladies could sing he looked at her curiously most of us can she answered taking a loaf of bread out of the bin and picking up the serrated knife of those of us who cant some have the sense not to try some havent i have so i still need your help with the rats would you like some lunch yeah thatd be nice o yer he accepted the invitation sitting down at the scrubbed wooden table and motioning the dog to sit also she toasted some of the bread holding it up to the open stove piece by piece on the threepronged fork then when it was brown passing it over to him to set in the rack then she fetched the butter and cheese and a fresh pot of tea they sat down together in the warm candlelit kitchen and for over half an hour no one interrupted them she liked sutton he had a vast string of tales about his adventures and a dry wit describing people and their reactions to rats it was the first time she had laughed in several days and she felt the knots easing out at the sheer relief of thinking about trivial things that had no relation whatsoever to life and death in portpool lane ill come back this evenin sutton promised picking up the last piece of toast and finishing his third cup of tea ill ave traps an me dog an the lot well get it tidied up for yeron the ouse like on the house she questioned he looked very slightly selfconscious yeah why not yer int got money ter spend gimme the odd cup o tea when im in this part o town an itll do thank you mr sutton she accepted that is very generous of you im glad yer don stand on no pride he looked relieved daft it is when yer can do some real good an i reckon yer does he stood up and straightened his coat it was actually rather smart ill see yer about dark good day miss ester he motioned to the dog cmon snoot good day mr sutton she replied she and the others took around bread gruel beef teawhatever they had that their various patients could consume mercy had peeled and stewed the apples from toddy and that was a very welcome addition at three oclock all seemed quiet hester decided to pay another visit to ruth clark to try to persuade her to remain in the clinic for at least two days longer and get her strength back she was far from well yet and the bitter air outside could give her a relapse that might even be fatal she opened the door and went into the room closing it behind her because she expected an argument and did not wish it to be overheard especially by mercy it might reveal more things about ruths situation and her relationship to clement louvain than mercy would be happy to know nor did hester wish any unkind remarks ruth might make to be overheard ruth was lying down her head lower on the pillows than hester would have left her someone had no doubt been trying to ease her and had not known that it was better for those with congestion of the lungs to be raised she walked over quietly and looked down at the sleeping woman it was a shame to disturb her she was resting in profound peace but she might waken with her lungs choked ruth hester said quietly there was no response her breathing was so much impaired that there was no sound to it at all no laboring ruth she said again this time putting her hand out to touch her through the bedclothes you need to sit up a bit or youll feel worse there was still no response hester felt for the pulse in her neck there was nothing and her skin was quite cool she felt again pushing harder for the pulse ruth had seemed to be recovering she had certainly been quite well enough to quarrel with mercy and with flo again after that but there was definitely no pulse even in the jugular vein and no breath from her nose or lips when hester moved the candle closer then held the back of her polished watch almost touching her ruth clark was dead she straightened up and stood still surprised at how deeply it affected her it was not that she had liked the woman ruth had been graceless arrogant and devoid of any sense of gratitude to those who helped her it was that she had been so intensely alive that one could not forget or ignore her one could not be unaware of her passions the sheer force of her existence now without any warning she had ceased to be why had she died so suddenly without any warning of deterioration was hester at fault had there been something she should have seen and perhaps treated if she had liked ruth more would she have taken better care of her seen the symptoms instead of the abrasive character she looked down at the calm dead face and wondered what she had been like before she became ill when she was happy and believed she was loved or at least wanted had she been kinder then and warm a gentler woman than she had been at the clinic how many people could keep the best of themselves if they had been rejected as she had she reached forward to fold the hands in some kind of repose it was a small act of decency as if someone cared it was only when she touched the fingers that she felt the torn nails and she picked up the candle again to look more closely then she set it on the table and examined the other hand those nails were torn also they were new tears because the ragged pieces were still there the other nails were perfect those of a woman who cares for her hands unease rippled through her not quite fear yet she looked at the face again there was a slight trickle of blood on her lower lip only the faintest smear and a trace of mucus on her nose with the fever and chest congestion she had had that was hardly surprising could she have choked somehow she parted the lips slightly and saw the bitten flesh inside as if it had been pressed close and hard on her teeth now the fear was real it needed disproving she seized the pillow and jerked it out from under ruths head clean she turned it over there on the underside was blood and mucus slowly she forced herself to open the eyelids one at a time and look the tiny pinpoints of blood were there too the little hemorrhages that turned her stomach sick with misery and fear ruth clark had been suffocated the pillow swift and tight over her face with someones weight pressing down on it who and for heavens sake why there had been quarrels but they were trivial stupid why murder she backed away slowly and closed the door leaning against it as if she needed it to hold her up what should she do call the police if she did that they would almost certainly suspect flo because ruth had accused her of being a thief but mercy louvain had quarreled with ruth too and so had claudine burroughs that was no proof of anything except that ruth was a very difficult and ungrateful woman would they close the clinic what would happen to the sick women then it was exactly the sort of thing the authorities would use as an excuse to finish all their work here but even if somehow she could persuade them not to who would come here after this a place where sick helpless women were murdered in their beds word would spread like fire vicious and frightening destroying causing panic if only monk were not busy now with a case he had to solve he could have come in so discreetly that no one but margaret need have known but margaret was not here right now there was no use asking bessie she would have no idea what to do and only be frightened to no purpose hester could not trust squeaky he was helpful as long as it suited him and he had no real alternative but he might see this as the perfect opportunity to win his brothel back and catch her as neatly as she had caught him could he have killed ruth for that noit was absurd she was losing all sense sutton was coming back he would understand the problem he might even have some way to help first it would be a good thing if she were to find out all she could there might be something here to tell her who was last in the room people made beds in different ways folded sheets or tidied things even arranged a sick persons clothes and she should prepare ruth for burial should she inform clement louvain mercy could surely get a message to him how would mercy feel hester must be careful what she told the other women and how she worded it she straightened up and walked back to the bed again was there anything at all that observation could tell her the bedding was rumpled but then ruth had done that herself most of the time when she was feverish it meant nothing she looked around the floor and at the way the corners of the sheets were tucked in at the foot it looked tight folded left over right bessies work probably she examined everything else she could think of the cup of water was on a small square of cardboard the way claudine left it so as not to make a ring mark on the wood of the table flo would not have thought of that it all told her nothing she should wash the body and prepare it for the undertaker perhaps she should tell clement louvain ruths family might wish to bury her and he would know who they were she went downstairs and fetched a bowl of water it did not matter that it was barely warm ruth would not mind it was just a case of cleaning and making her decent a gesture of humanity she did it alone there was no need to involve anyone else and she had not yet decided what to say carefully she folded back the bedcovers and took off ruths nightgown it was an awkward job perhaps she should have asked someone to help after all it would not have distressed bessie she had washed other dead women with pity and decency but no fear ruth had had a handsome body a little shrunken in illness now but it was easy enough to see how she had been she was still firm and shapely except for an odd dark shadow under her right armpit a little like a bruise funny that she had not complained of an injury perhaps it embarrassed her because of where it was there was another one less pronounced on the other side hesters heart lurched inside her and the room seemed to waver she could hardly breathe with her pulse knocking so loudly she was dizzy she moved ruth over a little and saw what she dreaded with fear so overwhelming it made her almost sick it was there another dark swellingwhat any medical book would have called a bubo ruth clark had not had pneumoniashed had the bubonic plague the disease that had killed a quarter of the known world in the middle of the fourteenth century and was known as the black death hester plunged her hands into the water in the bowl and then as quickly snatched them out again her whole body was shaking even her teeth were chattering she must get control of herself she had to make decisions do whatever must be done there was no one else to take over no one to tell her what was right when had the swellings appeared who was the last person to wash her or change her gown it had always been mercy perhaps ruth had refused to let her see or mercy had not known the swellings for what they were and what about all the other women with congestion of the chest did they have bronchitis pneumoniaor were they in the earlier pneumonic stage of the plague and if they did not die of that then would it turn into the true bubonic as well she had no answer she had to assume that it would so no one must leave it would spread like fire in tinder how many people had brought it into the country in one a dozen in weeks it could spread through half of london and into the countryside beyond with modern travel trains the length and breadth of the country it could be in scotland and wales the day after and margaret must not come back heaven knew she would miss margarets help her courage her companionship but no one must come inor go out how would she stop that she would have to have help lots of it but who what if she told the others who were here now and they panicked and left she had no power to hold them what on earth was she to do was there even any point in trying to see that no one else became infected no that was absurd everyone had already been in the room any number of times it was hideously possible that they had caught it and it was too late to help and save anything at least she would prevent anyone else from seeing ruths buboes and understanding what they meant that would stop panic there was one room with a door that locked she must wrap the body tightly in a sheet and get bessie to help her carry it there and lock her in she covered ruths body again binding the sheet to leave nothing showing then went out into the passageway and closed the door she saw flos back as she was about to go downstairs and called to her find bessie and send her up here will you immediately please flo heard the edge in hesters voice summink wrong wi that miserable cow again just do it hesters tone was high and sharp but she could not help it now flo gave a shrug and went off clearly annoyed at being spoken to that way but she must have obeyed because bessie came within three or four minutes ruth clark is dead hester said as soon as bessie was beside her i want you to help me put her body in the end room that has a lock on it so mercy and claudine dont panic at another death so soon i i dont want them running off so say nothing it matters very much bessie frowned yer all right miss ester yer look terrible pale yes thank you just help me get ruth into that room before anyone else knows it was difficult ruth was heavy and still limp it was all they could do not to let her slip through their hands onto the floor however bessie was strong and hester at least had some experience with moving the dead after nearly fifteen minutes of desperate effort they succeeded and bessie promised not to say anything to the others yet at least for the time being hester had a reprieve and she scrubbed out the room with hot water and vinegar all the time knowing it was probably useless at five oclock mercy came to tell her that sutton was back with his dog and traps ohgood hester was overwhelmed with relief are they that bad mercy said with surprise i dont think ive ever seen any there was one little creature in the laundry but i thought it was a mouse baby rat hester said quickly with no idea whether it had been one or not get a nest sometimes ill go and see sutton now thank you and she hurried away leaving mercy on the landing looking startled she found sutton in the kitchen snoot was sitting obediently at his heels his bright little face full of attention waiting to begin his job thank you for coming so promptly hester said straightaway may i show you the laundry where i think they are he sensed something wrong his face puckered in concern yer all right miss yer look rotten poorly yerself yer comin down wi summink ere sit down i can find the rats meself its me job me an snoot erehe gestured to the little dogwe ave all we need i i know you have hester pushed her hand over her brow her head was pounding i need to speak to you i she gulped and swallowed hard feeling her stomach knot sutton took a step toward her wots the matter he said gently wot appened she felt the tears come to her eyes she wanted to laugh and to cry it was so much worse than anything he was imagining she wished passionately that she could tell him some quarrel some domestic tragedy or fear anything but what was the truth downstairs she said in the laundry please if yer want he conceded puzzled now and worried cmon snoot hester led the way to the laundry sutton and the dog behind her she asked him to close the door and he obeyed she left the one candle burning and sat down on the single hardbacked chair because she felt her legs weak sutton leaned against the wooden tub his face masklike in the flickering light yer got me scared for yer he said with a frown wot is it wot can be that bad eh telling him was a relief so intense it was almost as if it were a solution one of our patients is dead she said meeting his eyes someone suffocated her his face tightened but there was no horror in it in fact she saw almost an easing of the fear he had expected something worse it appens he pursed his lips yer wanna tell the rozzers or get rid of it quiet i think gettin rid of it quietd be better it int a good thing ter do but avin the place buzzin wi bluebottlesd be worse i could elp yer she would have died anyway she heard her voice wobbling you see that isnt the real problem i mean someone suffocating her gawd then wot is if she were goin ter die anyway he was confused hester took a deep breath i thought she had pneumonia when i came to wash her and prepare her for the undertaker i i discovered what was really wrong with her he frowned wot could be that bad so she got syphilis or summink like that jus keep quiet about it lots o folk do an some as yer wouldnt think were all uman no i wouldnt care if it were that suddenly she wondered if she should tell him what would he do would he panic let everyone know and run out spreading it everywhere would a quarter of england dieagain he saw the terror in her yer better tell me miss ester he said dropping into sudden gentle familiarity she knew of nothing else to do she could not reach monk and certainly not rathbone even callandra was gone plague she whispered for a second there was incomprehension in his face then paralyzing horror jeez yer dont mean he gestured to his chest just by the armpit she nodded buboes the black death sutton what am i going to do she closed her eyes praying please god he would not run away and leave her he leaned against the wooden tub his legs suddenly weak as well his face had lost all its color except a sickly yellow in the candlelight and slowly he slid down until he was sitting on the floor gawd elp us he breathed out well fer a start we int tellin nobody nobody at all then we int lettin nobody out o ere it spreads likehe smiled bitterly his voice catching in his throatlike the plague the tears ran down her face and she took several seconds to control them and to stop her breath from coming in gasps and choking her he was going to help he had said we not you she nodded i want to give her a decent burial but i cant afford to let anyone see her body nothing else causes dark swellings like that anyone would know he rubbed the heel of his hand across his cheek we gotter stop that at any price at all he said hoarsely if folks know thered be some asd mob this place others asd put a torch ter it burn yer down ouse an everyone in it itd be terrible it would be better than having the plague spread throughout london she pointed out miss ester i know ive no intention of being burned alive but how can we keep everyone here how do i stop claudine from going home if she wants to or flo from leaving or anyone who gets better if they do her voice was wavering again how do i get food in or water or coal or anything he said nothing for several seconds hester waited the laundry was strangely silent it smelled of fat and potash and the steam that filled it during the day the one candle with its yellow circle of light made the darkness seem endless we gotta make certain no one leaves sutton said finally i got friends asll elp but it wont be nice he looked at her intently we gotta do it fer real miss ester no one gotta leave no matter wot int no room fer sorry in this if yer right an thats wot she ad then better some dead ere fer tryin

thatll do she nodded would would we really set the dogs on anyone i mean i dont think i yer wont ave ter he answered her ill do it would you she whispered her throat tight we gotter he answered one death quick int that better than lettin it get out she tried to say yes but her mouth was so dry the word was a croak there was a sound outside the door and a moment later it opened mercy louvain stood in the entrance a candlestick in her hand im sorry to interrupt she said a little awkwardly but do you need claudine to stay tonight hester glanced at sutton then back at mercy yes she said hoarsely she swallowed sorry im so tired my voice is going yes please dont let her go home she wont mind i dont think mercy answered are you all right do we have a lot of rats not bad sutton replied climbing to his feet but well get rid of em dont worry i just need ter go an get a few more things done see a couple o friends like then ill be back yer jus get yerselves a cup o tea or summink dont do nothin till i come back that was said firmly like an order no of course not hester agreed well just get everybody supper thank you sutton left and hester did as she had said she would measuring out the food carefully now it was even more precious than before she was conscious that claudine and mercy were both watching her with surprise and a shadow of anxiety she could not afford to say anything to them she was deceiving them by silence but she had no choice she felt guilty angry and above all suffocatingly afraid it seemed like hours until sutton came back hester was in the front room she had given up even pretending that she was not waiting for him everyone else had gone to look after the seriously ill or in bessies case to take a few hours sleep before relieving claudine in the small hours of the morning i got em sutton said simply theyre outside dogs an all i got a sack o potatoes an some bones ill get cabbages an onions an the like from toddy same as usual thank you suddenly she realized what her own imprisonment was going to mean perhaps she would never leave this place worse than anything else at all she would never see monk again there would be no chance for goodbyes or to tell him how he had given passion laughter and joy to her life in his companionship she had become who she was designed to be all the best in her the happiest was made real can you take a letter to my husband so he knows why i dont come home and why he cant come here ill tell im sutton answered and youd better tell margaret miss ballinger too she cant come back anyway we will need her help raising money even more than before make her see that wont you he nodded his face was sad and bleak yer gonna tell em ere she hesitated yer gotta he said simply they cant leave if they try theyll set the dogs on em too that int a death as yerd wish on anyone no i know no you dont miss ester not unless yer seen anyone taken down by dogs ill tell them she stood up slowly and walked over to the door as if she were pushing herself against a tide she reached it and called out into the passage beyond claudine mercy flo someone please waken bessie as well and squeaky i need you all in here im sorry but you have to come it was ten minutes before they were all there bessie still dazed with sleep it was mercy who first realized something terrible had happened she sat down hard on one of the chairs her face white she looked as if she had not eaten or slept properly in days what is it she said quietly there was no point in stretching out the fear which already sat thick and heavy in the room ruth clark is dead hester said looking at the incomprehension in their faces they saw nothing beyond a small loss in the midst of others most of them had not liked her hester drew in a shivering breath she did not die of pneumonia she died of plague she watched their faces one of them knew that was a lie had that person any idea at all of the deeper infinitely more terrible truth than murder she saw nothing except the slow struggle to understand to grasp the enormity and the true horror of it plague claudine said in bewilderment what sort of plague what do you mean what the ell are you talking about squeaky demanded bubonic plague hester replied in some cases it starts as pneumonic congestion in the chest some people recover not many some die with it in that stage in others it goes on to the bubonicswellings in the armpits and the groin that go black we call it the black death flo stood motionless her mouth open squeaky turned white as a sheet claudine fainted mercy caught her and pushed her head between her knees holding her until she struggled back to consciousness gasping and choking bessie sat blinking her breath rasping in her throat no one can leave in case we carry it out of here to the rest of london hester went on no one at all at any time or for any reason sutton has already arranged for friends of his with pit bull terriers to patrol outside if anyone leaves they will set the dogs on them please believe that they will really do that whatever happens we cannot allow the disease to spread in the fourteenth century it killed nearly half of europeman woman and child it changed the world our few lives are nothing we must stop that from happening again ow are we gonna live squeaky asked furiously as if it were some kind of reason to deny it all other people will bring us food water and coal hester replied they will leave them outside and we will go and fetch them we will never meet we have told them its cholera and they must never ever think differently mercy rubbed her hands up over her face sweeping her hair back if anyone outside gets to know theyll burn the place down flo finished for her mrs monks right we gotta keep it a secret from everyone its the only chance we gotgod elp us oh gawd bessie said rocking back and forth in her chair oh gawd i never thought of praying claudine said with wry bitterness but i suppose thats all we have hester looked across at sutton he was the only other person apart from herself and one more who knew that they also had a murderer in the house nine monk was sitting at home building up the fire to try to create in the house the warmth that was gone from it because hester was devoting so much time to the clinic her absence robbed him of a great deal of the pleasure he would have felt had he been able to share his triumph with her he had been extraordinarily successful he had pulled off a master stroke retrieving the ivory and getting it to louvain right under the noses of the thievesand of culpepper for whom it was taken and even of the river police louvain had paid him handsomely and his reputation was now high other jobs would come from it but there was no one to tell he was not finished he still needed to find out who had killed hodge it might have been goulds partner but that was likely only if he had gone on board after gould found hodge stirring and killed him that would have been a result of panic and completely unnecessaryunless the man was someone paid by louvain and thus had betrayed him louvain would exact a bitter vengeance for that and it would explain why hodge had been killed and not merely knocked senseless and then there was the other possibility that hodge had been killed by a member of the crew in some personal quarrel that had nothing to do with the theft if he found out who goulds partner had been it might be possible to prove whether he had ever come on board the maude idris gould should be able to remember his own actions which would at least help tusks were difficult things to handle he would surely know where his partner had been one could not pass anyone on the gangway to the hold without knowing the difficulty would be in making sure he was honest on the other hand he must have walked close to hodges body every time he carried ivory up or went back down for more louvain would not like it he might even try to block him but monk had taken care of that he had no intention of allowing hodges murderer to escape he had never known hodge and might well have disliked him if he had but that was irrelevant the less anyone else cared the more it mattered that he was given some kind of justice monk was sitting by the fire getting too hot but barely noticing it when he realized there was someone knocking on the door it could not be hester she had a key was it a new client he could not accept one unless he or she was prepared to wait he stood up and went to answer the man on the step was lean and quite smartly dressed but his shoes were worn his wry intelligent face was lined with weariness and there was a small brownandwhite terrier at his feet monk would be sorry to have to refuse him mr william monk the man enquired yes i have a message for yer sir may i come in monk was puzzled and already concerned who would send him a message in this fashion what is it he said a little sharply a message from whom from mrs monk can i come in there was an odd dignity to the man a confidence despite his obvious lack of education monk opened the door and stepped back to allow him to walk past into the warmth followed by the dog then he closed the door and swung around to face him what is it now his voice was sharp the edge of fear audible why would hester send a message through a man like this why not a note if she was delayed and wanted to tell him who are you he demanded sutton the man replied im a rat catcher ive knowd mrs monk awhile now what did she say monk cut across him is she all right yeah shes all right sutton said gravely though shes workin too ard like most times monk looked at him there was nothing in the mans face or his demeanor to ease monks growing alarm wot i got ter tell yer int a few moments worth sutton went on so yerd best sit down an listen there int nothing yer can do ceptin keep yer ead and then old yer tongue monk suddenly found his legs were weak and he felt a rush of panic well up inside him he was glad to sit down sutton sat in the other chair thank yer he said as if monk had invited him he did not tease out the suspense one o the women wot was brought inter the clinic died today when miss ester come ter wash er fer the undertaker she seed what she really died of which werent pneumonia like she thought he stopped his eyes shadowed his face intensely serious monk leapt to the conclusion that was most familiar to him murdered he leaned forward to stand up he should go there immediately helping gould would have to wait he could afford a few days sit down mr monk sutton said in a low very clear voice the trouble int nothin ter do wi murder its far more orrible than that an yer gotta act right or yer could bring down a disaster like the world int seen in five undred years what the hell are you talking about monk demanded was the man mad he looked perfectly sane the gravity in him was saner than in a score of men who governed the fates of businesses and societies what is it plague sutton answered his eyes fixed on monk not yer cholera or yer pox or any o them diseases its the real thingthe black death monk could not grasp what sutton had said it had no reality it was just huge words too big to mean anything thats why nobodys goin in there an nobodys comin out sutton went on quietly they gotta keep it closed no matter wot you did monk said instantly i kept away from miss ester an the woman wot nursed the dead one an i int comin out again arter this im still going in monk insisted hester was there without him she was facing something worse than any human nightmare how could he possibly stay out here safe doing nothing shell need help anyway how could you stop people from leaving i mean the sheer practicality you have to tell the authorities get doctors there int nothin a doctor can do fer the black death sutton sat almost motionless his face was impassive beyond emotion it was as if the horror of it had drained everything out of him if it takes yer it takes yer an if it leaves yer it leaves yer int no use tellin the authorities int nothin they can do an wot dyer thinkd appen then eh the hideousness of it was very slowly becoming real in his mind monk could see exactly what this strange composed man was saying how will you stop people from leaving he asked dogs sutton said with a slight movement of his shoulders i got friends with pit bulls theyre guardin all the outsides i ope nobody runs fer it but so elp me theyll set the dogs on em if they do better one torn ter bits than lettin er spread it over all the land all over the world mebbe what if they tell people we told em its cholera an they don know different monk tried not to think of what his own words meant i must still go and help i cant leave her alone there i wont yer gotter sutton began i wont come out again suttons face softened i know yer wont not as id let yer any road but yer can be more elp out ere theres things as need doin getting food coal medicine i know that anyone can do those things course they can sutton agreed an ill see as they do but int yer thought where the plague come from whered that poor woman get it then monk felt the sweat break out on his skin we gotter find out sutton said wearily an there int nobody else as can do that without settin the ole o london on fire wi terror she come from somewhere poor creature whered she get it eh oo else as it yere a man as knows ow ter ask questions an get answers as other people cant miss ester says as yer the cleverest man an the cussedest as she ever met she right monk buried his head in his hands his mind whirling ideas beating against him bruising in their violence hester was alone in the clinic with the most terrible disease ever known to man he would never see her again he could do nothing to help her he could not even remember now what were the last words they had said to each other did she know how much he loved her as his wife his friend the one person without whom he had no purpose and no joy the one whose belief in him made everything matter whose approval was a reward in itself whose happiness created his and the whole of europe could be decimated with disease corpses everywhere the land itself rotting history books told how the whole world had changed the old way of life had perished and a new order had been madeit had had to be is she right sutton asked again monk lifted his head did sutton know that in those words he had made it impossible for monk to refuse yes almost certainly he did yes he answered what do you know about the woman who died er name were ruth clark an she were brung in by a shipowner called louvain e said she were the mistress of a friend of is which is mebbe true an mebbe not louvain monks body froze his mind whirling yeah sutton stood up i ave ter go i cant see yer again yer just gotta do yer best he seemed about to add something but could not think of words to convey it i know monk said quickly tell hester dont matter now sutton replied simply if she dont know it words int gonna elp find where it come from an do it soft likevery very soft i understand monk rose to his feet also surprised that the room did not sway around him he followed sutton and his dog to the door goodbye sutton went out into the street rain drifting in the lamplight and glistening on the pavement good night he replied then turned and walked with a peculiar ease almost a grace of step into the darkness the dog still at his heels monk closed the door and went back into the room it seemed airless and unnaturally silent he sat down very slowly his body was shaking he must control his thoughts thought was the only way of keeping command of himself ruth clark had died of plague clement louvain had brought her to the clinic where from who was she he had said she was the castoff mistress of a friend was that true was she his own mistress he knew she was ill but had he any idea with what where had she contracted a disease like that not in london the maude idris had just come back from africa had she come on it was that how the plague had got here did louvain know that or guess and he had taken her to hester for a moment red fury swept over monk so it almost blinded him his body trembled and his nails dug into the flesh of his hands till they drew blood he must control himself he had no idea whether louvain had known what was wrong with her why should he the woman was sick that was all hester had known and hester was a nurse who had cared for her day and night he started to walk back and forth should he go to louvain and tell him should he at least tell him that ruth was dead if louvain had known she had the plague he would be expecting it would he panic now might he cause the very terror they were afraid of but then if he had not known and she had been his mistress would he be distressed hardly or he would have gotten a nurse in to care for her not sent her to a clinic for street women to be looked after by strangers far better to keep her death silent let him find out in time then another thought struck him what if gould had been telling the exact truth and hodge had been dead without a mark on him except the slight bruises of a fall and his head had been beaten in afterwards because he had died of plague was it not a murder but the concealment of a death which could end up killing half the world half the world wasnt that a ridiculous exaggeration nightmare hysteria rather than reality what did the history books say back in england had been a rural community ignorant and isolated compared with today if people traveled at all it was by foot or on horseback knowledge of medicine was rudimentary and filled with superstition he strode back and forth trying to picture it he could not make himself sit down or concentrate his mind in linear reasoning it had been a barbarous time who had been on the throne one of the plantagenet kings long before the renaissance it was a hundred and fifty years before they had even learned that the world was round there were still forests over england with wild animals nobody would have conceived of such a thing as a train they burned witches at the stake and yet the plague had spread like a stench on the wind how much farther would it spread now when a man could ride from the south coast of england all the way to scotland in a day london was the largest city in the world crammed cheek by jowl with close to five million people he had heard someone say recently that there were more scots in london than in edinburgh and more irish than in dublin and more roman catholics than in rome london would become a wasteland of the dead and dying disease spreading ever outward until it polluted the whole country it needed only one ship leaving the shores with a sick man and it would destroy europe as well he had only one choice he had no power to investigate hodges death or to question anyone he must find durban and tell him the whole truth there was time to pay the price of that afterwards all that mattered now was to trace the disease and anyone who might carry it he slept fitfully and woke confused and heavyheaded wondering what was wrong then the hideousness of the memory returned filling him like darkness till he hardly knew how to bear it he lay frozen as if time were suspended until finally intelligence told him the only way to survive was to do something action would drive the horror back and leave free a fraction of his mind in which he could live at least until exhaustion made him too weak to resist he dressed quickly with as many clothes as he could knowing that he would almost certainly spend most of the day on the river then he went out and bought hot tea and a sandwich from a street peddler he had turned over a dozen different ways to tell durban the truth but there was no good way to say any of this and it hardly mattered how he expressed it all personal needs and cares vanished in the enormity of this new terrible truth that swallowed everything else it was a sharp glittering day just above freezing but feeling far colder because of the wind that scythed in off the shifting brilliant surface of the water gulls wheeled overhead flashing white against the sky and the incoming tide slurped on the wood of piers and the wet stone of steps the river was busy this morning everywhere monk looked there were men lifting wheeling staggering under the weight of sacks and bales their shouts were carried by the wind and blown away canvas flapped loose and banged against boards in the clear air he could see as far as the river bends in both directions and every mast spar and line of rigging was sharp as an etching on the sky only in the distance above the city was there a thin pall of smoke durban was not at the police station the sergeant informed monk that he was already out on the water probably south but he didnt know monk thanked him and went out immediately there was nothing to do but find a boat and go to look for him he could not afford to wait a few minutes later he was down by the water again scanning the river urgently for a ferry willing to take him on a search at first he barely noticed the voice calling him and only when his sleeve was plucked did he turn yall right then scuff said in an elaborately casual manner but his eyes were screwed up and there was an edge of anxiety to his tone monk forced himself to be gentler than he felt yes the man with the ivory was very happy paid yer scuff asked for the true measure of success oh yes then why dyer look like e dint now there was real concern in his face its not money someone who might be sick do you know mr durban of the river police monk asked im wi the gray air walks like a sailor course i do why i need to speak to him urgently ill find im for yer scuff put two fingers in his mouth and let out a piercing whistle then walked over to the edge and repeated it within two minutes there was a boat at the steps after a hurried conversation scuff scrambled in and beckoned for monk to follow monk did not want the child with him what he had to do was going to be awkward and unpleasant possibly even dangerous and he certainly could not afford to have scuff learn the truth cmon then scuff said sharply his face wrinkled in puzzlement yint gonner find im standin there monk dropped down into the boat thank you he said politely but his voice was rough as if he were trembling i dont need you to come go back to your own work he was uncertain whether to offer him money or not he might see it as an insult to friendship scuff pulled a face if yer avent noticed the tides up like i said yer shouldnt be out by yerself yer int fit he sat down in the stern a selfappointed guardian for someone he obviously felt to be in need of one word is es gorn down debtford creek way the boatman said pleasantly bin a bit o trouble that way yesterday yer wanna go or not monk accepted if he put scuff ashore against his will he would lose the boatmans respect possibly even his cooperation yes as quick as you can please they pulled out onto the main stream of traffic and went south along limehouse reach weaving in and out of strings of barges moored ships waiting to unload their cargoes and a few still seeking anchorage it took them nearly three quarters of an hour but finally monk recognized durbans figure on the quayside above a flight of steps near debtford creek then he saw the police boat on the water just below with two men at the oars and orme standing in the stern over there monk told his own boatman the raw edge to his voice gave it all the urgency he needed how much a shilling the boatman replied instantly monk fished a shilling and threepence out of his pocket and as soon as they pulled in to the steps he passed it over and stood up scuff stood up also no monk swung around all but losing his balance ill be all right now yer might need me scuff argued i can do things there was no time to explain or be gentle i know ill find you when i have something for you to do for now keep out of the rozzers way scuff sank back reluctantly and monk leapt for the step and went on up without looking back durban turned around just as monk reached the top he was about to speak when he saw monks face instead he looked at the other man a sullen weary creature with one shoulder higher than the other do it again an ill have you now get gone the man obeyed with alacrity leaving monk and durban alone at the top of the steps in the wind what is it durban asked you look like youve seen hell not yet but that could be truer than you think monk said with bitter humor how could he laugh at anything now except insane as it seemed perhaps it was the only sanity left i need to talk to you alone and its more important than anything else at all durban drew in his breath possibly to tell him not to exaggerate and then let it out again what is it if youre going to tell me you were lying about the ivory and that goulds innocent of the murder of hodge i already know the first and i might believe the second with proof do you have any maybe telling the truth was going to be less difficult than monk had thought and facing durbans contempt was going to be more already guilt was eating him inside it might be proof but that isnt what matters he replied its not quick or easy to tell durban stood motionless waiting his hands in his pockets he did not ask or prompt somehow that made it harder there were fourteen tusks originally monk began i found all of them on jacobs island and hid one as proof an gave the rest to louvain which i presume is what you were hired for durban nodded monk had no time to indulge in excuses he was conscious of the other police in the boat a few yards away and that any moment orme might come up to see what was the matter i saw hodges body when louvain first told me about the robbery monk answered it was my condition for doing the job that i found whoever killed him and handed them to you i only looked at the back of his head nothing else durbans eyebrows rose questioning what any of this mattered there was no open contempt in his face but it lay only just beneath the surface does this matter mr monk his head was beaten in what did you see that proves goulds innocence or anyone elses monk was losing control of the story orme was out of the boat and on the steps and any patience durban might have had was slipping away for the first time since he had resigned from the police in fury he felt grubby for treating crime as a way of earning a living rather than a matter of the law that was unfair he solved the crimes other law officers did not and he wanted to show durban that but there was no time and no reason except pride my wife nursed in the crimea he said roughly now she runs a clinic for sick and injured prostitutes in portpool lane he saw durbans contempt deepening it was difficult not to reach out a hand and physically hold him from turning away a few days ago clement louvain brought a woman to her who was very ill it looked like pneumonia yesterday afternoon she died durban was watching him closely now but his face was still full of skepticism he did not interrupt when hester came to wash her body for the undertakermonk found his breath rasping in his throat please god orme stay out of earshotshe found what she had really died of he swallowed hard and nearly choked would durban realize the shattering enormity of what he said would he understand durban was waiting his brows puckered he lifted a hand in a gesture to stop orme who was halfway up the steps it was senseless to prevaricate if monk was not doing this the right way it was too late to do it better now plague he whispered even though the wind was carrying his words to durban not to orme i mean bubonic plaguethe black death durban started to speak and then changed his mind he stood perfectly motionless even though the wind was now cutting them both like ice on the skin the air was still bright around them the gulls circled above the strings of barges moved slowly past on the tide going up to the pool plague his voice was hoarse monk nodded the rat catcher sutton told me last night late he came to my house and hell tell margaret ballinger who works at the clinic too but no one else if he did thered be panic people might even try to burn them out durban ran his hand over his face suddenly he was so pale his skin looked almost gray we cant let them out i know monk said softly sutton already has friends patrolling all the ways in or out with pit bulls theyll take anyone down who tries to leave durban rubbed the heel of his hand over his face again oh god he whispered who no one monk replied weve got to deal with it ourselves margaret ballinger will do all she can outsidegetting food water coal and medicine to them leaving it somewhere they can pick it up after dark at least at this time of year the nights are long and portpool lanes well lit hester and the women already there will nurse the sick as long as he could not bring himself to say the rest even though the words beat in his head as long as they live durban did not say anything but his eyes were filled with a terrible drowning pity monk swallowed down the terror inside himself fear not of the disease but of losing everything he loved we have to find where it came from he went on his voice almost steady now we dont have the plague in england the maude idris which the ivory came in on has just returned from africa it is louvains ship louvain took ruth clark to the clinic yes i see durban answered she probably came off the ship maybe hodge knew that in which case his death could have more to do with plague than with theft either way we have to know god in heaven once plague gets hold it could sweep the country the question is who on the maude idris knows and what about louvain i dont know that monk admitted i i promised gould id do what i could to see he didnt hang if he was innocent of hodges death hang durban said with dawning disbelief great god man if what you say is true the whole world could die in a far worse way than hangingwhich is brutal but its quick whats one man compared with that we arent going to let that happen monk replied between his teeth his voice uneven because his body was beginning to shake hester will stay locked in the clinic with them no one will ever come out except after its all over if theres anyone left alive the world will go on exactly as if nothing had ever happened and justice will still matter the wash of a string of barges slapped against the stones you and i will be the only ones concerned with goulds life or death or know anything about it monk went on do we hang an innocent man if we do that because were frightened sick then why not two or ten or a hundred how many innocent men are worth trying to save he could hear the sharp anger in his words and he knew it was relief because this was something bearable to think about something they could address we have to know the truth anyway durban nodded very slowly his face bleak then he walked to the top of the steps and spoke to orme monk could not hear what he said but he saw orme acknowledge it frowning in concern then go back down towards the other men in the boat durban came back who did louvain say the dead woman was he asked the castoff mistress of a friend monk replied is it true durban looked sideways at him ive no idea might be or she could have been his own mistress do you think he knew what was wrong with her if she was the first one hed seen no when hester took her in she thought it was pneumonia pneumonia kills durban pointed out i know it does its still better than the plague dont keep saying that word durban snapped in fact dont ever say it again monk ignored the stricture on the other hand if someone had died of it on his ship he may well have known he went on but if it happened at sea and the crew buried him over the side he might and he might not similarly if thats what hodge died of durban stared at monk what are you saying hodge was in the pneumonic stage an someone killed him to stop him from going ashore or that he died of it an they couldnt dispose of the body at sea because they were here on the river an they bashed his head so no one would look too closely at the rest of the body probably the second monk replied louvain could be innocent or guilty of knowing what happened we have to find out whose mistress she was durbans voice was urgent edged with fear whoever he is he could have it too but worse than that what about the rest of the crew louvain told me that he paid off three and there are three men left now hodge is dead youll have to have a boat of men to keep them there shoot them if you have to monk answered theres not much point in sending a doctor to them theres no cure we cant let them unload either durban said thoughtfully the muscles in his face tightened his mouth pulling into a thin line i hate lying to my men but i cant tell them the truth there was a question in his eyes no more than a flicker as if he still hoped there was another answer and monk would give it to him sutton told his men it was cholera monk replied maybe thats what the crew think it is as well durban nodded slowly then wed best be about it weve no time to waste he started for the steps again and led the way down monk on his heels orme was waiting he regarded monk with patient curiosity but little liking he did not know what to make of him but he was suspicious durban did not prevaricate the maude idris has cholera he stated quietly his voice without a tremor as if it were the exact truth he was telling them we must stop them from unloading or anyone at all from coming ashore until theyre cleared of quarantine doesnt matter what you have to do shoot them if it comes to that but it shouldnt itll be easy enough to see they dont get a wharf ill do that were going there now once to warn them after that keep your distanceget that yes sir they spoke as one man youll get a reliefeight hours on eight hours off dont let anything distract you keeping the disease in is the most important if you doubt it just think of your families durban went on now lets get back upriver and do it he took his place in the boat and motioned monk to follow him and almost immediately the oarsmen bent their shoulders and dug the blades deep durban did not speak again but the other men had an obvious camaraderie jokes and goodnatured insults we swapped all the way but when the maude idris was in sight suddenly their concentration was complete as if they were already in the presence of illness they came alongside and orme hailed her newbolts shaven head appeared over the rail river police orme called back and the rope ladder came over a moment or two later durban glanced at monk then went up it hand over hand monk followed and heard orme come up behind him newbolt stood on the deck waiting for them a heavy coat made him look even more massive but he was bareheaded and had no gloves on his hands wot dyer want this time he said expressionlessly he offered no excuse or explanation and monks judgment of his intelligence was immediately revised possibly of his knowledge as well it was those who talked too much who gave themselves away durban stood motionless on the deck balancing to the ships slight sway with an innate grace how many are on board he asked three newbolt replied he seemed about to add something then changed his mind that was the moment monk decided he knew the truth he glanced at durban to see if he had understood the same thing but durban had not moved his eyes from newbolt three durban repeated that would have been four with hodge right whats your full crew nine four men paid off downriver dont need seven ter watch er ere he did not refer to the fact that the ivory had still been stolen or hodge met his death or how that had happened nor did he ask why durban wanted to know it was already a battle of wills undeclared but intensely real who were the three paid off durban asked captain cook an cabin boy newbolt answered without hesitation names durban specified stope carter an briggs newbolt said again he did not ask why durban might want to know whered they go ashore gravesend it was durban who hesitated do you know their first names no newbolt did not blink nor did he turn as the lean man with the scar came up through the hatchway from below theres me an atkinson an mckeever ere durban reached a decision we need to contact your captain newbolt shrugged durban looked beyond him to atkinson was stope your captain yeah atkinson replied e went ashore at gravesend could be anyplace by now did he ever say where he lived no newbolt cut across captains don talk ter the likes o us captains ter give orders an the other men durban persisted dunno newbolt replied if they said i don member most likely got no special ome at sea most o the time thought bein river plice an all yerd a knowd that captains have homes durban replied sometimes wives and families wheres mckeever below newbolt answered e int feelin good mebbe we should a let im go an kept the cook he grinned mirthlessly durbans face lightened ill need to see him he looked at atkinson take me below monk moved forward to stop him and durban snapped at him to stay where he was atkinson glanced at newbolt then obeyed monk orme and newbolt remained on deck no one spoke boats passed them gulls circled overhead they could hear the shouts of men working on the shore the tide was receding moving more and more rapidly past them carrying flotsam and refuse out the mudlarks were beginning to scavenge on the banks orme looked at monk with suspicion then away again finally durban came back up through the hatchway atkinson immediately behind him he walked over to monk with his slightly rolling gait his face pale not much to see he said briefly we could have a long search ahead of us still then he turned to newbolt youll be told when theres a berth for you stay on board till then he did not add any explanation simply signaled to orme and went to the railing monk followed nothing more was said between them until the boat put them ashore and orme and his men returned to keep watch if louvain paid them off at gravesend they could be anywhere durban said grimly weve got a long job he cant have known what it was monk said keeping step with durban as they walked towards the street no sane man would let that loose whatever the profit if it spreads theres nothing for anyone no clippers no cargoes no trade no life louvains a hard man but hes not mad he didnt know durban agreed not at the time of paying them off anyway i agree hes clever brutal at times but he respects the laws of the sea he knows no man wins against nature he wouldnt last long if he didnt and louvains done more than last hes profited built his own empire he came to the curb hesitated and crossed turning south again hed be perfectly happy to get rid of a mistress if she no longer interested him more likely than look after another mans castoff woman but id still wager he didnt know what she had or hed have done something different maybe even kill her and bury her with quicklime monk shuddered at the thought and believed it weve got to find those men i know durban agreed where would they go durban gave him a dry look that was ten days ago where would yer be if yerd been at sea for half a year eat well drink deep and find a woman monk replied unless i had family in which case id go home durbans face pinched tight he nodded something inside him too knotted with anger and grief to speak how do we find out monk went on there was no time for feelings they could come afterwardsif there was an afterwards well get their names durban replied thatll be a start at least then we look for them his face was almost expressionless just a faint almost bruised sadness about his mouth as if he understood the darkness ahead neither of them spoke again as they made their way along the narrow pavement past pawnbrokers shipwrights chandlers ropemakers sailmakers and ironmongersrepresentatives of all the heavy industries of the shore they were forced to stop and wait while a man backed four magnificent shire horses out of a yard with the dray turning a tight corner into the street wheels bumping over the cobbles he did it with intense concentration and care all the while talking to his animals a cooper was complaining bitterly about a barrel not to his liking monk nursed his anger like a small ray of sanity a glimpse of the world that seemed to be slipping out of his grasp no matter how hard he clung to it he was on the edge of an abyss where plague destroyed everything its spread or its containment was all he could think of the cooper lived in a world where one badly made barrel mattered to him monk glanced at durban and saw a reflection of his own thoughts in the policemans eyes it was a moment of perfect understanding then the cart was clear of the gateway and durban strode forward monk on his heels it was tedious finding the information they needed without arousing suspicion or worse than that fear that the police were seeking anyone in connection with a crime a breath of that and not only would the man disappear but no one on the river would help them all doors would be closed durban was endlessly patient sharing a fact here a fact there and it was dusk before they emerged from the last office with all the information they were likely to get the names physical descriptions and what was known of the backgrounds and tastes of the three men they sought they began at gravesend and worked upriver from one public house to another drinking half a pint of ale or eating a pie trying to blend in with the other men talking of ships voyages theyd known or heard of always listening for a name watching for a man who answered any of the descriptions all signs of durbans police status had been removed his hat was stuffed in his pocket and his coat collar turned up and a little lopsided he looked like a ships officer ashore a few months too long they heard nothing of value no one admitted to having seen any of the men from the maude idris the bright hard light faded shortly after five and the sun set in a sea of fire over the water dazzling the eyes till it hurt to look westwards glittering shades of silver and gold edged the ruffles over the surface and marked the wakes of barges monk and durban stopped at another public house for something to eat and were glad of the warmth outside the wind was rising neither of them said anything about the necessity to keep looking even the thought of home and sleep had to be pushed from the mind every hour counted and they had no lead yet they ate in silence glancing at one another every now and then mostly listening watching trying to catch the odd snatch of conversation which might refer to a sailor by name or to someone home from africa and looking for another ship they had been there three quarters of an hour and were getting ready to leave when monk heard a man with a hacking cough and realized that he had also been listening for word of anyone ill or even of a death where do sick men go he asked durban abruptly just as they rose to their feet durban swung around to face him his eyes wide sailors homes the lucky ones dosshouses the othersor worse than that some pick a nethersken on the street monk did not need to ask what a nethersken was he knew the cant names for all the different sorts of cheap lodging anything to be in out of the rain and share the warmth of other bodies however dirty they were or liceridden their shelter might be the difference between survival and freezing to death he made no comment and neither did durban for these few hours or days they were both policemen with a single task their understanding and their unity of purpose formed a bond as deep as brotherhood they moved into the backstreets of the dockside going from one house to another always asking discreetly following any word about a man who might be sick or one who was free with his money they did not mention names they could not afford to alarm anyone lies came as easily and inventively as the need arose by one in the morning they were cold and exhausted and had pursued half a dozen dead ends durban stood in an alley where the wind moaned up the narrow crack between the buildings his face half illuminated by the one lamp on the outside wall of a dosshouse his shoulders were hunched and he was shivering he looked at monk wordlessly one more monk suggested could be lucky someone must have seen them durbans eyes widened a little or we could sleep on it monk smiled durbans face eased his eyes softer for a moment right he straightened up stamping his feet to keep some kind of circulation going and led the way the dosshouse keeper began to refuse them she was a thin angular woman with a tired face and gray hair that was straggling out of an irregular knot then she saw the money monk offered and she changed her mind gotta share she warned but theres clean straw on the floor an yer out o the wind she took the few pence and put it away in a pocket well in the inside of her voluminous skirts then she led them to a small room at the back of the house it was as primitive as she had said and already occupied by two other men but it was tolerably warm monk found himself a place to lie down in the straw bunching some of it together to form a pillow and tried to sleep he was tired enough and his muscles ached from walking the endless alleys in the damp with the wind off the water cutting the flesh but he was too cold and thoughts of his own bed and hester beside himnot only the warmth of her body but the deeper warmth of her thoughts her dreams her whole beingmade this sour room with its restless and hopeless men a unique kind of hell he drifted into a kind of sleep but it did not last long he was too cold and the floor was too hard for him to relax he could not bear to imagine where she was now how much worse it was for her than for him how much greater the danger he lay in the dark listening to the rustle of straw the heavy breathing of the men and forced his mind to think he pieced together everything he knew and tried to make sense of it where would a sailor go ashore they had already tried taverns brothels and dosshouses along this stretch of the river they had found a score of men more or less like the ones from the maude idris but never the right ones was it a hopeless task one only a desperate man or a fool would even try what were the alternatives to alert the police forces everywhere and hunt down the men as if they were murderers on the loose would that catch them or drive them so far underground they would never be found and how many people would they infect in the meantime his thoughts drifted and then suddenly he was awake again he heard the scrape of rats feet and felt his flesh cringe someone in the next room was coughing over and over a raw hacking sound they were looking for someone ill that was how plague started wasnt it in the chest with something like pneumonia he was too cold to move but he should go and see if that was one of the crew or worse than that someone already infected by them he lay shivering muscles locked body curled up until a long spasm of coughing next door made him force himself to roll over and stand up slowly he picked his way to the door through the forms of sleeping men and went out into the narrow passage it was faintly lit by one candle on a shelf so anyone needing to relieve himself would not get lost or fall over and waken everyone else he reached the door of the next room and turned the handle very slowly and pushed it swung wide with a faint creak it took him a moment to accustom his eyes to the deeper gloom then he moved very quietly stepping over and around the sleeping bodies until he came to the one turning restlessly hunching his shoulders over his breath labored monk bent over and touched him the next instant the man lashed out sending monk flying backwards landing hard and awkwardly on a sleeping man behind him who let out a yell of fury it turned into a melee of thrashing arms and legs and cries of thief monk tried to extricate himself but he was one against half a dozen he was generally getting the worst of it failing to explain his motives when a candle appeared in the doorway and he saw durbans face with an expression of exasperation and amusement the next moment the candle was set on a chair and durban plowed into the battle with gusto he worked his way closer to where monk was struggling to avoid being knocked senseless without actually doing the same to anyone else finally monk leaned against the wall trying to catch his breath while the original man with the cough sat doubled over on the floor breathing with difficulty three other men glared at durban who was grinning hugely i only wanted to knowmonk gaspedif any of you are off the maude idris wot dyer come creeping in ere for like a bleedin thief then one of the men demanded i wasnt going to waken anyone monk said thinking reasonably he was greeted by hoots and jeers well have yer he shouted never eard of it another replied course yer ave yer fool the man next to him retorted one o clem louvains ships come back from africa int put ashore yet paid three men off at gravesend durban told him int seen none of em the man shook his head stope carter and briggs monk supplied stope know capn stope but i int seed im in moren a year now can i go back ter sleep again an yer get to ell out of ere monk glanced at the rest of the men but there was nothing in the faces of any of them to indicate guilt recognition or anything beyond weariness and wretchedness yes he said of course he followed durban out picking up the candle as he went by some miracle it was still burning he put it back on the shelf in the passage as he passed it he was beginning to be aware of several bruises and the fact that he was no longer cold durban was laughing to himself he glanced at monk as they reached the door of the room they had come from and in the wavering light from the flame his eyes were bright his expression was as eloquent as a score of words in the morning monk woke stiff and his body ached in every muscle no doubt if he looked he would have blackening bruises all over he glanced across at durban and saw him still smiling he shrugged and winced the whole episode was absurd and they had learned nothing but he still felt a warmth inside him that he had not had before breakfast was porridge and bread only hunger could have driven him to eat it but with daylight they saw their companions in the room more clearly one was a heavyset young man with a sullen face the other was elderly his skin pockmarked he was a great talker and eager to tell anyone about his adventures he had been around cape horn and dined out more than a few times on his memories of the storms off that notorious coast the wild weather waves like moving mountains winds that tore the breath from a mans lungs coasts like nightmares drawn from the landscapes of the moon he had rounded tierra del fuego in the teeth of a gale and that was where a loose halyard had shattered his arm the ships surgeon had cauterized the stump sawing the bone with no more anesthetic than half a bottle of rum and a leather gag to bite on monk watched the mans face and then durbans as he listened he saw many emotions respect for courage awe at the splendor and violence of the sea admiration for the audacity of men who built boats of wood and set out to sail it seemed an impossible hubris although durban would probably not be familiar with the word he certainly understood the concept of mortals daring and defying the gods to snatch glory from the hands of heaven monk saw also a tenderness and willing patience that he guessed some deep meaning lay behind when they left and were back in the street again in a slightly milder morning he asked the question that had taken shape in his mind was your father at sea durban looked at him with surprise then something like pleasure that clear is it monk smiled back just a guess durban kept his eyes ahead now avoiding monks gaze which had proved too keen lost in the irish sea in i can still remember the day they brought us the news his voice was quiet but there was a gentleness and a pain in it he could not disguise i suppose families of seamen always half expect it but when you grow used to the fear without the reality it takes you longer to believe that this time it isnt going to be just a scare its here to stay day in day out he jammed his hands farther into his pockets and walked in silence he expected monk to understand without words and details they went to more dosshouses more street corner peddlers more brothels taverns and pawnbrokers no one could help one even knew the family of the cabin boy and for an hour and a half hope boiled up that they had achieved one breakthrough at last but he was not there nor had his father heard of him since his ship left for africa nearly six months ago they were confused and then worried when durban said that the maude idris had docked and paid off don worry yerself ma his elder brother said gently es a growed lad ell be avin isself a good time ell come ome when es ready ell ave suffink special for yer from africa ill be bound they left somberly with a growing weight of urgency and sadness on them and moved on southwards along the river trafalgar durban said with a ham sandwich and a pint of ale in his hands my grandfather fought there not on the victory but he remembers nelson he smiled a little selfconsciously i wanted to go to sea then monk waited it would be indelicate to ask why he had not the reason might hold any kind of pain he would speak of it if he wanted to then my brothers died of scarlet fever durban said simply so i stayed at home he straightened up and walked back towards the street and the next place to ask monk followed he said nothing durban did not want sympathy or even comment he was simply revealing something of himself it was an act of trust they worked the rest of the day occasionally separately mostly together because this was not an area where a man should have no one guarding his back they did get involved in a brief fight and monk was startled at how hard he struck how instinctively he looked for the crippling blow afterwards he and durban leaned against the alley wall breathing hard and for no reason whatever laughing possibly it was because of the other absurd fight in the dosshouse monk was further bruised and his cheek was cut but extraordinarily the exertion even the physical pain had invigorated him he looked across at durban and saw exactly the same thing mirrored in his eyes durban straightened up and pulled his jacket straight he pushed his fingers through his disheveled hair next one he asked i havent got a better idea monk replied do you think it means were getting closer no durban said honestly they seem to have vanished he did not elaborate his fears that they had taken other ships out straightaway or that they were already dead but the same thoughts raced through monks mind we havent checked the deaths monk said aloud i did durban answered when you were talking to the brothel up in thames street the police have identified everyone that might have been ours how can you know monk challenged because they know the ones they have durban said simply doesnt mean they arent dead though just not found and not buried he looked at monk and his face was rueful cmon lets try the next one ten on the day that monk was visited by sutton margaret was in her bedroom preparing to return to the clinic she meant to give hester at least one nights uninterrupted sleep she was sitting at her dressing table when her mother knocked very briefly and without waiting came in margaret my dear she said closing the door behind her you must not give up hope you know you have a difficult nature and you certainly have an unfortunate tongue but you are not unpleasing to look at and at the moment your reputation is unmarked her tone altered very slightly you are from an acceptable family whose reputation is unblemished just a little care a great deal more discretion about your opinion a degree of becoming meekness and you could be very happy your intelligence does not need to be your undoing although i admit i am worried you seem to have unusually little sense as to when you should display it and concerning what margaret would have liked to pretend that she had no idea what her mother was talking about but since it seemed lady hordern had carried out her threat she could not hope to be believed she could not think of any answer that her mother would like so she said nothing just continued to pin up her hair a trifle crookedly and too tightly at the back she could feel the pins digging into her head she would end up having to take them out again which was a waste of time her mothers voice became sharper i assume from the fact that you are wearing that shabby blue dress again that you are thinking of going to that miserable institution in the slums good works are very worthy margaret but they are no substitute for a social life i would greatly prefer that you did something connected with the church they have lots of suitable endeavors where you could work with people wellbred people whose backgrounds and interests are like your own we are not discussing it margaret thought you are telling me your views as usual but she did not say so we may have backgrounds in common mama but no interests and i am more concerned with where i am going than where i have come from so am i mrs ballinger said tartly meeting her daughters eyes in the mirror and where you are going young lady is onto the shelf if you do not look to your behavior and bring sir oliver to the question very soon he is eminently suitablemost of the time you will not do better and obviously he is very taken with you but it is fast becoming time he declared his intentions and spoke to your father all it requires is for you to spend less time at that wretched clinic and more paying attention to him now take off that unbecoming dress put on something of a nice color and a proper cut for this seasonyour father provides you with sufficient meansand go to some social event where you may be seen she drew in her breath nothing concentrates a mans mind so much as the realization that he is not the only one to appreciate your qualities margaret turned around stung to an anger almost beyond her ability to bite her words back mama oh and there is a most reprehensiblelooking person to see you mrs ballinger went on i have had him wait in mrs timpsons sitting room she was referring to the housekeeper please ask him not to call again i would not have permitted him to remain this time but he insisted he had some kind of message for you from mrs monk i think you should restrict your association with that woman she is not entirely respectable your father agrees with me mr whatever his name is is waiting for you dont detain him i am sure he has drains to clean or something margaret was too aware of acute unease to take the time to respond to that last remark why would hester send anyone with a message unless there were something seriously wrong thank you she said curtly and went out almost at a run leaving her mother standing in the middle of the bedroom she went through the upstairs door to the servants quarters and down the staircase to the housekeepers sitting room she expected to see squeaky robinson there and was startled when the man standing on the mat in front of the fire was not he and yet he was someone she had seen before she simply could not remember when he was lean with squarish shoulders and a very weary face which at this moment looked marked by a deep and irrevocable sadness evenin miss he said as she closed the door behind her i got a message as i gotter tell yer an its fer you an nobdy else no matter wot i admit as id a told yer just wot i as ter but miss ester said as i gotter tell yer the truth an swear yer in gawds name as yerll tell no one else margaret felt a flicker of fear tighten in her throat what is it now she remembered who he was sutton the rat catcher whats happened is hester all right in a manner o speakin yes she is he answered but in another manner nobody int all right i gotter tell yer miss an yer gotter tell no one else or yer could kill em all his eyes were intent on hers and there was a fear in him which now gripped her also so hard she could scarcely draw in her breath what is it i sweari swear anything you like just tell me ruth clark died miss but it werent pneumonia like yer all thought it were the plague the plague margaret said incredulously you mean like london in before the great fire no miss i mean like in the black death wot killed near alf o the world she thought for a hysterical instant that he was making some stupid joke then she saw the truth in his eyes and knew that he meant it the room swam around her before she realized it the chair caught her awkwardly as she fell into it and gripped the arms to keep herself from fainting completely im sorry miss sutton apologized i only told yer cos i ave ter yer cant go back there an miss ester cant come out she lifted up her head and the room steadied dont be absurd ive got to go back in i cant leave hester to cope with that on her own there int no copin miss he said very quietly int much we can do ceptin see as they as food an water coal potash an a spot o brandy an that nobdy else goes in nor guesses why thats about the biggest thing cos if they does sure as night an day someonell stir em up ter go an mob the place an set a light ter it fires bout the only thing ter make sure o the plague an they knows that was the great fire o london as killed the pneumonic in but yer cant set fire ter the ole o england she stared at him wanting to disbelieve trying toand failing yer more use to er outside he said with sudden gentleness shes gonna need all the elp out ere as she can find an there int nobdy but you mr monks got all is work cut out ter find where the plague come from in the first place louvain she said quickly clement louvain brought her in yeah e knows but es gotter do all e can ter find it an stop the others wot got it im goin back in ter elp wi

out i know i know but if they say even they dunno its plague they think its cholera she leaned forward and put her head in her hands it was too big too hideous she had read about the great plague in school but it had been something unreal just a date to memorize like and the battle of hastings or and waterloo it had shaped her country but it had no reality today now suddenly it had she must have courage she must be as brave as hester was and she must do it without leaning on anyone else not even rathbone she lifted her head and looked at sutton of course i shall start raising more money immediatelytonight tell hester i shall do everything i can will you be back no he said simply when yer get money buy wot yer reckon well need an bring it ter the back tell the men oo yer are an theyll take it ter the back door an leave it if theres any message left for yer theyll bring it back so wait for em i understand thank you mr sutton she stood up surprised to find her head clear there was admiration in his eyes yer welcome miss would you like a cup of tea before you leave and something to eat she offered yeah but it int fittin an i int got time but it was a right gracious thing ter ask good night miss and he went to the door and out of it with a weary silent tread and a moment later he was gone margaret went back upstairs slowly holding on to the banister to keep her balance and stopping on the landing as if she were out of breath she was barely aware of her hands and feet and the familiar space with its chinese screen and jardiniere with flowers seemed blurred and far away plague one word with so vast a meaning the whole world was changed was it really the right thing to stay outside as he had told her or should she be there to do the real work above all to support hester so she did not face this horror alone no there was no time for personal need or indulgence they were troops facing an enemy without feeling or discrimination one that could kill every human being in europeor anywhere for that matter the wants or hungers the pain of one individual could not matter she must stay outside and raise money take them supplies keep them from being cut off from all help and she should start now it would be even harder than before because she must watch her tongue all the time she could not even tell rathbone the truth and that silence would cost her dearly but she knew why sutton had asked it she straightened her shoulders and went back to her own room her sister had invited her to go to a betrothal party this evening the motive behind it was the same one as always everybodys mind would be on marriage an odd twisting irony that if rathbone did not love her enough to propose to her accepting her dedication to the clinic as well then she would remain single and make her own way in the best manner she could she would not give up other friendships or freedom of conscience in order to have social status or financial security and she would swallow humble pie this evening and change her mind about the invitation she went downstairs at a run to request her mother to send the footman posthaste with a message to beg marielle to wait for her she would be there as soon as she could dress appropriately and have the carriage convey her her mother was too delighted with victory to question it and obliged with alacrity margaret had dressed with more flair and high fashion than she normally wished to it was not really to her taste this gown in warm pinks with a touch of plum was her mothers choice and it was more dramatic than she cared to be but it would draw attention to her and tonight that was what she needed she acknowledged marielles rather fulsome compliments as graciously as she could and entered the party with her head high and her teeth gritted she was immediately welcomed by her hostess a large lady full of bustling goodwill she had a charming smile and a gown up to the minute in fashion how delightful to see you miss ballinger she said after having welcomed marielle and her husband it has been far too long her wide eyes and the lift of curiosity in her voice made it a question some explanation of her absence was required yes it has margaret agreed forcing herself to smile im afraid i have been involved with work for a charity which has consumed my interest so much i have lost track of time oh good works are most admirable im sure her hostess said quickly but you must not rob us of your company altogether and of course your own welfare must also be considered margaret knew exactly what she meant it was a young womans duty to find a husband for herself and not remain dependent upon her parents i am sure you are right she replied trying to look sweet and agreeable and finding it required more of an effort than she had anticipated and this is such a happy occasion we shall all feel uplifted by it oh yes and her hostess proceeded to sing the praises of her future soninlaw without wishing for any response except perhaps a little envy as soon as she had exhibited all the wishedfor signs margaret excused herself and with marielle moved to the next compatible group of people marielle introduced her with the greatest of ease allowing them to understand that she was unmarried margaret cringed inside knowing she needed marielles help she bore it with grace but great difficulty once or twice it threatened to become unendurable as her mind was filled with a picture of hester with her sleeves rolled up her hair falling out of its pins she could see her face exhausted with days and nights of snatched sleep unable either to save the sick or to run away from the horror and the death even had she wanted to she was trapped perhaps until she too succumbed to the most terrible of diseases she might never leave that place never see monk again or anyone whom she loved what on earth was a little embarrassment to put up with i am sure we have not met before miss ballinger a young man was saying to her he had been introduced as the honorable barker soames he had floppy brown hair and a mildly superior air of good humor his tone invited explanation as to why not his friend sir robert stark was paying only half attention the rest was on a young lady with auburn hair who was pretending not to look at him while adjusting her fan margaret forced herself to pay attention she wanted to dismiss him with a cool remark but her purpose overrode everything else and she bit her tongue we have not she replied with a charming smile i should have recalled it i am always aware of those i have spoken to on serious matters and i cannot imagine you are interested in trivia he was startled it was certainly not the answer he had expected and it took him several seconds to adjust his thoughts why no of course not i i am concerned with all manner of of subjects of gravity gravity was the greatest of virtues and he was as aware of it as she the very mention of it conjured up a picture of the late and still deeply mourned prince albert to be of worth it is absolutely necessary dont you agree she pursued then before he could answer and divert the course of the conversation to something easier she hurried on i have been much involved in raising money to fund medicine for the poor and otherwise disadvantaged we are so incredibly fortunate we have homes food warmth and we have the means to keep ourselves from falling into the spiral of despair he frowned unprepared for the degree of gravity she was touching he had intended theory she was speaking of reality it made him uncomfortable she saw it in his shift of position the way his weight moved backwards a little she could not afford to be sensitive either for him or for herself she gazed very briefly around the room with its bright chattering company the plump arms of the women the pink cheeks and the freshly barbered faces of the men then for an instant she saw it in her mind as it would be if they failed the wasted flesh the fever the despair the sick no one dared go near to nurse the dead no one buried in weeks these people could be so many corpses their laughter silent she forced the image away i admire generosity enormously she went on dont you i see it as a great part of christian duty now was no time to be squeamish about coercion she added the final twist of course within the bounds of what we can afford the last thing i should wish is for anyone to feel they have to give what is beyond their means that would be quite cruel debt must be such a misery the honorable barker soames looked urgently at his friend hoping for rescue however his friend was now giving margaret his full attention and tasting a certain enjoyment in the situation for the sick you say miss ballinger what particular charity would that be one of the african ones i daresay he asked no it is one here at home margaret answered now far more careful she was perfectly happy to bend the truth a littlethe need was desperatebut she did not wish to be caught out for young women and children in the farringdon road area it is a clinic that treats injuries and at the moment is trying to give food and shelter to many struck down with pneumonia it is most kind of you to care sufficiently to take an interest she put a warmth into her voice as if he had already offered a gift sir robert smiled where may we donate miss ballinger would you be able to see that it reached the right people if we gave it to you thank you sir robert she said with relief and a gratitude so deep it lit her face for a moment she was truly beautiful i shall buy the food and coal myself but of course i am more than happy to send you receipts so you know what we have done then please accept five pounds he replied and im sure soames can at least match that cant you he turned to soames who was looking distinctly cornered margaret did not care in the slightest that is very kind of you she said quickly it will do a great deal of good with intense reluctance soames obeyed in a wave of triumph margaret moved on the next encounter did not go as fortunately but by the end of the evening she had elicited promises of a reasonably large sum the following morning she took the money she had gained went to the coal merchant and bought an entire wagonload she went with the delivery man to portpool lane instructing him as he tipped it all down the chute from the street into the cellar she stood in the sharp wind and stared at the walls of the house it was damp and bitterly cold and the air smelled of soot and the sour odor of drains but it was not infected she breathed it in with a sense of guilt hester was only a few yards away behind the blank bricks but it could have been another world she looked up at the windows trying to catch a glimpse of anyone but there was only blurred movement no more than light and shadow the wind stung her cheeks she wanted to shout just to let someone know how much she cared but it would be worse than pointless it could be dangerous slowly she turned away and walked back towards the coalman thank you she said simply ill let you know when they need more next she purchased oatmeal salt two jars of honey a sack of potatoes and several strings of onions and carried them back to give them to one of the men standing discreetly under the eaves in the yard at portpool lane she also went to the butcher and bought as many large bones as he had and carried them back again she gave them to one of the men with the dogs broadchested widejawed creatures with sturdy legs and unblinking eyes in the evening she accepted at ungraciously short notice an invitation to a recital she accompanied a young woman who was more of an acquaintance than a friend along with her parents and brother it was an awkward party but she was only too aware that last nights success might not be repeated for many days and while ten pounds was a great deal of money it had already been used the music was not the kind she particularly cared for and her mind was solely on gaining more support possibly even recruiting someone else to help in the effort she found herself in a series of brief and unsatisfactory conversations and was losing heart for the evening when during the second interval she saw oliver rathbone he was standing at the edge of a group of people in earnest discussion and apparently in the company of a gentleman of portly dimensions with fluffy gray hair but he was looking at margaret she felt a surge of pleasure just seeing his face and knowing that he was as aware of her as she was of him suddenly the lights seemed brighter the room warmer and she looked away smiling to herself and quite deliberately setting about working her way closer to where he was it was another ten minutes before he managed to introduce her to his guest a mr huntley who was both a client and a social acquaintance it was several moments further before mr huntley could be directed to converse with someone else and margaret found herself alone with rathbone he regarded her gown which was cut with ostentatious flattery she saw in his face that he was uncertain whether he cared for it it was uncharacteristic of her and the change disconcerted him you look very well he observed watching her eyes for the meaning behind whatever words she should use to respond she longed to be able to tell him the thoughts and the fears that drove her but she had promised sutton not to rathbone of all people would care about hester it was a sort of lying not to tell him but she was bound i am well she replied meeting his gaze but without inner honesty she had to go on it was not possible to tell how long they would have in which to talk the music would begin again soon huntley might return or any of a dozen other people could interrupt them but i am very exercised at trying to raise sufficient money for the clinic he frowned very slightly does it really need so so much of your time he said the word time but she knew he was thinking of the change in her the singlemindedness that absorbed her now so much that she wore clothes to please society and to be noticed she was at a function she did not care for and he knew she did not the familiar in her was slipping away from him and he was unhappy she ached to be able to tell him why it mattered more than anything else or anyones personal happiness just at the moment it does she answered why what is different from a few days ago he asked how could she answer she had expected the question but she was still unprepared whatever she said it could only be a lie even if she explained to him afterwards would he understand or would he feel that she ought to have trusted him he had been part of everything to do with the clinic even turning the tables on squeaky robinson in order to get the building he was proud of the clinic and what it did he had earned the right to be trusted but she had promised the rat catcher so in effect she had promised hester he was waiting the unease in him growing we are just short of money she answered there are big bills and we have to pay it was an evasion she saw in his face instantly that he knew it she was not good at lying and she had never done it before to him her candor was one of the qualities he loved in her most and she knew it more sharply just as she felt him slip from her he was hurt would she lose him over this she turned away her throat tight and tears prickling her eyes this was ridiculous there was no time for such personal selfpity he started to say something and then changed his mind also she looked back at him waiting there was a sudden hush in the room huntley came back i say sir oliver theyre about to start again do you think we might excuse ourselves before it oh im so sorry misseri didnt mean to he trailed off not knowing how to extricate himself she could at least help him not at all she said she wanted to smile at him but her throat was too tight its a bit tedious isnt it i really think the flute by itself has limited appeal his face flooded with relief he was completely unaware of any other tension thank you so much you are most understanding he turned to rathbone rathbone hesitated please margaret gestured towards the exit so obviously in huntleys thoughts i must return to my hostess or she will begin to realize my lack of enthusiasm rathbone had no choice but to go with huntley leaving margaret hurting as if she had been physically burned rathbone spent a miserable evening and went home as soon as he could excuse himself something had changed in margaret and it disturbed him profoundly he woke up several times during the night puzzled and increasingly unhappy had he been mistaken in her all the time was she not the startlingly honest person he had thought hermore than that he had felt he knew certainly the clinic would have bills but suddenly so many and so large even if that were true it was not at the core of it she was lying he did not know why or exactly about what but the honesty between them was compromised her manner of dress was different bolder more like everyone elses as if she cared what society thought of her and without any explanation she had needed to conform for that matter why had she gone to the recital at all she disliked that type of function as much as he did he was there only because huntley had invited him and it was a politic move that he accept the morning was little better and brought no ease to his mind he went to his office as usual and put aside personal matters with the discipline of concentration he had developed over the years but all the strength of will at his disposal intense as it was could not rid him of his sense of confusion and even of loss it was quite late in the afternoon with the light already fading as rain set in when his clerk came to inform him that mr william monk had called to see him it was on a matter he regarded as so urgent that he refused to be put off by the fact that sir oliver had other commitments for the rest of the day he simply would not leave in fact he would not even be seated rathbone glanced at his watch you had better ask mr styles to wait a moment or two apologize to him and say that an emergency has arisen and send monk in warn him that i have only ten minutes at the most yes sir oliver the clerk said obediently his lips pursed he did not approve of alteration to arrangements particularly those made with clients who paid which he knew that monk did not but he also loved order and obedience was the first rule of his life so he did as he was told the moment monk came in rathbone knew that whatever had brought him was extremely serious he was barely recognizable his usual elegance had vanished he looked more like a man of substance fallen on hard times perhaps sunk to the edges of the criminal world his trousers were shapeless his boots built for endurance rather than grace his jacket such as a laborer might wear and it was definitely soiled and with a tear in the sleeve but all that rathbone noticed at a glance it was monks face that shocked him and held his attention his skin had no color at all beneath the dark stubble of his beard and his eyes were hollow the shadows around them almost like bruises monk closed the door behind himself having already sent the clerk away thank you he said simply rathbone felt a flicker of alarm surely if something had happened to hester margaret would have told him he had seen her only yesterday evening and she had said nothing what is it he asked a little abruptly monk took a deep breath but he did not sit down as if he would find the slightest bodily comfort impossible i had taken a job on the river he began speaking swiftly as if the whole outline of what he was going to say had been rehearsed on october twentyone to be precise it was to find some ivory that had been stolen from the maude idris while she was moored on the river waiting for a wharf at which to unload rathbone was puzzled it was not monks usual type of work it must be a favor he owed or more likely a financial pressure had driven him to accept it why werent the river police involved he asked theyre good and as long as you stay clear of the revenue men for the most part theyre honest get the odd bad one but theyre few and far between a shadow crossed monks eyes the issue that matters is that when the theft was discovered so was the body of the night watchman from the crew with his head beaten in just a minute rathbone interrupted he could feel the tension in monk so powerful it was like a live thing in the air but looking for stolen goods rather than reporting and pursuing murder was so unlike monk he needed to be certain he had grasped the facts truly are you saying the man was killed by the thieves or not was the shipowner trying to conceal it who is he anyway im telling you the facts monk snapped back just listen his voice all but choked on the emotion within him a flicker of selfconsciousness appeared and vanished he did not apologize but it was implicit clement louvain he showed me the body of the man named hodge his skull was stoven in at the back i saw the ledge inside the hold where he was found and there was very little blood i wasnt certain if that was because he had actually been killed on deck and then carried down there but i couldnt find any blood on deck either i was told he had a woollen hat on and that might have absorbed a lot of it monk took a deep breath hodge was buried properly as an accident but the morgue attendant made a record of his injuries and louvain gave me his word in writing which i have that once the ivory was recovered he would see that hodges murderer was caught and tried he just needed to get his money first or he could lose everything rathbone found that impossible to believe why he started monk interrupted his question if his rival buys the clipper coming up for sale then he will be first home in every voyage first home gets the prize second gets the leavings if any i see rathbone was beginning to understand more now he has gone back on it and you want me to pursue it in law the ghost of a smile crossed monks face but so grim it was worse than nothing at all no the alleged murderer is in custody he took me to the ivory and he admits he was the only one to go on board and below deck the other man stayed above and couldnt have killed hodge didnt even know he was there but gould swears he found hodge senseless but unharmed he thought he was just dead drunk i believe him and i promised i would get him the best defense i could rathbone was now deeply troubled monk was the least gullible of men and this story was absurd on the face of it there had to be something else of crucial importance that monk was not telling him why not rathbone leaned back against his desk it was uncomfortable but while monk was standing he did not feel able to sit why do you believe him he asked monk hesitated i cant help you if i dont know the truth rathbone said with an edge that surprised himself something of the darkness inside monk was disturbing him although he had heard nothing yet except the story of a very ordinary robbery and a concealed murder that was itwhy would monk of all men hide a murder in this way the rest of it he demanded for heavens sake monk havent you learned to trust me yet monk flinched you dont know what youre asking now his voice was low his eyes were hollow only horror left rathbone was truly afraid im asking for the truth he felt his throat so tight the words were forced out why do you think this man is innocent nothing youve said so far makes sense of it if he didnt kill hodge who did and why are you saying it was one of the crew or louvain himself he jerked his hands slicing the air why would he why would a shipowner give a damn about one of his crewmen what is it blackmail mutiny something personal what would a shipowner have personal with a seaman im no use to you half blind monk monk stood perfectly still a momentous struggle raging inside him so clearly that rathbone could only stand and watch helpless and with a cold hand tightening inside him the clerk knocked on the door not yet rathbone said tensely monk focused his eyes his face was even whiter than before you must listen he said hoarsely his voice a whisper rathbone felt himself go cold he brushed past monk to the door opened it and called for the clerk the man appeared almost instantly cancel all my appointments for the rest of the day rathbone told him an emergency has arisen apologize and tell them i will see them at their earliest convenience he saw the mans face crease in bewilderment and dismay do it coleridge he ordered tell them i am very sorry but the circumstances are beyond my control and do not interrupt me or come to the door for any reason until i send for you are you all right sir oliver coleridge asked with deep concern yes i am just deliver my message thank you and without waiting he went back into his office and closed the door now he said to monk tell me the truth monk seemed to have ceased struggling with his decision he was even sitting down as if exhaustion had finally taken him over he looked so ashen rathbone was afraid he was ill brandy rathbone offered not yet monk declined this time it was rathbone who could not sit down monk began looking not at rathbone but somewhere in the distance shortly after engaging me louvain took a woman to the clinic in portpool lane i dont know whether he knew of hester from me or if he knew of the clinic before and possibly that was why he hired me rather than someone else dont interrupt me he said the woman was the castoff mistress of a friend which may or may not be true he ran his hand over his face three days ago in the evening a rat catcher called sutton came to me at home with a message from hester at last he looked up at rathbone and the pain in his eyes was frightening the woman ruth clark had died and in dressing her for the undertaker hester discovered buboes in her armpits and groin rathbone had no idea what he was talking about buboes he said black swellings monk answered his voice cracking theyre called buboesthats where we get the word bubonic he stopped abruptly the silence was as dense as fog while very slowly the meaning of what he had said sank into rathbone and filled him with indescribable horror monk was staring at him bubonic rathbone whispered you dont mean he could not say it monk nodded almost imperceptibly but but thats medieval its rathbone stopped again refusing to believe it he could not get his breath his heart was hammering and the room was swaying around him the edges of his vision blurred he reached out his hands to grasp the desk as he overbalanced sideways and sat down hard and awkwardly oblivious of bruising himself you cant have that now this is what do we do how do they treat it who do we tell no one monk said violently he was between rathbone and the door and he looked as if he would physically prevent him from leaving with force if necessary for gods sake rathbone hesters in there if anyone got even an idea of it theyd mob the place and set fire to it theyd be burned alive but we have to tell someone rathbone protested the authorities doctors we cant treat it if no one knows monk leaned forward his voice was shaking there is no treatment either they survive it or they dont all we can do is raise money to buy food coal and medicines for them we have to contain it at any cost at all if we dont if even one person gets out carrying it it will spread throughout london throughout england then the world in the middle ages before the indian empire or the opening up of america it killed twentyfive million people in europe alone imagine what it would do now do you see why we must tell no one it was impossible too hideous for the mind to grasp no one monk repeated they have men with pit bulls patrolling day and night and anyone attempting to leave will be torn to pieces now do you see why i have to find out if the disease came in on the maude idris and if hodge died of the plague and his head was beaten in so no one would think to look for any other cause of death he was buried straightaway i dont know whether louvain knew about him or the clark woman or not i have to find the source i cant let gould be hanged for something he didnt do but not ever even to save his life can i tell what i know do you see rathbone found it almost impossible to move or speak the room seemed to be far away from him as if he were dreaming rather than seeing it monks face was the only steady thing in his sight at once familiar and dreadful seconds ticked by in which he expected at any instant to wake up in a sweat and a tangle of bedclothes it did not happen he heard hooves in the street outside and the hiss of carriage wheels in the rain someone shouted it was all real there was no rescue no escape do you see monk repeated yes rathbone replied at last he was beginning to there was no one to help no one could he frowned nothing they can do doctors even now no what do you want from me he refused to visualize it the reality was more than he could endure he needed to be busy it would excuse him from knowing anything else he would be doing what he could did you say the mans name was gouldthe thief i mean yes hes held at wapping the man in charge is called durban he knows the truth rathbone was jolted the truth you mean he knows whether gould killed hodge or not no he knows how ruth clark died monk said sharply he knows we have to find the rest of the crew from the maude idris he and i have been looking and we havent found any trace of them yet god almighty arent they on the ship rathbone exclaimed no the crew now is only skeleton just four men including hodge they were supposedly enough to guard it until it can come in for unloading monk replied rathbone gulped his heart pounding in his chest then they could be anywhere carrying he could not even say it thats why i havent time to search for the truth to clear gould monk answered still looking at rathbone steadily rathbone started to ask what one man mattered when the whole continent was threatened with extinction and in a manner more hideous than the worst nightmare imaginable then he knew that in its own way it was the shred of sanity they had to cling to it was one thing that perhaps was within their power and in that they could hold on to reason and hope when he spoke his voice was roughedged as if his throat pained him ill do what i can ill go and see him if i cant find out who did kill hodge at least i may be able to raise reasonable doubt but isnt there something else i can do anything monk blinked there was not even the ghost of his usual humor in his face if you believe in any kind of god i mean really believe not as a sunday conformity you could try praying other than that probably nothing if you ask your friends for money for portpool lane and you havent before theyll become suspicious and we cant afford that rathbone froze margaret might go to the clinic he felt the blood draining from his body margaret he whispered she knows monk said very quietly she wont go in rathbone began to see the full horror of it hester was in portpool lane imprisoned beyond all human help monk knew it even as he tried to reassure rathbone about margaret while he himself could do nothing but try to find the rest of the crew rathbone could only try to save one thief from hanging for a murder he probably had not committed and margaret could do no more than struggle to raise from a blind society which could never be told the truth enough money to provide food and heat as long as there were survivors and do it without telling anyone the truthnot even him i understand he said quietly overwhelmed with gratitudeand shame ill give her money myself but ill ask no one else speak to me when you can and if there is anything else i can do tell me he stopped abruptly not knowing how to offer monk money without offending him and yet it was absurd to let a fear of asking stand between them now what is it monk asked rathbone put his hand in his pocket and pulled out six gold sovereigns and small change in silver he passed over the sovereigns in case you need it for transport or anything else i dont imagine louvain is still paying you monk did not argue thank you he said picking up the coins and putting them in the inside pocket of his coat ill tell you what i find if i do if you want me for anything leave a message at the river police station at wapping ill call in there or durban will he stood up slowly as if he were stiff and it hurt to move he smiled very slightly to rob his words of offense nobodys going to pay you for defending hodge rathbone shrugged and did not bother to reply as soon as monk left rathbone poured himself a full glass of brandy then looked at it for a moment seeing the light burn through its golden depths like a topaz in a crystal balloon then he thought of monk going out alone to the dark river and the backstreets where he must look for a ships crew carrying death leaving hester in a place which must surely be as close to hell on earth as was possible and he poured the brandy back into the decanter his shaking hand spilling a little of it he barely spoke to coleridge on the way out only sufficient to be civil to the anxious enquiry for his wellbeing outside on the footpath he hailed the first hansom that passed running out into the street to clamber into it and giving margaret ballingers address he sat down as the cab started forward at last he understood her extraordinary behavior yesterday she had honor she must have been desperate to raise money for hester and of course she could not possibly tell anyone why how farcical like some insane satanic jokeshe was trying to save them all and she could not tell them but why had she not told him if she had sent him some message he would have come immediately and she could have told him somewhere in private his brain was racing skidding off the rails like a highspeed train with a drunken driver no control when had margaret heard the same day as monk or not perhaps she had had no time to tell rathbone perhaps she had not trusted him or was she protecting him from having to know about it why would she do that did she know the horror of disease that rose like a tide inside him drowning reason courage even sense he had never been a moral coward in his life nor a physical one he had faced dangernot willingly but certainly without ever quailing or even imagining running away but disease was different the terror the nausea the delirium the inescapable certainty of death helpless and without dignity why was the hansom taking so long rain was causing traffic congestion as drays hansoms and private carriages all fought for space in the narrow wet streets trying not to bump into each other and tangle or mash wheels and break them in the dark what a relief it would be to see margaret tell her that he knew savor the precious time together before what he went to try to defend monks thief and she toplease god not the clinic no she would not be able to monk had said no one would be let in or out thank heaven for that his body broke out in a sweat of relief he was ashamed of it but it was impossible to deny but hester was in portpool lane alone she had only the street women and bessie to help her and squeaky robinson for whatever that was worthprobably nothing he would be the first to run away and she would have to set the dogs on him rathbone refused to imagine that but she could she would do it she would know what it would mean if he escaped and carried the plague to the rest of london she would have the courage the strength of mind he had never realized what that meant until now he remembered some of their early conversations with a stab of selfdisgust he had condescended to her as if she were a woman finding a secondbest kind of career to fill in the space where her emotional fulfillment ought to have been and she was stronger and better than any other human being he knew if she died in portpool lane she would leave an emptiness in his life that nothing else would ever fill the hansom stopped and he realized with a jolt that he was at margarets home he got out standing in the rain to pay the driver then ran across the footpath and up the stairs to pull the bell at the door the footman answered but regretted to tell him that miss ballinger was out and he could not say when she would return rathbone was bereft what if she had ignored instruction and gone to the clinic after all then she would be in as much danger as hester she would suffer horribly he would never see her again never marry her whatever happened to the rest of london or england his own personal future was suddenly cold and dark how could anyone else compare with her that was a stupid thought there were no comparisons however virtuous gentle funny or clever anyone else might be it was margaret he loved the footman was waiting patiently rathbone thanked him and left back out into the teeming rain and the darkness the hansom had already gone it hardly mattered he would walk home if it took an hour and he was soaked to the skin he would not notice it rathbone could not sleep and in the morning he had his manservant draw him a hot bath but he could not enjoy it by half past eight he was breakfasted and had sent a note to his office to say he would be late then he looked for a hansom to take him back to margarets house he could not even contemplate what he was going to do if she was still not there he could not think of going to the clinic to find her nor could he think of not going he would give her money and then he had to go and find this wretched thief of monks and see what could be done to serve justice at least if anyone had the skill for that it was he the traffic was heavy again it was the time of day when people were going into the city tradesmen were beginning their rounds everybody seemed to be jamming the roads at the first traffic congestion everything came to a standstill two coachmen were arguing over whose fault it was that a horse had tried to bolt and broken his harness rathbone waited a short while then finally paid his own driver and got out to walk it was no more than three quarters of a mile farther and the effort it would take was better than waiting cooped up and sitting this time he was more fortunate the footman informed him that miss ballinger was taking breakfast and he would enquire if she would receive him rathbone paced back and forth in the morning room until the man returned and invited him through rathbone tried to compose himself so as not to embarrass margaret in front of her parents should they be there he followed the footman across the hall and into the long very formal dining room where he was drenched with relief to find her alone she was dressed smartly in a dark suit a little like a riding habit it was fashionable and extremely becoming but she looked alarmingly pale good morning sir oliver she said with some reserve obviously she had not forgotten his coolness of the other evening would you care for a cup of tea or perhaps more toast she invited him no thank you he sat down praying she would give the footman leave to go i have a legal matter i wish to discuss with you of a most confidential nature he could not wait upon good luck really she raised her eyebrows slightly she thanked the footman and asked him to leave she looked guarded withdrawn as if she was afraid he was going to hurt her he found himself ashamed at the thought i know he said simply monk came to see me yesterday afternoon he told me of the situation at portpool lane her eyes widened dark and incredulous he told you she reached out instinctively and grasped his wrist you must say nothing i was sworn to secrecy absolute no exceptions at all it i understand he cut across her monk told me because he needs me to defend a thief he believes him to be innocent of murdering a watchman it is not muchone small act of justice and to a confessed thief at thatbut its all i can do he felt ashamed saying it that and help with funds but he warned me not even to ask friends in case my urgency should cause speculation her face was filled with a relief that set his heart surging the blood pounding in his veins there was a wild almost hysterical gratitude in him that margaret was not in the clinic and could not go anyway she was needed to raise funds to purchase what they needed and take it to them i know she said gently i am having to be so much more discreet than i want to be she met his eyes her own brimming with tears i think of hester in there alone and how she must feel and i want to go to help her i want to tell these people the truth and force them to give all they can every last penny but i know it would only drive them into hystericsat least some of them she was shivering her voice husky fear does terrible things to people anyway i promised sutton which really means hester that i would tell no one i couldnt even tell you i understand he said quickly closing his hand over hers where it lay on his wrist be careful and and when you take food to them leave it dont be dont be tempted to he saw an instant of pity in her eyes not for hester or for the sick but for him because she recognized his horror of disease it chilled him like ice at the heart suddenly he saw that he could lose her not to death but to contempt that awakening of disgust that is the end of love between a woman and a man and becomes the pity that a strong woman has for the weak for children and for the defenseless but never for a lover he looked away i will do what i have to she said quietly i do not intend to go inside the clinic i am more use to them out here but if hester sends for me perhaps because she is dying then i will go i might lose my life too but if i didnt i could lose everything that would make life precious i am sure you know that there was no certainty in her voice or her face she was full of question she needed his answer im sorry he apologized and he meant it with all the force of his nature i know you must it was a moments complete selfishness because i love you she smiled and lowered her eyes as the tears slid down her cheeks you must go and defend this thief if that is what monk requires now i am going to raise some more money we need vegetables and tea and beef if possible he took ten pounds out of his pocket and put it on the table he was giving money away like water thank you she whispered now please go while i can still keep some measure of composure we both have things to do he obeyed his emotions storming inside him his own composure in shreds he was glad to say goodbye and go as rapidly as he could outside into the anonymous street where the sharp wind would sting his face and the rain would hide his tears eleven day and night blurred into one exhausting round for hester there were over a dozen women in the clinic altogether counting herself bessie claudine mercy and flo three had been injured by accident or violence five were suffering fevers and congestion which might be pneumoniaor early stages of plague it was too soon to be certain there had already been two deaths one apparently from heart failure the other from internal bleeding of course to his outrage squeaky robinson could not leave either sutton had chosen to return and work with the little terrier snoot to catch the rats food water and coal were left in the yard and the men with the dogs placed them outside the back door when hester went to retrieve them she caught sight of one of the men standing near the wall half concealed in the shadows his dog at his feet it gave her a feeling of safety and reminded her at the same time that she was as much a prisoner as any of the others mercy helped her carry in the pails of water which were extremely heavy they left two in the kitchen and the other eight along the wall of the laundry were going to have to use the water several times hester said unhappily its not the best but we darent run out with fever like this its more important to drink than to be clean and i dont think we can have both mercy leaned against the washtub into which the mangle drained she looked pale and very tired but she was smiling makes you realize what a blessing it is to have water at home doesnt it ask someone for it and there it is hester looked at her with affection in the few days she had been there hester had grown to like her she still knew very little about her other than that she was clement louvains sister she had a gentleness with the sick an endless patience and in spite of the utterly different world she must be accustomed to she never seemed to patronize peopleunlike claudine whose temper was never far below the surface although hester found she could not dislike claudine either now they worked together piling the soiled sheets into the corner and then mercy tipped more coal from the scuttle into the boiler to heat it up it was an awkward job and she was covered in smuts by the time she had finished she leaned back putting the scuttle down and looked at herself in dismay why on earth do we wear white aprons she said disgustedly whoever thought of that obviously didnt have to do the laundry hester smiled dont worry about it its good clean dirt mercy looked confused for a moment then realized what she meant and relaxed smiling back it was half past nine in the evening and most of the jobs were done for the day insofar as day and night were any different from each other were you really in the crimea mercy asked a little shyly hester was surprised yes most of the time it seems like another world but right now its not so hard to remember she bit her lip a little ruefully there had been far more deaths there they were surrounded by it every day and it had been brutal and terrible largely senseless inflicted by men upon their fellows but there was a vast difference between war and murder even if there had seemed times when it would be difficult to explain it whole hours went by when she completely forgot that ruth clark had been murdered let alone that she should be trying to find out who was responsible did it matter anymorereally she realized with a jolt that she was not even certain that she wanted to know it had to be someone here and she cared for each of them was the bond of fear and survival greater than whatever had driven one of them to kill she did not want to know the answer youve not asked to have any message sent to your family she said to mercy she did not want to intrude mercy had never spoken of her home she had not even said if she knew it was her brother who had brought ruth clark here although hester had assumed that she must have known she seemed to be in her early twenties pleasing to look at and certainly she had an agreeable nature why was she not enjoying the social life her position offered her was there a love affair that had gone so badly for her that she was still too hurt to think of someone new was that why she was here to escape a greater pain hester realized that that was what she had assumed but there was no evidence for it mercy shook her head my brother knows i am here she replied i left him a letter i cannot tell him why i am remaining but he wont worry im sorry hester apologized you must be missing many things you would have attended could you leave no point in thinking about them mercy shrugged and i dont suppose any of them matter anyway one puts on ones best clothes and ones best manners and ends up being so polite that all one ever talks of is the weather or what book one has just readas long as it is not controversial of course heaven protect us from having to think everybody is hoping to meet someone of such interest you can hardly wait to see him again but unless you are terribly easily pleased does it really happen i am in greater danger of making myself believe it has when my better self knows it hasnt she smiled rubbing absentmindedly at the smear of coal dust on her apron i say to myself next timenext time and then its exactly the same at least this is real doesnt your mother insist on your meeting as many young gentlemen as possible mine did hester remembered with embarrassment and sadness her mother had died of grief and perhaps shame after her fathers suicide when he had been ruined in a financial scandal their deaths had been her reason for returning early from the crimea mercy must have caught the momentary grief in her face my parents are dead she said quietly from the way you speak your mother is also yes and my father hester acknowledged straightening up to go over to the table im sorry i shouldnt have asked i just wanted you to send a message if you wished sutton would see that it was delivered there isnt anyone mercy replied getting the bread out of the bin and passing it to her my elder sister charity married a doctor that was seven years ago they stayed in england for a year then he decided to go abroad and of course charity went with him that must have been hard for you mercy shrugged very slightly it was at first she said turning her face away so hester could see only the angle of her cheek and the way the muscles pulled in her neck but she was ten years older than i so we were not as close as we might have been and your brother is older too hester observed remembering clement louvain as he had been when he brought ruth clark in i was an afterthought mercy said lifting her chin a little her wide mouth curved in a smile my mother was nearly forty when i was born but i think she was especially fond of me for that she turned back to face hester ill make us a cup of tea i expect claudine would like one too and perhaps mr robinson she did not mention the others because they were taking an hour or twos rest before the night duty in the kitchen claudine was preparing vegetables for a soup many of the sick women found eating difficult fever robbed them of all appetite but some nourishment was essential and above all they should drink she stood at the bench a large knife in her hand her lips compressed as she tried to cut a raw carrot into small squares she was muttering to herself under her breath hester considered offering to help her but she had already had a taste of claudines temper when she was angry with herself for her ineptitude mercy gave hester a wry glance more than a little because she was domestically inexperienced also and knew that culinary skill did not come easily she filled the kettle and set it on the hob claudine went on chopping squeaky robinson came in looking with disapproval and impatience at claudine then hopefully at mercy claudine glared at him wonderful how you always know to come when the kettles on she said tartly saves yer having to send for me he replied sitting down at the table ready for mercy to bring him tea when it was brewed and why would we be sending for you claudine demanded her jaw clenched to swallow back the words as a piece of carrot jumped off the board under the crooked angle of the knife she stooped awkwardly to pick it up she had little grace and she was hurtingly conscious of it squeaky rolled his eyes mercy glanced at hester and swallowed a giggle probably cos yerve run out o water again squeaky said wearily beast o burden i am youre only getting it from the back door claudine said crossly some other poor devil is carrying it the length of the street and he can only do that in the dark for fear peoplell see him and wonder why we arent fetching our own so dont waste it you were scrubbing the floor yesterday as if youd half the ocean to play with perhaps youd better scrub the floor missus squeaky retorted an leave me ter chop them carrots i couldnt make no worse a job o it than you are no two bits the same you avent maybe you havent noticed it but the dear lord doesnt make any two carrots the same claudine said instantly her eyes blazing the knife clutched in her hand as if she were about to use it as a weapon e dont do it wi pertaters neither squeaky said with pleasure only wi peas an we int got none o them yer knows wot peas is missus about a penny a hundred claudine responded roughly what youre worth squeaky shot to his feet his face flushed now look yer vinegarfaced ol cow ive had as much o your tongue as im gonna take yer bleedin useless yer cant turn the mangle wiout tearin the sheets like we got em

wiout urlin bits all over the floor that poor cow wot died was rightno wonder yer poor bleedin usband dont miss yer bein ere es probably got a bit o peace for the first time in is poor bleedin life claudine went white she drew in her breath but found she had no words to defend herself suddenly she looked old and plain and very vulnerable hester was grasped by a pity so fierce she had no idea how to express it or what to say or do she stood frozen in the grip of it the fear and the sense of imprisonment was wearing on everyones emotions no one gave it words but they were all intensely aware that the disease was here with them like a brooding entity able to strike any of them or all every ache every weariness every moment of heat or chill every twinge of headache could be the beginning she was not the only one to wonder about every tenderness in the breast or the arm to look at herself with fear and imagine she could see shadows or the faintest swelling sign it was mercy who interrupted her thoughts mr robinson we appreciate that you are afraid we all are but deliberately seeking to hurt each other is only going to make it worse squeaky blushed but under his embarrassment he was angry as well he did not like being criticized particularly in front of claudine he knew he was in the wrong and it hurt him that mercy whom he admired was the one to point it out shes the one wi the tongue pickled in acid he said accusingly and you think so well of it you have to do the same mercy raised her eyebrows hester smiled because the only alternative was to cry and if she started she might not know how to stop as it was she was tired confused and would have given anything except what it would actually cost to have been able to go home the back door opened startling them all and making them swing around setting hearts pounding in sharp urgent fear but it was the little terrier snoot with his face half brown half white who came scampering in wagging his tail sutton close behind him hester breathed out in relief realizing she should have known it would be he the men with the dogs would not have permitted anyone else to pass sutton glanced around the room but if he sensed the tension he did not show it he was carrying beef bones two bottles of brandy and a pound of tea miss margaret must a brung em he said setting them down on the table he ran his hand gently over the little dog thats it fer the night he said gently now go ter bed the anger in the room subsided and everyone returned to their duties it was in the middle of the night when the incident occurred hester had had a few hours sleep and was going around to the more seriously ill of the women when she heard a noise on the landing a short distance away she knew bessie was doing the rounds as well so at first she took no notice then she heard a long wail rising into a note of sheer terror and she put down the cup of water in her hand she excused herself to the languid feverish woman she was with and went out into the passage bessie was struggling with a woman called martha who had come in with severe bronchitis which had seemed to be getting a little better bessie was broad and strong but martha was young and handsomely built as well and she seemed to have a remarkable strength bessies arms were clasped around her in a bear hug martha was leaning away from her her arms free her fists beating against bessies chest as hester took a step towards her marthas right fist caught bessie in the face and bessie let go of her with a yell of pain blood spurting from her nose martha half fell against the wall banging herself and twisting awkwardly hester started towards her but martha scrambled upright again and charged off along the passage towards the stairs dont bother wi me bessie shouted grasping her apron to her bleeding nose stop er shes makin a run fer it shes got them black swellins hester barely hesitated bessie would have to wait martha must be stopped at any cost she was already at the top of the stairs and lurching down them still screaming flo came out of one of the other bedrooms and saw bessie her face and bosom scarlet she screamed as well and ran floundering forward towards her im all right bessie yelled at her stop that stupid cow from runnin off get er go elp miss ester fer gawds sake flo stopped with a jolt as hester started down the stairs martha was already halfway down and squeaky robinson was on the way up holding on to the railings at both sides stop her hester shouted martha stop you cant leave but martha was beyond listening to anyone or anything she charged squeaky and carried him right off his feet knocking him backwards down the stairs his legs in the air she tried to avoid him and tripped pitching headlong after him landing heavily almost smothering him he screeched furiously then started howling with pain hester clung to the banister and went down as fast as she could without risking breaking her legs martha was still clambering to her feet when hester reached the bottom squeaky was clutching his right leg and cursing vigorously you cant leave martha hester said loudly and very clearly you know that youll spread the plague all over london come back upstairs and let us look after you come on squeaky was still swearing shut up she said to him furiously get up and hold on to martha squeaky tried to do as he was told grabbing a handful of marthas nightgown skirts to haul himself up she lashed out at him and sent him sprawling backwards to land with a thud against the wall whether she thought he was molesting her or she simply was not going to let anyone prevent her escape was irrelevant squeaky lay where he fell martha blundered away gathering speed and hester ran after her martha knew her way and was heading for the kitchen and the back door hester called out desperation making her voice high and shrill she was not even sure if she was trying to stop martha or to warn sutton and call for help would she have the nerve to order the dogs set on her even with the plague could she cause the death of someone in such a terrible way martha was in the kitchen claudine was sitting half asleep in the chair she woke up with a start as martha almost banged into her she lunged forward realizing instantly what martha was trying to do her weight carried martha forward and they fell together against the kitchen table claudine went down first martha on top of her there was a highpitched earsplitting series of barks snoot shot out of the door from the laundry as it opened and sutton appeared wot the ell is he started martha was the first to her feet let me go she shrieked i gotta get out of ere let me and again she plunged towards the back door hester tried to shout but she could not draw her breath dont sutton yelled dont do it but martha was beyond reach in her own mind she must escape or die the plague was here in this house and beyond in the night was freedom and life she ran barefoot out into the yard hester propped herself up onto her hands and knees sutton gritted his teeth and closed his eyes for a second then he opened them again get er he shouted martha was floundering across the cobbles of the yard out of the shadows from two different directions shot two pit bull terriers they leapt just as she shrieked and their weight carried her down hard and heavily as instinct and training taught them they went for her throat hester screamed no no oh god no she lurched to her feet claudine was standing as well one hand across her mouth the other clenched over her stomach where she had fallen against the table corner sutton stumbled to the door and out into the darkness the men were calling their dogs off martha lay motionless her white nightgown stained with widening blotches of crimson sutton reached her and bent down he touched her gently feeling for a pulse the two dog owners stood by hands on their animals reassuring them they had not done wrong but their voices trembled and hester knew they were talking as much to themselves as to their animals sutton looked up at them from where he knelt thanks joe arnie that cant be easy ter do but yer did right please eaven yer wont ave ter do it no more but if yer do then yer must he turned to hester who was now outside in the light rain almost beside him she int dead but shes bleedin summink orrible still i spose yer seen that before yer bein in the army an all wed best get er inside an see if yer can stitch er up poor little cow i dunno wot for thisd be an easier way to go gawd elp us claudine was outside now as well she was gasping for breath trying to control the hysteria rising in her you murderer she choked out the words staring transfixed with horror at sutton no he isnt hester protested her own voice thick with heldin anguish he set the dogs on her claudine said coldly you saw it god look at her theyve torn her throat out no they havent hester bent down to her knees to look at the mangled scarlet mess praying that what she said was true or maybe that it wasnt claudine began to gasp for breath the air scraping and wheezing in her chest sutton put his arm around her and with the other struck her hard on the back she turned on him in fury going to kill me now are you she shrieked raising both her fists as if to strike him in the face i might do missus he said grimly i really might dobut not yet ill ave enough ter bury without you an yer getting ter be more use every day spite o yerself now get an elp miss ester wi this poor little cow old the water or the needle or summink dont stand there wi yer bleedin mouth open int no flies ter catch this time o night claudine realized she was breathing clearly again she was beside herself with rage you she started but sutton was not listening to her shut yer face an be useful yer great lump he told her abruptly afore she bleeds ter death ere in the yard an yer ave ter spend yer mornin wi a broom an vinegar tryin ter clean it up partly out of sheer surprise claudine obeyed together all three of them managed to carry martha back inside and lay her on the kitchen table in the light she looked even worse can yer stitch er sutton whispered hester looked at the bloodsoiled clothes and the mangled flesh martha was still bleeding freely but it was not with the brilliant scarlet of arterial blood and it was still pumping which meant that she was alive i can try she answered but i need to be very quick claudine youll have to help bessies got what looks like a broken nose and mercyll have to deal with that anyway weve no time get my needle and silk out of the top drawer of the cupboard over by the sink as she spoke she was tearing out the other sleeve of marthas nightgown and rolling it up into a pad holding it onto the worst of the wounds sutton fetch the bottle of brandy and pour some of it into a dish then get more towels be quick they were ashenfaced their hands trembling but they did exactly as she told them mercy came while they were busy and said in a low voice that bessies nose was broken but she had managed to stop the bleeding bessie would be all right and so would squeaky he was bruised but nothing was broken flo was doing what she could for the rest of the sick women and what would hester like her to do now put a pot of tea outside for the men in the yard hester answered and thank them tell them we are grateful she did not look away from her work put your finger there she instructed claudine indicating a raw vein from which blood was running hold it ill stitch it as fast as i can ive got to do this one first without hesitation claudine stretched out her finger and pressed hester was oblivious of time it could have been a quarter of an hour or three quarters when she finally realized she had done all she could with claudines help she bound the last bandage on marthas neck and shoulder and the top of her arm she looked only once at the purplish patch near the armpit she did not know if it was a bruise or the beginning of a bubo she did not want to know they washed her the best they could put a clean gown on her then called for squeaky to help them carry her to one of the downstairs rooms they laid her on the bed and covered her over claudine looked at hester questioningly but she did not ask if martha would live or not ill go and clean up the kitchen she said ruefully it looks like a butchers shop thank you hester answered with profound sincerity she did not add any praise claudine knew she had earned approval and that was all that mattered to her she went out even smiling very slightly at squeaky as she passed him on her way to the door hester took the bloodstained clothes down to the laundry where she found sutton looking exhausted his lean face was shadowed as if with bruising his eyes hollow the stubble on his chin patched with white was the crimea like that he said with a twisted smile gawd elp the army if it were she thought of it with an effort it seemed like another world now she had been younger had so much less that was precious to her to live for one did not allow oneself to think about the violence and the pain in a rational way or it became too much to bear then instead of helping one was another needing to be helped pretty much she replied dropping the clothes on the floor the real answer was too long and she was too tired and perhaps sutton did not really want to hear it anyway iggerant an mad int we he said with startling gentleness makes you wonder why we bother wi ourselves dont it ceptin we int got nobdy else an yer gotter care bout summink he shook his head and turned to walk away snoot he called when he was outside in the passage where are yer yer useless little article there was an enthusiastic scampering of feet hester smiled as the little dog shot out of the shadows and caught up with his master after putting the clothes into cold water she went back to marthas room there was not much she could do for martha except sit with her make sure the bandages did not work loose give her water if she woke bathe her brow with a cool cloth and try to keep the fever down five minutes later claudine came to the door with a hot cup of tea and passed it to her its ready to drink she said simply it was it was just cool enough not to scald it was also so powerfully laced with brandy that hester felt she should be careful not to breathe near the candle flame oh she said as the inner fire of it hit her stomach thank you thought you needed it claudine replied turning to go then she stopped want me to watch her for a bit ill call you if anything happens i swear hesters head was pounding and she was so tired her eyes felt gritty if she closed them for longer than a second she might drift off to sleep the thought of letting go and allowing herself to be carried away into unconsciousness without fighting was the best thing she could imagine better than laughter good food warmth even lovejust to stop struggling for a while i cant she heard the words and wondered how she could make herself say them ill get another chair to sit here claudine replied then if she needs you i can wake you just by speaking i wouldnt have to leave her hester accepted she was asleep even before claudine sat down she sat up with a gasp an hour later when claudine woke her to say that martha was very restless and seemed to be in a lot of pain one of the wounds was bleeding again they did what they could to help her working with surprising ease together but it was little enough hester was grateful not to be alone and she told claudine so as they sat down again to watch and wait claudine was embarrassed she was not used to being thanked to be praised twice in one night was overwhelming and she did not know how to answer she looked away her face pink hester wondered what the other womans marriage was like that she apparently lived in such bitter loneliness uncomplimented without laughter or sharing was it filled with quarrels or silence two people within one house one name one legal entity who never touched each other at heart how could she reach out to claudine without making it worse or ask anything without prying and perhaps exposing a wound which could be endured only because no one else saw it she remembered ruth clarks cruel words and the mockery and contempt in them as if she really had known something about claudine not just guessed at it perhaps she had and perhaps it was bitter and wounding enough that claudine had seen the chance to kill her and protect herself but hester refused even to allow that into her mind one day she might have to but not now would you like sutton to have another message sent to your home hester asked aloud you could let them know you are all right but that with so many ill we cant do without you that would be more or less the truth or at any rate its not a lie it doesnt matter claudine replied her eyes fixed steadily on martha i said that in the first message she was silent for a moment or two my husband will be annoyed because it is a break in his routine and he was not consulted she went on there may be social events he would like me to have attended but otherwise it will not matter her voice caught for a moment i dont wish to appear to be explaining myself for the first time in my life i am doing something that matters and i dont intend to stop she had said little and yet beneath the surface it was an explanation of everything hester heard the emptiness behind the words a whole bruised and aching lifetime of it but there was no answer to give nothing to make it different or better the only decent response was silence she drifted back into sleep again and claudine woke her a little before four martha was slipping into deeper unconsciousness claudine stared at hester the question in her eyes the answer already known martha was dying is it the plague or the dogs claudine asked in a whisper i dont know hester said honestly but if it is the dogs perhaps that isnt a bad thing i i know claudine interrupted best thing not to linger martha was struggling for breath every few moments she stopped altogether then gasped again hester and claudine looked at each other then at martha finally it was the last time and she lay still claudine shivered poor soul she said softly i hope theres some kind of peace for her now do i mean should we she blinked rapidly say something yes we should hester answered without any doubt at all will you say it with me claudine was startled i dont know what how about the lords prayer claudine nodded together they pronounced the familiar words slowly a little huskily then claudine folded the dead womans hands and hester went to fetch sutton and ask for his help he was in the laundry rewarding snoot for having found a rats nest he looked up as hester came in his face was grave expectant he saw her expression she go he asked poor soul oo knows just claudine and i she replied good we better get er out before light he straightened up go ter bed snoot good boy you stay there like yer told he turned back to hester ill get the fellers ter take er sorry but well ave ter wind er in a sheet i know yer cant afford ter lose no more but there int no better way ceptin a blanket mebbe if yer got a dark one less easy seen ill find you a dark gray blanket she promised but what will they do with her she cant just be i mean she has to be buried too she thought of the silent miserable business of taking ruth clarks body out and leaving it on the cobbles in the rain for the men to take to an unknown grave she had not asked where then it was more than she wanted to know no doctor had seen ruth nor could they see martha not even an undertaker he would see the throat and think she had been murdered there was an irony in that she had not not morally anyway ruth had but there were hours at a time when hester forgot that and she had barely turned her mind to the question of who had done it or why now it was poor stupid terrified martha who mattered that hysteria lay close under the surface in all of them she licked her lips they were so dry they hurt in hallowed ground she asked tentatively is that impossible i just cant bear to think of her being pushed away somewhere in a drain or something don worry sutton said gently i got friends as can do all sorts o things theres graves in corners o proper places as got more bodies in em than they ave names on the stones the dead don care if they share a bit she wont be left unblessed or unprayed for nor ruth clark neither she felt the tears prickle in her eyes and the sheer weight of exhaustion loneliness pity and fear overwhelmed her his kindness sharpened it almost beyond bearing she wanted to thank him but her throat was choked he nodded his face hollow in the candlelight go find the blanket he told her claudine helped her roll the body and very quickly stitch the makeshift shroud around her catching it in places so it would not fall undone if she were carried hastily and perhaps with little skill they did not speak but every few moments their eyes met and a kind of understanding made them move in unison each reaching to help the other squeaky came upstairs again the three of them took her with stumbling steps awkwardly their backs aching along the passage and to the back door then outside into the yard hester raised her arm in signal to the men in the faint light of street lamps twenty yards away they looked huge and untidy coats flapping in the rising wind bareheaded hair plastered down the rain made their skins shiny almost masklike in the unnatural shadows they acknowledged hester and claudine but waited until they had gone back inside before they approached sutton went out alone and spoke to the men the larger of the two nodded and beckoned his companion carefully they picked up the corpse and without speaking they turned and walked slowly in the rain they stood very upright with the weight balanced between them as if they were used to such a thing hester and claudine stood side by side at the doorway so close their bodies touched watching as the men passed under the street lamp for a moment the rain was lit above them in bright streams then it glimmered pale on their backs as they retreated into the darkness the van at the end of the street was little more than a greater denseness in the shadows no one spoke it was quite unnecessary and there was nothing to say in a few hours another day would begin twelve rathbone had been to visit gould in prison because he had promised monk that he would he had expected to find a man he was morally obliged to defend not for the mans sake or because he was moved by any conviction that he was innocent but because it was a clear duty he realized as he left that he was inclined towards accepting goulds story that he really had found hodge unconscious but not apparently injured he admitted freely that he had stolen the ivory but his indignation at the charge of murder had a ring of honesty that rathbone had not expected however on speaking to the undertaker who had buried hodge there could be no doubt whatever that he had suffered an appalling blow to the head it had crushed the back of his skull and was presumably the cause of his death the undertaker had done as he was asked in burying hodge being assured both by louvain and by monk that all evidence had been recorded under oath and would be passed to the appropriate authorities the perpetrator of the crime was being sought and when found would be brought to justice rathbone returned to his office and began to consider what possible courses were open to him he was thus occupied when coleridge informed him that monk was at the door it was a little after half past eight in the morning now he said incredulously coleridges face was studiously without expression yes sir i daresay he is also concerned about the case he had no idea what the case was and he was apparently offended by the omission he also desired rathbone to realize that monk was not the only person working long and remarkable hours yes of course rathbone acknowledged he had no intention of telling coleridge what the case was he could not afford to until it was absolutely necessary even then it would be only what he was going to say in court and not include the reason for any of his extraordinary silences but coleridge did deserve to be treated with consideration he would be he said referring to monk it is a grave matter will you show him in please would you like a cup of tea sir oliver mr monk looks unusually the clerk searched for an adequate phrase in need of one he finished rathbone smiled yes please that is most thoughtful of you coleridge retreated mollified monk came in a moment later and rathbone saw immediately what coleridge had meant monk was wearing the same clothes he had had on last time and his face looked even hollower as though he had neither eaten nor slept well since then he came into the office and closed the door behind him coleridge is coming back with tea in a few minutes rathbone warned have you found any of the crew yet youll have to tell them even if you keep them by force you cant put them into the clinic can you we havent found them monk replied his voice low and rasping with exhaustion not any of them they could be anywhere in the country or back at sea on other ships going god knows where he remained standing rathbone noticed that monks body was rigid his right hand flexed and unflexed and the muscles of his jaw twitched in nervous reaction he must be in agony over hester alone in portpool lane he would have no idea whether there were more people dead plague raging through the place with all its horror and its obscenity or if they were cooped up waiting dreading every cough every chill or flush of heat every moment of faintness whether mere exhaustion or the beginning of the measured agony of fever swelling pain and then death rathbone was overcome with relief that margaret was not in there it welled up inside him like an almost physical escape from pain like the fire of brandy felt in the stomach and the blood when one has been numb with cold he stood facing monk who was gray with dread of losing all that mattered most to him and gave his life purpose and joy if hester died he would be alone in a way that would be a constant ache inside him increasing every burden dulling any possible happiness and rathbone was awash with relief at his own safety it filled him with shame i saw gould he said aloud trying for his own sake almost as much as monks to occupy their minds with the practical pity would be no help i believed him he saw the slight lift of surprise in monks face i didnt expect to he said hell make a good witness if i have to put him on the stand the trouble is i dont know what the truth is so im afraid of what ill uncover monk was pensive well so far as we know there was no one on board the ship apart from the skeleton crew and gould so the only defense can be that if gould didnt kill him then one of the crew did or else it was an accident if it was an accident then it can only have happened if he fell and cracked his head open possibly breaking his neck rathbone reasoned and if that were the case it should have been apparent to whoever found him was his neck broken you didnt say so no it wasnt and you said there was so little blood you thought he was actually killed somewhere else rathbone went on you said i know what i said monk snapped that was before i knew about the plague dont say that word rathbone said sharply his voice rising coleridge will be back any minute monk winced as though he had been caused sudden pain rathbone drew in his breath to apologize although he knew it was the truth which hurt monk not his words just at that moment there was a brisk tap on the door and coleridge opened it carrying in a tea tray and setting it on the table rathbone thanked him and he withdrew again are you saying he died of illness rathbone asked passing the tea as he spoke it fits the facts if gould is telling the truth monk replied sitting down at last he looked so weary it was going to be an effort for him to stand up again hodge had to be accounted for they couldnt just get rid of the body so someone took a shovel to the back of his head to make that seem the cause of death rathbone believed it but thats no use as a defense for gould he pointed out all i can think of so far is reasonable doubt and i dont know how to raise that without going too close to the truth he shivered and put his hands into his pockets it was an uncharacteristic gesture because it pushed his trousers out of shape who can i call he went on the prosecution will call the crew who will say they know nothing i darent call any medical experts because if i question them we would raise the issue of whether he was dead already and if so what caused it his neck wasnt broken there was nothing to suggest heart attack or apoplexy and the last thing on earth we can afford is to have them dig hodge up again monk shook his head slowly like a man in a fog of thought too harried on every side to find his way youll have to play for time he said unhappily i need to find something to raise a doubt rathbone hated forcing the issue monk was exhausted and rathbone could barely guess at the fear which must be eating him alive margaret was safe rathbone had everything to look forward to if he lost her it would be his own doing his cowardice moral or emotional the solution lay in his own hands but monk was powerless there was nothing he could do to help he did not even know from hour to hour if hester was alive still well or already infected suffering terribly she was imprisoned with virtual strangers would they even care for her in her moments of extremity would they stay to nurse her as she had nursed so many others would they run away in terror or inadequacy or would they be too close to death themselves to be able to raise a hand to fetch water or whatever one did to ease the terror or pain of the dying the thought made him sick with misery what is it monk demanded cutting across his thoughts rathbone recalled himself to raise reasonable doubt i have to suggest a believable alternative he answered if gould didnt kill him either someone else did or it was an accident can you get evidence to back your original decision louvain wrote that paper swearing to get hodges killer if you found the ivory thatll come out because the undertaker will swear to it to protect himself i cant afford to question the medical evidence at all they would dig the body up and thats a nightmare i dont even want to imagine monk said nothing he seemed to be lost in thought as if noticing the tea for the first time he poured himself a cup and drank it wincing at the heat and yet obviously grateful for it rathbone poured some for himself as well does louvain know the truth he asked monk looked up at him i really dont know then youve got to find out at least one of us has to if you ill do it monk said with such biting decision that rathbone knew he would not raise the question again if he didnt know rathbone said quietly then you will have to tell him the only way he can protect himself is to testify that he was mistaken and hodge could have fallen and hit his head or that gould killed him exactly as i first believed do you believe it now no again there was no hesitation then well have to find a way of getting louvain to testify for him or hell hang rathbone warned him we cant let the plague loose in london to save one man however innocent monk took a deep breath and rubbed the heel of his hand over his face i know how many days till the trial day after tomorrow ill see louvain monk promised he straightened up but there was a weariness inside him that bowed his shoulders and his face was ashen durban is still hoping to find the crew his face crumpled how many people are there rathbone that disappear and no one misses how many can fall and we all just press onward without even seeing the space theyve left does anyone care are there people suffering crippled with grief and we dont notice that either rathbone wished he had a lie good enough to give even the remotest comfort but he hadnt whether anyone missed the crewmen he had no idea they might be dead of plague in any town in the south of england or more probably already at sea on another ship there was no terror spreading no cry of quarantine evacuation or fire to burn it out to exorcise it like a thing from hell but monk was speaking of the void in his own life that hesters loss would create and rathbone knew that and he was contemplating allowing himself to love margaret just as deeplywasnt he with all the strength of emotion he possessed it defied every instinct of selfpreservation he had followed all his life it was a denial of sanity the ultimate madness had he any choice can one decide whether to love or not yes probably one could walk away from life and choose half a life paralysis of the soul he had walked away from hester and she had been wise enough to refuse him anyway perhaps for precisely that reason monk had had the courage of spirit to care and she knew that and valued it for the infinite worth it was now monk would be racked by it forever if she died margaret was safe as much as anything warm and living and vulnerable was ever safe if he wanted to be part of life not merely a watcher then he would let himself love as well perhaps it was the nature of caring that you could not help it there was no choice to make your own nature had already made it if you could pull back then you were not wholly involved he had never admired monk more than he did at this moment for the courage it had taken him to risk everything with that knowledge came a pity so deep it hollowed out new places within himself and filled them with a helplessness that twisted like a knife there was nothing to say or do as monk turned and walked to the door their friendship was deeper than rathbone had acknowledged to himself before and it was on the brink of being destroyed because part of monk himself would be lost if friendship could hurt so profoundly what in heavens name could love do rathbone spent the rest of the day catching up on other work he had put aside in order to prepare for the gould case and much of the following morning also however his mind was made up regarding margaret time was precious far more so than he had appreciated until now he had dithered on the brink of asking her to marry him it was both cowardly and foolish he had written to her and dispatched the letter by messenger inviting her to dinner that evening and rather than wait till this crisis was past whatever the relief or the irretrievable loss he would tell her his feelings and ask her to marry him as he dressed regarding himself unusually critically in the glass he was aware with surprise that he had taken it for granted that she would accept it had not occurred to him until this moment that it was possible she would not then he realized why the nerves in his stomach were jumping and there was a tightness in his throat it was not that she might decline everything in society and in her personal circumstances dictated that she accept and he was perfectly certain that there was no other suitor she was considering she was far too honest to have allowed him to court her had there been she would accept him the question that turned and twisted inside him was would she love him she would be loyal because loyalty was in her nature she would be gentle eventempered generous of spirit but she would have done that for anyone it was not enough to have all that not because she loved him but because it was a matter of her honor that she should give it would be a refinement of torture he could not bear to face yet if he did not ask her he had already chosen failure he took a hansom to call on her and this time he found mrs ballingers attentions even more difficult to receive gracefully his emotions were far too raw to expose to her acute perception he had no layer of wit with which to defend himself and he found parrying her enquiries extremely hard work he was relieved when margaret was unfashionably punctual in fact he was deeply grateful for it he offered her his arm bade mrs ballinger a good evening and went out to the waiting hansom just a fraction more hastily than was graceful have you heard anything more from monk margaret asked as soon as he had given the cabbie instructions what is happening has he heard from hester yes i have seen monk again he replied he came to my chambers yesterday morning but he had heard nothing from portpool lane i know no more than you do she made a tiny sound of desperation how was he how could he protect her from pain to love and cherish her was the privilege he was seeking to obtain for the rest of their lives surely he should begin now he is trying very hard to find evidence to help goulds trial he replied it starts tomorrow sir oliver she said simply please do not patronize me i asked you because i wished to know the truth if it is a confidence you cannot tell me then say so but do not tell me something untrue simply because you believe it is what i wish to hear how is monk he felt powerfully rebuked he looks dreadful he said honestly i have never seen anyone suffer as he is doing now and i know of no way to help him i feel as if i am watching a man drown and standing by with my arms folded she turned to face him the carriage lamps of the passing traffic throwing a flickering light on her face thank you she said softly that at least i believe and please dont blame yourself like that no one can help there are not many occasions that friendship cannot improve but i think this might be one of them we can only do our best and be there if the time should come when there is something to do there was no answer that was large enough so he made none a kind of peace settled between them he thought how fortunate he was to be sitting beside her and the resolve within him to ask her to marry him became even more certain they arrived at the home of their hosts and alighted they were welcomed in their turn there being over a score of guests it was a very formal affair women in magnificent gowns richly embroidered jeweled combs and tiaras glittering in their hair diamonds on earlobes and around pale throats margaret wore very little adornment only a simple pearl necklace and he was surprised how anything so modest could please him so much it had a purity that was like a quiet statement of her own worth within a few moments they were absorbed into the buzz of conversation he had been accustomed to such parties for years but he had never found it quite so intensely difficult to chatter politely without saying anything of meaning he recognized several people and did not wish to become involved in exchanges with them because he knew he could not concentrate his usual ease of manner was impossible emotions threatened to break through his composure and it required a constant vigilance to conceal them he wanted to protect margaret from the intrusive speculation that was customary he had escorted her several times now and it was inevitable that many would be waiting for him to make some declaration they would be watching her for pride disappointment desperation it was all intrusive unintentionally cruel and a part of society they both took for granted far more deeply than that he wanted to protect her from the fear she felt for hester and the sense of helplessness because there was nothing she could do beyond continuing to raise money how charming to see you again miss ballinger mrs northwood said meaningfully looking first at margaret then at rathbone rathbone drew in his breath to answer her then saw margarets face and realized she did not care she had caught the implication and it barely touched her he felt a rush of admiration for her how beautiful she was in her passion and integrity beside these bright and trivial women what did a little social prurience matter compared with the horror that was going on less than two miles away in portpool lane he moved a little closer to her mrs northwood noticed it and her eyes widened there was at least a half an hour before dinner would be announced but they were hemmed in by people on all sides he could hardly ask her to find a place where they could speak alone he did not even know exactly what he was going to say such things should be graceful romantic not blurted out in the fear they would be interrupted or overheard he should have invited her to a completely different kind of function what on earth had made him choose this but he knew the answer she would accept this because it gave her the opportunity to seek funds again she would have refused a more charming situation more romantic where they could be alone and then it would have become embarrassing and worst of all contrived and he enjoyed being with her in company he looked around at the other people present and was proud that it was she on his arm and not one of them he found himself smiling he would create a situation where he could speak to her even if it was on the way home lady pamela brimcott was coming towards them she was in her midthirties handsome and formidable he had defended her brother gerald on a charge of embezzlementunsuccessfully at least she had considered it so because gerald had been found guilty even though the sentence had been relatively lenient due to rathbones plea of mitigating circumstances actually gerald was greedy and selfish and rathbone had believed him guilty as charged but it was his duty to be advocate not judge good evening oliver pamela said coolly her gaze moved to margaret i presume this is miss ballinger whom i hear about so often i daresay oliver has told you as much about me rathbone felt the heat flood up his face at one time he had courted pamela had even considered she would be a suitable wife that had been before he met hester and realized that suitable was a description without passion or laughter or necessarily even friendship thank heaven his instinct had prevailed he could see the enmity in pamelas eyes and knew she had not forgiven him for either of the things in which she believed he had let her down she very probably would not have married him thenhe had had no titlebut she would have liked to be asked im afraid he has not mentioned you margaret replied her tone polite and implying regret pamela smiled how discreet of him she let the layers of hidden meaning unfold rathbone felt the heat increase in his face he would have loved to utter a crushing response but he cared too much to think of one he knew hester would have and wished she were here to defend them both margaret grasped the implication immediately her body stiffened rathbone could feel it almost as if she were actually touching him but she smiled with startling sweetness and looked unblinkingly at pamela he never discusses past cases with me she responded rathbone gasped there was utter silence for a second two seconds then pamelas face went white as she understood what she had heard for the first time in years she struggled to find a response the remark had been truer than margaret could have known and she could not fling it back margaret waited refusing to help her he certainly wouldnt discuss this one pamela said at last he doesnt care to speak of failures and this was a disaster he defended a member of my family who was charged with an act of which he was completely innocent but suffered in spite of it now margarets face was tense and pale also she raised her eyebrows very slightly really she said with disbelief that must have been most distressing for you i admire your courage in speaking of it so frankly to a stranger her tone implied that it was also indiscreet we are not really strangers when we share so much pamela replied between her teeth margaret lifted her chin even higher do we i had not realized but i am delighted to know it then you will be as keen as i on giving to charitable causes i am presently concerned with a clinic which treats sick and injured women in the farringdon area even a few pounds is sufficient to provide heating and medicine so the most desperate cases can have time to recover a little i shall give you an account of how it is spent naturally pamela looked startledand cornered i admit you have surprised me miss ballinger i did not expect you to ask me for money margaret contrived to look even more surprised have you something else i might wish rathbone could feel his stomach clench his face burning and yet he wanted to laugh the whole evening was escaping him he had failed pamelas brother not in that he was found guilty but in arguing the case at all he should have persuaded him to admit his guilt and repay the money he could have he had had the means he had bent to pressure from the family and because he was fond of pamela he had not wanted to tell her that her brother was a thief he did not want margaret to know that nothing that i could pass to you my dear pamela said icily her meaning perfectly plain margaret smiled radiantly im so glad she whispered and turned to walk away leaving pamela utterly confused feeling she had been bested without knowing exactly how rathbone was amazed and a little startled at how pleased he was that margaret had defended herself so very effectively he caught up with her in a glow of satisfaction almost pride he took her arm but as soon as they were a few yards away she stopped and faced him with all trace of humor gone oliver i would like to be able to speak to you for a few moments without interruption i believe there is a conservatory would you mind if we went to it there would surely be a discreet corner where we could goshe smiled a trifle selfconsciouslywithout people leaping to romantic conclusions he felt oddly crushed he did not wish her to take the lead it was vaguely unbecoming and yet she had made it plain that her intention was not romantic and he was disappointed of course he replied hearing the coolness in his voice and wishing it were not there she must surely have heard it also it is this way it was a marvelous room full of wroughtiron arches and filled to the roof with exotic plants the sound of falling water was delightful and the smell of damp earth and flowers filled the air margaret stopped as soon as they were several yards from the nearest person who might overhear them her face was extremely grave he felt a sense of alarm this was not even remotely how he had intended it to be what is it his voice sounded nervous scratchy have you heard from hester she asked there was no lift of expectation in her no have you i dont even know if she is well or ill she admitted i choose to believe that were she not still alive then the rat catcher would have told me but i cant even be certain of that but i do know that it is not over or she would have returned home she looked at him very steadily she is still in there with only the help of unskilled women and squeaky and the rat catcher there is no one to look after her if she should need it or even to be with her so she does not face this alone i am going tomorrow morning early before light please dont try to argue with me it is the right thing to do and there is no alternative it was terrible unbearable you cant he reached out and took her hands clasping them hard she did not resist but neither did she respond margaret no one is allowed inor out he said urgently i understand your wishing to help but his mind was filled with horror as if a pit had suddenly yawned open at his feet and he and all he loved were teetering on the rim she pulled her hands away sharply yes i can i shall write a message for the men with the dogs to take to the rat catcher hester may not let me in but sutton will for her sake she looked so white now that he was afraid she might faint she was as terrified as he was just as aware of the horror of the disease and the chances of her contracting it and dying a vile death and yet she intended to go he had to stop her the irony of it was devastating i was going to ask you to come to the conservatory so that we might speak alone for an utterly different reason what she was startled as if she thought she might have misheard him i was going to ask you to marry me i love you margaret more than i have ever loved anyone else more than i realized i could i am very afraid of caring so intensely but i find i do not have a choice in the matter how stilted he sounded as if he were addressing a judge before a more impassioned plea to a jury her eyes filled with tears which amazed him please he said gently i love you far too much to give up asking for me there is no second best nothing else to fall back on i love you too oliver she said in little more than a whisper but this is not the time to be thinking of ourselves and we do not know if there will be a future after this there was reproach in her voice it was infinitely gentle but it was also impossible to mistake his heart plunged she had seen his terror of disease and while she might understand it she could conquer her own fear she expected as much from him had he lost her already not to plague but to contempt or even to its kinder and more devastating likeness pity and yet he had no power to govern the churning of his stomach the feeling as if everything strong and in control inside him had suddenly turned to water he closed his eyes it is precisely because there may be no future after this that i had to tell you how i feel he heard his voice hollow shaky rather than passionate tomorrow or next week may be too late i could merely have said i love you but i imagine you already know thatthe important part is that i wish to marry you i have never asked a woman that before she turned away from him smiling in spite of her tears of course not oliver if you had she would have accepted you but i cant not with things as they are i hope you will forgive me and take my place in the raising of funds we will still need them desperately probably even more so but others apart from me can do that no one else can be there nor should they she turned back i am not asking because you love me or because i love you but because it is right of course he did not have to give it an instants thought he wanted to argue with her say anything do anything to prevent her from going but he knew if he did it would be rooted in selfishness and it would destroy both of them he offered her his arm and they went back to join the party and proceed in to dinner it was not late when he took her home because they both could think of nothing but the fact that she must be up early in the morning to reach the clinic before dawn he alighted from the hansom and offered his arm to hand her out he hesitated for a moment hoping to kiss her she must have sensed it because she pulled away no she said quietly goodbye is difficult enough please dont say anything just let me walk away apart from anything else i do not wish to have to explain myself to my mother good night and she walked across the footpath as the front door of the house opened she went in leaving him as utterly alone as if he were the only man alive in a deserted city he slept badly and at half past four gave up the attempt altogether he rose shaved in tepid water and dressed without bothering to eat breakfast he took a hansom cab and gave the driver the address of his fathers house in primrose hill it was nearly six when he arrived and still as dark as midnight he spent almost five minutes on the front doorstep before henry rathbones manservant let him in good gracious mr oliver whatevers wrong he said with horror come in sir let me get you a brandy ill go an fetch the master thank you rathbone accepted thats very good of you please tell him that i am quite unhurt and so far as i know in perfectly good health henry rathbone arrived some ten minutes later accepting the offer of a cup of tea from his manservant then he sat down in the armchair opposite oliver who was nursing a brandy he did not cross his legs as usual but leaned forward giving rathbone his whole attention the room was cold no one having risen yet in the normal course of the day to clean out the grate set and light a new fire what is it he said simply he was a taller man than his son lean with a gentle aquiline face and steady very clear blue eyes he had been a mathematician and sometime inventor in his earlier years and the lucidity of his mind and its gentle reasonableness had often assisted in olivers more desperate cases oliver remembered henrys profound affection for hester it made what he had to say almost impossibly difficult he hesitated now that the moment had arrived lost for words i cannot help if i do not know what it is henry reminded him reasonably you have come this far before dawn and you are obviously beside yourself with anxiety over something you had better say what it is rathbone looked up his mere presence made it both better and worse it brought all his own emotions so much closer to the surface it is something that can be told to no one else at all i should not tell you but i am at my wits end he said yes i see that henry agreed wait till we have the tea and can be uninterrupted oliver obeyed marshaling the thoughts in his mind into some kind of rational order when the tea was brought and they were alone he began he told the story very simply and in a manner as devoid of emotion as he could manage rather than robbing it of feeling this reserve added to it henry said nothing whatever until oliver stopped speaking and waited for a comment how like hester henry said at last i am sure margaret ballinger is a fine woman that much is quite clear and perhaps hester would not have made you happy nor you her but i have never known anyone else whom i liked quite so much what can i do oliver asked defend the thief to the best of your ability henry told him as long as you do not ever allow anyone to guess as wildly as they may that you are concealing a disease of any nature let alone this one you could create a panic which could end in mass destruction neither hester nor margaret would survive it and it would not even necessarily contain the plague whatever you do oliver you must let no one suspect it would be very dreadful if the thief is hanged for a crime of which he is innocent but for once injustice is not the greatest evil i know oliver agreed quietly i do know and poor monk is doing what he can to trace the members of the crew who were paid off yes the last i spoke to him he had had no success at all they may already be dead henry pointed out it is even possible they died at sea and he will find no trace of them because there is none to find i hadnt thought of that oliver admitted is there any reason to believe this man louvain none at all then you had better appeal to his interest rather than his honor now that margaret is no longer able to raise money for food coal medicines it is up to me there is a fear of immorality and disease in our midst we dont like to be reminded of such things so close to home we feel guilty that it happens while we are perfectly well and comfortable ourselves africa is too far away to be our fault personally henry agreed dryly it is too far away for us to feel accountable for it and it is equally too far away for them to be accountable to us oliver was too tired to grasp his meaning he was cold and exhausted deep to his bones what do you mean that we give money and feel our duty is discharged henry replied there is no probability of seeing that it goes to the cause we have been told so we feel virtuous and ignore the rest well of course it oliver stopped henry reached for the teapot and topped up his cup i shall help it will not be difficult for me to raise money for you you attend to rescuing the thief from the gallows i shall bring money for you tomorrow for today i have about seven pounds in the house take that and begin i shall get more however i do it however oliver said sharply he glanced around the room at various pieces of pewter silver a couple of wooden carvings can you think of anything better i could do with whatever i have henry asked no no of course not oliver rose to his feet stiffly i must get back to town thank you as darkness shrouded the river on the evening rathbone took margaret to dinner monk was standing on the shore at wapping stairs waiting for durban he heard the boat scraping against the stones and moved forward out of the shadows durban came up the steps slowly coughing in the raw night air for a brief moment he was silhouetted against the water where the riding lights of a moored boat shimmered behind him then he was in the dark but monk had seen him for that moment and knew from the hunch of his shoulders that he had found nothing neither did i he said quietly he voiced the thought that had been in his mind for some time do you think they could have died at sea and simply been put overboard and thats why there is no trace of plague durban asked standing close beside monk so he did not have to raise his voice and the rest of the crew got the ship here why not couldnt four men do it if they had to probably and they wouldnt all go at once but that isnt the issue if the men died of an ordinary illness theyd report it why not and louvain would know yes monk agreed but if they died of plague they wouldnt the ship would be barred from landing and louvain would lose his cargo and we already know he cant afford that you saw newbolt and the others durban responded do you think theyd stay on a plague ship out of loyalty to louvain no there was no argument the idea was ludicrous so where are they paid off as louvain said and either lucky enough not to have got the plague or died of it by now durban answered his voice soft in the darkness and the gentle slurping of the tide against the stones gould goes to trial tomorrow monk said i believe hodge died of plague and someone beat his head in to hide the fact they didnt dare put him over the side once they were in port which means gould had nothing to do with it we cant prove that and wouldnt even if we could we darent even suggest it was one of them or the whole thing could come out we darent give any cause to dig up the body so we cant call any medical evidence durban did not ask if monk knew anything from the clinic they had spent enough time together that he would have heard it in monks voice in what he didnt say as well as what he did he never once offered pity just a quiet understanding of pain it wasnt any of the crew he agreed if they knew it was plague theyd have been off that ship if theyd had to swim it must have been louvain himself but well not get him to testify to that what would be reasonable doubt monk was thinking aloud dead drunk and fell it would mean louvain would have to go back on his word durban warned hed not like that hed not like the alternative either monk said with growing conviction i need to make it sufficiently unpleasant so hell be glad to say he was mistaken hodge was drunk and he fell and hit his head so hard it killed him there was more blood around hodges than he first realized hodge was a drunkard durban asked dubiously they left a known drunkard on watch at night on the river with the cargo still on board thats incompetent theyre shorthanded then put your drunkard on during daylight then youre right theyre incompetent monk agreed bitterly thats still better than plagueridden and thats louvains choice you going to tell him can you think of anything better you want me to come monk heard the exhaustion in durbans voice no anyway id like to see that bastard alone i want to be the one to force him to save gould its not much but id like to i understand but be careful durban warned and suddenly the edge was back in his tone the tiredness gone make sure he knows you are not working alone the river police know everything make absolutely certain he understands that you think hed kill me monk was only mildly surprised and it was a strange flat emptiness inside him that he did not really care he was exhausted with plunging between hope and despair for hester hope was agonizing sometimes it was almost unbearable to cherish it better to accept that this was the end sooner or later she would catch it she had given her life to save london maybe europe he was passionately proud of her yet so angry he could have killed louvain with his bare hands and felt the life choke out of him with the nearest he could know to pleasure he was so full of pain he was buckling under the weight of it he did not want to eat and could not sleep only succumb to unconsciousness now and then actually i think you might kill him durban said reasonably so ill come with you anyway you can be the one to talk ill just be there and if he has men there and kills both of us monk asked chance ill take durban replied dryly well take him with us thatll be something wont help gould much no it wont will it durban agreed come on lets go and see him this time it was less easy to gain entrance to louvains office even though the clerk readily admitted that mr louvain was still in and there was no one with him its to do with the maude idris and the theft of the ivory monk said curtly yes sir we have the ivory back thank you i know damn it im the one who got it back for you the thief goes on trial tomorrow a matter has arisen which i need to speak to louvain about before then ill ask sir and the gentleman with you inspector durban of the river police ten minutes later they were in louvains office the fire still burning the room warm the gaslight gleaming on the polished surface of his desk he was standing with his back to the window as he had been when monk was there the last time the lights of the thames flickering in the dark window behind him he looked tense and tired what is it he said as soon as the door was closed i know the thief goes on trial tomorrow what of it he did not bother to hide his irritation as they faced each other across the room anger brittle in the air between them what the hell have you got the river police here for gould didnt kill hodge monk stated i didnt look at the body closely as i was meant to i saw only the back of his head louvains eyes were hard and steady not once did they look at durban and what more did you wish to see he asked the cause of death monk replied instantly or the cause of ruth clarks deathwhoever she was louvains face paled under the windburn on his skin she has nothing to do with them he said gruffly for the first time there was an emotion in him quite different from anger monk wondered if she had been louvains mistress after all had it even hurt him to take her to the clinic and leave her there monk had thought it possible that louvain had not known it was plague believed it to be simply pneumonia but durbans logic was relentless if gould had not killed hodge then it had to be louvain who had disguised the cause of his death if the crew had known the truth nothing on earth would have kept them on the ship which also meant that the other three had been paid off rather than died at sea she has everything to do with it monk said with a choking hatred inside him you took her to the portpool lane clinic knowing she had the plague he ignored louvains wince of pain however much he might have cared for her it did not excuse his taking her to where she could pass on the disease to other people women other men loved in fact the depth of his own loss made it worse that is what hodge died ofisnt it he accused it was you who took a shovel to the back of his head to make it look like murder so he would be buried quickly and no one would ever know the truth you didnt care a toss that an innocent man might hang for it hes a thief louvain said bitterly anger in his voice at being held to account is that why youre hanging him monk was incredulous and yet the more he thought of it the more he believed it because he stole from you louvains mouth twisted you think youre a worldly man monk and that no one dares to defy you but youre naive youre hobbled by your own morals youre too weak to survive on the river a few days ago that insult would have bothered monk today it was too trivial even to answer what was vanity in the face of the loss that gaped in front of him gould is not going to hang monk answered instead because we are going to see he is acquitted on the grounds of reasonable doubt louvain bared his teeth in something like a smile reasonable doubt as to what youre not going to tell anyone he died of plague even as he said the word his voice caught and monk realized for the first time the horror that turned louvain sick at even speaking the word it was anger greed and pride which drove him but it was fear which beaded the sweat on his skin and drained the blood from it youll have panic like forest fire he went on your own wife will be one of the first to be killed the mob would torch the clinic and you know that a glitter of triumph thin as melting ice lit his eyes monk was drenched with the sense of the power in louvain the intelligence and the violence held in check only by judgment of his own need now monk knew exactly why he had been so willing to sign the paper testifying to hodges death he had intended even then to hold hester and the clinic to ransom that was why he had chosen monk it made the most perfect sense of course i wont tell monk agreed his voice shaking and almost oblivious now of durban behind him and neither will you because if you do youll be mobbed as well ill see to it the river wouldnt thank you for bringing plague into london youll not only lose your ship and the cargo still in it but youll be lucky if they dont burn your warehouse your offices and your home theyd string you up for the pleasure of it he smiled back ill make damn sure of itif i have to he saw the sweat of fear on louvains lip and brow and the hatred in his eyes so you are going to testify that you were mistaken monk said in a hard level voice holding louvains eyes you did not want everyone to know that you had a watchman on duty who was a drunkard bad for your reputation but you realize now that you have to be more precise with the truth hodge drank too much he smelt of it and he must have overbalanced and fallen hitting his head because thats how you found him gould will change his story about hodges being drunk but unhurt when he saw him it will be reasonable enough to think thats what happened and if i refuse louvain said very carefully he stood stiffly his body balanced as if for a physical fight shoulders high weight on the balls of his feet youre not going to let the plague story out any more than i am we are hoist on the same petard monk i say gould hangs the next thief will think twice before stealing from a louvain ship how clever do you think gould is monk asked as if it were merely a matter of curiosity how moral not muchin either case louvain answered shifting his weight a little why he didnt kill hodge what are you prepared to gamble on his willingness to hang in order to protect your interests louvains eyes were bright but the last vestige of color had drained from his face making the stubble on it look gray rather than brown you wouldnt tell him he stated i wouldnt have to monk replied he might be able to work it out not plague perhaps but yellow fever typhus cholera are you willing to have them dig up hodges body to see if hes right once it gets that far none of us will be able to prevent it there was silence in the room suddenly the ticking of the chronometer on the table became audible counting away the moments of eternity louvain spoke at last what do you want me to say his skin was white and sheened in sweat but there was black rage in his eyes monk told him again slowly and carefully then he and durban went out into the rainwashed blustery darkness a small triumph like a pin dot of warmth inside him too tiny to ease the vast fear of loss in the morning rathbone was preparing to go into court when monk came to him in the corridor he looked ashenfaced and his clothes were ragged sorry he apologized i lost track of the time i should have been here earlier louvain will testify that hodge was a drinker and when he found him he was on the ledge at the bottom of the steps dead drunk his head bashed in from the fall rathbone stared at him youre sure yes he dare not do anything else monk blinked you look terrible his voice caught in his throat fear naked in his eyes his face the wild angular rigidity of his body rathbone felt an overwhelming sense of brotherhood with him a bond shared so profoundly it changed something inside him at that moment all he could think of was getting rid of the terror in monks eyes he understood it because it was his own margaret has gone to the clinic to help hester he answered i dont know any more good or bad but im taking money and supplies the momentary relief left monk speechless his eyes filled with tears and he turned away rathbone let him go there was no need for words between them the trial lasted for three days on the first the prosecution began with the undertaker who had buried hodge and his evidence seemed damning there was little rathbone could have done to shake him and he knew he would only make himself unpopular with the jury were he to try the undertaker was an honest man and it was quite clear he believed utterly what he said he behaved with both dignity and compassion in the early afternoon hodges widow gave evidence as to the identity of the body not that anyone had doubted it it was her quiet grief that the prosecution wished the jury to see rathbone rose to his feet i have nothing to ask this witness my lord i would merely like to offer my condolences upon her loss and he sat down again to a murmur of approval from the crowd next to be called was clement louvain rathbone found his heart beating faster his hands clenched and slick with sweat there was more than a mans life depending upon him if he probed too far asked too much he could let out a secret that could destroy europe and no one in the room knew it but louvain and himself louvain took the oath he looked tired as if he had been up all night and his face was deeplined with the ravages of emotion rathbone wondered briefly what part of it might be loss of the woman ruth clark the prosecution led louvain through the finding of hodges body and the description of the terrible wound on his head and why did you not call in the police mr louvain he enquired mildly rathbone waited louvain stood silent the judge stared at him his eyebrows raised louvain cleared his throat part of my cargo had been stolen i wanted it recovered before my competitors were aware of it it ruins business i employed a man to do that it was he who caught gould that would be mr william monk yes the prosecutions tone was audibly sarcastic and now that you have your cargo back you are ready to cooperate with the law and the people of london not to mention her majesty and help us to obtain justice do i understand you correctly mr louvain louvains face was twisted with fury but there was nothing he could do watching him rathbone had a sense of the power in him the strength of his will and was glad he had not incurred such hatred louvain leaned forward over the railing of the witnessbox no you dont he snarled you have no idea of life at sea you dress in smart suits and eat food brought you by a servant and youve never fought anything except with words one day on the river and youd heave up your guts with fear i got the thief and i got back my cargo and i did it without anyone getting hurt or spending the public money on police time what else do you want for you to follow the law like anyone else mr louvain the prosecution replied but perhaps you will tell me exactly what you found when you went to your ship the maude idris and discovered the body of mr hodge louvain did as he was bidden and the prosecution thanked him and invited rathbone to question the witness if he wished thank you rathbone said courteously he turned to louvain you have described the scene very vividly sir the dim light of the hold the necessity of carrying a lantern the height of the steps we feel as if we have been there with you the judge leaned forward sir oliver if you have a question please ask it the hour is growing late yes my lord rathbone refused to be rushed his tone was easy almost casual mr louvain is it as awkward to climb the steps into the hold as you seem to suggest not if youre used to it louvain answered and sober i presume rathbone added louvains shoulders clenched under his jacket and his hands on the railing looked as if he could break the wood a drunken man could miss his footing he conceded and fall a considerable distance i believe you said eight or ten feet yes and sustain serious injuries yes and was hodge sober louvains eyes narrowed not from the smell of him no then what makes you believe he was murdered rather than simply having missed his footing slipped and fell rathbone walked a step farther forward into the middle of the floor let me assist you mr louvain could it be that since your cargo had been stolen you automatically assumed that the watchman was a victim of the same crime you looked at the scene and concluded that the thief had come aboard your ship attacked your watchman and stolen your goods rather than that your watchman had died an accidental death his absence from his post had allowed a thief to come aboard your ship and steal your goods is that possible mr louvain yes louvain said bitterly that is possible his voice was barely audible in fact i believe that is what happened thank you sir rathbone returned to his seat the rest of the trial was a formality the other witnesses including monk gave their evidence the following day substantiating all that louvain had said the jury returned a verdict on the third daygould was guilty of theft as he had pleaded but there was more than reasonable doubt that any murder had been committed at all of that charge he was not guilty rathbone walked out into the midmorning rain with a sense of one very small victory one mans life saved at least for the time being thirteen in portpool lane time was measured not in nights and days but in loads of laundry whether it was light enough to blow out the candles or dark enough to ask the men in the yard to fetch water from the well at the end of the street everything still had to be done by signs from the back door no one must come close enough to risk catching the contagion four women had died now including ruth clark and martha hester went to each of the survivors as often as she could for those with pneumonia or bronchitis it was a matter of keeping the fever down and making sure they drank as much as possible water tea soupanything to make up for the fluid loss for the three whose illness was recognizably plague there was less to be done and a more desperate desire to try anything at all to lessen the pain which was acute it was not only the knowledge of almost certain death but the poison that raged through their bodies before it erupted in the blackened putrefying flesh of the buboes that made a person so ill that he or she longed for oblivion the moments of awareness between one delirium and another were so agonizing that they cried out and there was nothing hester or any of the others could do but administer cool cloths a sip of water and not leave them alone i wouldnt wish this on anyone flo said softly pulling uncomfortably on the sleeve of her blouselike all of them conscious every moment of her arms and groin she set down another bowl of water on the table outside one of the rooms so hester could wring out cloths for the woman inside not even that ruth clark the lyin bampot her face was pale with tiredness the freckles on it standing out like dirty marks her eyes dark ringed i may be a tart miss ester an a few other things i daresay but i int never bin a thief i got a name like anybody else an she got no right to take it from me by tellin lies whyd she do that i int never done nothin to er she was an angry woman hester replied putting the cloths over her arm then picking up the bowl a man she trusted maybe even loved threw her aside like so much rubbish when she most needed him she just lashed out at everyone flo shrugged if she trusted a man wot paid for er the more fool er she looked at hester defiantly and hester stared straight back at her flo sighed and lowered her gaze well i spose were all stupid sometimes poor cow she said reluctantly then she smiled im alive an she aint so i reckon i dont old no grudges i won eh hester felt the cold grasp her as if the outside door had been opened onto the night is that what you call winning flo well flo started then she froze geez i dint do nothin to er miss ester the cold deepened inside hester gripping like ice why would i think you did flo she asked very quietly cos she called me a thief an i int flo said indignantly thats a nice thing ter say if yerd believed er yer could a put me out on the street fer gawds sake i could die out there a wry miserable smile flickered across her face come ter think on it i could die in ere too but in ere im wi friends an that counts i never thought you were a thief flo hester said surprised how completely she meant it flos face lit with amazement and joy dint yer really hester felt tears prickle in her eyes it must be tiredness she could not remember when she had last slept more than an hour at a time no i didnt flo shook her head still smiling then im glad i never fetched the poor sod in the chops an blieve me i thought of it dyer want some more towels then yes yes please hester accepted bring them next time you come another woman died and hester and mercy tied her in one of the dark blankets as a winding sheet when they were finished hester looked across and saw how whitefaced mercy was and when mercy turned her head hearing footsteps on the stairs the candlelight accentuated the hollowness around her eyes well get squeaky to help us carry her down hester said dont you do it mercy started to argue then gave up perhaps youre right she conceded it would be terrible to drop herpoor soul her face was filled with pity and there was also a note of anger hester wondered why but she was too tired to pursue it claudine stood in the doorway she looked at hester for a moment then at the bundle on the bed it was a woman she had despised but even a glance at her face showed that death had cleansed judgment from her and left only a common humanity ill tell the men she said she turned from hester to mercy you dont look as if you could lift your own feet let alone anyone elses id better fetch that useless man away from his books and without asking hesters agreement she withdrew they heard her feet going down the passageway still sharpheeled on the wood but slower than before she too was on the edge of exhaustion it would soon be time for bessie and flo to take over for the rest of the night we can manage hester said to mercy go to bed now ill wake you when its time for once mercy didnt demur claudine returned with squeaky a step behind her grizzling all the way int my job ter be a bleedin undertaker he complained wot if i get the plague eh wot then carryin bodies mr bleedin rathbone dint say as i ad ter be carryin bodiesthat werent part o the agreement wot if i get it eh yer dont answer me that did yer you didnt hold your tongue long enough to give me the chance claudine responded tartly but if you cant work out the answer for yourself then ill tell you youll die of it thats what exactly the same as the rest of us yerd like that wouldnt yer he accused her glaring at her where she stood just inside the door her head high hair untidy hands on her wide hips of course i wouldnt like that she snapped if you were dead i would have to carry all the water myself instead of just most of it as i do now apart from that whod carry you out yer a cold and eartless woman he said miserably an yer don carry most o the water yer carries alf just like i does well carry half that poor womans body she ordered not the bottom half the top why because its heavier of course use the wits you were born with man poor woman is it he sneered thats not wot yer called er a couple o days ago nothin werent bad enough for er then cos she made er livin on er back like most of em ere yer just despises er cos yer wouldnt a made an apenny yerself not even in the dark hester tensed ready to stem the onslaught she expected in reply to this insult but claudine remained perfectly calm dont put words in my mouth you stupid little man she said wearily just pick her up and help me carry her down the stairs and do it discreetly shes not so much dirty laundry to be slung about squeaky obeyed youve changed yer tune avent yer so tarts off the street are all right again as long as theyre dead eh he bent and picked up the wrapped bundle approximately where her shoulders were and staggered a little under the weight well there isnt much point in criticizing the dead is there claudine challenged him poor soul is gods problem now squeaky let out a highpitched expletive shes my bleedin problem if i rips me guts out carryin er dyer put a couple o lead bricks in wi er for heavens sake man claudine exploded bend your knees straighten your back whats the matter with you havent you ever picked up anything before she gave an exasperated sigh here she bent down carefully and with surprising grace keeping her back perfectly straight and picked up the dead womans feet come on she ordered squeaky copied her exactly his face twisted in concentration then lifted the other end of the corpse he did it with comparative care hesitated transparently doubting within himself whether to thank her or not and very graciously decided to do so yeah he said it int so ard oh get on with it claudine told him impatiently what are you waiting for a round of applause he glared at her and set off backwards down the candlelit corridor towards the stairs hester followed calling out and warning just as squeaky reached the top of the stairs and looked like hed fall backwards down them you fool claudine said in utter exasperation probably because she had not thought to warn him herself i dunno why we bother wi sutton an is bleedin dogs squeaky said indignantly got a mouth like a rattrap you ave catch all the bleedin rats in the place yer would mebbe thats wots wrong wi yer swallowin too many bleedin rats stop complaining and carry this poor woman to her grave claudine responded apparently unmoved squeaky steadied himself and started backwards down the stairs claudine went gently with considerable regard for his balance and speed waiting whenever it was necessary and without further criticism when they reached the bottom she told squeaky when to go left when right and when he seemed lost she waited finally they reached the back door and sutton who was standing beside it opened it on to the rainsoaked night the lamplight gleamed on the stones and the gutters were awash under the eaves two men were waiting dogs sitting patiently at their heels two more detached themselves from the shadows ready to come forward for the body when the door was closed the rat cart would be waiting at the curb but it was out of sight squeaky let go of the body with relief and then claudine let go of her end in turn to everyones amazement she stood quite still in the rain her head bowed may the good lord have mercy on her soul and remember only what was good in her she said quietly amen she jerked her head up what are you staring at squeaky glowered at her his body hunched and tight shivering in the cold amen he replied then splashed back over the cobbles to the kitchen door scattering water everywhere claudine immediately behind him hester smiled thanking them both just as bessie appeared announcing her arrival to take over for a while hester excused herself and went upstairs again to find a quiet place and snatch a few hours of sleep sinking into oblivion with immeasurable gratitude she awoke what seemed only a few minutes later but it must actually have been several hours because the thin winter daylight came in through the window flo was standing beside her her long freckled face filled with misery hester dragged herself into consciousness and forced herself to sit up the air was cold and her head ached what is it flo she asked i went ter waken miss mercy flo replied she looks orrible pale an i cant get er ter waken proper shes probably exhausted hester answered pulling the bedclothes around herself shes been working almost without a stop for days we can leave her for a little longer ill get up has anything happened during the night how is everyone as she straightened up she touched her fingers to the skin under her armpits dreading to feel the tenderness and only half believing it was not there that minnie looks worse flo replied pretending she had not noticed the gesture she understood it perfectly coughin fit to bring er guts up she is she went on but still got plenty ter say fer erself so i reckons shes good fer another day or two poor little cow kettles on when yer ready thank you flo went out closing the door behind her stiffly shivering as the air hit her skin hester got up she dressed again and splashed her face from the small dish of cold water she had spared herself then she started to go downstairs for the tea flo had offered and a slice or two of toast thanks to margarets constant efforts they had sufficient food and fuel she pushed the thought of margaret out of her mind because she missed her company her encouragement just the knowledge that she could glance at her and know that they understood each other in unique ways the loneliness might cripple her if she allowed it if she thought of monk she would find herself in tears she could not bear to think of being with him againhis voice his touch the feel of his lips on her facebecause the sweetness of it was everything she longed for nor could she think of the possibility that she would not because that robbed her of hope he was the only reward that mattered and it was enough to drive her through exhaustion and pity and grief she was halfway down the stairs when she thought she had better have a look at mercy she was probably just exhausted she was a young woman of good birth and a fairly sheltered upbringing this kind of physical labor let alone the constant fear would have crippled most girls like her hester knocked lightly on the door and there was no answer she pushed it open and went in mercy looked to be sound asleep but not motionless she moved slightly took an unsteady breath then turned her head mercy hester said quietly there was no answer hester walked over to her even in the dim daylight through the curtains she could see that mercy was not awake she was tossing and turning in fever her cheeks flushed a beading of sweat on her lip hester felt a slow settling of pain inside her and fear took hold of her stomach knotting it tight with a trembling hand she reached over and pulled the bedclothes back her fingers rested lightly over the place where the sleeve of the nightgown met the bodice she felt the hard lumps perhaps it was going to happen to all of them it was only sooner or later that was all now for mercy it was a terrible certainty hesters throat was thick with tears she found it suddenly hard to breathe looking down at the flushed face and the fair tangled hair she realized how much she liked mercy she was angry that this should happen to her and not someone who had less to lose or who would not be missed so much it was a stupid emotion and she should have known better than to allow herself to feel it but all the reason in the world made no difference slowly she turned and walked away closing the door of the room behind her and going down the stairs as if in a dream she must get something to eat stay strong she would nurse mercy herself make sure she never woke alone no one could help no one could remove the physical pain the horror or the inevitability of death lies would be no comfort only dig a gulf between them she could do nothing but simply be there she walked into the kitchen they all turned to look at her but it was sutton who spoke he came over to her his face pinched with concern tea he ordered flo then get yerself off to claudine he just waved a hand and whitefaced she went to resume the endless laundry there was little water left but she did not mention it and certainly did not complain she would reuse what was there if it proved necessary squeaky was nowhere to be seen fear was in the air like the cold flo poured the tea and excused herself hester sat down still without having spoken she placed her hands around the steaming mug and let the warmth run through them dyer know oo did it sutton said quietly killed ruth she was surprised it seemed to matter so little now no i dont im not sure how much i care the poor woman was dying anyway she just took longer than some of the others partly it was because of the way the disease went and partly because she was strong not living on the streets half starved i think if i had plague i wouldnt mind a lot if someone just snuffed me out a little faster and dont bother to tell me you shouldnt do that i know im just admitting that i havent even thought about it lately have you not much he replied she quarreled a lot with claudine and flo mercy was the only one oo ad the measure of er but then seems it were mercy oo looked after er as it were er brother oo brung er ere so mebbe she knowd plenty about er could bin er as done it he pulled his face into a gruesome expression of disbelief or it could a bin anybdy else she were a nasty piece o work gawd rest er i dont think its going to matter if mercy did hester said quietly her voice flat sutton caught the tone and he looked at her with intense sorrow she got it too hester took a shuddering breath yes it ended in a sob he put out his hand automatically to touch hers very lightly as if he did not want to intrude she felt the warmth of it and ached to be able to hold on to him but it would have embarrassed him she was there to be a leader not to turn to others for comfort as if she were just as terrified as they were they might guess it but they must never know she sat there silently for a moment longer forcing her breathing to become even again and the tears to choke back out of her throat then she brought her head up and began to drink her tea ten minutes later she went back upstairs to sit with mercy she spoke to her every so often not certain if she was awake enough to hear or understand she talked about all sorts of things past experiences things she had seen like the first christmas in the crimea the beauty of the landscape snowbound under a full moon and she described other things closer to home wandering in her memories at random simply for the sake of talking once or twice mercy opened her eyes and smiled hester tried to get her to drink a little beef tea and she managed a mouthful or two but she was very weak how she had kept going for so long was hard to imagine she must have been in great pain hester thanked her for all she had done above all for her gentleness for her friendship and she praised her hoping she would understand at least some of it late in the afternoon she seemed to find almost an hour of sleep in the evening hester went downstairs again to see how everyone else was doingif there was enough water food soapand to fetch another candle her head was aching her eyes prickled with weariness and her mouth was dry she had just started back upstairs when she was aware of the room blurring a little sliding away from her vision the next thing she lost her balance and slipped into darkness only vaguely aware of something hitting her hard on the left side she opened her eyes to see the smokestained patch on the ceiling then claudines face ashen with fear tears on her cheeks with a wave of terror so intense the room spun around again she remembered the moment she had touched mercys armpit and felt the hard swelling had she looked as claudine did now it was the end she had gotten it after all she would never see monk again sutton was beside her his arm around her holding her head up a little snoot was pushing against him wagging his tail yerve no right to give up yet sutton said scathingly yerve nothin ter give up for yer not ill yer just daft he gulped beggin yer pardon fer the familiarity but there int nuffin under yer arms yer just too skinny ter stand the pace what she mumbled yer not got the plague he hissed at her yer just got a fit o the vapors like any other lady wots bin brung up right claudinell get yer ter yer bed an yer stay there until yer told yer can come out sent ter yer room like int that wot yer ma did to yer when yer was full o lip sent to my room hester wanted to giggle but she hadnt the strength but mercy the world int gonner stop just cos yer int pushin it round sutton said disgustedly but his hand on her was as gentle and his eyes as soft as when he fondled his little dog just do as yer told for once he snapped his voice suddenly choking we int got time ter be pickin yer up off the floor every five minutes he turned away quickly blushing hard claudine bent down and helped her up holding her so tightly she couldnt have buckled at the knees if she had wanted to together awkwardly trying to keep in step and not trip each other they made their way back up the stairs passing a horrified squeaky robinson on the landing dont look like that you daft haporth claudine shot a furious glare at him shes just tired if you want to be useful go and fetch some water from the yard and if there isnt any there tell those blasted men to go and get some and without waiting to see if he was going to obey her she swept hester along to the bedroom and half heaved her onto the bed now go to sleep she ordered furiously just do it ill look after everything hester stopped struggling and let go she woke with a start the only light in the room was from the candle burning on the small table beside her in its flame she could see margaret sitting on the chair looking back at her a little anxious but smiling hester shook her head trying to clear her thoughts she sat up slowly blinking but margaret was still there horror welled up inside her you cant have i havent margaret said understanding immediately she leaned forward and took hesters arm neither have you youre just exhausted they shouldnt have told you hester protested struggling to sit up now fear for margaret drowned out all other thoughts margaret shook her head they didnt i came because i couldnt leave you here alone she said it quite simply without protestations of morality or friendship it was simply a fact hester smiled widely and lay back filled with warmth just for now refusing to think beyond the moment later they met together over toast and jam and a cup of tea while hester told margaret all that had happened since she had left im sorry about mercy margaret said quietly i liked her it seems a terrible sacrifice shes so young and had everything before her at least she frowned i dont really know anything except that she is clement louvains sister one tends to think that if people have a good family and are more than pleasing to look at they will be happy and thats silly really she may have all kinds of private griefs we know nothing of her face became reflective deep in her own thoughts and there was more than a shadow of pain in it hester knew what it was there was only one thing that would trouble margaret in such a way there was all the difference in the world between the ache in the heart caused by love its disillusion and loneliness and the fear of any other kind of calamity she had realized even more intensely in these last days that the passion the tendernessabove all the companionshipof heart and mind were the gifts that gave light and meaning to all others or took it from them oliver she said gently margarets eyes opened wide then she blushed am i so transparent hester smiled to another woman yes of course you are he asked me to marry him margaret said quietly she bit her lip i had been waiting for him to do that dreaming of it and it was all exactly as it should have been she gave a rueful bewildered little laugh except that nothing was really right how could i possibly accept marriage now and go away leaving you here alone to cope with this what would i be worth if i could and how could he not know that what does he believe of me that he would even ask hester watched margarets face what did you say margaret took a sharp breath that i could not of course i told him that i was coming here he didnt want me to at least part of him didnt illness frightens him she said it with hesitation as if betraying a confidence and yet unable to bear it alone i know hester smiled hes not perfect it costs him all the courage he has even to think of it let alone come close to it margaret said nothing perhaps he can face things we find harder or even turn away from hester went on if he were afraid of nothing if he had never run away never failed or been ashamed never needed time and another chance what would he have in common with the rest of us and how would he learn to be gentle with us margaret looked at her steadily searching her eyes youre disappointed hester asked no margaret answered instantly then looked away i im afraid hell think i am because i was for a moment or two and maybe he wont ask me again maybe nobody will but that doesnt matter because i really dont want anyone else apart from you theres nobody else i like so much she looked up again do you understand absolutely i believe he will ask you but if he is cautious you will have to deal with that you mean be patient wait no i dont hester responded instantly i mean do something about it put him in a situation where he is obliged to speaknot that i am in the least useful at doing that sort of thing myself but i know it can be done sutton came in through the back door snoot at his heels hester poured tea for him offered him toast and invited him to sit down its good to see you miss he said to margaret accepting the invitation the words were bare enough but the expression in his face was profound approval and margaret found herself coloring at the unspoken praise hester took the crusts from her toast and gave them to snoot i know i shouldnt she acknowledged to sutton but hes done such a good job hes a beggar sutton said tartly ow many times ave i told yer not to beg yer little ound his voice was full of pride e as done a good job miss ester i int seed a rat fer two days now hester felt a hollowness at the thought that sutton might leave she realized how much she relied upon him even with margaret back his resourcefulness his wry brave wit his companionship could not be replaced by anybody else there might still be some she said too quickly ill show yer where i bin he replied waiting until she was ready to move she finished her tea and when he had also she followed him to the laundry it smelled of carbolic wet stone and cotton he stopped we int had no more new cases o the plague since miss mercy mebbe were gonna get the better of it he said softly but i int goin till yer find out oo killed that clark woman not as she dint deserve it like but nobdy can take the law into their own ands he looked at her in the dim light i bin thinkin its gotter be between flo miss claudine an miss mercy though why miss mercy should wanter kill er i int got no idea summink ter do wi er brother mebbe bessie couldve o course but she int like that the rest of em were too poorly accordin ter bessie an dint never see er or squeaky hester added but so far as i know he didnt see her either and why on earth would he want to kill her thats exactly it sutton said unhappily an as yer said it were mr louvain as brung er in yes he said she was the mistress of a friend of his he raised an eyebrow in a lopsided expression of doubt or mebbe not ave yer thought as mebbe she were is own mistress like yes of course i have a coldness touched her you mean that mercy knew that perhaps even knew her int wot i wanna think he said sadly nor wouldnt i wanter think as mebbe thats why she come ere ter elp just to murder ruth clark hester refused to believe it she was here for days before ruth was killed if thats what she came for why would she wait i dunno mebbe she wanted ter argue the clark woman inter leavin the family alone he suggested his face pinched with weariness but praps the clark woman ad ideas o becomin mrs louvain or mebbe just o bleedin im o money miss mercy could a bin protectin im no this time she was quite certain he doesnt need anyone to do that if ruth clark was trying to blackmail him or get money in any way hed simply have dumped her in the river himself he looked at her shaking his head a little somebdy put a piller over er ead dyer reckon as it were floor miss claudine miss claudine got a tongue on er asd slice bacon but she wouldnt stoop erself to it anybdy i seen er wi squeaky shed fair bust er stays but she wouldnt it im flos a different kettle o fish shed a throttled er if shed really lost er rag like but dyer reckon as shed a carried it off after all cool an surprised like an nobdyd guessed it were er no then i reckon yerve gotter think as it were miss mercy his face was marked with weariness and sorrow i wish i adnt ad ter say that i was just putting off thinking it she admitted i sensed emotion between them but i really didnt think it was hatred and i would have sworn that ruth wasnt afraid of her if thered been that kind of threat between them if ruth was blackmailing clement louvain or imagining she would marry him then surely shed know mercy would try to stop it wouldnt she have been afraid he was disconcerted ow daft were she not at all she was quick well educated in fact they seemed to belong to the same social class except that ruth was possibly louvains mistress whereas mercy is his sister there was a sound at the doorway and claudine came in aware that she was probably interrupting and ignoring the fact her eyes were bleak and she held her voice in control with difficulty mrs monk i think mercy is sinking flo is with her but i thought youd like to be there yourself if she rallies long enough to know hester was not ready her thoughts were in turmoil and she needed to know the truth however deeply it hurt if only to free flo and claudine from suspicion nor was she ready emotionally she liked mercy liked her patience her curiosity the way she was willing to learn skills outside her class or style of life her generosity of spirit her ease to praise others even her occasional flashes of temper hester was not prepared to accept her death with so much turbulence of heart so many painful questions unanswered but time would not wait the hand of plague waited for nothing im coming she said glancing once at sutton then she followed claudine out through the kitchen and up the stairs to mercys room flo was sitting beside the bed leaning forward a little to hold mercys hand mercy lay quite still her eyes closed she was breathing heavily and the sweat stood out on her skin flo rose and allowed hester to take her place moving silently to the door hester touched mercys head then wrung out the cloth in the dish of water and placed it on her brow a few minutes later mercy opened her eyes she saw hester and smiled just the corner of her lips moving a fraction im here hester whispered i wont leave you mercy seemed to be struggling to say something hester wet her lips with the cloth are there any more mercy breathed the words barely audible any more hester did not understand what she meant but she could see that it was of intense importance to her any more sick mercy whispered no no more hester answered there were several more minutes of silence mercy was blue about the lips and she was obviously in severe pain the poison that had blackened the buboes under her arms and groin was racking her whole body now hester had seen death often enough to know that it would not be long she would have to get word out to clement louvain when it was over and they could communicate with the outside world she would have to tell him about ruth clark as well whatever the truth of his regard for her had been odd such lovely words mercy and clement and the sister was charitythe same meaning again and ruth clark too the word was usually used in the negativeruthlessso ruth must be a kind of mercy and forbearance a gentleness of spirit presumably clement louvain would tell charity what a lot of grief for one man to bear had he known that ruth had plague was that why he had brought her here instead of having her nursed in his own home if she had been his mistress then he could well have it too by now mercys eyes were open hester looked at her did you know that ruth clark had the plague mercy blinked ruth it was almost as if she did not know who hester meant ruth clark the first one to die hester reminded her she was suffocated someone put a pillow over her face and stifled her but she would have died of plague anywayalmost certainly hardly anyone ever recovers leaving mercy said hoarsely not listen to me spread it no she didnt hester assured her gently her eyes brimming with tears she never went outside the clinic except to be buried she put her hand on mercys and felt the fingers respond very slightly thats why you killed her isnt it her throat was tight and aching to stop her from leaving you knew she had plague didnt you yes it was hardly more than a breath how was she your brothers mistress mercy made a funny little sound in her throat a gasping as if she had something caught in it and it was a couple of seconds before hester realized it was laughter wasnt she she asked who was ruth clark charity mercy answered my sister stanley died at sea but charity thought she could escape i wouldnt let her not with plague i but she had no more strength her eyelids fluttered and her breath eased out slowly and did not come again hester reached for her pulse but she knew it would not be there she sat motionless overwhelmed with the reality of the loss she had not known mercy long but they had shared sorrow pity and laughter shared grubby manual duties fear and hope and feelings that mattered now she knew that mercy had come here deliberately knowing what it might cost her to stop her sister from carrying plague away into the city the country she had paid the price to the last drop slowly hester moved from the chair and bent to her knees she had prayed often for the deadit was a natural thing to dobut before now it had been for the comfort of those remaining this time it was for mercy and it was directed to no listener except that divine power who judges and forgives the souls of men forgive her she said in her mind pleaseshe didnt know anything better to doplease please she did not know how long she knelt saying the words over and over until she felt the hand on her shoulder and flinched as if she had been struck if shes gone miss ester we gotter get er away from ere an buried proper it was sutton yes i know she climbed to her feet she has to be buried in a graveyard she stated it as a fact she had already decided to tell no one what mercy had said as far as they were concerned ruth clark was a prostitute who had died of pneumonia and no more she will miss ester sutton bit his lip i told the men yesterday they got a place but we gotter urry theres a grave new dug not far from ere mile an a alf mebbe its rainin like stair rods whichll keep folk off the streets flos bringin one o them dark blankets an well wrap er up but we int got time ter grieve im sorry hester felt her eyes hot and stinging with unshed tears but she obeyed when flo came with the blanket she took it from her and insisted on wrapping mercy in it herself then the three of them sutton at the feet and the two women at the head carried mercy down to the back door squeaky claudine and margaret were waiting heads bowed faces pale no one spoke margaret looked at hester the question in her eyes hester shook her head she turned to sutton im going with them it was a statement yer cant do that he started then he saw the blind grief in her face yer cant go out now he said gently yerve kept in all this time i wont go near anyone she cut across him ill walk behind by myself he shook his head but it was in defeat rather than denial and his eyes were swimming in tears flo sniffed fiercely don yer forget yer goin fer all of us an for all of them as we buried as as got no one say something for us as well claudine agreed hester nodded of course i will and before anyone could say anything more and break what little composure she had left she opened the door and sutton helped them carry the body outside into the yard and lay it down look after er he said to the men when they came for it hester waited until they were almost to the street then she pulled her shawl over her head and followed over the cobbles in the drenching rain suttons coat around her shoulders she waited under the arch of the gate as they passed under the street lamp and across the footpath and placed the body gently into the rat cart one man picked up the shafts and started to pull his dog beside him the other went behind his dog at his heels hester went after them about twenty feet behind they knew she was there and possibly they walked a little more slowly to allow her to keep up they moved through the sodden night unspeaking but every now and then glancing backwards to make sure she was still there she thought of the other women who had been buried this way unmarked and unmourned whoever had loved them would never know where they were nor that at the very least someone had dealt with them in some reverence the rain was turning to sleet drifting across the arcs of light shed by the street lamps and disappearing into the darkness again she pulled suttons coat more tightly around her without warning they came to a stop and she stood still twenty feet away while the two men took the body out of the cart and led the way very slowly guided by the bullseye lanterns through the graveyard gates she waited until they were almost out of sight before she went after them along the paths between the stones a thin figure loomed up ahead standing by the earth of a new grave dug ready for the morning the mound of fresher earth excavated deeper was barely visible in the darkness quick was the only word spoken but she heard the slither of soil and then the thud as shovel blades hit harder ground there was a minutes silence dimly she saw the figures straighten and bend again as they lowered mercy down then all three piled the earth back in it was bitterly cold and she heard the faint splash of water in the bottom of the grave at least the downpour would wash the mud from their hands afterwards it seemed an age until mercy was completely covered but at last it was done one of the men walked over and stopped about ten feet from hester yer wanner say summink he asked quietly yes hester took a step sideways closer to the grave but away from him rest in peace she said clearly the rain icy in her face washing away the tears if we loved you as much as we did and could understand you have no need to fear godhe has to love you more and understand even better dont be afraid goodbye mercy amen the others said in unison then led the way ahead of her through the gravestones back to the rat cart and the cold bitter journey home the next day passed with no one else developing symptoms they waited in dread and hope listening for every cough feeling for tenderness watching for an awkward movement they worked together to scrub launder cook change bandages for the injured still trapped with them and tend to those recovering from what now seemed to have been only pneumonia or bronchitis no one spoke much they were all deeply subdued by mercys death even snoot seemed to have lost his heart for ratting although he had possibly got them all anyway once or twice claudine seemed about to say something deliberately filling her expression with hope then as if it were too fragile to expose to reality she changed her mind and kept silent redoubling her efforts at scrubbing or mixing or whatever else she was doing flo chopped vegetables as if she were slitting the throat of an enemy biting back tears all the time and bessie banged pots pans folded linen and grunted but whether it was out of satisfaction the ache in her shoulders and back or too much hope bottled up inside her she did not allow anyone to know in the evening they all sat together around the kitchen table and ate the last of the soup from now on there would be nothing except gruel but no one complained in everyones mind there was just the one prayer that the plague be gone in the morning one of the men with the dogs knocked on the back door when claudine allowed him time then went to answer it she found a box of food three pails of fresh water and two envelopes tucked where they were kept dry she carried them inside in triumph one note was for margaret hester watched as she opened it and her face filled with joy her eyes brimming she read it twice regardless of her tears then looked across at hester whose note was still unopened its oliver she said gulping he brought the food himself involuntarily she glanced at the courtyard he was right outside the door she did not offer any further comment they both knew the effort it must have cost him and the victory hester tore hers open as well and read my dearest hester the thing you will care most about is that monk is well but he looks exhausted and his fear for your welfare is eating him alive he is working night and day to find the crew of the maude idris who were paid off before the ship reached the pool of london but we fear they may already be dead or else have gone back to sea in new ships however we have succeeded in saving the life of the thief gould with a verdict of not guilty because of reasonable doubt and thus justice is served without the terror of the truth being known when i last saw monk after the trial i did not yet know that i would find the courage to deliver this myself or i could have brought you a letter from him but you will already know all that he would have written my admiration for you was always greater than i told you but now it grows beyond my ability to measure i shall be proud if you still wish to consider me a friend yours as always oliver she smiled folding it up to put into her pocket then looked up at margaret i told you he would she said with infinite satisfaction they spent the day scrubbing everything they could reach rathbone had thoughtfully included carbolic among the things he had left by suppertime they were exhausted but every room was clean and the chemicals sharp stinging odor was everywhere at any other time it would have been offensive now they stood in the kitchen and inhaled it with pleasure that night they all sleptexcept bessie who now and again walked the corridors just to make certain there was still no one worse or complaining of new symptoms in the morning there was a crisp hard frost and the light was sharp with pale sun it was november twentyone days since clement louvain had summoned monk to find his ivory and see the dead body of hodge yer beat it sutton said with a huge grin yer beat the plague miss ester ill take yer ome we beat it she corrected him grinning back at him she lifted her hands tentatively wanting to touch him shake his hand something then she abandoned conventions even the fear of embarrassing him and did what she wished she threw her arms around him and hugged him he stood frozen for a moment then responded gently at first as if she might break then strongly with sheer joy claudine came into the room gasped then whisked around and took hold of flo behind her and hugged her too almost bumping into margaret there was a knock on the door and sutton stepped over and threw it open blinking in amazement when he saw a smartly dressed man with fair hair and a long intelligent face at the moment filled with overwhelming emotion oliver hester said in disbelief rathbone looked questioningly from one to another of them then solely at margaret come in margaret invited him have breakfast with us its perfectly all right then she smiled hugely as well weve beaten it he did not hesitate an instant he strode in and took her in his arms hugging her just as all the others had in a bewilderment of happiness finally he turned to hester you havent been home for over a week ill take you now it was not a question she smiled at him shaking her head thank you oliver but no he cut across her margaret will stay here now you must go home even if you dont think you deserve it monk does ill go home she said meekly ill just go with sutton if you dont mind he hesitated only an instant of course i dont mind he replied mr sutton deserves that honor so hester walked home beside sutton pulling the rat cart smiling all the way snoot sat upright in the front quivering with excitement at all the new sights and smells and the infinite possibility of ratting ahead of him sutton put down the cart in fitzroy street and turned to hester thank you she said with profound sincerity that is far too small a word for what i feel but i dont know any large enough she offered him her hand he took it a little awkwardly yer dont need ter thank me miss ester we done well together yes we did she shook his hand then let it go and turned to walk up to the step she would have to knock or look for her key she had thought rathbone had said monk was home but perhaps she only wanted to believe that how absurd it would be if he were not the door opened as if monk had been watching for her he stood just inside the hall looking thin and ashenfaced his eyes shining with joy so intense he could not speak rathbone had planned thisshe knew it nowbut there was no time even to think of him she walked straight into monks arms and clung to him so fiercely she must have bruised his body she felt him shudder holding on to her with such passion he could scarcely breathe his tears wetting her face it was the rat catcher who softly closed the door leaving them alone fourteen monk stood in the bedroom in the wan morning light looking at hester still sleeping he wanted to stay simply to be as close to her as he could he would like to wait until she woke however long it was and light the fire downstairs regardless of expense he would make the room warm for her bring her whatever she wanted tea toast go out in the rain and buy whatever else she would like and bring it back for her then when she was ready talk about everything tell her all that had mattered to him and learn more than the few bare facts she had told him of her time in portpool lane he wanted to hear the details how she had felt in all the victories and the pain so he could be closer to her before that he had one more idea to pursue he knew nothing about any of the missing crewmen except hodge he was apparently the only one married it was perhaps intrusive to go to his widow now but it was just possible that hodge might have told her something about one of the missing men a woman a place anything at all to help find them he went downstairs and cleaned out the grate clumsily it was not a job he was accustomed to doing and at the end he found himself with rather more cleaning up to do than he had expected then he laid a new fire and lit it when it was drawing nicely he damped it down so it would last he filled the coal buckets to the top and wrote a note for hester saying simply that he loved her at any other time he would have thought it ridiculous but today it was the most natural thing to do he only became selfconscious after he had propped it up on the table and had gone as far as the door coat collar turned up he smiled for a moment then went out into the wind and sleet he had no idea of hodges widows address louvains office was the obvious place to ask however the surgeon or the morgue attendant might know and he would far rather ask them he had too much other business to address with louvain the death of his sisters the whereabouts of his missing crew and his own black rage with him for deliberately sending ruth clark to hester knowing she had plague and to use it to manipulate monk he dared not even think of that the raw emotion it woke in him robbed him of reason of any kind of judgment he wanted to beat louvain with his own hands until he was a bloody pulp and too helpless even to ask for mercy and that blind rage frightened him it woke old memories of another rage which had ended in murder and only by the grace of god had he not been guilty so instead he set out to look for the attendant at the morgue he was walking along the embankment when he heard a scampering of feet the next moment scuffs voice was demanding to know what was the matter with him int yer talkin ter me no more monk stopped taken aback at how pleased he was to see him i was thinking he excused himself think that ard an youll walk straight inter the river scuff said disgustedly wot yer lookin fer now monk smiled at him how about a hot pie then i need to find where the widow of the man from the ship lives the one who was killed wot fell down the ole an broke is ead scuff asked odge yes ow yer gonna do that ask the man at the morgue where she came to see the body scuff gave an exaggerated shudder e wont tell yer int none o yer business but we could ask crow ed find out for yer now he was eager do you think so yeah cmon well get a pie eh scuff looked acutely hopeful monk did as was expected of him with pleasure three quarters of an hour later they were walking back along the street towards the river the wind in their faces crow was concocting a vivid and rather unlikely story in order to obtain the necessary information from the morgue attendant he did not once ask monk why he wanted it he seemed to consider it some kind of professional courtesy they reached the morgue and monk and scuff remained outside while crow went in he emerged fifteen minutes later black hair flying in the wind and a smile of triumph showing brilliant teeth got it he said waving a piece of paper in his hand monk thanked him took the paper and read it then put it in his pocket now what crow asked with interest now i treat you to the best pie i can afford and a hot cup of tea then i go about my business and leave you to go about yours monk replied with a smile youre almighty pleased with yourself crow said suspiciously only half monk replied with sudden honesty ive still got the rest to do do you want that pie or not he treated them handsomely but refused to allow either of them to go with him scuff objected strongly insisting that monk was not safe on his own and unquestionably needed someone to advise him and watch his back while monk reluctantly agreed with him nevertheless he still would not allow him to come with a show of suffering fortitude scuff finally resigned himself to going with crow instead just this once it took monk little more than an hour to find the right small brick house it was in the middle of a long row of exactly similar houses built back to back near the docks in rotherhithe when he knocked on the door she opened it and he recognized her immediately as much for her resemblance to newbolt as for his memory of her at the morgue yeah she said suspiciously he knew she was trying to remember where she had seen him before good morning mrs hodge he said respectfully i am hoping that you can help me cant elp no one she replied without hesitation beginning to close the door i should not be ungrateful for it he forced himself to smile at her she was graceless and abrupt but she must also be frightened and whatever her relationship with her husband had been she must still be raw from his loss and the implied disgrace that he had died of his own drunken carelessness i regret your loss mrs hodge he added quite genuinely it is a terrible thing when a husband or wife dies i dont think anyone else can comprehend it you lost someone she said with surprise no but i am fortunate i very nearly did and only late yesterday evening did i learn that she was all right wot dyer want she asked reluctantly i spose youd better come in but dont get in my way i int got all mornin some of us as gotter work she pulled the door wider and turned to allow him to follow her into the small kitchen at the back seemingly it was the only warm room in the house the black stove was burning and it gave off considerable heatand a smell of soot and smoke that caught in his throat and made his eyes water she seemed oblivious to it he looked around without having intended to there was a stone sink but no drain that would be in the yard at the back with the privy water would be collected from the nearest well or standing pump there were wooden bins for flour or oats several strings of onions hanging from the ceiling and a sack of potatoes leaning against the wall with two turnips and a large white cabbage beside it two scuttles were nearly full of coal and on the wall were hanging three very handsome copper pans she saw his glance i int sellin em she said tartly wot is it yer want i was simply admiring your pans he told her its information im looking for i dont grass it was a flat statement an before yer ask they wasnt stole me bruvver give em to me back in august e bought em fair at a shop up west could prove it i dont doubt you mrs hodge he answered her do you have several brothers just the one why i suppose one like that is more than most people have he said evading the answer the information i wanted has to do with the other men your husband served with on the maude idris i wondered if you knew where any of them lived lived she said in amazement ow the ell should i know you think wi three kids i got time ter go around visitin only if they were close a street or two away maybe they are but i dunno she replied is that all yes thank you im sorry to have wasted your time she frowned why dyer wanna know he created the best lie he could think of actually it was the captain i wanted to find but ill just have to keep looking thank you for your courtesy she shrugged not knowing how to reply he excused himself and went out into the street his mind racing he had the beginning of an idea a wild terrible possibility that explained everything he was bitterly cold by the time he crossed the river to the north bank again at wapping stairs and the river police station he found durban looking tired and pale sitting at his desk with a mug of hot tea in his hands he regarded monk curiously seeing the relief in him and not knowing what it was monk walked across to the chair opposite him and sat down its all right at the clinic he said unable to keep the emotion out of his voice no new cases in days and its three weeks now since hodges death hester came home last night durban smiled a sweet gentle expression im glad he stood up and walked over to the window away from monk i know we havent finished with louvain monk conceded what he did to the people in the clinic was inhuman so many died and it could have been all of them and if they hadnt been prepared to sacrifice their own lives to stay there the devastation could have been to all london all england and god only knows what beyond durban pursed his lips i think he knew who he was dealing with he answered mrs monks reputation is not unknown it was the best gamble he had other than to kill ruth clark and bury her somewhere im not surprised he couldnt bring himself to do that if she was actually his own mistress his voice dropped he wouldnt be sure she had plague then it was only a danger she might simply have had pneumonia she wasnt his mistress monk replied she was his sister her real name was charity bradshaw she and her husband were coming back from africa he died at sea durbans eyes widened im not surprised louvain wanted her cared for but he should have told mrs monk what the illness could be although i daresay he believed shed refuse her if she knew you think clement louvain the hard man of the river couldnt kill his own sister if she carried the plague monk asked his voice grating with the dreadful irony of the idea now in his mind durban blinked his eyes were pinkrimmed with exhaustion could you he asked wouldnt you have to try every last thing you could to save her monk brushed his hands over his face for all his joy at hesters return he too was physically drained if she was going to spread the disease i dont know but mercy louvain went there to help in the clinic as a volunteer to nurse her sister durbans face was gentle his eyes shining what sublime devotion she went there to nurse her monk replied but she killed her rather than let her leave carrying the plague with her durban stared at him in growing horror he started to speak then stopped still incredulous oh god he said at last i wish you hadnt told me you cant do anything monk said looking up at him if you could i wouldnt have said it shes dead too plague the word was a whisper said with fierce hurting pity it seemed to be torn from somewhere deep inside him as if all his passion were in it monk nodded they buried her properly durban turned his back to monk staring out of the small window the cold light picking out the gray in his hair now was the time monk had to speak no matter how preposterous even if durban thought him insane i went to see mrs hodge today durban was puzzled what for did you think she would know anything about the crew he smiled very slightly hardly a movement of the lips did you think i hadnt thought of that monk was momentarily embarrassed but the idea in him overrode everything else im sorry did you see the copper saucepans in the kitchen i didnt go orme did durban was frowning what about them what does it matter i cant afford to care about petty theft now again the fraction of a smile touched his mouth and disappeared they werent stolen so far as i know monk answered she saw me looking at them and said her brother gave them to her im too tired to play games monk durban said wearily he looked grayfaced close to collapse im sorry monk said quickly and he meant it he liked durban as much as anyone he had known in years more instinctively than he did oliver rathbone she told me she has only one brother and he gave them to her in august she said she could prove that durban blinked frowning harder she cant he was off the coast of africa in august are you saying the maude idris was here then or that newbolt wasnt on her not exactly either monk said very quietly we checked the names of the crew of course but not their appearances durban steadied himself leaning back against the sill for gods sake what are you saying but the hideousness of it was already in his eyes he shook his head but theyre still thereon the ship you told your men to keep them there because it was typhoid monk reminded him maybe louvain told them the same or close enough durban rubbed his hand over his face like a man trying to dispel a nightmare then wed better find out can you use a pistol of course monk replied with no idea whether he could or not durban straightened up ill get orme and half a dozen men but im the only one going below he stared very levelly at monk his eyes seeming to look into his brain that is an order he did not elaborate but walked past him and through the outside office calling for orme as he went he gave his orders concisely and with a clarity no man could misunderstand like a commander going into a last battle the rain had cleared away and the water was bright and choppy with a knifeedge wind blowing from the west when they rowed out monk sat in the stern of the boat cradling his loaded gun as they plied between the ships and the maude idris came clearly into view durban sat in the bow a little apart he glanced at each of his men then gave a barely discernible nod as they drew alongside and he stood up balancing easily even in the pitching boat he hailed the ship and newbolts head appeared over the railing river police durban called out coming aboard newbolt hesitated then disappeared the next moment the rope ladder came pitching over uncurling to fall almost in durbans hands he caught it and climbed upit seemed to monk watching from belowless agilely than before two of the river police went up after him orme and another man guns tucked in their belts and lastly monk leaving only the oarsman in the boat monk climbed over the rail onto the deck where three river police faced newbolt and atkinson there was no sound except the whine of the wind in the rigging and the slap of water against the hull below them what dyer want this time newbolt asked staring sullenly at durban none of us killed odge and none of us elped anyone take the bleedin ivory i know durban replied steadily we dont think anyone killed hodge he died by accident and we know that gould stole the ivory because we have it back so wot dyer want ere then newbolt said irritably if yer wanter do summink useful get bleedin louvain ter unload this ship an pay us off i want to see below deck then we might do that durban replied watching him curiously his face intent wheres mckeever dead newbolt said tersely we got the typhoid still wanna go below i know you have durban replied thats why youve not berthed now open the hatch newbolts eyes flickered and his head came up as if at last he was paying real attention right wot dyer wanter see ill find it for myself durban said grimly you stay up here im coming wi yer newbolt insisted durban took the gun out of his belt and glanced at orme who did the same no you arent newbolt looked startled then suspicious yer no better than the bleedin revenue men he snarled bloody thieves the lot o yer durban ignored him keep them here he ordered his men shoot them if you have to there was no possibility whatever of doubting his intent he took a bullseye lantern from orme and walked over to the hatch monk followed after him as durban reached the hatch he yanked it open and the stench of the enclosed air caught in monks throat turning his stomach he had not remembered it being so strong im going down durban said his face pinched with revulsion you stay here ill tell you if i find anything im coming monk started youre doing as youre told durban snapped at him thats an order or ill have orme hold you at gunpoint monk saw in durbans eyes that there was no point in arguing and no time he stood back and watched as durban swung over the edge found the ladder then took the lantern in his other hand and started down he saw him reach the ledge and look up his eyes dark in the small circle of yellow light he knew as well as monk did that had any of the jury seen the hold of the maude idris they would have known that a man who slipped off the ladder would not land on the ledge injure his head fatally and then lie there his body would have pitched off and gone on down probably breaking his neck or his back when he hit the bottom then monk turned and held the lantern out so he could see as much as possible of the stacked wood and the boxes of spice as far as monk could remember peering down from the top it all seemed exactly the same as when he had been there approximately three weeks before with louvain durban went on down at the bottom he stood still he was directly above the ships bilges monk could not wait he threw his leg over the edge of the opening and started down durban shouted at him and he ignored it he could not leave durban alone with what he now dreaded they would find below him durban knelt holding the light only inches from the boards the marks of a crowbar were clear go back up durban ordered as monk reached the ledge above him it doesnt need two of us monk found himself shaking and he had trouble swallowing the nausea from the sickening smell in the air he ignored the command do as youre told durban said between his teeth monk stayed exactly where he was whats under there the bilges of course durban snapped somebodys taken them up monk observed durbans eyes flashed i can see that get out monk was frozen unable to move even if he had wanted to his skin crawled with the horror he imagined get out durban said looking up at him emotion naked on his face theres no point in both of us being here pass me the crowbar from over there then go back to the deck ill not tell you again somewhere in the darkness a rat dropped onto the floor and scuttled away at last monk obeyed climbing up hand over hand until he reached the air and gasped it freezing and clean into his lungs what is it orme said hoarsely whats down there he put out his hand and half hauled monk over the hatchway and onto the deck i dont know monk replied straightening up nothing yet then what are you doing back here why ave you left im down there smell o bilges got to yer as it there was infinite contempt in ormes voice and in the curl of his lip not for a queasy stomach but for a man who deserted another in the face of trouble i came back up because he ordered me to monk said wretchedly he wouldnt move until i did orme stared at him coldly whats e doin the other officer asked youll find out when he wants to tell you monk retorted they looked at each other but remained silent newbolt and atkinson were standing near the rail sullen and anxious neither moved because the policemens pistols were at the ready and there was enough firepower to stop both of them the wind was whining more shrilly in the rigging a large schooner passed going upriver tacking back and forth its wake rocked the ship slightly finally durbans head appeared above the hatch opening monk was the first to move striding over towards him clasping his hand and hauling him out he looked paperwhite his eyes redrimmed and shocked as if he had seen hell was it monk said yes durban was shuddering uncontrollably with their throats cut all eight of them even the cabin boy not no i told youthroats cut monk wanted to say something but what words could possibly carry the horror that was in him durban stood on the deck breathing slowly trying to gain control of his limbs his racing heart the trembling of his body finally he looked at orme arrest these men for murder he commanded pointing at newbolt and atkinson mass murder if they try to escape shoot themnot to kill just to cripple shoot them in the stomach the third one is down below possibly dead leave him just batten down the hatch thats an order no one is to go below do you understand me orme stared at him in disbelief then slowly understanding came at least partially theyre river pirates yes orme was white they killed the whole crew except hodge i suppose they left him because he was married to newbolts sister orme rubbed his hands over his face staring at durban then suddenly he came to attention and did as he was commanded durban walked over to the rail and leaned against it monk followed him are you going to arrest louvain he asked durban stared ahead of him at the churning water and the shoreline where the tide was rising against the pier stakes and washing ever higher over the steps for what he asked murder the men will no doubt say he ordered them even paid them durban replied but hell say he didnt and theres no proof for gods sake monk exploded he knows these arent his crew he has to know they murdered everyone except hodge it doesnt matter whether he knows it was because they had plague or because they simply wanted to take the ship he gulped durban said nothing if louvain paid these men monk went on turning to face durban the knifeedge wind stinging his face he must have been aboard the ship to do it someone would have taken him seen him therell be a chain of proof we cant let him get away with it i wont there are a dozen arguments he can come up with durban said wearily these are the men who killed the crew we wont be able to prove that louvain even knew about it much less ordered it we cant tell anyone his reason and he knows that im going to find him monk said rage almost choking the air out of his lungs monk but monk would not listen if durban would not or could not make louvain answer for what he had done then monk would no matter what it cost he strode along to the ladder swung over the rail and scrambled down towards the boat not caring if he skinned his knuckles or bruised his elbows louvain had cost mercy her lifeand seven other women theirs it was only by the grace of god that hester and margaret had not died as well it could have been half of londonit could have been half of europe louvain had gambled that hester would be prepared to give her own life to prevent it he landed in the boat take me ashore he ordered now the oarsman took one look at his face and obeyed digging the blades into the water with all his strength as soon as they reached the shore monk thanked him and stepped out his foot sliding on the wet stone he grasped at the wall and went up as fast as he could at the top he turned straight for louvains office without even glancing behind him to see the boat begin its journey back you cant go in there sir mr louvains busy the clerk shouted at him as he went past bumping into another clerk with a pile of ledgers and only just avoiding knocking the man over he apologized without turning around he reached louvains office door lifted his hand to knock then changed his mind and simply opened it louvain was at his desk a pile of papers in front of him a pen in his hand he looked up at the interruption but without alarm then he saw monk and his face darkened what do you want he said sharply im busy your thief got off isnt that enough for you monk had to make an intense effort to control himself even to keep his voice from shaking he realized with amazement that part of him had respected louvain even liked him it was that which made his rage so nearly uncontrollable now this was the same man who had been dazed by the beauty of the great landscapes of the world who had longed to sail beyond the horizon in the great clippers with their staggering beauty a man he had almost confided in did anyone tell you that your sister died he asked instead he was not even certain what made him say it louvains face tightened it hurt him and he could not conceal it she was very ill he said softly not charity monk saw louvains eyes widen in using her name he had at once told louvain how much more he knew he drove home the far deeper pain i meant mercy you knew charity would die when you took her to portpool lane and you didnt care seven other women died as well and wed all have died if hester and the others hadnt been prepared to sacrifice their own lives to keep it in louvain was staring at him his eyes wide his hands on the desktop whiteknuckled youre speaking as if its over he said hoarsely in portpool lane it is louvain leaned back and let his breath out slowly then it is over everywhere his body went limp he almost smiled its finished monk forced his next words through clenched jaws and what about the crew of the maude idris mckeever died of it and so did hodge how about the rest of them he watched louvain intently if they havent got it now they wont he answered and monk saw barely a flicker of regret in his face lets go and see monk suggested straightening his body his hands sweating his breath uneven im busy louvain answered his eyes met monks and they stared at each other across the silent room monk thought of mercy of margaret ballinger of bessie and the other women whose names he did not know but mostly of hester and the hell it would have been for him without her louvain became aware of a change in the air between them he sat back the moment of understanding was gone they were enemies again im busy he repeated challenging monk to act monk wanted to smile but his face was stiff come with me to see them now he said softly or shall i tell newbolt and atkinson what kind of a ship theyre on do you think they will wait there then dont you think theyll hunt you down anywhere everywhere for the rest of your life louvains skin blanched of every trace of color leaving him graywhite he drew in his breath to defy monk but knew that his face had betrayed him this time monk could laugh it was a grating sound choked inside him you know what they are he said you know what theyll do to you now are you coming or do i tell them louvain stood up very slowly what for youll get nothing monk you cant prove i knew ill say i paid off the others at gravesend and these men brought the ship up to the pool if you like monk replied in that instant he knew exactly what he was going to do the resolve inside him set like steel louvain sensed the change and he also knew that he could not fight it he straightened up and came around the desk he was moving slowly with the tense animal grace of a man who knows his own physical power what if i say you attacked me he asked almost curiously as if the answer did not really matter you wont monk replied because by the time you show there is any truth in that youll be dead i will have shot younot to kill in the stomach and newbolt and atkinson will still be there mckeevers dead by the way plague i imagine louvain stood still what do you want monk i want you on the maude idris go ahead of menow slowly both of them moving as if wading against the tide they went out through the office clerks looked up but no one spoke louvain opened the outer door and winced as the icy air struck him but monk allowed him no time to collect a coat there might have been a weapon in the pocket they walked across the street and onto the quayside louvain shuddering with cold it was a brilliant afternoon the sun low in the west in the shortening day light dancing gold on the water they had only a few minutes to wait for a boat and monk ordered the oarsman to take them out neither of them spoke as they sat the waves slapping against the wood of the hull the occasional spray was like ice when they reached the maude idris monk told louvain to go up the ladder then followed after him durban was alone louvain looked startled he swung around to monk monk took the gun out of his belt im taking mr louvain down to see the crew he told durban may i borrow the lantern again ill take him durban answered you stay up here monk stared at him he looked exhausted his face flushed his eyes sunken no im doing this besides the state youre in he might jump you durban started to argue and monk pushed past him thrusting the lantern into louvains hands you go first he ordered all the way down if you stop ill shoot you and believe me i will durban leaned against the rail dont be long he said the tide turns in a quarter of an hour i need you to go ashore then there was a finality in his eyes and his voice louvain started down the ladder and monk followed one hand on the rungs the other awkwardly holding his gun he had to do this he had to see louvains face when he stood in the hold and looked down into the bilges monk needed him to smell the plague to breathe it in to know the stench of it so that for the rest of his life it would stalk his dreams as an old man he would wake screaming soaked in sweat enclosed again in the creaking rolling ship with the corpses of the men he had had killed the smell was far worse it was like a thickness in the air as they went down hand over hand towards the ledge louvain stopped monk could hear his breathinggasping labored he looked down at his face and saw the sweat standing out on it his eyes like holes in his head sockets dark keep moving monk ordered whats the matter can you smell them then as he looked past louvain at the open bilges where durban had torn up the wood his stomach heaved so violently he nearly lost his grip on the ladder the boat swayed in the wash of something passing and the water in the bilges slopped forward carrying the bloated head and shoulders of a dead man his eyes were eaten out and his face rotted but the fearful gash in his throat was still plain and the stench so overpowering it made his senses swim thats your crew louvain monk said gasping to control his nausea can you smell the plague its the black death there was a scrabbling of clawed feet and a flurry of squeaks then a rat dropped into the bilges with a plop louvain screamed and flung himself upwards the lantern falling from his hands to land with a crash and the light went out louvain was still screaming monk started up again desperate for the air he reached the ledge panic welling up inside him horror inconceivable at what lay below him in the dark and the madman at his heels he saw the square of sky at the hatch darken for a moment as durban began down were coming up he shouted its all right durban hesitated louvain reached the ledge and monk realized it half a second too late he caught the movement out of the corner of his eye and then louvains arms were around him clinging as if to squeeze the air out of him break his ribs and crush his lungs and his heart he could not escape his only choice was to lunge forward with his head louvain did not let go monk twisted sideways and bit louvains wrist as hard as he could feeling his teeth break skin and his mouth fill with blood louvain yelled and his grip loosened but he was blind with terror he swung at monk but monk moved and caught only a glancing blow on the shoulder you had their throats cut monk gasped out even the poor bloody cabin boy theyd have died anyway you fool louvain said between his teeth his hands reaching for monks throat but i couldnt tell anyone that if youd had the stomach for it youd have done the same id have taken the ship out again monk lunged at him fists clenched and louvain sidestepped bringing them closer so they were locked together muscles straining and lose my cargo louvain replied grunting with effort his face was running with sweat i need that clipper this was quickbetter than dying of the plague i thought youd see that he punched monk hard but the blow caught him on the hip instead of the stomach monk gagged with pain doubling forward but you took your sister to portpool lane to spread the plague there so londons got a few less whores louvain retorted i knew your wife wouldnt let it go beyond that i couldnt kill charity she was my sister monk swung his leg back and kicked louvain on the shin as hard as he could when louvains hold weakened for a moment monk struck him with all the force of rage he possessed all the horror and loss that had drenched him night and day for the last week louvain staggered twisting his own arm to strike back he teetered on the rim for wild hideous seconds then plunged over the edge limbs flailing and landed with a crash on the broken boards of the hold floor his head a foot away from the swirling bilges awash with blood and their cargo of dead men flesh bloated and eaten throats gaping in eternal silence monk fell to his knees and was sick then he crept to the edge and stared down vertigo made him grasp the wood as if it were salvation although the drop to the hold floor was no more than twelve or fourteen feet there was no sound but the slurp of water and the scraping of rats louvain lay on his back his eyes were open and monk knew instantly that he could see but he could not move his back was broken the ship swayed monk clung on even harder horror at what lay below him crawling over his skin and running off him in a cold sweat louvain slid closer to the yawning bilges the weight of his body carrying him along the slimy angled floor monk stared at him knowing what was going to happen with the next lurch of the ship and seeing in louvains eyes that he knew it also the moment froze like an everlasting hell the ship swayed again louvain slithered to the edge of the boards hesitated a ghastly moment then helpless to save himself slipped into the nightmare of the bilges bumping against the swollen bodies of the cabin boy and two dead rats his own weight took him down monk saw his white face for a moment then the putrid water closed over him and he was no more distinguishable from the rest of the corpses slewing back and forth monk closed his eyes and saw in his mind the same scene burned into his brain time seemed to have stopped he saw it frozen forever help me get the sails up it was durbans voice at his shoulder monk avoided the policemans eyes and grasped the hand held out to help him he staggered to his feet help me get the sails up durban repeated the tides turning and theres a stiff breeze from the west two should do it three at most sails monk said stupidly what for its a plague ship durban replied we cant let it put ashore not here not anywhere monk was reeling with fearful inescapable thoughts you mean can you think of anything else durban said quickly his face looked gray in the light from the hatch your men monk began ashore help me get the sails up then you can go too theres the lifeboatyou can take it monk was balancing with difficulty his trouble was not the faint rolling of the ship but the sick horror in his mind you cant sail it alone where to theres nowhere you can take it out beyond gravesend and open the seacocks durban answered his voice little above a whisper the seall clean her way down at the bottom itll be a good burial now lets get out of here and up into the air the smell is making me sick as he spoke he turned and started climbing again monk followed hand after hand until he stood on the deck gasping the icecold evening air sweet as the light that poured across from the west etching the waves with fire he could not remember much about raising a sail but as durban told him what to do some familiarity from childhood on the northeastern seaboard gave skill to his fingers one great canvas slowly unfurled and with their combined weight and strength began to crawl up the mainmast they lashed it close straight into the wind then moved to the second together they went to the winch and lifted the anchor monk completed the last few turns as durban went back to the wheel and slowly turned her to catch the wind in one sail then the next it was hard workand with only two of them dangerous as the canvas billowed out and they picked up speed monk turned to look at durban it was a kind of insane and terrible triumph they were sailing a drowned ship on a sea of gold heading towards the shadows of the east and the dying day its time you went durban said raising his voice above the wind and the water before we put on speed ill help you launch the longboat monk was stunned what do you mean if i take the longboat now how will you get ashore durbans face was quite calm the wind burning his cheeks to scarlet i wont ill go down with her its a better way than waiting for the other death monk was too shattered to speak he opened his mouth to deny it to refuse to grant the possibility but it was foolish even as the thought entered his mind he should have seen it before and he had not the sweating the burning cheeks the exhaustion the carefully bittenback pain and above all the way durban had kept a distance between himself and monk even his own men recently go durban said again no i cant they were near the rail the ship was gathering speed the water churning alongside them the words were the last monk said before he felt a weight jolting hard against him the rail had caught him in the back then the water closed over his head cripplingly cold smothering drowning out everything else he fought to hold his breath to beat his way up to the surface for seconds the will to live driving out everything else he broke into the air gasping and saw the huge bulk of the maude idris already fifty feet away and moving faster he shouted after it no idea what he was saying just bellowing in fury and grief for an instant he saw durbans figure in the stern his arm lifted in salute then he moved away and monk was left to thrash around and think how he was going to make his way to shore without being drowned run down by another ship or simply frozen to death he had swum only a few strokes hampered by his sodden clothes and was already overwhelmed when he heard a shout and then another with a mighty effort he twisted around in the water and saw a boat with at least four men at the oars bearing down on him rapidly he recognized orme leaning over the side of the bow arms out the boat reached him and even though they shipped the oars the speed of it made it a desperate armwrenching struggle to grasp monk it took three men to haul him on board then the moment he landed they threw their weight behind the oars again hurling them forwards after the maude idris which was going ever faster as the wind filled her sails but she was a heavy ship and the lighter boat was closing the gap monk sat in the stern shuddering with cold the wind was making his wet clothes feel like ice on his skin but he was only peripherally aware of it all his thoughts were on durban would it help to rescue him it was the action of instinct of the heart the driving compulsion of a friend but was it really the best thing to do did honor and dignity not require that he be allowed to die his own way is that not what monk or any of these men around him would choose for themselves did they know had durban told them nohe couldnt have or they might have prevented him guessing what he might do they would not believe the enormity of plague the certain death the hideousness of it dare he tell them now they were still closing on the maude idris the lowering sun made her spread sails gleam like the wings of a great bird as she cut through the water they were clear of the pool of london and the other ships were behind them she was heading down limehouse reach past the isle of dogs but it was a long way to the sea with many places where she would have to come about and go on the other tack could durban manage alone guts apart from his weakened condition could any man perhaps orme guessed was that what these men around him breaking their backs at the oars really wantedto make sure that the maude idris did not crash into a pier or another ship or run aground he hoped not he prayed it was out of concern for durban durban was struggling with another sail slowly agonizing with the strain it went up the mast a foot at a time monk did not even realize that he was leaning forward on his seat his muscles aching with the effort as if he were hauling the great sail himself putting his own strength against the heavy canvas the sun in his eyes the light blinding him off the river slowly the ship pulled ahead of them again widening the distance not a man in the longboat spoke the oarsmen moved with steady rhythm faces intent breath forced from their lungs beside monk orme never took his eyes off the ship ahead her sails were bellying full now the white wake creaming behind her as she sped down limehouse reach with the isle of dogs to the left monk looked at orme and saw the horror and grief in his face seawater mixed with tears durban was forced to come about clumsily on the bend for a moment he lost control and they closed in on him again monk ached as he watched they were within twenty yards of her they could see him working frantically to control the great booms and stop her from luffing and going over orme was standing up half crouching forward his face a mask of passion and despair monk did not even realize that he too was shouting but durban took no notice he succeeded in coming about and righting the ship all the sails filled again and the maude idris pulled away from them past greenwich the sun was low a pool of fire on the horizon behind them only the gathering purple of the evening lay ahead and the darkness over the bugsby marshes to the south durban was on the deck again black against the shining gold of the sails he raised both arms in a signal a gesture of victory and farewell then he disappeared down the forward hatch monk clung to the gunwale of the boat his hands frozen his body shaking and numb with cold he could hardly breathe for it seconds went by a minuteit seemed like eternitythen another minute the maude idris was still gaining speed then it happened at first it was only a dull sound monk did not even realize what it was until he saw the sparks and the gout of flame the second crash was far louder as the ships magazine exploded and the flames roared upward engulfing the decks and leaping up the sails soon she was a pillar of fire in the encroaching night an inferno a holocaust of burning wood and canvas sweeping towards the deserted mud of the shore carrying with it durban louvain the river pirates and the corpses of the crew it was at once a vikings pyre and a plague ships burial she lurched into the shallows and stuck the white heat gone the light dying red the water rushing in monk stood in the boat beside orme his body freezing and exhausted his mind burned through to the core with grief and pride the tears were wet on his face and his hands too numb to feel orme reach out and grip hold of him in a moment of understanding a loss too deep to endure alone he was barely aware of one of the other men taking off his own coat and putting it around his shoulders the warmth would come later in the time still ahead
