jeffery deaver the devils teardrop a novel of the last night of the century with thanks to madelyn i the last day of the year a thorough analysis of an anonymous letter may greatly reduce the number of possible writers and may at once dismiss certain suspected writers the use of a semicolon or the correct use of an apostrophe may eliminate a whole group of writers osborn and osborn questioned document problems the diggers in town the digger looks like you the digger looks like me he walks down the wintry streets the way anybody would shoulders drawn together against the damp december air hes not tall and not short hes not heavy and not thin his fingers in dark gloves might be pudgy but they might not his feet seem large but maybe thats just the size of his shoes if you glanced at his eyes you wouldnt notice the shape or the color but only that they dont seem quite human and if the digger glanced at you while you were looking at him his eyes might be the very last thing you ever saw he wears a long black coat or a dark blue one and not a soul on the street notices him pass by though there are many witnesses herethe streets of washington dc are crowded because its morning rush hour the diggers in town and its new years eve carrying a fresh fields shopping bag the digger dodges around couples and singles and families and keeps on walking ahead he sees the metro station he was told to be there at exactly am and he will be the digger is never late the bag in his maybepudgy hand is heavy it weighs eleven pounds though by the time the digger returns to his motel room it will weigh considerably less a man bumps into him and smiles and says sorry but the digger doesnt glance at him the digger never looks at anybody and doesnt want anybody to look at him dont let anybody click let anybody see your face look away remember i remember click look at the lights he thinks look at the click at the new years eve decorations fat babies in banners old man time funny decorations funny lights funny how nice they are this is dupont circle home of money home of art home of the young and the chic the digger knows this but he knows it only because the man who tells him things told him about dupont circle he arrives at the mouth of the subway tunnel the morning is overcast and being winter there is a dimness over the city the digger thinks of his wife on days like this pamela didnt like the dark and the cold so she click she what did she do thats right she planted red flowers and yellow flowers he looks at the subway and he thinks of a picture he saw once he and pamela were at a museum they saw an old drawing on the wall and pamela said scary lets go it was a picture of the entrance to hell the metro tunnel disappears sixty feet underground passengers rising passengers descending it looks just like that drawing the entrance to hell here are young women with hair cut short and briefcases here are young men with their sports bags and cell phones and here is the digger with his shopping bag maybe hes fat maybe hes thin looking like you looking like me nobody ever notices the digger and thats one of the reasons hes so very good at what he does youre the best said the man who tells him things last year youre the click click the best at the digger walks to the top of the down escalator which is filled with people disappearing into the pit he reaches into the bag and curls his finger around the comfy grip of the gun which may be an uzi or a mac or an intertech but definitely weighs eleven pounds and is loaded with a hundredround clip of longrifle bullets the diggers hungry for soup but he ignores the sensation because hes the click the best he looks toward but not at the crowd waiting their turn to step onto the down escalator which will take them to hell he doesnt look at the couples or the men with telephones or women with hair from supercuts which is where pamela went he doesnt look at the families he clutches the shopping bag to his chest the way anybody would if it were full of holiday treats one hand on the grip of whatever kind of gun it is his other hand curledoutside the bagaround what somebody might think is a loaf of fresh fields bread that would go very nicely with soup but is in fact a heavy sound suppressor packed with mineral cotton and rubber baffles his watch beeps nine am he pulls the trigger there is a hissing sound as the stream of bullets begins working its way down the passengers on the escalator and they pitch forward under the fire the hush hush hush of the gun is suddenly obscured by the screams oh god look out jesus jesus whats happening im hurt im falling and things like that hush hush hush and all the terrible clangs of the missesthe bullets striking the metal and the tile that sound is very loud the sounds of the hits are much softer everyone looks around not knowing whats going on the digger looks around too everyone frowns he frowns nobody thinks that they are being shot they believe that someone has fallen and started a chain reaction of people tumbling down the escalator clangs and snaps as phones and briefcases and sports bags fall from the hands of the victims the hundred rounds are gone in seconds no one notices the digger as he looks around like everyone else frowning call an ambulance the police the police my god this girl needs help she needs help somebody hes dead oh jesus my lord her leg look at her leg my baby my baby the digger lowers the shopping bag which has one small hole in the bottom where the bullets left the bag holds all the hot brass shells shut it off shut off the escalator oh jesus look somebody stop it stop the escalator theyre being crushed things like that the digger looks because everybodys looking but its hard to see into hell below is just a mass of bodies piling up growing higher writhing some are alive some dead some struggling to get out from underneath the crush thats piling up at the base of the escalator the digger is easing backward into the crowd and then hes gone hes very good at disappearing when you leave you should act like a chameleon said the man who tells him things do you know what that is a lizard right that changes color i saw it on tv the digger is moving along the sidewalks filled with people running this way and that way funny funny nobody notices the digger who looks like you and looks like me and looks like the woodwork whose face is white as a morning sky or dark as the entrance to hell as he walksslowly slowlyhe thinks about his motel where hell reload his gun and repack his silencer with bristly mineral cotton and sit in his comfy chair with a bottle of water and a bowl of soup beside him hell sit and relax until this afternoon and thenif the man who tells him things doesnt leave a message to tell him not tohell put on his long black or blue coat once more and go outside and do this all over again its new years eve and the diggers in town while ambulances were speeding to dupont circle and rescue workers were digging through the ghastly mine of bodies in the metro station gilbert havel walked toward city hall two miles away at the corner of fourth and d beside a sleeping maple tree havel paused and opened the envelope he carried and read the note one last time mayor kennedy the end is night the digger is loose and their is no way to stop him he will kill againat four eight and midnight if you dont pay i am wanting million dollars in cash which you will put into a bag and leave it two miles south of rt on the west side of the beltway in the middle of the field pay to me the money by hours only i am knowing how to stop the digger if you xxxx apprehend me he will keep killing if you kill me he will keep killing if you dont think im real some of the diggers bullets were painted black only i know that this was havel decided about as perfect an idea as anybody couldve come up with months of planning every possible response by the police and fbi anticipated a chess game buoyed by that thought he replaced the note in the envelope closed but didnt seal it and continued along the street havel walked in a stooped lope eyes down a pose meant to diminish his sixtwo height it was hard for him though he preferred to walk tall and stare people down the security at city hall one judiciary square was ridiculous no one noticed as he walked past the entrance to the nondescript stone building and paused at a newspaper vending machine he slipped the envelope under the stand and turned slowly walking toward e street warm for new years eve havel was thinking the air smelled like fallrotten leaves and humid wood smoke the scent aroused a pang of undefined nostalgia for his childhood home he stopped at a pay phone on the corner dropped in some coins and dialed a number a voice answered city hall security havel held a tape recorder next to the phone and pressed play a computergenerated voice said envelope in front of the building under the post vending machine read it now its about the metro killings he hung up and crossed the street dropping the tape recorder into a paper cup and throwing the cup into a wastebasket havel stepped into a coffee shop and sat down in a window booth where he had a good view of the vending machine and the side entrance to city hall he wanted to make sure the envelope was picked upit was before havel even had his jacket off he also wanted to see whod be coming to advise the mayor and whether reporters showed up the waitress stopped by his booth and he ordered coffee and though it was still breakfast time a steak sandwich the most expensive thing on the menu why not he was about to become a very wealthy man daddy tell me about the boatman parker kincaid paused he set down the castiron skillet he was washing hed learned never to be alarmed by anything the children askedwell never to appear alarmedand he smiled down at the boy as he dried his hands with paper towels the boatman he asked his nineyearold son you bet what do you want to know the kitchen of parkers house in fairfax virginia was fragrant with the smells of a holiday meal in the works onion sage rosemary the boy looked out the window said nothing go ahead parker encouraged tell me robby was blond and had his mothers blue eyes he wore a purple izod shirt and tan pants cinched at the waist with a ralph lauren belt his floppy cowlick leaned to the starboard this morning i mean the boy began i know hes dead and everything thats right parker said he added nothing more never tell the children more than they ask this was one of the rules from parker kincaids handbook for the single parenta guide that existed solely in his mind yet one he referred to every day its just that outside sometimes it looks like him i mean i looked outside and its like i could see him what do we do when you feel like that i get my shield and my helmet the boy recited and if its dark i put the lights on parker remained standing usually when he had serious conversations with his children he subscribed to the eyelevel approach but when the subject of the boatman arose a therapist had recommended that parker standto make the boy feel safe in the presence of a strong protective adult and there was something about parker kincaid that induced a sense of security just forty he was talla little over six feetand was nearly in as good shape now as hed been in college thanks not to aerobics or health clubs but to his two childrenand their soccer scrimmages basketball frisbee tourneys and the familys regular sunday morning runs well parkers runhe usually brought up the rear behind their bicycles as they looped around a local park lets take a look okay where you think you saw him okay you have your helmet and your shield right here the boy patted his head and then held up his left arm like a knights thats a good one ive got mine too parker mimicked the boys gestures they walked to the back door see those bushes robby said parker looked out over his half acre in an old development twenty miles west of washington dc his property was mostly grass and flower beds but at the back of the land was a tangle of forsythia and kudzu and ivy hed been meaning to cut back for a year sure enough if you squinted some of the vegetation did resemble a human form that looks spooky parker conceded sure does but you know the boatman was a long time ago he wasnt going to minimize the boys fear by pointing out that hed been scared only by some scruffy bushes but he wanted to give robby a sense of distance from the incident i know but how long ago was it four years robby answered isnt that a long time pretty long i guess show me he stretched his arms out this long maybe i think its longer parker stretched his arms out farther as long as that fish we caught at braddock lake that was this long the boy said starting to smile and holding his own arms out naw it was this long parker gave an exaggerated frown no no it was this long the boy danced from one foot to the next hands up high it was longer parker joked longer robby ran the length of the kitchen lifting one arm then he ran back and lifted the other it was this long thats how long a shark is parker cried no a whale no a giant squid no i knowa tufted mazurka a creature from if i ran the zoo robby and stephie loved dr seuss parkers nickname for the children was the whosafter the creatures in horton hears a who which was their absolute favorite story of all time beating even pooh parker and robby played a game of indoor tag for a few minutes then he caught the boy in his arms for a brief tickle fest know what parker asked gasping what how bout tomorrow we cut down all those bushes can i use the saw the boy asked quickly oh theyre ready for any opportunity he thought laughing to himself well see parker said all right robby danced out of the kitchen memories of the boatman lost under euphoria at the promise of power tools he ran upstairs and parker heard some gentle bickering between brother and sister about which nintendo game to play stephanie it seemed won and the infectious mario bros theme wafted through the house parkers eyes lingered on the brush in the backyard the boatman he shook his head the doorbell rang he glanced into the living room but the children hadnt heard it he walked to the door and swung it open the attractive woman offered a broad smile her earrings dangled below her sharpedged hair which was bleached blonder than usual by the sun robbys was her shade while stephanies was closer to parkers brown her tan was scrupulous well hello parker said tentatively he glanced past her and was relieved to see that the engine of the beige cadillac parked in the driveway was still running richard was behind the wheel reading the wall street journal hi parker we just got in to dulles she hugged him you were where were you st croix it was wonderful oh relax god your body language i just stopped by a minute you look good joan i feel good i feel really good i cant tell whether you look good parker you look pale the kidsre upstairs he turned to call them no thats all right joan started to say robby stephie your mommys here thuds on the stairs the whos turned the corner fast and ran up to joan she was smiling but parker could see that she was miffed hed called them mommy youre all tan stephie said tossing her hair like a spice girl robby was a cherub stephanie had a long serious face which parker hoped would start to look intimidatingly intellectual to boys by the time she turned twelve or thirteen where were you mommy robby said frowning the caribbean didnt daddy tell you a glance at parker yes hed told them joan didnt understand that what the children were upset about wasnt miscommunication about her travel plans but the fact she hadnt been in virginia for christmas did you have a nice holiday she asked we got an air hockey and i beat robby three games this morning but i got the puck in four times in a row he said did you bring us something joan looked in the direction of the car of course i did but you know i left them in the suitcase i just stopped by for a minute now to say hi and to talk to your father ill bring your presents tomorrow when i come to visit stephie said oh and i got a soccer ball and the new mario bros and the whole set of wallace gromit robby stepped on his sisters recitation and i got a death star and a millennium falcon and tons of micro machines and a sammy sosa bat and we saw the nutcracker did you get my package joan asked uhhuh stephie said thank you the girl was impeccably polite but a barbie doll in a pageant dress no longer held any interest for her eightyearolds now were not the eightyearolds of joans childhood daddy took back my shirt robby said and got one the right size i told him to do that if it didnt fit joan said quickly i just wanted you to have something we didnt get to talk to you on christmas stephie said oh joan replied to her daughter it was so hard to call from where we were staying it was like gilligans island the phones were never working she tousled robbys hair and after all you werent home she was blaming them joan had never learned that nothing was ever the childrens fault not at this age if you did something wrong it was your fault if they did something wrong it was still your fault oh joan it was subtle lapses like thisthe slight shifting of blamethat were as bad as slaps in the face still he said nothing never let the children see their parents argue joan stood richard and i have to go now we have to pick up elmo and saint at the kennel the poor puppies have been in cages all week robby was animated once more were having a party tonight and were going to watch the fireworks on tv and play star wars monopoly oh thatll be fun joan said richard and i are going to kennedy center for an opera you like the opera dont you stephie gave one of the broad cryptic shrugs shed been using a lot lately in response to adults questions thats a play where people sing the story parker said to the children maybe richard and ill take you to the opera sometime would you like that i guess robby said which was as good a commitment as a nineyearold would ever make to high culture wait stephie blurted she turned and pounded up the stairs honey i dont have much time we the girl returned a moment later with her new soccer outfit handed it to her mother my said joan thats pretty holding the clothes awkwardly like a child whos caught a fish and isnt sure she wants it parker kincaid thinking first the boatman now joan how the past was intruding today well why not after all it was new years eve a time to look back joan was obviously relieved when the children ran back to stephies bedroom buoyed by the promise of more presents then suddenly her smile was gone ironically at this ageshe was thirtynineshe looked her best with a sullen expression on her face she touched her front teeth with the tip of her finger to see if they were dotted with lipstick a habit of hers he remembered from when they were married parker i didnt have to do this she was reaching into her coach purse hell she got me a christmas present and i didnt get her one he thought quickly did he have any extra gifts hed bought but hadnt yet given away something he could but then he saw her hand emerge from the purse with a wad of papers i couldve just let the process server take care of it on monday process server but i wanted to talk to you before you went off halfcocked the top of the document read motion to modify child custody order he felt the blow deep in his stomach apparently joan and richard hadnt come directly from the airport but had stopped at her lawyers first joan he said despairing youre not i want them parker and im going to get them lets not fight about it we can work something out no he whispered no he felt the strength leach from his body as the panic swept through him four days with you fridays and weekends with me depending on what richard and i have plannedweve been doing a lot of traveling lately look itll give you more time to yourself id think youd look forward to absolutely not theyre my children she began technically parker had had sole custody for four years parker she said reasonably my life is stable im doing fine im working out again im married to a civil servant in county government who according to the washington post just missed getting indicted for accepting bribes last year richard was just a bugpicking bird on the rump of insidethebeltway politics he was also the man joand been sleeping with for the last year of her marriage to parker concerned the children would hear he whispered youve been a stranger to robby and stephie practically from the day they were born he slapped the papers and rage took him completely are you thinking about them at all about what thisll do to them they need a mother no parker thought joan needs another collectible several years ago it had been horses then championship weimaraners then antiques houses in fancy neighborhoods too she and richard moved from oakton to clifton to mclean to alexandria moving up in the world shed said though parker knew shed simply grown tired of each previous house and neighborhood when she failed to make friends in the new locale he thought of what uprooting the children that frequently would do to them why he asked i want a family have children with richard youre young but she wouldnt want that parker knew as much as shed loved being pregnantshe was never more beautifulshe had fallen apart at the work involved with infants you can hardly have children when emotionally youre one yourself youre completely unfit parker said my you have learned how to take the gloves off havent you well maybe i was unfit but thats in the past no thats in your nature ill fight it joan he said matteroffactly you know that she snapped ill be by tomorrow at ten and im bringing a social worker what he was dumbfounded just to talk to the kids joan on a holiday parker couldnt imagine that a social worker would agree to this but then he realized that richard must have pulled some strings if youre as good a father as you think you are you wont have any trouble with them talking to her i dont have any trouble im thinking of them just wait until next week how do you think theyll feel having some stranger crossexamining them on the holiday its ridiculous they want to see you parker she said exasperated shes a professional shes not going to crossexamine them look i have to run the kennels closing soon because of the holiday those poor puppies oh come on parker its not the end of the world but yes he thought thats exactly what it is he began to slam the door but halfway through the gesture he stopped knowing that the sound would upset the whos he closed the door with a firm click turned the dead bolt put the chain on as if trying to lock this cyclone of bad news out folding the papers without looking at them he walked into the den and stuffed them into the desk left a message for his lawyer he paced for a few minutes then climbed the stairs and stuck his head in robbys room the children were giggling and tossing micro machines at each other no bombardiering on new years eve parker said so its okay to bombardier tomorrow robby asked very funny young man he started it stephie sniped then returned to her book little house on the prairie who wants to help me in the study he called i do robby cried together father and son disappeared down the stairs into his basement office a few minutes later parker heard the electronic music again as stephie exchanged literature for computer science and sent intrepid mario on his quest once more mayor gerald kennedya democrat yes but not that strain of kennedyslooked at the piece of white paper on his desk mayor kennedy the end is night the digger is loose and their is no way to stop him attached to the sheet was an fbi memo which was headed annexed document is a copy metshoot case metshoot kennedy thought metro shooting the bureau loved their labels he recalled sitting hunched like a bear over the ornate desk in his georgian office in the very ungeorgian washington dc city hall kennedy read the note once more looked up at the two people seated across from him a trim attractive blond woman and a tall lean grayhaired man balding kennedy often thought of people in terms of their hair youre sure hes the one behind the shooting what he said about the bullets the woman said them being painted that checked out were sure the notes from the perp kennedy a bulky man comfortable with his bulk pushed the note around on his desk with his huge hands the door opened and a young black man in a doublebreasted italian suit and oval glasses walked inside kennedy gestured him to the desk this is wendell jefferies the mayor said my chief aidedecamp the woman agent nodded margaret lukas the other agent gave what seemed to kennedy to be a shrug cage they all shook hands theyre fbi kennedy added jefferiess nod said obviously kennedy pushed the copy of the note toward the aide jefferies adjusted his designer glasses and looked at the note shit hes gonna do it again so it seems the woman agent said kennedy studied the agents cage was from ninth street fbi headquartersand lukas was the acting special agent in charge of the washington dc field office her boss was out of town so she was the person running the metro shooting case cage was older and seemed well connected in the bureau lukas was younger and appeared more cynical and energetic jerry kennedy had been mayor of the district of columbia for three years now and he had kept the city afloat not on experience and connections but on cynicism and energy he was glad lukas was the one in charge prick cant even spell jefferies muttered lowering his sleek face to read the note again his eyes were terrible a malady shared by his siblings a good portion of the young mans salary went to his mother and her two other sons and two daughters in southeast dc a good deed that jefferies never mentionedhe kept it as quiet as the fact that his father had been killed on east third street while buying heroin for kennedy young wendell jefferies represented the best heart of the district of columbia leads the aide asked lukas said nothing weve got vicap involved district police behavioral down in quantico and fairfax prince william and montgomery county police but we dont have anything solid jesus jefferies said checking his watch kennedy looked at the brass clock on his desk it was just after am twelve hundred hours noon he mused wondering why the extortionist used twentyfourhour european or military time we have two hours jefferies said youll have to make a statement jerry soon i know kennedy stood why did this have to happen now why here he glanced at jefferiesthe man was young but kennedy knew had a promising political career ahead of him he was savvy and very quick jefferiess handsome face twisted into a sour expression and kennedy understood that he was thinking exactly the same thing that the mayor was why now kennedy glanced at a memo about the special reviewing stand at the new years eve fireworks tonight on the mall he and claire his wife would be sitting with representative paul lanier and the other key congressional zookeepers of the district or they would have been if this hadnt happened why now why my city he asked them whatre you doing to catch him it was lukas who answered and she answered immediately were checking cisconfidential informantsand bureau handlers whove got any contact with domestic or foreign terrorist cells so far nothing and my assessment is this isnt a terrorist profile it smells like a bythebook profit crime then ive got agents comparing past extortion schemes to try to find a pattern were looking at any other threats the district or district employees have received in the past two years no parallels so far the mayors gotten some threats you know jefferies said about the moss situation whats that cage asked lukas answered the board of education whistleblower the guy ive been babysitting oh him cage shrugged to jefferies agent lukas said i know about the threats ive looked into them but i dont think theres a connection they were just your routine anonymous threats from pay phones no money was involved and there were no other demands your routine anonymous threats kennedy thought cynically except that they dont sound so routine if your wife picks up the phone at in the morning and hears dont push the moss investigation or youll be as fucking dead as hes gonna be lukas continued in terms of standard investigation ive got agents running license plates from every car parked around city hall this morning were also running the tags from cars around dupont circle were checking out the drop area by the beltway and all the hotels apartments trailers and houses around it you dont sound optimistic kennedy grumbled im not optimistic therere no witnesses no reliable ones anyway a case like this we need witnesses kennedy examined the note once again it seemed odd that a madman a killer should have such nice handwriting to lukas he said so i guess the question isshould i pay now lukas looked at cage he answered we feel that unless you pay the ransom or an informer comes forward with solid information about the diggers whereabouts we wont be able to stop him by four pm we just dont have enough leads she added im not recommending you pay thiss just our assessment of whatll happen if you dont twenty million he mused without a knock the office door opened and a tall man of about sixty wearing a gray suit stepped inside oh great kennedy thought more cooks in the kitchen us representative paul lanier shook the mayors hand and then introduced himself to the fbi agents he ignored wendell jefferies paul kennedy told lukas is head of the district governance committee though the district of columbia had some autonomy congress had recently taken over the power of the purse and doled out money to the city like a parent giving a reckless child an allowance especially since the recent board of education scandal lanier had been to kennedy what an auditor is to a set of accounting books lanier missed the disparaging tone in kennedys voicethough lukas seemed not toand the congressman asked can you give me a headsup on the situation lukas ran through her assessment once more lanier remained standing all three buttons of his brooks brothers suit snugly secured why here lanier asked why washington kennedy laughed to himself the pricks even stolen my rhetorical questions lukas answered we dont know kennedy continued you really think hed do it again yes the congressman asked jerry youre not seriously thinking of paying im considering all options lanier was looking dubious well arent you concerned with what itll look like no i dont care how it looks kennedy snapped but the congressman continued in his politicians perfect baritone its going to send the wrong message kowtowing to terrorists kennedy glanced at lukas who said it is something to think about the floodgates theory you give in to one extortionist therell be others but nobody knows about this do they kennedy nodded to the note sure they do cage said and morell know pretty soon you cant keep something like this under wraps for long notes like this have wings you bet they do wings kennedy repeated disliking the expression intensely and all the happier that lukas was running the show he asked her what can you do to find him if we do pay lukas again responded our tech peoplell rig the drop bagwith a transmitter twenty million will weigh a couple hundred pounds she explained its not something you can just hide under the seat of a car well try to track the perp to his hideout if were lucky get both him and the shooterthis digger lucky kennedy said skeptically she was a pretty woman he thought though the mayorwhod been married to his wife for thirtyseven years and had never once considered cheating on herknew that beauty is mostly expression of eye and mouth and posture not godgiven structure and margaret lukass face hadnt once softened since shed walked into his office no smile no sympathy her voice was flinty now as she said we cant give you percentages no of course you cant twenty million mused lanier the controller of the purse strings kennedy rose pushed his chair back and stepped to a window looked out on the brown lawn and trees speckled with dead leaves the winter in northern virginia had been eerily warm for the past several weeks tonight the forecasters were predicting would be the first big snow of the year but at the moment the air was warm and humid and the scent of decomposing vegetation wafted into the room it was unsettling across the street was a park in the middle of which was a big dark modern statue it reminded kennedy of a liver he glanced at wendell jefferies who took the cue and joined him the aide wore aftershave he must have had twenty different scents the mayor whispered so wendy the pressures on huh the aide never known for his restraint responded you got the ball boss drop it and you and me both were gone and more than that too and more than that too and kennedy had thought things couldnt get any worse after the board of education scandal and so far kennedy said no leads nothing so far twentythree people dead so far all they knew was that this psychopath was going to try to kill more people at oclock and more after that and more after that outside the window the eerily warm air stirred five lacy brown leaves twisted to the ground he turned back to his desk looked at the brass clock the time was lanier said i say we dont pay i mean it seems to me that when he finds out the fbis involved he might just balk and head for the hills agent lukas offered bet he had an idea the bureaud be involved before he started this kennedy picked up on her sarcasm lanier again remained oblivious the congressman continued speaking to her i didnt think you were in favor of paying im not but you also think hell keep shooting if we dont pay yes she answered well lanier lifted his hands isnt that inconsistent you dont think we should pay but hes going to keep killing thats right that doesnt give us much guidance lukas said hes a man whos prepared to kill as many people as he needs to just to make money you cant negotiate with somebody like that will paying make your job harder kennedy asked harder to catch him no she said a moment later so she asked are you going to pay or not the desk lamp shone on the note to kennedy it seemed that the piece of paper glowed like white fire no were not paying lanier said were taking a hard line were standing tough on terrorism were im paying said kennedy you sure lukas asked him not seeming to care one way or the other im sure do your best to catch them but the citys going to pay hold on the congressman said not so fast its not fast at all kennedy snapped ive been considering it since i got this goddamn thing he gestured at the fiery note jerry lanier began laughing sourly you dont have the right to make that decision actually he does said wendell jefferies who could append the letters jd and llm after his name congress has jurisdiction lanier said petulantly cage said to lanier no it doesnt its exclusively the districts call i asked the attorney general on my way over here but weve got control of the money lanier snapped and im not going to authorize it kennedy glanced at wendy jefferies who thought for a moment twenty million we can draw on our line of credit for discretionary spending he laughed but itll have to come out of the board of education reserve theyre the only account thats majorly liquid thats the only place thats it its debt or nickels and dimes everywhere else kennedy shook his head how goddamn ironicthe money to save the city was available only because someone had cut corners and landed the administration in the middle of a huge scandal jerry this is ridiculous lanier said even if they get these men somebody else could try the same thing next month never deal with terrorists thats the rule in washington dont you read department of state advisories no i dont kennedy said nobody sends em to me wendy get started on that money and agent lukas go catch this son of a bitch the sandwich was okay not great gilbert havel decided that after he got the money he was going to the jockey club and having a real steak a filet mignon and a bottle of champagne he finished his coffee and kept his eye on the entrance to city hall the chief of police of the district had come and gone quickly a dozen reporters and camera crews had been turned away from the front door directed toward an entrance on the side of the building they hadnt looked happy then a couple of what were clearly fbi agents had disappeared into city hall some time ago a man and a woman and hadnt emerged it was definitely a bureau operation well hed known it would be so far no surprises havel looked at his watch time to go to the safe house call the helicopter charterer there was a lot to get ready for the plans for picking up the million were elaborateand the plans for getting away afterward were even more so havel paid his checkwith old crumpled singlesand pulled his coat and cap on again he left the coffee shop turned off the sidewalk and walked quickly through an alley eyes down the judiciary square metro stop was right beneath city hall but he knew it would be watched by police or agents so he headed for pennsylvania avenue where hed get a bus down to southeast dc white man in a black mans hood life sure is funny sometimes gilbert havel emerged from the alley and turned onto a side street that would take him to pennsylvania the light changed to green havel stepped into the intersection suddenly a flash of dark motion from his left he turned his head thinking shit he doesnt see me he doesnt see me he doesnt hey havel cried the driver of the large delivery truck had been looking at an invoice and had sped through the red light he glanced up horrified with a huge squeal of brakes the truck slammed directly into havel the driver screaming christ no christ the truck caught havel between its front fender and a parked car crushing him the driver leapt out and stared in shock you werent looking it wasnt my fault then he looked around and saw that the light had been against him oh jesus he saw two people running toward him from the corner he debated for a moment but panic took over and he leapt into his truck he gunned the engine and backed away then sped down the street skidding around the corner the passersby two men in their thirties ran up to havel one bent down to check for a pulse the other just stood over him staring at the huge pool of blood that truck the standing one whispered he just took off he just left then he asked his friend is he dead oh yeah the other man said oh yeah hes dead where margaret lukas lay on her lean belly on a rise overlooking the beltway traffic sped past an endless stream she looked at her watch again and thought where are you her belly hurt her back hurt her elbows hurt thered been no way to get a mobile command post near the ransom drop zoneeven a disguised mcpand not be seen by the extortionist if he was anywhere near so here she was in jeans jacket and cap turned backward like a sniper or gangsta lying on the rockhard ground where theyd been for an hour sounds like water cage said what the traffic he lay on his belly too next to her their thighs nearly touchingthe way lovers might lie on a beach watching the sunset they studied the field a hundred yards away they were overlooking the money drop near gallows road yes gallows an irony so rich that not one of the agents had bothered to comment on it you know how that happens cage continued something gets under your skin and you try not to think about it but you cant help it i mean it sounds like water it didnt sound like water to lukas it sounded like cars and trucks where was the unsub theres million bucks there for the taking and hes not taking it where the hell is he muttered another voice it belonged to a somber man of about thirty with a military hairstyle and bearing leonard hardy was with the district of columbia police and was part of the team because even though the bureau was handling the operation it would look bad not to have a district cop on board lukas would normally have protested having nonbureau personnel on her team but she knew hardy casually from his assignments at the bureaus field office near city hall and didnt mind his presenceas long as he kept doing what hed done so far sitting quietly by himself and not bothering the grownups whys he late hardy mused again apparently not expecting an answer his immaculate hands with perfectly trimmed nails continued to jot notes for his report to the district chief of police and the mayor anything she turned her head calling in a whisper to tobe geller a curlyhaired young agent also decked out in jeans and one of the same navyblue reversible windbreakers that lukas wore geller in his thirties too had the intensely cheerful face of a boy who finds complete contentment in any product filled with microchips he scanned one of three portable video monitors in front of him then he typed on a laptop computer and read the screen zip he responded if there was any living thing larger than a raccoon for a hundred yards around the ransom bags gellers surveillance equipment would detect it when the mayor had given the goahead to pay the extortion money the cash had made a detour en route to the drop lukas and geller had had kennedys aide shepherd the money to an address on ninth street in the districta small unmarked garage that was up the street from fbi headquarters there geller had repacked the ransom into two huge burgess security systems kl knapsacks the canvas of which looked like regular cloth but was in fact impregnated with strands of oxidized coppera highefficiency antenna the transmitter circuitry was in the nylon handles and batteries were mounted in the plastic buttons on the bottom the bag transmitted a global positioning system beacon cleaner than cbss main broadcast signal and couldnt be shielded except by several inches of metal geller had also rewrapped forty bundles of hundreddollar bills with wrappers of his own designthere were ultrathin transmitting wafers laminated inside them even if the perp transferred the cash from the canvas bag or it was split among accomplices geller could still track down the moneyup to a range of sixty miles the bag had been placed in the field just where the note had instructed all the agents had backed off and the waiting began lukas knew her basic criminal behavior extortionists and kidnappers often get cold feet just before a ransom pickup but anyone willing to murder twentythree people wasnt going to balk now she couldnt understand why the perp hadnt even approached the drop she was sweating the weather was oddly warm for the last day of the year and the air was sickly sweet like fall margaret lukas hated autumn shed rather have been lying in the snow than waiting in this purgatory of a season where are you she muttered where she rocked slightly feeling the pain of pressure on her hipbones she was muscular but thin with very little padding to protect her from the ground she compulsively scanned the field once more though gellers complex sensors would have picked up the unsub long before her bluegray eyes could spot him hmm c p ardell a heavyset agent lukas worked with sometimes squeezed his earphone and listened nodded his bald pale head he glanced at lukas that was charlie position nobodys gone off the road in the woods lukas grunted so maybe she was wrong shed thought the unsub would come at the money from the westthrough a row of trees a half mile away from the expressway she believed that hed be driving a hummer or a range rover would snag one of the bagssacrificing the other for the sake of expediencyand disappear back into the woods bravo position she asked ill check said c p who worked undercover often because of his unfortunate resemblance to a manassas drug cooker or a hells angel charter member he seemed to be the most patient of all the agents on the stakeout he hadnt moved his pound frame an inch since theyd been here he made the call to the southernmost surveillance post nothing kids on a fourwheeler is all nobody older than twelve our people didnt chase em away did they lukas asked the kids nup good make sure they dont more time passed hardy jotted notes geller typed on his keyboard cage fidgeted and c p did not your wife mad lukas asked cage you working the holiday cage shrugged it was his favorite gesture he had a whole vocabulary of shrugs cage was a senior agent at fbi headquarters and though his assignments took him all over the country he was usually primary on cases involving the district he and lukas worked together often along with lukass boss too the special agent in charge of the washington dc field office this week though sac ron cohen happened to be in a brazilian rainforest on his first vacation in six years and lukas had stepped up to the case largely because of cages recommendation she felt bad for cage and geller and c p working a holiday they had dates for tonight or wives as for len hardy she was happy he was here he had some pretty good reasons to keep himself busy on holidays and this was one of the reasons that she had welcomed him to the metshoot team lukas herself had a comfortable home in georgetown a place filled with antique furniture needlepoints and embroideries and quilts of her own design an erratic wine collection nearly five hundred books more than a thousand cds and her mixedbreed labrador jean luc it was a very nice place to spend a holiday evening though in the three years shed lived there lukas had never once done so until her pager had signaled her ascension to the metshoot command she had planned to spend the night babysitting that board of education whistleblower gary moss the one whod broken the school construction kickback scandal moss had worn a wire and had picked up all sorts of good incriminating conversations but his cover had been blown and the other day his house had been firebombed his daughters nearly killed moss had sent his family to stay with relatives in north carolina and he was spending the weekend in federal protection lukas had been in charge of his protection as well as handling the investigation into the firebombing but then the digger arrived and moss was at the moment nothing more than a bored tenant in the very expensive apartment complex referred to among law enforcers as ninth street fbi headquarters she now scanned the field again no sign of the extortionist he might be staking us out a tactical agent crouched behind a tree said you want a perimeter sweep no its standard procedure he persisted we could use five six handoff cars hed never spot us too risky she said uhm you sure im sure abrupt responses like this had earned lukas a reputation in the bureau for being arrogant but she believed that arrogance is not necessarily a bad thing it instills confidence in those who work for you it also gets you noticed by your bosses her eyes flickered as a voice crackled in her earphone speaking her name go ahead she said into the stalk mike recognizing the voice of the deputy director of the bureau weve got a problem he said she hated dramatics what she asked not caring a bit about the abrasion in her voice the dep director said there was a hitandrun near city hall a little while ago white male he was killed no id on him nothing at all just an apartment keyno addressand some money the cop who respondedd heard about the extortion thing and since it was near city hall thought there might be a connection she understood immediately they compared prints she asked his and the ones on the extortion note thats right the dead guys the one who wrote the note the shooters partner lukas remembered part of the note it went something like if you kill me he will keep killing nothing can stop the digger youve got to find the shooter margaret the deputy director said there was a pause as apparently he looked at his watch youve got to find him in three hours is it real parker kincaid wondered bending over the rectangle of paper peering through his heavy tenpower hand glass joan had been gone for several hours but the effect of her visitthe dismaystill lingered trying though he was to lose himself in his work the letter he examinedon yellowing paperwas encased in a thin strong poly sleeve but when he eased it closer to him he did so very carefully the way youd touch a babys red fat face he adjusted the light and swooped in on the loop of the lowercase letter y is it real it appeared to be real but in his profession parker kincaid never put great stock in appearances he wanted badly to touch the document to feel the rag paper made with so little acid that it could last as long as steel he wanted to feel the faint ridge of the irongallide ink which to his sensitive fingers would seem as raised as braille but he didnt dare take the paper from the sleeve even the slightest oil from his hands would start to erode the thin letter which would be a disaster since it was worth perhaps if it was real upstairs stephie was navigating mario through his surreal universe robby was at parkers feet accompanied by han solo and chewbacca the basement study was a cozy place paneled in teak carpeted in forestgreen pile on the walls were framed documentsthe less valuable items in parkers collection letters from woodrow wilson fdr bobby kennedy the old west artist charles russell many others on one wall was a rogues galleryforgeries parker had come across in his work parkers favorite wall though was the one opposite the stool he sat on this wall contained his childrens drawings and poems going back over the past eight years from scrawls and illegible block letters to samples of their cursive writing he often paused in his work and looked at them doing so had given him the idea about writing a book on how handwriting mirrors childrens development he now sat on the comfortable stool at an immaculate white examination table the room was silent normally hed have the radio on listening to jazz or classical music but thered been a terrible shooting in the district and all the stations were having special reports on the slaughter parker didnt want robby to hear the stories especially after the boys flashback to the boatman he hunched over the letter eagerly the way a jeweler appraises a beautiful yellow stone ready to declare it false if thats how he saw it but secretly hoping that it will turn out to be rare topaz whats that robby asked standing and looking at the letter its what came in the truck yesterday parker said squinting as he checked out an uppercase k which can be written a number of different ways and therefore is very useful in handwriting analysis oh the armored car that was neat it was neat but it didnt answer the boys question parker continued you know thomas jefferson third president oh and he lived in virginia like us good thiss a letter that somebody thinks he wrote they want me to check it and make sure one of the more difficult conversations hed had with robby and stephie was explaining what he did for a living not the technical part of being a questioned document examiner but that people would forge letters and documents and try to claim they were real whats it say the boy asked parker didnt answer right away oh answers were important to him he was after all a puzzle masterhis lifelong hobby was riddles and word games and brainteasers he believed in answers and he tried never to defer responding to his childrens questions when a mother or father said later it was usually for their convenience hoping the child would forget the question but the content of this letter made him hedge after a moment he said its a letter jefferson wrote to his oldest daughter this much was true but parker didnt go on and tell the boy that the subject of the letter was maryhis second daughterwho had died of complications from childbirth as had jefferson s wife some years before he read back here in washington i live under a sorrowful pall haunted as i am by visions of polly on horseback and running along the porch in goodnatured defiance of my prescriptions to her to exercise more caution parker certified document examiner struggled to ignore the sadness he felt reading those words concentrate he told himself though the terrible image of a father being deprived of one of his children kept intruding a sorrowful pall concentrate he observed that the girls nickname in the letter was what jefferson would have usedborn mary the girl was called polly by her familyand that the punctuationsparse style was typically jeffersonian these attested to authenticity so did some of the events that the letter referred to they had in fact occurred in jefferson s life and had done so around the time the letter had purportedly been written yes textually at least the letter seemed real but that was only half the game document examiners are not only linguists and historians they are scientists too parker still had to perform the physical examination of the letter as he was about to slip it under one of his bausch lomb compound microscopes the doorbell rang again oh no parker closed his eyes it was joan he knew it shed picked up her dogs and returned to complicate his life further maybe she had the social worker with her now a surprise commando raid ill get it robby said no parker said quickly too quickly the boy was unnerved by his abrupt reaction father smiled at son ill go and slid off the stool climbed the stairs he was mad now he was determined that the whos would have a fun new years eve despite their mother he flung the door open well hello parker it took him a second to remember the name of the tall grayhaired man he hadnt seen the agent for years then he recalled cage he didnt recognize the woman standing beside him how you doin parker never expected to see me in a month of blue mondays did you wait im mixing up my expressions but you get the picture the agent had changed very little a bit grayer a little more gaunt he seemed taller parker remembered that cage was exactly fifteen years older than he they shared june as a birth month gemini yinyang from the corner of his eye parker saw robby appear in the hallway with his coconspirator stephie word of visitors spreads fast in a household of children they edged closer to the door gazing out at cage and the woman parker turned and bent down dont you two have something to do up in your rooms something very important no stephie said uhuh robby confirmed well i think you do what how many legos are on the floor how many micro machines a couple robby tried a couple of hundred well the boy said grinning upstairs now up up or the monsterll take you up there himself do you want the monster do you no stephie shrieked go on parker said laughing let daddy talk to his friend here as they started up the stairs cage said oh not hardly a friend right parker he didnt respond he closed the door behind him and turned back appraising the woman she was in her thirties with a narrow smooth face pale nothing like joans relentless tan she wasnt looking at parker but was watching robby climb the stairs through the lacecurtained window beside the door she then turned her attention to him and reached out a strong hand with long fingers she shook his hand firmly im margaret lukas asac at the washington field office parker recalled that within the bureau assistant special agents in charge were referred to by the acronym pronounced asack while the heads of the offices were called sacs an aspect of his former life he hadnt thought about for years she continued could we come inside for a minute a parental warning alarm went off he responded you mind if we stay out here the children her eyes flickered and he wondered if she considered this a snub but that was just too bad the kids exposure to the bureau was limited to sneaking a look at scully and mulder on the xfiles when sleeping over at friends houses he planned on keeping it that way fine with us cage said for both of them hey last time i saw you man it was a while ago we were at jimmys you know his thing on ninth street thats right it was in fact the last time parker kincaid had been at the bureau headquarters standing in the large courtyard surrounded by the somber stone building a hot july day two years ago he still got occasional emails about what a fine speech hed delivered at the memorial service for the jim huang who was one of parkers former assistants hed been gunned down on his first day as a field agent parker remained silent cage nodded after the kids theyre growing they do that parker answered what exactly is it cage the agent gave a shrug toward lukas we need your help mr kincaid she said quickly before the stream of breath accompanying parkers question evaporated parker tilted his head its nice out here cage said looking up fresh air linda and i should move get some land maybe loudon county you watch the news parker i listen huh radio i dont watch tv thats right you never did cage said to lukas wasteland hed call tv he read a lot wordsre parkers domain his bailiwick whatever the hell a bailiwick is you told me your daughter reads like crazy she still do that the guy in the subway parker said thats what youre here about metshoot lukas said thats what weve acronymed it he killed twentythree people wounded thirtyseven six children were badly injured there was a what is it you want he interrupted worried that his own children might hear this lukas responded thiss important we need your help what on earth could you possibly want from me im retired cage said uhhuh sure retired lukas frowned looked from one to the other was this rehearsed a good copconfused cop thing it didnt seem to be still another important rule in his invisible parental handbook was get used to being doubleteamed he was on his guard now you still do document examination youre in the yellow pages and youve got a web site its good i like the blue wallpaper he said firmly im a civilian document examiner lukas said cage tells me you were head of the document division for six years he says youre the best document examiner in the country what weary eyes she has parker thought shes probably only thirtysix or thirtyseven great figure trim athletic beautiful face yet what shes seen look at those eyes like bluegray stones parker knew about eyes like that daddy tell me about the boatman i only do commercial work i dont do any criminal forensics he was also candidate for sac eastern district yeah yeah im not kidding cage said this as if he hadnt heard parker except he turned it down lukas lifted her pale eyebrows and that was years ago parker responded sure it was cage said but youre not rusty are you parker cage get to the point im trying to wear you down the graying agent said cant be done ah im the miracle worker remember to lukas he said see parker didnt just find forgeries he used to track people down because of what they wrote where they buy writing paper pens things like that best in the business she already said you said that parker said acerbically déjà vu all over again cage observed parker was shiveringbut not from the cold from the trouble these two people represented he thought of the whos he thought of their party tonight thought of his exwife he opened his mouth to tell lanky cage and deadeye lukas to get the hell out of his life but she was there first bluntly she said just listen the unsub parker remembered unknown subject an unidentified perp and his partner the shooter have this extortion scheme the shooter lights up a crowd of people with an automatic weapon every four hours starting at four this afternoon unless the city pays mayors willing to and we drop the money but the unsub never shows up why hes dead you believe the luck cage said on his way to collect twenty million and he gets nailed by a delivery truck parker asked why didnt the shooter pick up the money cause the shooters only instructionsre to kill lukas said he doesnt have anything to do with the money classic lefthand righthand setup lukas seemed surprised he hadnt figured it out the unsub turns the shooter loose with instructions to keep going if he doesnt get a call to stop that way well hesitate to cap the perp in a tac operation and if we collar the unsub hes got leverage to work out a plea bargain in exchange for stopping the shooter so cage said weve gotta find him the shooter the door behind him started to open parker quickly said to lukas button your jacket what she asked as robby stepped outside parker quickly reached forward and tugged her jacket closed hiding the large pistol on her belt she frowned at this but he whispered i dont want him to see your weapon he put his arm around his sons shoulders hey who how you doing stephie hid the controller i did not she called didnt didnt i was winning and she hid it parker said frowning wait isnt it connected with a cord she unplugged it stephieeffie is that controller going to appear in five seconds four three two i found it she called my turn robby cried and charged up the stairs again once more parker noticed lukass eyes follow robby as he climbed to the second floor whats his name lukas asked robby but what did you call him oh who its my nickname for the kids after wahoo she asked your alma maters team no its from a dr seuss book parker wondered how she knew hed gone to the university of virginia look cage im sorry but i really cant help you you understand the problem here boy cage continued the only link weve gotthe only clue at allis the extortion note run it by pert the bureaus physical evidence response team lukass thin lips grew slightly thinner if we have to we will and well get a psycholinguistic from quantico and ill have agents check out every goddamn paper and pen company in the country but thats what were hopin youd take over on cage filled in you can look at it you can tell us whats what stuff nobody else can maybe where he lived maybe where the shooters going to hit next parker asked what about stan stanley lewis was the current head of the bureaus document division parker knew the man was good hed hired lewis years ago as an examiner he recalled that theyd spent an evening drinking beer and trying to outdo each other forging john hancocks signature lewis had won hes in hawaii for the sánchez trial even in a tomcat we cant get him back here before the next deadline its at four lukas repeated it wont be like last time parker cage said softly thatll never happen again lukass head swiveled between the two men once again but parker didnt explain what cage had meant he wasnt talking about the past hed had enough past for one day im sorry any other time maybe but i cant now he was imagining what would happen if joan found out he was working on an active investigation shit parker what do i have to do we have nothing lukas said angrily no leads we have a few hours until this crazy shoots up another crowd of people there were children shot down parker waved his hand abruptly to silence her ill have to ask you to leave now good luck cage shrugged looked at lukas she handed parker her card with the goldembossed seal of the justice department on it parker had once had cards just like these the typeface was cheltenham condensed ninepoint cell phones on the bottom look at least if we have any questions you mind if we call parker hesitated no i dont thank you goodbye parker said stepping back into the house the door closed robby stood on the stairs who were they daddy he said that was a man i used to work with did she have a gun robby asked that lady did you see a gun parker asked him yeah then i guess she had one did you work with her too the boy asked no just the man oh she was pretty parker started to say for a lady cop but he didnt back here in washington i live under a sorrowful pall haunted as i am by visions of potty on horseback parker back in his basement study alone now found himself thinking of the letter in front of him as ql fbi document lab procedures dictated that questioned documents were called qs authentic documents and handwriting samplesalso called knownswere referred to as k s it had been years since hed thought of the suspect wills and contracts he analyzed as qs this intrusion of police mindset into his personal life was unsettling nearly as troubling as joans appearance forget about cage forget about lukas concentrate back to the letter hand glass in front of his face he now noted that the authorwhether it had been jefferson or nothad used a steel pen he could see the unique flow of ink into fibers torn by the nib many forgers believe that all old documents were written with feather quills and use those exclusively but by steel pen points were very popular and jefferson did most of his corresponding with them one more tick on the side of authenticity i think of your mother too at this difficult time and though my dear i do not want to add to your burden i wonder if i might impose on you to find that portrait of polly and your mother together do you recall it the one mr chabroux painted of them by the well i meant to bring it with me that their faces might sustain me in my darker moments he forced himself not to think about the context of the letter and examined a line of ink where it crossed a fold in the paper he observed there was no bleeding into the gully of the crease which meant the letter had been written before it was folded he knew that thomas jefferson was fastidious about his writing habits and would never have written a letter on a piece of paper that had been previously folded score another point for the document parker looked up stretched he reached forward and clicked on the radio national public radio was broadcasting another story about the metro shootings report that the death toll has risen to twentyfour fiveyearold lavelle williams died of a gunshot wound her mother was wounded in the attack and is listed in critical he shut the radio off looking at the letter moving his hand glass over the document slowly swooping in on a liftwhere the writer finishes a word and raises the pen off the surface of the paper this lift was typical of the way jefferson ended his strokes and the feathering of the ink in the paper how ink is absorbed can tell you many things about the type of materials used and when the document was made over the years ink is drawn more and more into the paper the feathering here suggested it had been written long agoeasily two hundred years but as always he took the information under advisement there were ways to fake feathering he heard the thud of the childrens feet on the stairs they paused then there were louder bangs as first one then the other jumped down the last three steps to the floor daddy were hungry robby called from the top of the basement stairs ill be right there can we have grilled cheese please stephie added parker clicked out the brilliant white examination light on his table he replaced the letter in his vault he stood for a moment in the dim study lit only by a fake tiffany lamp in the corner beside the old couch i meant to bring it with me that their faces might sustain me in my darker moments he climbed the stairs the weapon margaret lukas called abruptly i want the deets on the shooters weapon you want what cage asked deets details she was used to her regular staff who knew her expressions and idiosyncrasies any minute now c p ardell called back thats what theyre tellin me they were in one of the windowless rooms in the bureaus new strategic information and operations center on the fifth floor of headquarters on ninth street the whole facility was nearly as big as a football field and had recently been expanded to let the agency handle as many as five major crises at once cage walked past lukas and as he did so he whispered youre doing fine lukas didnt respond she caught sight of her reflection in one of the fivebyfifteenfoot video screens on the wall on which was displayed the extortion note thinking am i am i doing fine she hoped so lord how she hoped that the legend that went around the bureau was that every agent got one chance to strike gold in his or her career one chance to get noticed one chance to move up exponentially well this sure as hell was hers an asac running a case like this it never happened not in a what had cage said not in a month of blue mondays looking past her reflection at the note which glowed white with spidery black letters on the huge screen what am i not thinking of lukas wondered in her mind she ran through what she had thought of shed sent the dead unsubs fingerprints to every major friction ridge database in the world she had two dozen district cops trying to find the delivery truck that hit him on the chance the unsub uttered some dying words to the driver and had had miracleworker cage secure an immunityfromprosecution waiver on the hitandrun charge to induce the driver to talk she had two dozen agents tracking down wits hundreds of tag numbers were being checked out handlers were milking cis all over the country phone records in and out of city hall for the past two weeks were being checked she was a call came in len hardy started to pick up the phone but cage got to it first hardy had shed the trench coat revealing a white polyester shirt with thin brown stripes and razorcrease slacks and a brown tie despite lying in a northern virginia field for an hour his marineofficer hair was still perfectly in place and there was not a bit of dirt on him he looked less like a detective than a cleancut jehovahs witness about to offer you some brochures on salvation lukas who wore a new glock thought the thin smith wesson revolver on hardys hip was positively quaint you doing okay detective lukas asked him seeing his disgruntled expression as cage swept the phone out from under his nose right as rain he muttered not too sardonically she gave a faint laugh at the expression which she knew was an indigenous midwestern phrase she asked if he was from there i grew up outside chicago downstate well thats what they call iteven though my hometown was northwest of the city he sat down her smile faded right as rain cage hung up got your deets that was firearms gun was an uzi about a year old and there was a lot of barrel spread that weapons seen some serious action mineral cotton in the silencer hand packed it looked like not commercial the shooter knows what hes doing good lukas said she called to c p ardell across the room have somebody check out web sites that give instructions for homemade silencers and converting uzis to full auto i want email addresses of recent hits do they have to give up that info c p asked not without a warrant but make em think they do be persuasive the agent made a call and spoke for a few minutes he reported comtech is on it the bureaus crack computer and communications unit headquartered in maryland to cage lukas said hey got an idea the agent lifted an eyebrow she continued what we can do is get that guy from human resources who cage asked lukas continued that guy who examines applicants handwriting and writes up their personality the district does that too len hardy said its supposed to weed out the wackos whatta you mean c p asked lukas we already sent it to quantico the big agent was referring to a copy of the note that had been sent to the bureaus behavioral section for psycholinguistic profiling tobe geller sat at a computer terminal nearby waiting for the results no no thats to link him to similar mos and profile his education and intelligence lukas said im talking about profiling his personality graphoanalysis dont bother a voice from behind them said lukas turned and saw a man in jeans and a leather bomber jacket he walked into the lab he wore a visitors badge around his neck and was carrying a large attaché case it took a moment to recognize him cage began to speak but stopped himself maybe afraid that hed scare him off artie let me up parker kincaid said the bureaus employee entrance night guard he still remembers me after all these years this was a very different image of kincaid lukas thought hed seemed frumpy at his house it hadnt helped that hed been wearing some godawful sweater and baggy slacks the gray crewneck sweater he wore now over a black shirt seemed much more him mr kincaid lukas said nodding a greeting dont bother with what graphoanalysis you cant analyze personality from handwriting she was put off by his peremptory tone i thought a lot of people do it people read tarot cards too and talk to their dear departed its bogus ive heard it can be helpful she persisted waste of time he said matteroffactly well concentrate on other things well all right lukas pledged that shed try not to dislike him too much cage said hey parker you know tobe geller doubling as our computer and communications man tonight we tracked him down on his way to a ski trip in vermont it was new hampshire the trim agent corrected offering kincaid one of his ready grins for holiday pay ill do anything even break a date hi parker i heard about you they shook hands cage nodded to another desk thiss c p ardell hes from the dc field office nobody knows what c p stands for but thats what he goes by i dont think even he knows did a while ago c p said laconically and this is len hardy hes our district pd liaison nice to meet you sir the detective said kincaid shook his hand dont really need the sir sure you forensic investigative kincaid asked him hardy seemed embarrassed as he said actually im research and statistical everybody else was out in the field so i got elected to liaise wheres the note he asked lukas i mean the original in identification i wanted to see if we could raise a few more prints kincaid frowned but before he could say anything lukas added i told them to use the laser only no ninhydrin his eyebrows lifted good youve worked in forensics she had a sense that even though she was right about not using the chemical he was challenging her i remember from the academy she told him coolly and picked up the phone whats that hardy asked nin as she punched in a number lukas said ninhydrins what you usually use to image fingerprints on paper but kincaid finished her thought it ruins indented writing never use it on suspect documents lukas continued to make her phone callto id the tech told her that there were no other prints on the document and that a runner would bring the note up to the crisis center stat she relayed this to the team kincaid nodded whyd you change your mind cage asked him about coming here he was silent for a moment you know those children you mentioned the ones injured in the subway one of them died with a solemnity that matched his lukas said lavelle williams i heard he turned to cage im here on one condition nobody except the immediate task force knows im involved if theres a leak and my name gets out whatever stage the investigations in i walk and i deny i even know you people lukas said if thats what you want mr kincaid but parker cage said you got it can we ask why my children if youre worried about security we can have a car put on your house as many agents as you im worried about my exwife lukas gave him a quizzical glance kincaid said ive had custody of my children since my wife and i got divorced four years ago and one of the reasons that its me who has custody is that i work at home and i dont do anything thatd endanger them or me thats why i only do commercial document work now it looks like my wifes reopening the custody case she cant find out about this not a single problem in the world parker cage reassured him youll be somebody else who dyou want to be i dont care if you make me john doe or thomas jefferson as long as im not me joans coming by the house tomorrow morning at ten with some presents for the kids if she finds out i went off on new years eve to work on a case itll be bad whatd you tell them lukas asked that a friend of mine was sick and i had to go visit him in the hospital he pointed a finger at cages chest i hated lying to them hated it recalling his beautiful boy lukas said well do our best its not a question of best kincaid said to her easily holding her eye which is something very few men could do its either keep me out of the picture or im gone then well do it she said simply looking around the room c p geller and hardy all nodded all right kincaid took his jacket off pitched it onto a chair now whats the plan lukas ran through the status of the investigation kincaid nodded not saying anything she tried to read his face see if he approved of what she was doing wondered if she cared whether he did or not then she said the mayors going on the air soon to make a plea to the shooter hes going to suggest that well pay the money to him not come right out and say it but hint at it were hoping hell contact us weve got the money downstairs in a couple of trace bags well drop them wherever he wants cage took over then tobe herell track him back to his hideyhole jerry bakers tactical teams on call well nail him when he gets back home or take him down on the road how likely is it hell go for the cash we dont know lukas said when you take a look at the note youll see the unsubthe guy who got killedwas pretty slow if his partner this digger is just as dumb he might not go for it she was thinking of the criminal psychology shed learned at the academy slower perps were far more suspicious than intelligent ones they tended not to improvise even when circumstances changed lukas added which means he might just keep on shooting the way hes been instructed to cage added and we dont even know if the shooterll hear kennedys broadcast but we just dont have a single damn lead lukas noticed kincaid glance down at the major crimes bulletin it was about the firebombing of gary mosss house bulletins like these described the crime in detail and were used to brief subsequent officers on the specifics of a case this one mentioned how mosss two children had just escaped being burned to death parker kincaid stared at the bulletin for longer than he seemed to want to apparently troubled by the stark report of the attempt to murder the family the two children of the subject were able to effectuate an escape from the structure with only minor injuries finally he pushed it away looked around the center taking in the banks of phones computers desks his eyes ended up on the video monitor displaying the extortion note can we set up the readyroom someplace else this is the crisis center lukas said watching him scan the note whats wrong with here were not using most of the space kincaid pointed out and hardly any of the equipment lukas considered this where did you have in mind upstairs he said absently still staring at the glowing note lets go upstairs parker walked through the scicrime document lab looking over the array of equipment he knew so well two leitz binocular stereo microscopes with a volpi intralux fiber optic light source an old foster freeman vsc video spectral comparator and the latest of their video spectral comparatorsthe vsc equipped with a rofin polilight and running qdos software through windows nt also sitting wellused in the corner were a foster freeman esdaan electrostatic detection apparatusand a thinlayer gas chromatograph for ink and trace analysis he noticed the glass windows the tourists paraded past every day nine to four as part of the fbi headquarters tour the corridor was now dark and ominous parker watched the other members of the team find seats at desks and lab tables the room was cluttered smelly and uncomfortable the way real working laboratories were but he preferred to be hererather than in the glitzy crisis centerbecause he firmly believed in something hed learned from his father a historian who specialized in the revolutionary war always fight your battles on familiar ground the professor had told his boy hed chosen not to give this answer to lukas another thing william kincaid had told his son was you dont have to share everything with your allies he glanced into stan lewiss office again saw the books that he himself had used when this had been his department harrison s suspect documents housely and farmers an introduction to handwriting identification and scientific examination of questioned documents by hilton and the bible of the profession questioned documents by albert s osborn he looked at the credenza behind the office chair and recognized the four bonsai trees hed cultivated then left for lewis wheres the note he asked cage impatiently on its way on its way parker turned on several of the instruments some hummed some clicked and some were silent their dim indicator lights glowing like cautious eyes waiting waiting and trying not to think about his talk with the children an hour beforewhen hed told them that their holiday plans were changing both of the whos had been in robbys room the floor still awash with legos and micro machines hey whos i got to the third level stephied said nodding at the nintendo then i got bomped robbyd had a fullscale invasion of his bed underwaywith helicopters and landing craft parker had sat on the bed you know those people who were here before the pretty lady you kept looking at his son had said coyly theyre sharper than youll ever guess reports the handbook well they told me that a friend of mine is sick and i have to go visit him for a little while who do you want to babysit in addition to the standard cast of highschool and college sitters parker had a number of friends in the neighborhoodparents he socialized withwhod gladly take the children for the evening there was also his friend lynne who lived in the district she would have driven to fairfax to help him out but he was sure shed have a date tonight it was impossible to imagine lynne without a date on new years eve and their relationship was no longer at the level where he could ask for a sacrifice like that you have to go robbyd asked tonight when he was disappointed the boy would become very still his expression remaining unchanged he never pouted never grumbledwhich parker would have preferred he just froze as if sadness threatened to overwhelm him as robby had looked up at him unmoving holding a tiny toy helicopter parkerd felt his sons disappointment in his own heart stephie was less emotional and wore those emotions less visibly her only response had been to toss her hair from her face and give him a frown asking is he going to be all right your friend im sure hell be okay but it would be a good thing for me to see him sodo you want me to call jennifer or mrs cavanaugh mrs cavanaugh theyd said almost in unison robby coming out of his dolor mrs cavanaugh the neighborhood grandmother babysat on tuesdayswhen parker sat in on a local poker game parker had stood up surrounded by the sea of toys but youll be back before midnight robbyd asked wont you never make promises if theres any chance you cant keep them im going to try as hard as i can parker had hugged both of the children and then walked to the door daddy stephie had asked pure innocence in her baggy black jeans and hello kitty tshirt would your friend like me to make him a getwell card parker had felt his betrayal as a physical blow thats okay honey i think hed like it better if you just had fun tonight now intruding on these difficult thoughts the door to the document lab swung open a lean handsome agent with sweptback blond hair walked into the room jerry baker he announced walking up to parker youre parker kincaid they shook hands he looked across the lab margaret he called in greeting lukas nodded back youre the tactical expert parker asked him right lukas said jerrys got some s s people lined up search and surveillance parker recalled some good shooters too baker said just dying for a chance to light up this beast parker sat down in the gray chair he said to lukas youve processed the unsubs body yes lukas said do you have the inventory not yet no parker was troubled he had very definite ideas of running investigations and he could see lukas would have definite ideas too he wondered how much of a problem hed have with her handle it delicately or not glancing at her tough facepale as pale marbleparker decided he had no time for niceties in a case with so few leads they needed as many ksknown aspects of the unsubas they could find we better get it he said she responded coolly ive ordered it sent up here asap parker would have sent somebodyhardy maybeto pick it up but he decided not to fight this skirmish hed give it another few minutes he looked at baker how many good guys do we have thirtysix of ours four dozen district pd parker frowned well need more than that thats a problem cage said most actives are on alert because of the holiday therere a couple hundred thousand people in town and a lot of treasury and justice agentsre on security detail what with all the diplomatic and government parties len hardy muttered too bad this happened tonight parker gave a short laugh it wouldnt have happened at any other time the young detective gave him a quizzical look what do you mean he was about to answer but lukas said the unsub picked tonight because he knew wed be shorthanded and because of the crowds in town parker added the shooters got himself a fucking firing range he he paused listening to himself he didnt like what he heard living with the children working largely alone hed softened since hed left the bureau the rough edges were gone he never swore and he tempered everything he said with the whos in mind now he found himself back in his former life his hard life as a linguist parker knew that the first thing an outsider does to adapt to a new group is to talk their talk parker opened his attaché casea portable document examination kit it was filled with the tools of his trade also it seemed a darth vader action figure a present from robby the force be with you cage said our mascot for the night my grandkids love those movies parker propped it up on the examination table wish it were obiwan kenobi who lukas frowned shook her head hardy blurted out you dont know then blushed when she glanced at him coldly parker was surprised too how could somebody not know about star wars just a character in a movie c p ardell told her without a reaction she turned back to a memo she was reading parker found his hand glass which was wrapped in black velvet it was a leitz lens twelve power and was the essential tool of a document examiner joan had given it to him for their second anniversary hardy noticed a book in parkers attaché case parker saw the cop looking at it and handed it to him mind twisters volume hardy flipped through it then passed it to lukas hobby parker explained glancing at her eyes as she scanned the pages cage said oh this man loved his puzzles that was his nickname round here the puzzle master theyre lateral thinking exercises parker said he looked over lukass shoulder and read out loud a man has three coins that total seventysix cents the coins were minted in the united states within the last twenty years are in general circulation and one isnt a penny what are the denominations of the coins wait one of them has to be a penny cage said hardy looked at the ceiling parker wondered if his mind was as orderly as his personal style the cop reflected for a moment are they commemorative coins no remembertheyre in circulation right the detective said lukass eyes scanned the floor her mind seemed to be elsewhere parker couldnt tell what she was thinking geller thought for a minute im not wasting my brain cells on that he turned back to his computer give up parker asked whats the answer cage asked he has a fiftycent piece a quarter and a penny wait hardy protested you said he didnt have a penny no i didnt i said one of the coins wasnt a penny the halfdollar and the quarter arent but one of them is thats cheating cage grumbled it sounds so easy hardy said puzzles are always easy when you know the answer parker said just like life right lukas turned the page she read three hawks have been killing a farmers chickens one day he sees all three sitting on the roof of his chicken coop the farmer has just one bullet in his gun and the hawks are so far apart that he can only hit one he aims at the hawk on the left and shoots and kills it the bullet doesnt ricochet how many hawks are left on the roof its too obvious c p observed wait cage said maybe thats the trick you think it should be complicated but the answer really is the obvious one you shoot one and therere two left end of puzzle is that your answer parker asked cage said uncertainly im not sure lukas flipped to the back of the book thats cheating parker said echoing cage she kept flipping then frowned where are the answers there arent any she asked what kind of puzzle book is that an answer you dont get on your own isnt an answer parker glanced at his watch where the hell was the note lukas turned back to the puzzle studied it her face was pretty joan was dropdead beautiful with her serpentine cheekbones and ample hips and buoyant breasts margaret lukas wearing a tightfitting black sweater was smaller on top and trimmer she had thin muscular thighs revealed by tight jeans at her ankle he caught a glimpse of sheer white stockingsprobably those kneehighs that joan used to wear under her slacks she was pretty daddy for a lady cop a slim young man in a tootight gray suit walked into the lab one of the young clerks who worked in the mail and memo distribution department parker guessed agent cage he said timothy whatve you got for us im looking for agent jefferson parker was saved from asking who by cage tom jefferson yessir he pointed to parker thiss him parker hesitated for only a moment then took the envelope and signed for it carefully writing th jefferson the same way the statesman had done though with a much more careless hand timothy left and parker cocked an eyebrow at cage who said you wanna be anonymous poof youre anonymous but how im the miracle worker i keep telling you the digger is standing in the shadows outside his motel a day kitchenette and free cable we have vacancies this is a lousy part of town reminds the digger of click where where boston no white plains click which is near new new york click hes standing beside a smelly dumpster and watching the front door to his comfy room hes watching people coming and going the way the man who tells him things told him to do watching his front door watching the room through the open curtain come and go cars speed by on the lousy street people walk past on the lousy sidewalk the digger looks like them the digger looks like no one nobody sees the digger excuse me a voice says im hungry i havent eaten the digger turns the man looks into the diggers blank eyes and cant finish his sentence the digger shoots the man with two silenced bullets he falls and the digger hefts the body into the big blue dumpster thinking the silencer needs repacking its not that click not that silent anymore but nobodys heard too much traffic he picks up the shell casings and puts them into his pocket the dumpster is a pretty blue the digger likes colors his wife grew red flowers and his wife grew yellow flowers but no blue flowers he believes looking around nobody else is nearby if somebody looks at your face kill them said the man who tells him things nobody can see your face remember that ill remember that the digger answered he listens to the dumpster silence funny how when youre click when youre dead you dont make any noise funny he goes back to watching the door watching the window watching the people on the sidewalk he checks his watch hes waited for fifteen minutes now its okay to go inside have some soup reload his gun repack the silencer which he learned how to do on a pretty fall day last yearwas it last year they sat on logs and the man told him how to reload his gun and repack the silencer and all around them were pretty colored leaves then he would practice shooting spinning around like a whirligig spinning around with the uzi as leaves and branches fell he remembers the smell of hot dead leaves he liked the forest better than here opening the door walking inside he calls his voice mail and methodically punches in his code one two two five there are no messages from the man who tells him things he thinks hes a little sad that he hasnt heard from the man he hasnt heard a word since this morning he thinks hes sad but he isnt sure what sad is no messages no messages which means he should repack the silencer and reload his clips and get ready to go out again but first hell have some soup and put on the tv have some nice hot soup mayor kennedy the end is night the digger is loose and their is no way to stop him he will kill againat four eight and midnight if you dont pay i am wanting million dollars in cash which you will put into a bag and leave it two miles south of rt on the west side of the beltway in the middle of the field pay to me the money by hours only i am knowing how to stop the digger if you xxxx apprehend me he will keep killing if you kill me he will keep killing if you dont think im real some of the diggers bullets were painted black only i know that documents have personalities the jefferson letter sitting in parkers vault at homewhether a forgery or notwas regal scripty and rich as amber but the extortion note sitting on the fbi examination table here in front of him was choppy and stark still parker was examining it the way he approached any puzzle with no assumptions no preconceptions when solving riddles the mind is like fastdrying plaster first impressions last hed resist drawing any conclusions until hed analyzed the note completely deferring judgment was one of the hardest parts of his job three hawks have been killing a farmers chickens the bullets at the metro he called you found some painted yup jerry baker said a dozen or so black paint parker nodded did i hear you say youd ordered a psycholinguistic we did geller nodded at his computer screen still waiting for the results from quantico parker looked at the envelope that had contained the note it had been placed in an acetate sleeve to which was attached a chainofcustody card headed with the word metshoot on the front of the envelope was written in the same handwriting as the note to the mayorlife and death he donned rubber glovesnot worried about fingerprints but rather about contaminating any trace materials that might be found on the paper he unwrapped his leitz hand glass it was six inches across with a rosewood handle and a glistening steel ring around the perfect glass lens parker examined the glue flap on the envelope whatve we got whatve we got anything he muttered under his breath he often talked to himself when he was analyzing documents if the whos were in his study while he was working they assumed his comments were directed at them and got a kick out being included in daddys job the faint ridges left by the glue application machine at the factory were untouched no spit on the glue he said clicking his tongue angrily dna and serologic information can be lifted from saliva residue on envelope flaps he didnt seal it lukas shook her head as if parker had missed something obvious but we dont need it remember we took blood from the corpse and ran it through the dna database nothing i figured youd run the unsubs blood parker said evenly but i was hoping the diggerd licked the envelope and we could run his spit through the computer after a moment she conceded good point i hadnt thought about that not too full of herself to apologize parker noted even if she didnt seem to mean it he pushed the envelope aside and looked at the note itself again he asked and what exactly is this digger stuff yeah c p ardell piped up we have a wacko here cage offered another son of sam that leonard bernstein guy david berkowitz lukas corrected before she realized it was a joke c p and hardy laughed you could never exactly tell when cage was fooling with you parker recalled the agent was often jokey when investigations were at their most grim it was a type of invisible shieldlike robbysto protect the man inside the agent parker wondered if lukas had shields too maybe like parker himself she sometimes wore her armor in full view sometimes kept it hidden lets call behavioral parker said and see if they have anything on the name digger lukas agreed and cage made the phone call down to quantico any description of the shooter parker asked looking over the note nope cage said it was spooky nobody saw a gun saw muzzle flash heard anything other than the slugs hitting the wall well hitting the vics too incredulous parker asked at rush hour nobody saw anything he was there and then he was gone c p said hardy added like a ghost parker glanced at the detective he was cleancut trim handsome wore a wedding ring had all the indicia of a contented life but there seemed to be a melancholy about him parker recalled that when he was leaving the bureau the exit counselor explained to himunnecessarilyabout the high incidence of depression among law enforcers ghost lukas muttered cynically bending over the letter again studying the cold paper and the black type he read it several times the end is night parker noted that there was no signature which might seem like a pointless observation except that hed assisted in several cases in which perps had actually signed ransom or robbery notes one had been fake intended to lead them off though the scrawled signature provided handwriting samples that ultimately convicted the perp in another case the kidnapper had actually signed his real name perhaps jotted automatically in the confusion of the abduction the perp was arrested seventeen minutes after the victims family received the ransom demand parker moved the powerful examining light closer to the note bent over it heard a neckbone pop talk to me he silently urged the piece of paper tell me your secrets the farmer has just one bullet in his gun and the hawks are so far apart that he can only hit one he wondered if the unsub had tried to doctor his handwriting many criminalssay kidnappers writing ransom noteswill try to disguise their writing to make comparisons more difficult theyll use odd slants and formations of letters but usually they cant do this smoothly its very difficult to suppress our natural hand and document examiners can usually detect tremblea shakiness in the strokeswhen someones trying to disguise his writing but there was no tremble here this was the unsubs genuine writing normally the next step in an anonymouswriting case would be to compare the suspect document with knowns by sending agents to public records offices with a copy of the extortion note and have them plough through files to find a match unfortunately for the team on the metshoot case most writing in public records are in uppercase block or manuscript style please print the directions always admonish and the extortion note had been written in a form of cursive even a document examiner with parker kincaids skill couldnt compare printing with cursive writing but there was one thing that might let them search public files a persons handwriting includes both general and personal characteristics general are the elements of penmanship that come from the method of handwriting learned in school years ago there were a number of different methods of teaching writing and they were very distinctive a document examiner could narrow down a suspects location to a region of the country but those systems of writingthe flowery ladies hand for instanceare gone now and only a few methods of writing remain notably the zanerbloser system and the palmer method but theyre too general to identify the writer personal characteristics though are different these are those little pen strokes that are unique to uscurlicues mixing printing and cursive writing adding gratuitous strokeslike a small dash through the diagonal stroke in the letter z or the numeral it was a personal characteristic that first tipped examiners off that the hitler diaries discovered a few years ago were in fact fake hitler signed his last name with a very distinctive uppercase h but he used it only in his signature not when writing in general the forger had used the ornate capital h throughout the diary which hitler would not have done parker continued to scan the extortion note with his hand glass looking to see if the unsub had had any distinctive personal characteristics in his handwriting daddy youre funny you look like sherlock holmes finally he noticed something the dot above the lowercase letter i most dots above is and js are formed by either tapping the pen directly into the paper or if someone is writing quickly making a dash with a dot of ink to the left and a tail to the right but the metshoot unsub had made an unusual mark above the lowercase isthe tail of the dot went straight upward so that it resembled a falling drop of water parker had seen a similar dot years beforein a series of threat letters sent to a woman by a stalker who eventually murdered her the letters had been written in the killers own blood parker had christened the unusual dot the devils teardrop and included a description of it in one of his textbooks on forensic document examination got something here he said what cage asked parker explained about the dot and how hed named it devils teardrop lukas asked she didnt seem to like the name he guessed she was more comfortable with science and hard data he remembered that shed had a similar reaction when hardy had said that the digger was like a ghost she leaned forward her short blond hair fell forward and partially obscured her face any connection with your perp she asked in that stalker case no no parker said he was executed years ago but thishe nodded toward the sheetcould be the key to finding out where our boy lived how jerry baker asked if we can narrow down the area to a county oreven bettera neighborhood then well search public records hardy gave a short laugh you can actually find somebody that way oh you bet you know michele sindona c p shook his head hardy asked who lukas searched through her apparently vast mental file cabinet of criminal history and said he was the financier the guy who handled the vatican s money right he was arrested for bank fraud but he vanished just before trial he showed up a few months later and claimed he was kidnappedthrown in a car and taken someplace but there were rumors he hadnt been kidnapped at all butd flown to italy then returned to new york i think it was an examiner in the southern district who got samples of sindonas handwriting and found out he had this personal handwriting quirkhe made a dot inside the loop when he wrote the numeral nine agents went through thousands of customs declaration forms on flights from italy to new york they found a dot in the number nine in an address of a card filled in by a passenger who it turned out had used a fake name they lifted one of sindonas latents from it man c p muttered collared because of a dot a little thing like that oh parker said its usually the little things that trip up the perps not always but usually he placed the note under the scanner of the vsc this device uses different light sourcesfrom ultraviolet to infraredto let examiners see through obliterations and to visualize erased letters parker was curious about the crossout before the word apprehend he scanned the entire note and found no erasures other than under the obliteration he then tested the envelope and noticed no erasures whatd you find tell you in a minute dont breathe down my neck cage its twotwenty the agent reminded i can tell time thanks parker muttered my kids taught me he walked to the electrostatic detection apparatus the esda is used to check documents for indented writingwords or markings pressed into the paper by someone writing on pages on top of the subject document the esda was originally developed as a way to visualize fingerprints on documents but the device turned out to be largely useless for that purpose because it also raised indented writing which obscured any latent prints in tv shows the detective rubs a pencil over the sheet to visualize the indented writing in real life it would be malpractice for a document examiner to do this it would probably destroy most indented writing the esda machine which works like a photocopier reveals lettering that was written as many as ten sheets above the document being tested no one quite knows why the esda works so efficiently but no document examiner is without one once after a wealthy banker died parker was hired to analyze a will that disinherited his children and left his entire estate to a young maid parker was very close to authenticating the document the signatures looked perfect the dates of the will and the codicils were logical but his last testthe esdarevealed indented writing that said this one ought to fool the pricks the maid confessed to hiring someone to forge the will parker now ran the unsubs note through the machine he lifted a plastic sheet off the top and examined it nothing he tried the envelope he lifted off the thin sheet and held it up to the light he felt a bang in his gut when he saw the delicate gray lines of writing yes he said excitedly weve got something lukas leaned forward and parker smelled a faint floral scent perfume no hed known her for only an hour but hed decided that she was not the perfume sort it was probably scented soap weve got a couple of indentations parker said the unsub wrote something on a piece of paper that was on top of the envelope parker held the electrostatic sheet in both hands and moved it around to make the writing more visible okay somebody write this down first word lowercase cle then a space uppercase m lowercase e nothing after that cage wrote the letters on a yellow pad and looked at it whats it mean the agent gave a perplexed shrug c p tugged a pierced earlobe and said dont have a clue geller if its not bits and bytes im helpless lukas too shook her head but parker took one look at the letters and knew immediately he was surprised no one else could see it its the first crime scene what do you mean jerry baker asked sure lukas said dupont circle capital mmetro of course hardy whispered puzzles are always easy when you know the answer the first site parker mused but theres something written below it can you see it can you read it he jockeyed the sheet again holding it out to lukas jesus its hard to see she leaned forward and read just three letters thats all i can make out lowercase tel anything else hardy asked parker squinted no nothing tel lukas pondered telephone telephone company telecommunications cage asked television c p offered maybe hes going to hit one of the studiosduring a broadcast no no parker said look at the position of the letters in relation to the cle me if hes writing in fairly consistent columns then the tel comes at the end of the word then parker caught on he said its a lukas blurted hotel the second targets a hotel thats right or motel hardy suggested no parker said i dont think so hes going for crowds motels dont have big facilities all the events tonight will be in hotel banquet rooms and lukas added hes probably sticking to foot or public transportation motelsre in outlying areas traffics too bad tonight to rely on a car great cage said then pointed out but there must be two hundred hotels in town how do we narrow it down baker asked id say go for the bigger hotels parker nodded toward lukas youre rightprobably near public transportation and high population centers with a loud bang baker dropped the yellow pages on the table dc only he flipped them open c p ardell walked over to the table and began looking over the tactical agents shoulder parker considered the question its the district hes extorting not virginia or maryland id stick to dc agreed lukas said also we should eliminate any place with hotel first in the name like hotel new york because of the placement of the letters on the envelope and no inns or lodges cage and hardy joined c p and baker they all bent over the phone book they started circling possibilities discussing whether this choice or that was logical after ten minutes they had a list of twentytwo hotels cage jotted them down in his own precise handwriting and handed the list to jerry baker parker suggested before you send anybody there call and find out if any of the functions tonight are for diplomats or politicians we can eliminate those why baker asked lukas responded armed bodyguards right parker nodded and secret service the unsub wouldve avoided those right baker said and hurried out of the room opening his cell phone but even eliminating those how many locations would remain parker wondered a lot too many too many possible solutions three hawks have been killing a farmers chickens my fellow citizens they powdered his forehead they stuck a plug in his ear they turned on the blinding lights through the glare mayor jerry kennedy could just make out a few faces in the blackness of the wplt newsroom located just off dupont circle there was his wife claire there was his press secretary there was wendell jefferies my fellow citizens kennedy rehearsed in his mind want to reassure you that our citys police force and the fbi no the federal authorities are doing everything in their power to find the perpetrators no the persons responsible for this terrible shooting one of the stations senior producers a thin man with a trim white beard came up to him and said ill give you a sevensecond countdown ill go silent after four and use my fingers at one look into the camera youve done this before ive done this before the producer glanced down and saw no papers in front of kennedy you have anything for the teleprompter its in my head the producer gave a brief chuckle nobody does that nowadays kennedy grunted responsible for this terrible crime and to that person out there i am asking you please please no just one please im asking you please to reestablish contact so that we can continue our dialog on this the last day of a difficult year lets put the violence behind us and work together so that therell be no more deaths please contact me personally no please call me personally or get a message to me five minutes the producer called kennedy waved aside the makeup artist and motioned jefferies over to him you heard anything from the fbi anything nothing not a word kennedy couldnt believe it hours into the operation the new deadline approaching his only contact with the feds had been a fast phone call from some district detective named len hardy who was calling on behalf of that agent margaret lukas to ask kennedy to make this appeal to the killer over the air lukas kennedy reflected angrily hadnt even bothered to call him herself hardy a district cop who sounded intimidated by the feds he was supposed to be liaising with hadnt known any details of the investigationor more likely didnt have permission to give out any hed tried to call lukas but shed been too busy to take his call cage too the mayor had spoken briefly with the head of the districts police department but short of providing cops to work under fbi supervision the chief had had nothing to do with the case kennedy was furious they dont take us seriously jesus i want to do something i mean other than this he waved his hand at the camera its going to sound like im begging its a problem wendy jefferies conceded ive called the press conference but half the stations and papers arent sending anybody theyre camped out at ninth street waiting for somebody at the bureau to talk to them its like the city doesnt exist its like im sitting on my hands thats sort of what its looking like the producer started toward him but the mayor gave him a polite smile in a minute the man veered back into the shadows so kennedy asked his aide hed seen a cagey look behind the young mans armani glasses time to call in some markers jefferies whispered i can do it surgically i know how to handle it i dont i dont want to do it this way either jefferies said fiercely never one to glove his advice to his boss but we dont have any choice you heard the commentary on wtgn of course he had the station popular with about a halfmillion listeners in the metro area had just aired an editorial about how during his campaign kennedy had pledged to take back the streets of washington from criminals and yet had been more than willing to pay terrorists a multimilliondollar ransom today the commentator a surly old journalist had gone on to cite kennedys other campaign promise of cleaning up corruption in the district while being completely oblivious to and possibly even participating in the board of education school construction scandal jefferies repeated we really dont have any choice jerry the mayor pondered this for a minute as usual the aide was right kennedy had hired the man because as a white mayor he needed a senior black aide he didnt apologize for such tactical hiring but hed been astonished that the young man possessed a political sense that transcended grassroots community relations his aide said this is the time for hardball jerry theres too much at stake okay do what you have to he didnt bother to add be careful he knew jefferies would two minutes came a voice from above kennedy thought to the digger where are you where he looked up at a darkened camera and stared at it as if he could see through the lens and cables to some tv set out theresee through the screen to the digger himself he thought to the killer who are you and why did you and your partner pick my city to visit like the angel of death in the spirit of peace on this last day of the year contact me so that we might come to some understanding please jefferies bent close to the mayors ear remember he whispered waving his hand around the tv studio if hes listening the killer this might be the end of it maybe hell go for the money and theyll get him before kennedy could respond the voice from on high called out one minute the diggers got a new shopping bag all glossy red and christmasy covered with pictures of puppies wearing ribbons round their necks the digger bought the bag at hallmark its the sort of bag he might be proud of though he isnt sure what proud means he hasnt been sure of a lot of things since the bullet careened through his skull burning away some of his spongy gray cells and leaving others funny how that works funny how funny the diggers sitting in a comfy chair in his lousy motel with a glass of water and the empty bowl of soup at his side hes watching tv something is on the screen its a commercial like a commercial he remembers watching after the bullet tapped a hole above his eye and did a scorchy little dance in his crane crane cranium somebody described the bullet that way he doesnt remember who maybe his friend the man who tells him things probably was something flickers on the tv screen brings back a funny memory from a long time ago he was watching a commercialdogs eating dog food puppies eating puppy food like the puppies on the shopping bag he was watching the commercial when the man who tells him things took the diggers hand and they went for a long walk he told him that when ruth was alone you know ruth i uhm know ruth when ruth was alone the digger should break a mirror and find a piece of glass and put the glass in her neck you mean the digger stopped talking i mean you should break the mirror and find a long piece of glass and you should put the glass in ruths neck what do i mean i should break the mirror and find a long piece of glass and i should put the glass in her neck some things the digger remembers as if god himself had written them on his brain good said the man good repeated the digger and he did what he was told which made the man who tells him things happy whatever that is now the digger is sitting with the puppy bag on his lap in his room at the motor lodge kitchenettes free cable reasonable rates looking at his bowl of soup the bowl is empty so he must not be hungry he thinks hes thirsty so he takes a drink of water another program comes on the tv he reads the words mutters them out loud special report hmm hmmm this is click this is click a wplt special report this is important i should listen a man the digger recognizes comes on the air hes seen pictures of this man its washington dc mayor gerald d kennedy thats what it says on the screen the mayors talking and the digger listens my fellow citizens good afternoon as you all know by now a terrible crime was committed this morning in the dupont circle metro station and a number of people tragically lost their lives at this time the killer or killers are still at large but i want to reassure you that our police force and the federal authorities are doing everything in their power to make sure there will be no recurrence of this incident to the persons responsible for this carnage i am asking you from my heart please please contact me we need to reestablish communication so that we can continue our dialog on this the last night of the year lets put the violence behind us and work together so that therell be no more deaths or injuries we can boring the digger shuts the tv off he likes commercials for dog food with cute puppies much better car commercials too ohhhhhh everyday people the digger calls his voice mail and punches in the code onetwotwofive the date of christmas the woman who doesnt sound like pamela his wife but does sound like ruthbefore the glass went into her neck of coursesays that he has no new messages which means its time for him to do what the man who tells him things told him if you do what people tell you to do thats a good thing theyll like you theyll stay with you forever theyll love you whatever love is merry christmas pamela i got this for you and you got something for me oh my oh my a present click click what a pretty yellow flower in your hand pamela thank you for my coat the digger pulls this overcoat on now maybe black maybe blue he loves his coat he carries his soup bowl into the kitchenette and puts it in the sink he wonders again why he hasnt heard from the man who tells him things the man told him that he might not call but still the digger feels a little ping in his mind and hes sorry he hasnt heard the mans voice am i sad hmmmm hmmmm he finds his leather gloves and they are very nice gloves with ribs on the backs of the fingers the smell makes him think of something in his past though he cant remember what he wears latex gloves when he loads the bullets into the clips of his uzi but the rubber doesnt smell good he wears his leather gloves when he opens doors and touches things that are near where he shoots the gun and watches people fall like leaves in a forest the digger buttons his dark coat maybe blue maybe black he smells his gloves again funny he puts the gun into the puppy bag and puts more bullets in the bag too walking out the front door of his motel the digger closes the door after him he locks it carefully the way youre supposed to do the digger knows all about doing things youre supposed to do put glass into a womans neck for instance buy your wife a present eat your soup find a bright new shiny shopping bag one with puppies on it why puppies the digger asked just because said the man who tells him things oh and that was the one he bought parker kincaid sitting in the same gray swivel chair he himself had requisitioned from gsa many years ago did a test that too few questioned document examiners performed he read the document and then he read it again and a halfdozen times more parker put much faith in the content of the document itself to reveal things about the author once he was asked to authenticate a letter supposedly sent by abraham lincoln to jefferson davis in which lincoln suggested that if the confederacy surrendered he would agree to allow certain states to secede the shaken director of the american association of historians sent parker the letter which would have thrown us history into turmoil the scientists had already determined the paper had been manufactured in the s and the ink used was iron gallide contemporary to the era the document showed timeappropriate absorption of the ink into the paper fibers and was written in what clearly seemed to be lincolns handwriting yet parker didnt even pull out his hand glass to check the starts and lifts of the penstrokes he read it once and on his analysis report wrote this document is of dubious origin which was the forensic document examiners equivalent of a bronx cheer the reason the letter was signed abe lincoln the sixteenth president abhorred the name abe and would never let it be used in reference to him let alone would he sign an important document with the nickname the forger was arrested convicted andas is often the case with the crime of forgerysentenced to probation as he now read the extortion note yet again parker took careful note of the unsubs syntaxthe order of the sentences and sentence fragmentsand his grammar the general constructions hed used in composition an image began to emerge of the soul of the man whod written the notethe man lying cold and still six floors below them in the fbi morgue tobe geller called here we go he leaned forward its the psycholinguistic profile from quantico parker gazed at the screen hed often used this type of computer analysis when hed overseen the document division the entire text of a threatening documentsentences fragments punctuationis fed into a computer which then analyzes the message and compares it with data in a huge threat dictionary which contains more than words and then a standard dictionary of millions of words an expert working with the computer then compares the letter to others in the database and decides if they were written by the same person certain characteristics of the writer can also be determined this way geller read psycholinguistic profile of unsub a deceased metshoot data suggest that abovereferenced unknown subject was foreignborn and had been in this country for two to three years he was poorly educated and probably spent no more than two years in what would correspond to an american high school probable iq was plus or minus points threats contained in subject document do not match any known threats in current databases however the language is consistent with sincere threats made in both profit and terrorist crimes he printed out a copy and handed it to parker foreign lukas said i knew it she held up a crime scene photo of the unsubs body taken at the scene where hed been killed by the delivery truck looks middle european to me serb czech slovak he called city hall security len hardy said dont they tape incoming calls we could see if he had an accent parker said ill bet he used a voice synthesizer right thats right lukas confirmed it was just like the youve got mail voice geller said we should call ih the bureaus international homicide and terrorism division but parker crumpled up the psycholinguistic profile sheet and tossed it into a wastebasket what lukas began from c p ardells fat throat came a sound that could only be called a guffaw parker said the only thing they got right is that the threat is real but we know that dont we without looking up from the extortion note he said im not saying ih shouldnt be involved but i can say he wasnt foreign and he definitely was smart id put his iq at over one hundred sixty where do you get that cage asked waving at the note my grandkid writes better than that i wish he had been stupid parker said itd be a hell of a lot less scary he tapped the picture of the unsub sure european descent but probably fourth generation he was extremely smart well educated probably in a private school and i think he spent a lot of time on a computer his permanent address was someplace out of this area he only rented here oh and he was a classic sociopath margaret lukass laugh was nearly a scoff where do you get that it told me parker said simply tapping the note a forensic linguist parker had been analyzing documents without the benefit of psycholinguistic software for yearsbased on the phrases people chose and the sentences they constructed words alone can make all the difference in solving crimes some years ago parker had testified at the trial of a young suspect arrested for murder the suspect and his friend had been shoplifting beer in a convenience store when the clerk caught them and came at them with a baseball bat the friend grabbed the bat and was threatening the clerk the suspectthe boy on trialhad shouted give it to him the friend had swung and killed the clerk the prosecutor claimed the sentence give it to him meant hit him the defense claimed the suspect had meant give the bat back parker had testified that give it to him had at one point in the history of american slang meant to do harmto shoot stab or hit but that usage had fallen by the waysidealong with words like swell and hip parkers opinion was that the suspect was telling his friend to return the bat the jury had believed parkers testimony and though the boy was convicted of robbery he escaped the murder charge but thats how foreigners talk cage pointed out i am knowing pay to me remember the lindbergh kidnapping from the academy all fbi trainees at quantico had heard the story in their forensic lectures before bruno hauptmann was arrested and charged with the lindbergh baby abduction document examiners in the bureau deduced from the expressions in the ransom notes that the person whod written them was a german immigrant whod been in the united states for probably two or three yearswhich described hauptmann accurately the analysis helped narrow the search for the kidnapper who was convicted primarily on the basis of handwriting comparisons between a known of his writing and the ransom notes well lets go through it parker said and put the note on an oldfashioned overhead projector dont you want to scan it and put it on the video screen tobe geller asked no parker answered peremptorily i dont like digital we need to be as close to the original as we can get he looked up and gave a fast smile we need to be in bed with it the note flashed onto a large screen mounted on one wall of the lab the ashen document seemed to stand in front of them like a suspect under interrogation parker walked up to it gazed at the large letters in front of him mayor kennedy the end is night the digger is loose and their is no way to stop him he will kill againat four and midnight if you dont pay i am wanting million dollars in cash which you will put into a bag and leave it two miles south of rt on the west side of the beltway in the middle of the field pay to me the money by hours only i am knowing how to stop the digger if you xxxx apprehend me he will keep killing if you kill me he will keep killing if you dont think im real some of the diggers bullets were painted black only i know that as parker spoke he pointed to parts of the note i am knowing and pay to me sound foreign sure the form of the verb to be combined with a present participle is typical in a slavic or germanic indoeuropeanroot language german or czech or polish say but the use of the preposition to with me is not something youd find in those languages theyd say it the way we do pay me that construction is more common in an asian language i think he just threw in random foreignsounding phrases trying to fool us into thinking hes foreign to lead us off i dont know cage began no no parker persisted look at how he tried to do it those quote foreign expressions are close togetheras if hed gotten the fake clues out of the way then moved on if a foreign language was really his first hed be more consistent look at the last sentence of the letter he falls back to a typical english construction only i know that not only i am knowing that by the way thats also why i think he spent time on a computer im online a lot browsing through rare document dealers web sites and newsgroups a lot of them are foreign but they write in english you see bastardizations of english just like these all the time i agree with that about computers lukas told parker we dont know for sure but its likely that he learned how to pack silencers and rig the uzi for full auto on the web thats how everybody learns things like that nowadays but what about the twentyfourhour clock hardy asked he demanded the ransom by twelve hundred hours thats european another red herring he doesnt refer to it that way earlierwhen he writes about when the diggers going to attack again there he says four eight and midnight well c p said if hes not foreign hes got to be stupid look at all the mistakes to lukas he said sounds just like those rednecks we took down in manassas park parker responded all fake but lukas protested the very first line the end is night he means the end is nigh he oh parker continued but thats not a mistake youd logically make people say once and a while even though the correct expression is once in a while because theres a certain logic to using the conjunction and and not the preposition in but the end is night makes no sense whatever his level of education what about the misspellings hardy asked and the capitalization and punctuation mistakes the detectives eyes were scanning the letter carefully parker said oh therere plenty more mistakes than those look how he uses the dollar sign and the word dollars a redundancy and when hes talking about the money hes got an improper object in the sentence parker touched a portion of the screen moving his finger along the words i am wanting million dollars in cash which you will put into a bag and leave it two miles south of rt on the west side of the beltway see he says leave it but the object it isnt necessary only that isnt the sort of mistake that makes sensemost grammatical errors are reflections of errors in speaking and in everyday vernacular we just dont add unnecessary direct objects if anything were lazywe tend to streamline our speech and leave out words and the misspellings parker continued he paced slowly in front of the projected note and the letters moved across his face and shoulder like black insects look at the sentence their is no way to stop him their is a homonymwords that are spelled differently but are pronounced the same it should be there but most people only make those mistakes when they write quicklyusually when theyre on a computer their mind sends them the spelling phonetically not visually the secondhighest incident of homonymic mistakes is by people typing on typewriters but with handwriting theyre rare the capitalizations he glanced at hardy you only find erroneous uppercasing when theres some logical basis for itconcepts like art or love or hate sometimes with occupations or job titles no hes just trying to make us think hes stupid but he isnt the note tells you that lukas asked staring as if she were seeing an extortion note entirely different from the one parker was studying you bet the document examiner responded he laughed his other mistake was not making some mistakes he should have for instance he uses a comma in adverbial clauses correctly a clause beginning a sentence should end with a comma the if clause he touched it on the wall screen if you kill me he will keep killing but with a clause at the end of the sentence you dont need one he will kill againat four and midnight if you dont pay he also used a comma before which i am wanting million dollars in cash which you will put into a bag thats a standard rule of grammara comma before the nonrestrictive which and not before the restrictive thatbut generally only professional writers and people whove gone to good schools follow it anymore there oughta be a comma before which c p grumbled who cares parker silently responded we do because its little things like this that lead us to the truth hardy said it looks like he tried to spell apprehend and couldnt get it right what do you make of that looks like it parker said but you know whats under the markout there i scanned it with an infrared viewer what squiggles squiggles lukas asked a term of art parker said wryly he didnt write anything he just wanted us to think he was having trouble spelling the word but whyd he go to all this trouble to make us think hes stupid hardy asked to trick us into looking for either a stupid american or a slightly less stupid foreigner its another smokescreen parker added and to keep us underestimating him of course hes smart just look at the money drop the drop lukas asked c p asked you mean at gallows road whys that smart well parker glanced up then from one to the other of the agents the helicopters what helicopters hardy asked parker frowned arent you checking out helicopter charters no lukas said why should we parker remembered a rule from his days working at the bureau never assume a single thing the field where he wanted the money dropped was next to a hospital right geller was nodding fairfax hospital shit lukas spat out it has a helipad so hardy asked lukas shook her head angry with herself the unsub picked the place so a surveillance team would get used to incoming choppers hed chartered one himself and was going to set down pick up the money and take off again probably fly at treetop level to a getaway car i never thought about that hardy said bitterly none of us did c p said cage added ive got a buddy at the faa ill have him check it out parker glanced at the clock no response from kennedys news conference lukas made a call she spoke to someone then hung up six calls all cranks none of them knew anything about the painted bullets so they were bogus weve got their names and numbers nail em later for interference with law enforcement activity you think the unsub wasnt from around here hardy asked parker right if there was any chance he thought we could compare his handwriting with public records in the area he wouldve disguised his writing or used cutout letters which he didnt so hes not from the district virginia or maryland the door swung open it was timothy the runner whod brought the note agent lukas ive got the results from the coroner parker thought its about time she took the report and as she read it cage asked parker you said he was a sociopath how do you figure that because parker said absently his eyes on lukas whod do something like this except a sociopath lukas finished and handed it to hardy he asked you want me to read it go ahead she answered parker noticed that the young mans sobriety had lifted maybe because he was for a moment part of the team the detective cleared his throat white male approximately fortyfive years old six foot two one hundred eightyseven pounds no distinguishing no jewelry except a casio watchwith multiple alarms hardy looked up get this set to go off at four eight and midnight back to the report wearing unbranded blue jeans well worn polyester windbreaker jcpenney workshirt also faded jockey underwear cotton socks walmart running shoes a hundred twelve dollars in cash some change parker stared at the letters on the screen in front of them as if the words hardy was reading described not the unsub but the note itself minor trace elements brick dust in hair clay dust under nails stomach contents reveal coffee milk bread and beefprobably inexpensive grade of steakconsumed within the past eight hours thats it hardy read another metshoot memo attached to the coroners report no leads with the delivery truckthe one that hit him hardy glanced at parker its so frustratingweve got the perp downstairs and he cant tell us a damn thing parker glanced at another copy of the major crimes bulletin the one hed seen earlier about the firebombing of gary mosss house the austere description of the near deaths of the mans daughters had shaken parker badly seeing that bulletin hed very nearly turned around and walked out of the lab parker shut off the projector put the note back on the examining table cage looked at his watch he pulled on his coat well weve got fortyfive minutes we better get going what do you mean lukas asked the senior agent handed her her windbreaker and parker his leather jacket he took it without thinking out there he nodded toward the door to help jerry bakers team check out hotels parker was shaking his head no we have to keep going here he looked at hardy youre right len the unsub cant tell us anything but the note still can it can tell us a lot they need everybody they can get cage persisted there was silence for a moment parker stood with his head down opposite lukas across the brightly lit examining table the stark white extortion note between them he looked up said evenly i dont think well be able to find him in time not in fortyfive minutes i hate to say it but this is the best use of our resourcesto stay here keep going with the note c p said you mean youre just going to write em off the victims he paused then said i guess thats what i mean yes cage asked lukas whatta you think she glanced at parker their eyes met she said to cage i agree with parker we stay here we keep going from the corner of her eyes lukas saw len hardy standing motionless after a moment he smoothed his hair picked up his coat and walked over to her right as rain let me go at least he said to her to help with the hotels she looked at his earnest young face he kneaded his trench coat in his large right hand the nails perfectly trimmed and scrubbed he was a man she had concluded who found comfort in details i cant im sorry agent cage is right theyll need everybody they can get lukas glanced at parker kincaid but he was lost in the document once more easing it carefully from its clear acetate shroud come on over here len lukas said gesturing him into the corner of the document lab cage was the only one who noticed and he said nothing in his long tenure at the bureau the senior agent would have had plenty of talks with underlings and knew that the process was as delicate as interrogating suspects more delicatebecause these were people you had to live with day after day and whom you might have to depend on to watch your back lukas was grateful cage was giving her rein to handle hardy the way she felt best talk to me she said whats eating you i want to do something the detective replied i know im secondstring here im from the district im research and stats but i want to help youre only here as liaison thats all youre authorized for this is a federal operation its not taskforced he gave a sour laugh liaison im here as a stenographer you and i both know that of course she knew it but that wouldnt have stopped lukas from giving him a more active role if she thought hed be valuable elsewhere lukas was not one who lived her life solely by regs and procedures and if hardy had been the worlds best sniper shed kick him out the door and onto one of jerry bakers shooting teams in an instant whatever the rules dictated after a moment she said all right answer me a question sure why are you here she asked why he frowned you volunteered didnt you lukas asked yeah i did because of your wife right emma he tried to look confounded but lukas could see right through it his eyes fell to the floor i understand len but do yourself a favor take your notes kick around ideas with us and stay out of the line of fire then when this pricks tagged go on home but its hard he said avoiding her eyes being home he nodded i know it is lukas answered sincerely he clung to the trenchcoat like a childs security blanket in fact if it had been anybody but len hardy whod shown up as the district police liaison she would have kicked them right back to police headquarters she had no patience with ass covering or interagency turf wars and no time to coddle employees of a corrupt nearly bankrupt city but she knew a secret of hardys lifethat his wife was in a coma the result of an accident when her jeep cherokee had skidded off the road in a rainstorm near middleburg virginia and hit a tree hardy had been to the district field office several times to compile statistical data on crime in the metro area and had gotten to know betty lukass assistant shed thought at first that the man was trying to pick up the attractive woman but had then overheard him talking emotionally about his wife and her injury he didnt have many friends it seemed just like lukas herself shed gotten to know him slightly and had learned more about emma several times theyd had coffee in the policemens memorial park next to the field office hed opened up slightly but also like lukas he kept his emotions tightly packed away knowing his tragedy knowing how hard it would be for him to sit home alone on a holiday she had welcomed him onto the team and resolved to cut him some slack tonight but margaret lukas would never jeopardize an operation for the emotional health of anyone right as rain he now told her i cant sit still i want a piece of this guy no she thought what he wants is a piece of god or fate or whatever force of nature broke emma hardys life and her husbands into a thousand pieces len i cant have somebody in the field whos she looked for a benign word distracted reckless would have been closer and suicidal was what she meant hardy nodded he was angry his lip trembled but he dropped his coat on a chair and returned to a desk poor man she thought but seeing how his intelligence his sense of propriety and perfection shone through his personal anguish she knew hed be all right hed survive this terrible time oh hed be changed yes but hed be changed the way iron is changed into steel in a refinerys whitehot coals changed the way lukas herself had if you looked at jacqueline margaret lukass birth certificate the document would reveal that shed been born on the last day of november but in her heart she knew she was just over five years old having been born the day she graduated from the fbi academy she recalled a book shed read a long time ago a childrens story the wyckham changeling the picture of a happy elf on the cover didnt hint at the eeriness of the story itself the book was about an elf whod sneak into homes in the middle of the night and switch babieskidnap the human child and leave a changelingan elfin baby in its place the story was about two parents who discover that their daughter had been switched and go on a quest to find her lukas remembered reading the book curled up on a couch in her comfortable living room in stafford virginia near quantico postponing going to safeway because of an unexpected blizzard shed been compelled to finish ityes the parents had found the girl and traded the elf baby back for herbut she had shivered at the unpleasant aftertaste of the book and had thrown it out shed forgotten about the story until shed graduated from the academy and been assigned to the washington field office then one morning walking to work her colt python snug on her hip a case file under her arm she realized thats what i ama changeling jackie lukas had been a parttime librarian for the bureaus quantico research facility an amateur clothing designer who could whip up outfits for her friends and their children over a weekend shed been a quilter needlepointer wine collector and drinker too a consistently top finisher in local fivek races but that woman was long gone replaced by special agent margaret lukas a woman who excelled in criminalistics investigative techniques the properties of c and semtex explosives the care and handling of confidential informants an fbi agent her perplexed father had asked during a visit to her parents pacific heights townhouse in san francisco shed gone home to break the news to them youre going to be an agent not like with a gun you mean youll work at a desk or something with a gun but ill bet they give me a desk too i dont get it the burly man a retired loan officer for bank of america said you were such a good student she laughed at the apparent non sequitur though she knew exactly what her father meant an honor student at both st thomas high in russian hill and stanford the lean girl who accepted dates too rarely and raised her hand in class too often was destined for high places in academia or on wall street no no he didnt mind that jackie was going to be toting guns and tackling killers it was that she wouldnt be using her mind but its the fbi dad theyre the thinking cops yeah i guess but is this what you want to do no it was what she had to do there was a gulf of a difference between the two verbs wanted and had but she didnt know if hed understand that so she said a simple yes then thats good enough for me then he turned to his wife and said our girls got mettle you know what mettle is mettle i know lukass mother called from the kitchen i do crosswords remember but youll be careful jackie promise me youll be careful as if she were about to cross a busy street ill be careful mom good i made coq au vin for dinner you like that right and jackie hugged her mother and her father and two days later flew back to washington dc to change into margaret after graduating she was assigned to the field office she got to know the district got to work with cage who was as good a changeling father as she couldve asked for and must have done something right because last year she was promoted to assistant special agent in charge and now with her boss photographing monkeys and lizards in a brazilian rainforest she was running the biggest case to hit washington dc in years she now watched len hardy jotting his notes in the corner of the lab and thought hell come through this okay margaret lukas knew that it could happen just ask a changeling hey a mans voice intruded on her thoughts she looked across the room and realized that parker kincaid was speaking to her weve done the linguistics he said i want to do the physical analysis of the note now unless youve got something else in mind thiss your inning parker she said and sat down beside him first he examined the paper the note was written on it measured by inches the sort intended for breadandbutter notes paper size has varied throughout history but by has been standard in america for nearly two hundred years six by was the secondmostcommon size too common the size alone would tell parker nothing about its source as for composition of the paper he noted that it was cheap and had been manufactured by mechanical pulping not the kraftchemical pulpingmethod that produced finerquality papers the paper wont help us much he announced finally its generic nonrecycled highacid coarse pulp with minimal optical brighteners and low luminescence sold in bulk by paper manufacturers and jobbers to retail chains they package it as a house brand of stationery theres no watermark and no way to trace it back to a particular manufacturer or wholesaler and then forward to a single point of sale he sighed lets look at the ink he lifted the note carefully and placed it under one of the labs compound microscopes he examined it first at ten then at fiftypower magnification from the indentation the tip of the pen made in the paper the occasional skipping and the uneven color parker could tell that the pen had been a very cheap ballpoint probably an awiamerican writing instruments the bargainbasement thirtyninecenter he looked at his teammates no one grasped the significance and lukas asked thats a bad thing he explained emphatically impossible to trace theyre sold in just about every discount and convenience store in america just like the paper and awi doesnt use tags tags hardy asked parker explained that some manufacturers put a chemical tag in their inks to identify the products and to help trace where and when theyd been manufactured american writing instruments however didnt do this parker started to pull the note out from under the microscope he stopped noticing something curious part of the paper was faded he didnt think it was a manufacturing flaw optical brighteners have been added to paper for nearly fifty years and its unusual even in cheap paper like this for there to be an unevenness in the brilliance could you hand me the polilight he asked c p ardell the what there the big agent picked up one of the boxy als unitsan alternative light source it luminesced a variety of substances that were invisible to the human eye parker pulled on a pair of goggles and clicked on the yellowgreen light it gonna irradiate me or anything the big agent said only partly joking it seemed parker ran the polilight wand over the envelope yes the right third was lighter than the rest he did the same with the note and found there was a lighter lshaped pattern on the top and right side of the paper this was interesting he studied it again see how the corners faded i think its because the paperand part of the envelope toowere bleached by the sun where at his house or the store hardy asked could be either parker answered but given the cohesion of the pulp id guess the paper was sealed until fairly recently that would suggest the store but lukas said itd have to be a place that had a southern exposure yes parker thought good he hadnt thought of that why hardy asked because its winter parker pointed out theres not enough sunlight to bleach paper from any other direction parker paced again it was a habit of his when thomas jeffersons wife died his oldest daughter martha wrote that her father paced almost incessantly day and night only lying down occasionally when nature was completely exhausted when parker worked on a document or was wrestling with a particularly difficult puzzle the whos often chided him for walking in circles again the layout of the lab was coming back to him he walked to a cabinet opened it and pulled out an examining board and some sheets of collecting paper holding the note by its corner he ran a camelhair brush over the surface to dislodge trace elements there was virtually nothing he wasnt surprised paper is one of the most absorbent of materials it retains a lot of substances from the places its been but generally they remain firmly bound into the fibers parker took a large hypodermic syringe from his attaché case and punched several small disks of ink and paper out of the note and the envelope you know how it works he asked geller nodding at the gas chromatographmass spectrometer in the corner oh sure he said i took one apart once just for the fun of it separate runsfor the note and the envelope parker said handing him the samples you got it whats it do c p asked again undercover and tactical agents generally dont have much patience for lab work and know little about forensic science parker explained the gcms separated chemicals found at crime scenes into their component parts and then identified them the machine rumbled alarminglyin effect it burned the samples and analyzed the resulting vapors parker brushed more trace off the note and envelope and this time managed to collect some material he mounted the slides on two different leitz compound scopes he peered into one then the other turned the focusing knobs which moved with the slow sensuality of oiled precision mechanisms he stared at what he saw then looked up said to geller i need to digitize images of the trace in here nodding at a microscope how do we do that ah piece of proverbial cake the young agent plugged optical cables into the base of the microscopes they ran to a large gray box which sprouted cables of its own these cables geller plugged into one of the dozen computers in the lab he clicked it on and a moment later an image of the particles of trace came on the screen he called up a menu said to parker just hit this button theyre stored as jpeg files and i can transfer them on email just tell me who theyre going to in a minuteill have to get the address first i want to do different magnifications parker and geller captured three images from each microscope stored them on the hard drive just as he finished the gcms beeped and data began to appear on the screen of the computer dedicated to the unit lukas said ive got a couple of examiners standing by in materials and elemental these were the bureaus two trace evidence analysis departments send em home parker said theres somebody else i want to use who lukas asked frowning hes in new york nypd cage asked was civilian now why not somebody here lukas asked because parker answered my friends the best criminalist in the country hes the one set up pert our evidence team c p asked right parker looked up a number and made a call but hardy pointed out its new years eve hes probably out no parker said he hardly ever goes out not even on holidays not even on holidays parker kincaid the voice in the speaker phone said i wondered if someone from down there might be calling in you heard about our problem did you parker asked lincoln rhyme ah i hear everything he said and parker remembered that rhyme could bring off dramatic delivery like no one else dont i thom dont i hear everything parker you remember thom dont you longsuffering thom hi parker hi thom he giving you grief of course i am lincoln said gruffly i thought you were retired parker i was until about two hours ago funny about this business isnt it the way they never let us rest in peace parker had met rhyme once he was a handsome man about parkers age dark hair he was also paralyzed from the neck down he consulted out of his townhouse on central park west i enjoyed your course parker rhyme said last year parker remembered rhyme sitting in a fancy candyapplered wheelchair in the front row of the lecture hall at the john jay college of criminal justice in new york the subject was forensic linguistics rhyme continued do you know we got a conviction because of you i didnt there was a witness at a killing he couldnt see the killer he was hiding but he heard the perp say something to the vic just before he shot him he said if i were you you prick id say my prayers thenthis is interesting parker are you listening you bet when lincoln rhyme spoke you listened then during the interrogation at police hq he said to one of the detectives if i were going to confess it wouldnt be to you you know how we got him how lincoln rhyme laughed like a happy teenager because of the subjunctive voice if i were you not if i was you if i were going to confess statistically only seven percent of the general population uses the subjunctive voice anymore did you know that as a matter of fact i do parker said that was enough for a conviction no but it was enough for a confession as part of a plea bargain rhyme announced now let me guess youve got this unsub shooting people in the subway and your only clue to him is thewhat a threat letter an extortion note hows he know that lukas asked another country heard from rhyme called to answer the question i know that theres a note involved because its the only logical reason for parker kincaid to be calling me whoexcuse me parkerwhom did i just answer special agent margaret lukas she said shes asac at the district field office shes running the case ah the bureau of course fred dellray was just over here to visit rhyme said you know fred manhattan office i know fred lukas answered he ran some of our undercover people last year an arms sale sting rhyme continued so an unsub a note now talk to me one of you lukas said youre right its an extortion scheme we tried to pay but the primary unsub was killed now were pretty sure his partnerthe shootermay keep going oh thats tricky thats a problem youve processed the body nothing lukas told him no id no significant trace and my belated christmas present is a piece of the case i gcd a bit of the envelope and the letter good for you parker burn up the evidence theyll want to save it for trial but you burn up what you have to i want to send you the data and some pictures of the trace can i email it all to you yes yes of course what magnification ten twenty and fifty good whens the deadline every four hours starting at four going to midnight four pm today thats right lord she continued we have a lead to the four oclock hit we think hes going after a hotel but we dont know anything more specific than that four eight and twelve your unsub was a man with a dramatic flair should that be part of his profile hardy asked jotting more notes parker supposed the man would probably spend all weekend writing up a report for the mayor the police chief and the city councila report that would probably go unread for months maybe forever whos that rhyme barked len hardy sir district pd you do psych profiling actually im with research but ive taken profiling courses at the academy and done postgraduate psych work at american university listen rhyme said to him i dont believe in psych profiles i believe in evidence psychology is slippery as a fish look at me im an oven of neuroses right amelia my friend heres not talking but she agrees all right weve got to move on this send me your goodies ill get back to you as soon as i can parker took down rhymes email address and handed it to geller a moment later the agent had uploaded the images and the chemical profiles from the chromatographspectrometer hes the best criminalist in the country cage asked skeptically but parker didnt respond he was gazing at the clock somewhere in the district of columbia those people that he and margaret lukas were willing to sacrifice had only thirty minutes left to live this hotel is beautiful this hotel is nice the digger walks inside with puppies on his shopping bag and no one notices him he walks into the bar and buys a sparkling water from the bartender it tickles his nose funny he drinks it down and leaves money and a tip the way the man who tells him things told him to do in the lobby the crowds are milling therere functions here office parties lots of decorations more of those fat babies in new years banners my arent they arent they arent they cute and heres old man time looking like the grim reaper he and pamela click and pamela went to some parties in places like this the digger buys a usa today he sits in the lobby and reads it the puppy bag at his side he looks at his watch reading the articles usa today is a nice newspaper it tells him many interesting things the digger notices the weather around the nation he likes the color of the highpressure fronts he reads about sports he thinks he used to do some sports a long time ago no that was his friend william his friend enjoyed sports some other friends too so did pamela the paper has lots of pictures of nice basketball players they look very big and strong and when they dunk balls they fly through the air like whirligigs the digger decides he must not have played sports he isnt sure why pamela or william or anyone would want to its more fun to eat soup and watch tv a young boy walks past him and pauses he looks down at the bag the digger pulls the top of the bag closed so the boy wont see the uzi thats about to kill fifty or sixty people the boy is maybe nine he has dark hair and its parted very carefully hes wearing a suit that doesnt fit well the sleeves are too long and a happy red christmas tie bunches up his collar awkwardly hes looking at the bag at the puppies the digger looks away from him if anybody looks at your face kill them remember that i remember but he cant help looking at the boy the boy smiles the digger doesnt smile he recognizes a smile but he doesnt know what it is exactly the boy with his brown eyes and the little bit of a smile on his face is fascinated with the bag and the puppies their happy ribbons like the ribbons the fat new years babies wear green and gold ribbons on the bag the digger looks at the bag too honey come on a woman calls shes standing beside a pot of poinsettias as red as the rose pamela wore on her dress at christmas last year the boy glances once again at the diggers face the digger knows he should look away but he just stares back then the boy walks to the crowd of people around tables filled with little dots of food lots of crackers and cheese and shrimps and carrots no soup the digger notices the boy walks up to a girl who is probably his sister shes about thirteen the digger looks at his watch twenty minutes to four he takes the cell phone out of his pocket and carefully punches the buttons to call his voice mail he listens you have no new messages he shuts the phone off he lifts the bag onto his lap and looks out over the crowd the boy is in a blue blazer and his sister is wearing a pink dress it has a sash on it the digger clutches the puppy bag eighteen minutes the boy is standing at the food table the girl is talking to an older woman more people enter the hotel they walk right past the digger with his bag and his nice newspaper that shows the weather all across the nation but no one notices him the phone in the document lab began ringing as always when a telephone chirped and he was someplace without the whos parker felt an instant of lowvoltage panic though if one of the children had had an accident mrs cavanaugh would of course have called his cell phone and not the federal bureau of investigation he glanced at the caller id box and saw a new york number he snagged the receiver lincoln its parker weve got fifteen minutes any clues the criminalists voice was troubled oh not much parker speaker me dont you linguists hate it when people verb nouns parker hit the button somebody grab a pen rhyme called ill tell you what ive got are you ready are you ready were ready lincoln parker said the most prominent trace embedded in the letter is granite dust granite cage echoed theres evidence of shaving and chiseling on the stone and some polishing too what do you think its from parker asked i dont know how would i know i dont know washington i know new york and if it were in new york lukas asked rhyme rattled off new building construction old building renovation or demolition bathroom kitchen and threshold manufacturers tombstone makers sculptors studios landscapers the lists endless you need somebody who knows the lay of the land there understand thats not you is it parker nope i the criminalist interrupted him know documents you know unsubs too but not geography thats true parker glanced at lukas she was gazing at the clock she looked back at him with a face devoid of emotion cage had mastered the shrug lukass waiting state was the stony mask rhyme continued therere also traces of red clay and dust from old brick then theres sulfur and a lot of carbonash and soot consistent with cooking meat or burning trash that has meat in it nowthe data from the envelope showed a little of the same trace substances i found on the letter but also something moresignificant amounts of salt water kerosene refined oil crude oil butter butter lukas asked thats what i said rhyme groused he added sourly dont know the brand and theres some organic material not inconsistent with mollusks so all the evidence points to baltimore baltimore hardy asked from lukas how do you figure that the seawater kerosene fuel oil and crude oil mean its a port right right what else could it be well the port nearest to dc that does major crude oil transfer is baltimore and thom tells memy man knows foodthat there are tons of seafood restaurants right on the harbor berthas he keeps talking about berthas mussels baltimore lukas muttered so he wrote the note at home had dinner on the waterfront the night before he came to dc to drop it off at city hall then no no no rhyme said what lukas asked parker the puzzle master said the evidence is fake he staged it didnt he lincoln just like a broadway play rhyme said sounding pleased parker had caught on how do you figure cage asked theres a detective ive been working withroland bell nypd good man hes from north carolina hes got this expression seems a little kind of too quick and too easy well all that trace theres too much of those elements way too much the unsub got his hands on some trace and impregnated the envelope just to send us off track and the trace on the letter hardy asked oh no thats legit the amount of material in the fibers was consistent with ambient substances no no the letterll tell us where he lived but the envelope ah the envelope tells us something else parker said that there was more to him than meets the eye exactly the criminalist confirmed parker summarized so where he lived theres the granite clay dust brick dust sulfur soot and ash from cooking or burning meat all that dustmight be a demolition site cage said that seems the most likely hardy said likely how could it be likely rhyme asked its a possibility but then isnt everything a possibility until one alternatives proven true think about that rhymes voice faded slightly as he spoke to someone in the room with him no amelia im not being pompous im being accurate thom thom some more singlemalt please mr rhyme lukas said lincoln this is all good and we appreciate it but weve got ten minutes until the shooters next attack you have any thoughts about which hotel the unsub mightve picked rhyme answered with a gravity that chilled parker im afraid i dont he said youre on your own there all right parker said thank you lincoln good luck to all of you good luck with a click the criminalist disconnected the phone parker looked over the notes granite dust sulfur oh they were wonderful clues solid clues but the team didnt have nearly enough time to follow up on them not before pm maybe not even before eight he pictured the shooter standing in a crowd of people his gun ready about to pull the trigger how many would die this time how many families how many children like lavelle williams children like robby and stephie everyone in the halfdarkened lab remained silent as if paralyzed by their inability to see through the shroud obscuring the truth parker glanced at the note again and had a feeling that it was mocking him then lukass phone rang she listened and her mouth blossomed into the first genuine smile parker had seen on her face that day got him she announced what parker asked two of jerrys boys just found some rounds of the blackpainted shells under a chair at the four seasons hotel in georgetown every available agent and copre on their way there is it crowded the hotel cage said in response to parkers question looking up from his own cell phone hell yes our man says the lobby bars fullsome kind of reception then in the banquet rooms downstairs therere four new years eve parties going on lot of companiesre closing up early must be a thousand people there parker thought of what an automatic weapon could do in a closed space like a banquet room tobe geller had patched the operation radio frequency through speakers in the lab the team could hear jerry bakers voice this is new years leader two to all units code twelve at the four seasons on m street code twelve unsub is on premises no description believed armed with a fully auto uzi and suppressor you are greenlighted repeat you are greenlighted meaning they were free to shoot without making a surrender demand dozens of troops would be inside the hotel in minutes would they catch him even if not parker figured they might spook him into fleeing without harming anyone but then they might catch him arrest him or if he resisted kill him and the horror would be over parker could return home to his children what were they doing now he wondered was his son still troubled by the boatman oh robby how can i tell you not to worry the boatmans been dead for years but look here now tonight weve got another boatman whos even worse thats the thing about evil son it crawls out of its grave again and again and theres no way to stop it silence from the radio waiting was the hardest thats what parker had forgotten in his years of retirement you never got used to waiting the first cars are just getting there cage called out listening to his cell phone parker bent over the extortion note again mayor kennedy the end is night the digger is loose and their is no way to stop him then he glanced at the envelope he was looking at the smudges of trace evidence looking at the esda sheets again the faint images of the indented writing tel rhymes words echoed but the envelope tells us something else there was more to him than meets the eye and parker heard himself earliertelling lukas that quanticos psycholinguistic profile was wrong that the unsub was in fact brilliant his head shot up he looked at lukas what she asked alarmed at his expression he said evenly were wrong weve got it wrong hes not going to hit the four seasons the others in the room froze stared at him stop the response the police agentswherever they arestop them what are you talking about lukas asked the noteits lying to us cage and lukas looked at each other its leading us away from the real site its c p ardell asked uncertainly looked at lukas what does he mean parker ignored him and cried stop them cage lifted his phone lukas motioned with her hand to stop do it parker shouted the response teams have to stay mobile we cant tie them up at the hotel hardy said parker hes there they found the rounds that cant be a coincidence of course its not a coincidence the digger left them there then he went someplace elseto the real target someplace thats not a hotel he looked at cage stop the cars no lukas said anger now blossomed in her thin face but parker staring up at the note continued its too smart to leave a reference to the hotel accidentally it tried to fool us with the trace on the envelope the sames true with the indented writing the tel we hardly even found the indented writing lukas countered we wouldnt have if you hadnt been helping us it knows the talk of the note personified seemed to make them uncomfortable he said the unsub knew what hed be up against remember my linguistic profile he tapped the picture of the dead unsub he was brilliant he was a strategist he had to make the evidence subtle otherwise we wouldnt believe it no no we have to stop the tactical teams wherever they are and wait until we can figure out where the real target is wait hardy said exasperated lifting his hands c p whispered its five minutes to four cage shrugged glanced at lukas it was her call you have to parker snapped he saw lukas lift her stony eyes to the clock on the wall the minute hand advanced one more notch the hotel was nicer than this place the digger looks around him and theres something about this theater he doesnt like the puppy bag seemed seemed right when he was in the nice hotel it doesnt look right here this is the this is the click is the mason theater just east of georgetown the digger is in the lobby and hes looking at the wood carvings he sees flowers that arent yellow or red but are wood dark like dark blood oh and whats this snakes snakes carved in the wood and women with big breasts like pamelas hmmm but no animals no puppies here no no hed walked into the theater without anybody stopping him the performance was nearly over you can walk into most theaters toward the end of a show said the man who tells him things and nobody notices you they think youre there to pick up somebody all the ushers here ignore him theyre talking about sports and restaurants and new years eve parties things like that its nearly four the digger hasnt been to a concert or a play for several years pamela and he went click went to someplace to hear music not a play not a ballet what was it someplace where people were dancing listening to music people in funny hats like cowboys wear playing guitar singing the digger remembers a song he hums to himself when i try to love you less i just love you all the more but nobodys singing today this show is a ballet a matinee they rhyme he thinks funny ballet matinee the digger looks at the wallat a poster a scary picture he doesnt like scarier than the picture of the entrance to hell its a picture of a soldier with a huge jaw and hes wearing a tall blue hat weird no click no no i dont like that at all he walks through the lobby thinking that pamela would rather see men in cowboy hats than soldiers with big jaws like this one shed get dressed up in clothes bright as flowers and go out to see the men in cowboy hats sing the diggers friend william wore hats like that sometime they all went out together he thinks they had fun but hes not sure the digger eases to the lobby barwhich is now closedand finds the service door steps through and makes his way up the stairs that smell like spilled soda past cardboard boxes of plastic glasses and napkins and gummi bears and twizzlers i love you all the more upstairs at the door that says balcony the digger steps into the corridor and walks slowly over the thick carpet go into box number fiftyeight said the man who tells him things i bought all the seats in the box so itll be empty its on the balcony level around the right side of the horseshoe shoe the digger asked what does he mean shoe the balcony is curved like a horseshoe go to a box ill go click go to a box whats a box itll be behind the curtains a little room overlooking the stage oh now nearly pm the digger walks slowly toward the box and nobody notices him a family is walking past the concession stand the father is looking at his watch theyre leaving early the mother is helping her daughter put her coat on as they walk and they both look upset theres a flower in the girls hair but its not yellow or red its white their other child a young boy of about five glances at the concession stand and stops he reminds the digger of the boy in the nice hotel no its closed the father says lets go well miss our dinner reservation and the boy looks like hes going to cry and hes led away by his father without gummi bears or twizzlers the digger is alone in the corridor he thinks he feels bad for the boy but he isnt sure he walks to the side of the horseshoe theres a young woman in a white blouse walking toward him she holds a flashlight hello she says lost she looks at his face the digger nuzzles the side of the puppy bag against her breast what she starts to ask phut phut he shoots her twice and when she drops to the carpet he grabs her hair and drags her inside the empty box he stops just on the other side of the curtain my this is click this is nice hmmm he looks out over the theater the digger doesnt smile but he now decides that he likes this place after all dark wood flowers plaster gold and a chandelier hmmm look at that nicer than the nice hotel though he thinks its not the best place for him to shoot concrete or cinderblock walls would be better that way the bullets would ricochet more and the sharp bits of lead would rattle around inside the skull of the theater and cause oh so much more damage he watches people dancing on the stage listens to the music from the orchestra but he doesnt really hear it hes still humming to himself cant get the song out of his cranium i look into the future i wonder whats in store i think about our life and i love you all the more the digger pushes the body of the woman against the velvet curtain hes hot and he undoes his coat even though the man who tells him things told him not to but he feels better he reaches into the puppy bag and wraps his fingers around the grip of the gun takes the suppressor in his left hand he looks down over the crowds at the girls in pink satin boys in blue blazers women with skin showing in vs at their necks bald men and men with thick hair people aim little binoculars at the people on the stage in the middle of the theaters ceiling is that huge chandelier a million lights the ceiling itself is painted with pictures of fat angels flying through yellow clouds like the new years baby there arent that many doors and thats good even if he doesnt shoot more than thirty or forty people others will die crushed in the doorway thats good thats good four oclock his watch beeps he steps forward grips the suppressor through the crinkly bag glances at a puppys face one puppy has a pink ribbon one has a blue but no red and no yellow the digger thinks as he starts to pull the trigger then he hears the voice its behind him in the corridor through the pretty velvet curtain jesus christ the mans voice whispers we got him hes here and the man pulls the curtain aside as he lifts his black pistol but the digger heard him just in time and he throws himself against the wall and when the agent fires the shot misses the digger cuts him nearly in half with a onesecond burst from the uzi another agent behind the first one is wounded by the stream of bullets he looks at the diggers face and the digger remembers what he has to do so he kills that agent too the digger doesnt panic he never panics fear isnt even a piece of dust to him but he knows some things are good and other things are bad and not doing what hes been told to do is bad he wants to shoot into the crowd but he cant there are more agents rushing onto the balcony floor the agents have fbi windbreakers on bulletproof vests some have helmets some have machine guns that probably shoot just as fast as his uzi a dozen agents two dozen several turn the corner and run toward where the bodies of their friends lie the digger sticks the bag out through the curtain into the lobby and holds the trigger down for a moment glass breaks mirrors shatter twizzlers and gummi bears fly through the air he should click should shoot into the audience thats what hes supposed to supposed to do he for a moment his mind goes blank he should click more agents more police shouting theres so much confusion dozens of agents will soon be in the corridor outside the box theyll throw a hand grenade at him and stun him and maybe shoot him to death and the bullets wont rattle aroundtheyll go straight through his heart and it will stop beating or theyll take him back to connecticut and shove him through the entrance to hell hell stay there forever this time hell never see the man who tells him things ever again he sees people jumping from the balcony onto the crowds below its not far to fall shouting the agents and the policemen theyre everywhere the digger unscrews the suppressor and aims the gun at the chandelier he pulls the trigger a roar like a buzzsaw the bullets cut the stem and the huge tangle of glass and metal tumbles to the floor trapping people underneath a hundred screams everyone is panicked the digger eases over the balcony and drops onto the shoulders of a large man fifteen feet below they fall to the floor and the digger springs to his feet then hes being rushed through the fire door with the rest of the crowd he still clutches the shopping bag outside into the cool air hes blinded by the spotlights and flashing lights from the fifty or sixty police cars and vans but there arent many police or agents outside theyre mostly in the theater he guesses he jogs with a middleaged couple through an alley away from the theater hes behind them they dont notice him he wonders if he should kill them but that would mean mounting the suppressor again and the threads are hard to align besides they dont look at his face so he doesnt need to kill them he turns into another alley and in five minutes is walking along a residential street the bag tucked neatly under the arm of his black or blue coat his dark cap snug over his ears id love you if youre sick id love you if youre poor the diggers humming even when youre miles away i love you all the more man parker len hardy said shaking his head with youthful admiration good job you nailed it c p ardell meant the same when he said dont fuck around with this man no how no way margaret lukas listening to her phone said nothing to parker her face was still emotionless but she glanced at him and nodded it was her form of thanks yet parker kincaid didnt want gratitude he wanted facts he wanted to know how bad the shooting had been and if the body count included the diggers on a console speakers clattered with static as jerry baker and the emergency workers stepped on each others transmissions parker could understand very little of what they said lukas cocked her head as she listened to her phone she looked up and said two agents dead two wounded an usher killed and one man in the audience was killed by the chandelier a dozen injured some serious some kids were hurt bad in the panic got trampled but theyll live theyll live parker thought grimly but their livesll never be the same daddy tell me about the boatman parker asked and he got away he did yes lukas said sighing description she shook her head and looked at cage who was on his phone too he muttered nope nobody got a damn look at him well two people did two of ours but theyre the ones he capped parker closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the gray padding of the office chair it had to have been the one hed ordered years ago there was a certain musty plasticky smell about it that brought back memoriessome of the many that were surfacing tonight memories he had no desire to experience forensics he asked perts going over the place with a microscope cage said buti dont get ithes firing an automatic weapon and therere no shell casings parker said oh hes got the gun in a bag or something catches the casings how do you know that hardy asked i dont but its what id do if i were him anybody at the hotel get a look at him leaving the bullets nope cage muttered and theyve canvassed everybody there one kid said he saw the boogeyman but he couldnt remember anything about him boogeyman parker thought wryly just great and he reflected what a photo finish lukas had finally agreed to go along with parker saying icily all right all right well stop the response but god help you if youre wrong kincaid shed ordered the teams to hold their positions then they spent a frantic few minutes trying to guess where the digger mightve gone parker had reasoned that hed leave the bullets at the hotel not long before fourso hed have ten minutes tops to get to the real target the killer couldnt rely on getting a cab on a holiday afternoon and buses in the district were very unpredictable hed have to walk that meant about a fiveblock radius parker and the team had pored over a map of georgetown suddenly hed looked at the clock and said are there matinees today in the theaters lukas had grabbed his arm yes i saw some in the post this morning tobe geller was a music fan and he mentioned the mason theater which was only a fiveminute walk from the four seasons parker ripped open a copy of the washington post and found that a performance of the nutcracker had started at two and would be letting out around four a crowded theater would be just the target for the digger he asked lukas to call jerry baker and have him send all the troops there all of them all of them god help you if youre wrong kincaid but he hadnt been wrong still what a risk hed taken and though many lives had been saved some had been lost and the killer had escaped parker glanced at the extortion note the man whod written it was dead but the note itself felt very much alive it seemed to be sneering at him he felt a crazy urge to grab an examination probe and drive it into the notes heart cages phone rang again and he answered it spoke for a few minuteswhatever the news was it seemed encouraging to judge from his face then he hung up that was a shrink teaches criminal psychology at georgetown says hes got some info about the name the digger parker asked yeah hes on his way over good lukas said cage asked whats next lukas hesitated for a moment then asked parker what do you think you dont have to limit your thoughts to the document he said well id find out if the box in the theater he shot from was empty and if it was did the unsub buy out the whole boxso the diggerd have a good shooting position and then id find out if he used a credit card lukas nodded at c p who flipped open his phone and called jerry baker and posed the questions to him he waited for a moment then listened to his response c p disconnected nice try he rolled his eyes but parker speculated aloud he bought the tickets two weeks ago and paid cash three weeks ago the agent muttered rubbing the shiny top of his head with a rough palm and paid cash hell parker snapped in frustration nothing to do but move on he turned to the notes hed taken of lincoln rhymes observations well need some maps good ones not like this he tapped the street map that theyd used to try to figure out where the digger had gone from the four seasons parker continued i want to figure out where the trace in the letter came from narrow down the part of town he was staying in lukas nodded at hardy if we can do that well get jerrys team and some of your people from district pd and do a canvass flash his pic and see if anybodys seen him at a house or apartment she handed geller a copy of the coroners photo of the unsub in the morgue tobe make a hundred prints of this will do parker looked over the list of trace rhyme had identified granite clay brick dust sulfur ash where had the materials come from the young clerk whod brought them the note earliertimothy parker recalledappeared in the doorway agent lukas yes couple things you ought to know about first of all moss gary moss parker remembered the memo about the children whod nearly been burned to death hes kind of freaked out he saw a janitor and thought it was a hitman lukas frowned who was it one of our people yeah one of the cleaning staff we checked it out but mosss totally paranoid he wants us to get him out of town he thinks hell be safer well we cant get him out of town hes not one of our priorities at the moment i just thought id tell you timothy responded she looked around and seemed to debate she said to len hardy detective you mind holding his hand for a while me would you hardy didnt look happy this was yet another subtle slap in the face parker recalled that the hardest part of his job when he was running the division was dealing not with elusive documents but with the delicate egos of his employees i guess hardy said thanks lukas gave him a smile then she said to timothy you said there was something else primary security wanted me to tell you theres a guy downstairs a walkin and he says he knows something about the metro shooter whenever there was a major crime like this parker recalled the wackos crawled out of the woodworksometimes to confess to the crimes sometimes to help there were several reception rooms near the main entrance in headquarters for people like this when anyone with knowledge of a crime dropped into the fbi the good citizen was taken into one of these visitor rooms and pumped for information by an expert interrogator credentials lukas asked claims hes a journalist writing about a series of unsolved murders license and social security check out no warrants they didnt take it past a stagetwo check whats he say about the digger all he said is that this guys done it beforein other cities in other cities c p ardell asked what he says lukas looked at parker who said i think we better talk to him ii the changeling the first step in narrowing the field of suspects of a questioned writing is the identification of the national class and group characteristics further elimination of suspects is made when obvious individual characteristics are identified tabulated and evaluated edna w robertson fundamentals of document examination so hes in dc now is he the man asked they were downstairs in reception area b which is what the sign on the door reported in pleasant scripty type within the bureau however it was called interrogation room blue after the shade of the pastel decor inside parker lukas and cage sat across the battered table from hima large man with wild gray hair from the linguistics of his sentence parker knew the man wasnt from the area locals always call the city the district never dc who would that be lukas asked you know who answered the man coyly i call him the butcher what do you call him who the killer with a mans mind and the devils heart he said dramatically this fellow might have been a nut but parker decided that his words described the digger pretty well henry czisman was in clean but wellworn clothes a white shirt straining against his large belly a striped tie his jacket wasnt a sports coat but was the top of a gray pinstripe suit parker smelled the bitter scent of cigarettes in the clothes a battered briefcase sat on the table he cupped a mug of ice water on the table in front of him youre saying the man involved in the subway and theater shootings is called the butcher the one who actually did the shootings yes i dont know his accomplices name lukas and cage were silent for a moment she was scrutinizing the man closely and would be wondering how czisman knew the digger had a partner the news about the dead unsub had not been released to the press whats your interest in all this parker asked czisman opened the briefcase and took out several old newspapers the hartford newstimes they were dated last year he pointed out articles that hed written he wasor had beena crime reporter im on a leave of absence writing a truecrime book about the butcher he added somberly im following the trail of destruction true crime cage asked people like those books huh oh they love em bestsellers ann rule that ted bundy book you ever read it might have cage said people just eat up reallife crime says something about society doesnt it maybe somebody ought to do a book about that why people like it so much lukas prompted this butcher you were mentioning czisman continued that was his nickname in boston earlier in the year well i think one paper called him the devil the devils teardrop parker thought lukas was glancing at him and he wondered if she was thinking the same he asked what happened in boston czisman looked at him glanced at his visitors pass it had no name on it parker had been introduced by cage as a consultant mr jefferson there was a shooting at a fastfood restaurant near faneuil hall lucys tacos parker hadnt heard of itor had forgotten if the incident had made the news but lukas nodded four killed seven injured perp drove up to the restaurant and fired an automatic shotgun through the window no motive parker supposed that shed read all the violent criminal apprehension program bulletins she continued if i recall there was no description of that perp either oh hes the same you bet he is and no there was no description just guesses hes probably white but not necessarily how old thirties or forties height medium build medium he could be anybody not like those ponytailed bodybuilding bad guys in madefortv movies pretty easy to spot them but the butcher hes just an average man on the street pretty scary isnt it lukas was about to ask a question but czisman interrupted you said there was no motive in the restaurant shooting agent lukas not according to vicap well did you know that ten minutes after the butcher finished lobbing rounds through the plateglass window and killing the women and children a jewelry store was robbed four miles away no that wasnt in the report czisman asked and did you know that every tactical officer for two miles around was at the restaurant so even though the owner of the jewelry store hit the silent alarms the police couldnt get to the store in their normal response time of four minutes it took twelve in that time the thief killed the owner and a customer they were the only witnesses he was the butchers accomplice the thief czisman said who else would it be lukas sighed we need any information you have but i dont sense youre really here out of civic duty czisman laughed she added what exactly do you want access he said quickly just access to information thats right for my book wait here she said rising she gestured parker and cage after her just off room blue on the first floor of headquarters tobe geller was sitting in a small darkened room in front of an elaborate control panel on lukass orders hed watched the entire interview with henry czisman on six different monitors czisman would have no idea he was being watched because the bureau didnt use twoway mirrors in its interrogation roomsthe sort you see in urban police stations rather on the walls of the room were three prints of impressionist paintings they happened to have been picked not by a gsa facilities planner or a civilian interior designer but by tobe geller himself and several other people from the bureaus comtech group they were prints of paintings by georges seurat who pioneered the pointillist technique six of the tiny dots in each of the three paintings were in fact miniature video camera lenses aimed so precisely that every square inch of the interrogation room was covered conversations were also recordedon three different digital recorders one of which was linked to a computer programmed to detect the sequence of sounds of someone drawing a weapon czisman like all interviewees had been searched and scanned for a gun or knife but in this business you could never take too many precautions lukas had instructed geller though that his main job was not so much security as data analysis czisman would mention a factthe robbery in boston for instanceand geller would instantly relay the information to susan nance a young special agent standing by upstairs in communications she in turn would contact the field office and seek to verify the information czisman had never drunk from the mug of water cage had placed in front of him but he did clutch it nervously which is what everyone did when they sat in fbi interrogation rooms the mug had a pressuresensitive surface and a microchip battery and transmitter in the handle it digitized czismans fingerprints and transmitted them to gellers computer he in turn sent them to the automated fingerprint identification system database for matching one of the video camerasin a print of seurats famous sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte which was a complicated painting that every interviewee tended to look at frequentlywas locked onto czismans eyes and was performing retinal scans for veracity probability analysisthat is lie detection geller was also doing voice stress analysis for the same reason lukas now directed cage and kincaid into the observation room anything yet lukas asked geller its prioritized he said typing madly a moment later his phone rang and lukas slapped the speakerphone tobe a womans voice asked go ahead he said the task force is here hi susan lukas said its margaret go ahead give us the deets whatve you got okay prints came back negative on warrants arrests convictions name henry czisman is legit address in hartford connecticut bought his house twelve years ago property taxes are up to date and he paid off the mortgage last year the image you beamed up matches his connecticut drivers license photo ninetyfive percent likely is that good kincaid interrupted my present picture matches ninetytwo percent nance responded ive got longer hair now she continued employment record through social security administration and irs shows him working as a journalist since but some years he had virtually no income listed his job those years as freelance writer so hes taken plenty of time off not living on his wifes salary either he used to be married but his filing status is single now paid no quarterly estimated this year which hes done in the past and that suggests hes got no reportable income at all this year ten years ago he had very high medical deductions looks like it was treatment for alcohol abuse became selfemployed a year ago quit a fiftyonethousanddollarayear job at the hartford paper and is apparently living off savings quit fired or took a leave of absence kincaid asked not sure nance paused she continued we couldnt get as many credit card records as we wanted because of the holiday but hes staying at the renaissance under his name and he checked in after a noon flight from hartford united express no advanced purchase made the reservation at ten am this morning so he left just after the first shooting lukas mused oneway ticket kincaids question anticipated her own yes what do we think lukas asked goddamn journalist is all id say cage offered and you she glanced at kincaid he said what do i think i say we deal with him when i analyze documents i need every bit of information i can get about the writer if you know its really the writer lukas said skeptically she paused then said he seems like a crank to me are we that desperate yes kincaid said glancing at the digital clock above tobe gellers computer monitor i think we are in the stuffy interrogation room once more lukas said to czisman if we talk off the record now and if we can bring this to a successful resolution czisman laughed at the euphemism motioned for the agent to continue if we can do that then well give you access to materials and witnesses for your book im not sure how much yet but youll have some exclusivity ah my favorite word exclusivity yes thats all im asking for but everything we tell you now lukas continued will be completely confidential agreed czisman said lukas nodded at parker who asked does the name digger mean anything to you digger czisman shook his head no as in gravedigger we dont know its the name of the shooterthe one you call the butcher lukas said i only call him the butcher because the boston papers did the new york post called him the devil in philadelphia he was the widow maker new york philly too lukas asked parker noticed that she was troubled by this news jesus cage muttered a pattern criminal czisman said theyve been working their way down the coast headed where dont we wonder to florida for retirement more likely the islands somewhere what happened in the other cities parker asked the international beverage case czisman responded ever hear of it lukas was certainly current on her criminal history the president of the company right he was kidnapped details parker asked her impressed at her knowledge czisman looked at lukas who nodded for him to continue the police had to piece it together but it looks likenobodys exactly surebut it looks like the butcher took the presidents family hostage the wife told her husband to get some money together he agreed was there a letter parker asked thinking there might be another document he could examine a note no it was all done by phone well the president tells the kidnapper hed pay then he calls the police and hostage rescue surrounds the house yada yada yada the whole nine yards while the president goes to his bank to get the ransom but as soon as they opened up the vault a customer pulls out a gun and begins shooting killed everyone in the bank the international beverage president two guards three customers three tellers two vice presidents on duty the video camera shows another man with him walking into the vault and walking out with a bag of money so there was nobody in the house lukas asked understanding the scheme nobody alive the butcherthe diggerhad already killed the family looks like he did it after she called her husband parker said he hit them at the weakest point in the kidnapping process the police would have the advantage in a negotiation or in an exchange of the money he preempted them he didnt say aloud what he was thinking that it was a perfect solution to a difficult puzzleif you dont mind killing anything in the banks security video thatd help us cage asked you mean what color were their ski masks cages shrug meant i had to ask anyway what about philly lukas asked czisman said cynically oh this was very good the digger starts taking the bus hed get on sit next to someone and fire one silenced shot he killed three people then his accomplice made the ransom demand the city agreed to pay the ransom but set up surveillance to nail him but the accomplice knew which bank the city had its accounts in as soon as the rookies escorting the cash stepped outside the door of the bank the digger shot them in the back of the head and they escaped i never heard about that one lukas said no they wanted it kept quiet six people dead parker said massachusetts new york pennsylvania washington youre righthe was on his way south czisman frowned was parker glanced at lukas she told czisman hes dead what czisman seemed truly shocked the partnernot the digger what happened czisman whispered hitandrun after he dropped the extortion note off and before he could collect his extortion money czismans face grew still for a long moment parker supposed he was thinking there goes the exclusive interview with the perp the huge mans eyes darted around the room he shifted in his chair what was his scheme this time lukas was reluctant to say but czisman guessed the butcher shoots people until the city pays the ransom but now theres nobody to pay the money to and so the butchers going to keep right on shooting sounds just like their mo you have any leads to where his lair might be the investigation is continuing lukas said warily czisman stared at one of the prints a pastoral landscape he kneaded the water mug manically parker asked how did you follow him here i read everything i can find about crimes where somebody has no qualms about killing most people do you know unless their raison dêtre is killinglike bundy or gacy or dahmer no most professional criminals will hesitate to pull the trigger but the butcher never and when id hear about a multiple homicide that was part of a robbery or extortion id go to the city where it had happened and interview people lukas asked why hasnt anybody made the connection czisman shrugged isolated crimes small body counts oh i told the police in white plains and philly but nobody paid much attention to me he laughed bitterly waved his arm around the room tookwhattwentyfive dead before anybodyd perk up their ears and listen to me parker asked what can you tell us about the digger hasnt anybody gotten a look at him no czisman said hes a wisp of smoke hes there and then hes gone hes a ghost he lukas had no patience for this were trying to solve a crime here if you can help us wed appreciate it if not we better get on with our investigation sure sorry sorry its just that ive lived with this man for the past year its like climbing a cliffit could be a mile high but all you see is a tiny spot of rock six inches from your face see i have a theory why people dont notice him whats that parker asked because witnesses remember emotion they remember the frantic robber whos shooting someone in desperation the cop whos panicked and firing back the woman screaming because shes been stabbed but you dont remember calm and the diggers always very calm calm as death czisman said nothing about his habits clothes food vices no nothing czisman seemed distracted can i ask what youve learned about the accomplice the dead man nothing about him either lukas said he had no id on him fingerprints were negative would you would it be all right if i took a look at the body is it in the morgue cage shook his head lukas said sorry its against the regs please there was almost a desperation to the request lukas though was unmoved she said shortly no a picture maybe czisman persisted lukas hesitated then opened the file and took out the photo of the unsub at the accident site near city hall and handed it to him his sweaty fingers left fat prints on the glossy surface czisman stared for a long moment he nodded can i keep this after the investigation sure he handed it back id like to do a ridealong where a reporter accompanies police on an investigation but lukas shook her head sorry ill have to say no to that i could help he said i might have some insights i might have some thoughts thatd help no cage said firmly with another look at the picture czisman rose he shook their hands and said im staying at the renaissancethe one downtown ill be interviewing witnesses if i find something helpful ill let you know lukas thanked him and they walked him back to the guard station one thing czisman said i dont know what kind of deadlines heczisman nodded toward lukass file meaning the unsubcame up with but now that hes gone theres no one to control the butcher the digger you understand what that means dont you what she asked that he might just keep on killing even after the last deadline why do you think that because its the one thing he does well killing and everybody loves to do what they do well thats a rule of life now isnt it they huddled once more in the surveillance room in a cluster around tobe geller and his computer lukas said into the speakerphone how bout the other crimes he mentioned susan nance responded couldnt get any of the case agents in boston white plains or philly but the onduty personnel confirmed the cases are all open nobody heard of the name butcher though forensics parker asked just as lukas started to ask foren nothing no prints no trace and the witnesses well the ones who lived said they never really saw either the unsub or the diggerif it was the digger ive put in requests for more info on the shootings theyre calling case agents and detectives at home thanks susan lukas said she hung up geller said im getting the other analysis he looked at the screen okay voice stress and ret scansnormal readings stress is awfully low especially for somebody being crossexamined by three feds but id give him a clean bill of health nothing consistent with major deception but then with practice you can beat most polygraphs with a valium and a daydream about your favorite actress lukass phone rang she listened looked up its security hes almost out of primary surveillance range we let him go parker said id say yes agreed cage said lukas nodded she said into her phone no detention for subject she hung up then glanced at her watch the shrink the guy from georgetown hes on his way cage said now gellers phone rang he answered and spoke for a moment after he hung up he announced comtech theyve found a hundred and sixtyseven working web sites that have information about packing silencers and fullauto machinepistol conversions guess what not one of emll hand over email addresses they dont seem inclined to help out the federal government dead end lukas said wouldnt do us much good anyway geller noted comtech added up the hit counter totals from about a hundred of the sites more than twentyfive thousand peopleve logged on in the last two months fuckedup world out there cage muttered the door opened len hardy walked inside hows moss lukas asked hes okay there were two hangups on his voice mail at home and he thought they mightve been death threats lukas said we should have communications hardy eyes on the elaborate control panels interrupted i asked one of your people to check em out one call was from mosss brother the other was a telemarketer from iowa i called em both back and verified them lukas said thats just what i was going to ask detective figured it was thanks district of columbia at your service he said parker thought the irony in his voice was fairly subdued lukas didnt seem to notice it at all parker asked whatre we doing about that map weve got to analyze the trace geller said the best one i can think of is in the topographic archives the archives cage asked shaking his head theres no way we can get in there parker could only imagine the difficulty of finding civil servants willing to open up a government facility on a holiday night lukas flipped open her phone cage said no way ah she said you dont have the corner on miracles you know the brass clock it meant so much to him mayor jerry kennedy looked at it now resting prominently on his desk in city hall the gift was from students at thurgood marshall elementary a school square in the war zone of ward southeast dc kennedy had been very touched by the gesture no one took washington the city seriously washington the political hub washington the federal government washington the site of scandaloh that was what captured everyones attention but no one knew or cared how the city itself ran or who was in charge the children of thurgood marshall had cared however hed spoken to them about honor and working hard and staying off drugs platitudes sure but a few of them sitting in the pungent damp auditorium itself a victim of the school board scandal had gazed up at him with the look of sweet admiration on their faces then theyd given him the clock in appreciation of his talk kennedy touched it now looked at the face so the fbi had come close to stopping the madman but they hadnt some deaths some injuries and more and more panic around the city hysteria thered already been three accidental shootingsby people carrying illegal pistols for protection they thought theyd seen the digger on the street or in their backyards and had just started shooting like feuding neighbors in west virginia and then there were the press reports berating kennedy and the district police for not being up to the challenge of a criminal like this for being soft on crime and for hiding out one report even suggested that kennedy had been unavailableon the phone trying to get tickets to one of his beloved football gameswhile the theater shooting was going on the reviews of his tv appearance were not good either one interviewee a political commentator had actually echoed congressman laniers phrase kowtowing to terrorists hed also worked the word cowardly into his commentary twice the phone rang wendell jefferies sitting across from the mayor grabbed the receiver first uhhuh okay he closed his eyes then shook his head he listened some more he hung up well theyve scoured the entire theater and cant find an iota of evidence no fingerprints no witnessesno reliable ones anyway jesus what is this guy invisible theyve got some leads from this former agent former agent kennedy asked uncertainly document expert hes found something but not much the mayor complained we need soldiers we need police out on every street corner we dont need former paper pushers jefferies cocked his smooth head cynically the possibility of police on every street corner of the district of columbia was appealing of course but was the purest of fantasies kennedy sighed he might not have heard me the tv broadcast possibility but its twenty million dollars kennedy argued with his unseen foe the digger why the hell doesnt he contact us he could have twenty million dollars they nearly got him maybe next time they will at his window kennedy paused looked at the thermometer that gave the outside temperature thirtythree degrees it had been thirtyeight just a half hour ago temperature falling snow clouds were overhead why are you here he silently asked the digger once again why here why now he raised his eyes and looked at the domed wedding cake of the capitol building when pierre lenfant came up with the plan of the city of washington in he had a surveyor draw a meridional line north and south and then another exactly perpendicular to it dividing the city into the four quadrants that remain today the capitol building was at the intersection of these lines the center of the cross hairs some guncontrol advocate had once said at a congressional hearing where kennedy was testifying but the figurative telescopic sight might very well be aimed directly at kennedys chest the sixtythreesquaremile city was foundering and the mayor was passionately determined not to let it go under he was a native washingtonian a dying species in itselfthe city population had declined from a high of more than to around a half million it continued to shrink yearly an odd hybrid of body politic the city had only had selfrule since the s aside from a fewyear period a century earlier though corruption and incompetence had quickly pushed the city into bankruptcy and back under congressional domination twentyfive years ago the federal lawmakers turned the reins over to the city itself and from then on a mayor and the thirteenmember city council had struggled to keep crime under control at times the district had the worst murder rate in america schools functioning students testing lower than in any other major city finances in check forever in the red and racial tensions defused asian versus black versus white there was a real possibility that congress would step in once more and take over the city the lawmakers had already removed the mayors blanket spending power and that would be a disasterbecause kennedy believed that only his administration could save the city and its citizens before the place erupted into a volcano of crime and homelessness and shattered families more than percent of young black men in dc were somewhere in the systemin jail on probation or being sought on warrants in the s onequarter of families in the district had been headed by a single parent now the figure was closer to threequarters jerry kennedy had had a personal taste of what might happen if the city continued its downward trajectory in then a lawyer working for the district school board hed gone to the mallthe stretch of grass and trees presided over by the washington monumentfor human kindness day a racial unity event hed been among the hundreds injured when racial fighting broke out among the crowd it was on that day that he gave up plans to move to virginia and run for congress he decided to become the mayor of the nations capital by god he was going to fix the place and he knew how to kennedy the answer was very simple and that answer was education you had to get the children to stay in school and if you could do that then selfesteem and the realization that they could make choices about their lives would follow yes knowledge can save you it had saved him lifting him out of the poverty of northeast dc boosting him into william and mary law school it got him a beautiful brilliant wife two successful sons a career he was proud of no one disagreed with the basic premise that education could save people of course but how to solve the puzzle of making sure the children learned was a different matter the conservatives bitched about what people ought to be like and if they didnt love their neighbors and live by family values then that was their problem we homeschool why cant everybody the liberals whined and pumped more money into the schools but all the cash did was slow the decay of the infrastructure it did nothing to make students stay in those buildings this was the challenge for gerald david kennedy he couldnt wave a wand and bring fathers back to mothers he couldnt invent an antidote to crack cocaine he couldnt get guns out of the hands of people who lived only fifteen miles from the national rifle associations headquarters but he did have a vision of how to make sure kids in the district continued their education and his plan could pretty much be summarized by one word bribery though he and wendell jefferies called it by another nameproject for the past year kennedy aided by his wife jefferies and a few other close associates had been negotiating with members of the congressional district committee to impose yet another tax on companies doing business in washington the money would go into a fund from which students would be paid cash to complete high schoolprovided they remained drug free and werent convicted of any crimes in one swoop kennedy managed to incur the political hatred of the entire political spectrum the liberals dismissed the idea as a potential source of massive corruption and had problems with the mandatory drug testing as a civil liberties issue the conservatives simply laughed the corporations to be taxed had their own opinion of course immediately the threats startedthreats of major companies pulling out of the district altogether political action committee funds and hard and soft campaign money vanishing from democratic party coffers even hints of exposing sexual indiscretions of which there were nonebut try telling that to the media after theyve gotten their hands on blurry videotapes of a man and a woman walking into a motel six or holiday inn still kennedy was more than willing to risk this and in his months of bargaining on capitol hill to get the measure through committee it appeared that the measure might actually pass thanks largely to popular support but then that city employeegary mosshad summoned up his courage and gone to the fbi with evidence of a huge kickback scheme involving school construction and maintenance early investigations showed that wiring and masonry were so shoddy in some schools that faculty and students were at serious physical risk the scandal kept growing and it turned out involved a number of contractors and subs and highranking district officials some of them kennedy appointees and longtime friends kennedy himself had extolled moss and thrown himself into the job of rooting out the corruption but the press not to mention his opponents continued to try to link him to the scandal every news story about payoffs in the kennedy administrationand there were plenty of themeroded the support for project more and more fighting back the mayor had done what he did best he gave dozens of speeches describing the importance of the plan he horsetraded with congress and the teachers union to shore up support he even accompanied kids home from school to talk to their astonished parents about why project was important to everyone in the city the figures in the polls stabilized and it seemed to kennedy and wendy jefferies that they might just hold the line but then the digger arrived murdering with impunity escaping from crowded crime scenes striking again and who got blamed not the faceless fbi but everyones favorite target jerry kennedy if the madman killed any more citizens he believed project the hope for his citys futurewould likely become just a sour footnote in kennedys memoirs and this was the reason that jefferies was on the phone at the moment the aide put his hand over the receiver hes here jefferies said where kennedy asked sourly right outside in the hallway then he examined the mayor youre having doubts again how trim the man was kennedy thought how perfect he looks in his imported suit with his shaved head his silk tie frothing at his throat sure im having doubts the mayor looked out of another windowone that didnt offer a view of the capitol he could see in the distance the logotype tower of georgetown university his undergrad alma mater he and claire lived not far away from the school he remembered last fall the two of them walking up the steep stairway the priest had tumbled down at the end of the exorcist the priest who sacrificed himself to save the girl possessed by a demon now theres an omen for you he nodded all right go talk to him jefferies nodded well get through this jerry we will into the phone he said ill be right out in the hallway outside of the mayors office a handsome man in a doublebreasted suit leaned against the wall right below a portrait of some nineteenthcentury politician wendell jefferies walked up to him hey wendy slade this was the mans first name his real given name believe it or not andwith the surname phillipsyoud think his parents had foreseen that their handsome infant would one day be a handsome anchorman for a tv station which in fact he was got the story on the scanner dude lit up two agents did a phantom of the opera on a dozen poor bastards in the bleachers on the air with an earplug wire curling down his razorcleaned neck phillips talked differently in public he talked differently with white people he talked differently but jefferies was black and slade wanted him to think he talked the talk phillips continued capped one i think jefferies didnt point out to the newscaster that in gangsta slang the verb cap meant shoot to death not chandelier to death nearly got the perp but he booked thats what i heard jefferies said so the mans gonna rub our uglies and make us feel better this was a reference to kennedys impending press conference jefferies had no patience today to coddle the likes of slade phillips he didnt smile here it is this quote dudes gonna keep going nobody knows how dangerous he is how dangerous is jefferies waved him quiet this is as bad as it gets i know that everybodys going to be looking at him him uppercase h jerry kennedy phillips would understand this sure so we need some help jefferies said lowering his voice to a pitch that resonated with the sound of money changing hands help we can go twentyfive on this one twentyfive you bargaining jefferies asked no no just thats a lot what do you want me to do i want him kennedy jefferies sighed yes him to get through this like hes a hero i mean the hero peoplere dead and more peoplere probably gonna die get the focus on him for visiting vics and standing up to terrorists and i dont know coming up with some brilliant shit about catching the killer and get the focus off him for fuckups off the mayor jefferies said kennedys not the one no hes not the one running the case phillips cleared his baritone voice is that what you were going to say right jefferies said if theres any glitch make sure he wasnt informed and that he did his best to make it right well its a feebie operation right so we can just thats true slade but we dont want to go blaming the bureau for anything jefferies talked to his tenyearold nephew in just this tone we dont why exactly we just dont finally slade phillips used to reading off of a teleprompter had had it i dont get it wendy what do you want me to do i want you to play real reporter for a change sure phillips began writing copy in his head so kennedys taking a tough line hes marshaling cops hes going to the hospitals wait without his wife with his wife jefferies said patiently phillips nodded toward the press room but waitthey were saying i mean the guy from the post said kennedy didnt visit anybody they were going to oped him on it no no he went to the families who wanted to remain anonymous hes been doing it all day oh he has it was amazing what could buy you jefferies thought phillips added that was good of him real good dont overdo it jefferies warned but what do i do for footage i mean if the storys about him at the hospitals jefferies snapped just show the same five seconds of tape over and over again like you guys always do i dont know show the ambulances at the metro oh okay what about the fuckup part why do you think therell be a fuckup because in situations like this theres always a fuckup okay you need somebody to point a finger at but not not the feds okay said phillips but how exactly do i do that thats your job remember who what when where and why youre the reporter he took phillips by the arm and escorted him down the hallway go report you dont look good agent lukas its been a long day gary moss was in his late forties heavyset with shortcropped kinky hair just going gray his skin was very dark he was sitting on the bed in facility two a small apartment on the first floor of headquarters there were several apartments here used mostly for visiting heads of law enforcement agencies and for the nights when the director or dep director needed to camp out during major operations he was here because it was felt that given what moss knew and whom he was soon to testify against he would survive about two hours if placed in district custody the place wasnt bad government issue but with a comfortable double bed desk armchair tables kitchen tv with basic cable wheres that young detective i like him hardy hes in the war room hes mad at you why because i wont let him play cop yeah hes not investigative sure he told me hes a desk driver like me but he just wants a piece of the action youre trying to catch that killer arent you i saw about it on tv thats why yallve forgotten me nobodys forgotten about you mr moss the man gave a smile but he looked forlorn and she felt bad for him but lukas wasnt here just to hold hands witnesses who feel unhappy or unsafe sometimes forget things theyve heard and seen the us attorney running the kickback case wanted to make sure that gary moss was a very happy witness howre you doing miss my family miss my girls doesnt seem right when theyve had a scare like that i cant be there for them my wifell do a good job but a man should be with his family times like this lukas remembered the girls twins about five tiny plastic toys braided into their hair mosss wife was a thin woman with the wary eyes youd expect of someone whos just watched her house burn to the ground you celebrating she nodded at a gold pointed hat with happy new year printed on it there were a couple of noisemakers too moss picked up the hat somebody brought it for me i said what was i supposed to do with half of madonnas bra lukas laughed then she grew serious i just called on a secure phone your familys fine therere plenty of people looking out for them i never thought anybodyd try to hurt me or my family i mean when i was deciding to go to the fbi about what i found at the company i figured id get fired but i never thought peopled want to hurt us he hadnt the kickback scheme involved tens of millions of dollars and would probably result in the indictment of dozens of company employees and city officials lukas was surprised that moss had survived long enough to make it into federal protection what were you going to be doing tonight she asked with your family go to the mall and watch the fireworks let the girls stay up late theyd like that more than the show how bout you agent lukas whatd you have planned nothing she had nothing planned she hadnt told anybody this lukas thought about several of her friendsa woman cop out in fairfax a firefighter in burke several neighbors a man shed met at a wine tasting someone shed met in dog class where shed tried futilely to train jean luc she was more or less close with all of these people and a few others some she gossiped with some shed shared plenty of wine with one of the men she slept with occasionally theyd all asked her to new years eve parties shed told them all that she was going to a big party in maryland but it was a lie she wanted to spend the last night of the year alone and she didnt want anybody to know thislargely because she couldnt have explained why but for some reason she looked at gary moss a brave man a man trapped in the firestorm of washington dc politics and she told him the truth i was going to be spending it with my pooch and a movie he didnt offer any cloying sympathy instead he said brightly oh you have a dog sure do black lab shes pretty as a fashion model but boardcertified stupid how long you had her two years got her on thanksgiving moss said i got my girls a mutt last year pound puppy we thought wed lost her in the firebombing but she got out had the good sense to leave us behind and just take off got away from the flames what movie were you gonna watch dont know for sure some chick flick probably something good and sappy thatd make me cry didnt think fbi agents were allowed to cry only off duty what were going to do mr moss is keep you here until monday then youll be moved to a safe house run by the us marshals ha tommy lee jones the fugitive wasnt that a good movie i didnt see it rent it sometime maybe i will youll be fine gary youre in the safest place you could possibly be nobody can get to you here long as those cleaning men stop scaring the shit out of me he laughed he was trying to be upbeat but lukas could see the mans fearit was as if it pulsed though the prominent veins on his bony forehead fear for himself fear for his family well get some good dinner brought in for you a beer maybe he asked you want a sixpack hell yes name your brand well sam adams then he asked uncertainly that in the budget provided i get one of them ill keep it nice n cold for you you come back and get it after you catch that crazy guy he toyed with the hat for a moment she thought he might put it on but must have realized that the gesture would look pathetic he tossed it onto the bed ill be back later she told him where you going to look at some maps maps hey good luck to you agent lukas she walked through the door neither wished the other a happy new year outside in the cool air parker cage and lukas walked along the dimly lit sidewalk on the way to the topographic archives six blocks from headquarters washington dc is a city of occasional beauty and some architectural brilliance but at dusk in winter it becomes a murky place the budget christmas decorations did nothing to brighten the gray street parker kincaid glanced up at the sky it was overcast he remembered that snow was predicted and that the whos would want to go sledding tomorrow theyd trim the bushes in the backyard as hed promised robby and then drive out west toward the massanutten mountains with their sleds and a thermos of hot chocolate lukas interrupted these thoughts by asking him howd you get into the document business thomas jefferson parker answered hows that i was going to be a historian i wanted to specialize in jeffersonian history thats why i went to uva he designed the school didnt he the original campus he did id spend days in the archives there and at the library of congress in the district one day i was in charlottesville in the library looking over this letter jefferson had written to his daughter martha it was about slavery jefferson had slaves but he didnt believe in slavery but this letter written just before he died was adamantly proslavery and recanted his earlier opinions he said that slavery was one of the economic cornerstones of the country and should be retained it seemed strange to meand strange that hed write it to his daughter he loved her dearly but their correspondence was mostly domestic the more i read it the more i began to think the handwriting didnt look quite right i bought a cheap magnifying glass and compared the writing with a known and it was a fake right i took it to a local document examiner and he analyzed it caused quite a stirsomebody slipping a forgery into the jefferson archives especially one like that i got written up in the post whod done it lukas asked nobody knows it was from the sixtieswe could tell that because of the absorption of the ink the archivists think that the forger was a rightwinger whod planted the letter to take some of the wind out of the civil rights movement anyway from then on i was hooked parker gave lukas his curriculum vitae he had an ms in forensics from george washington university and he was certified by the american board of forensic document examiners in houston he was also in the american society of questioned document examiners the national association of document examiners and the world association of document examiners i did freelance work for a while but then i heard that the bureau was looking for agentexaminers went to quantico and the rest is history lukas asked what appealed to you about jefferson parker didnt even consider this he responded he was a hero we dont see many of them nowadays cage said oh people arent any different now than they ever were parker countered thereve never been many heroes but jefferson was because he was a renaissance man lukas asked because of his character i think his wife died in childbirth just about destroyed him but he rose above it he took over raising his daughters he put the same amount of effort into deciding what kind of dress to buy mary as he did in planning an irrigation system for the farm or interpreting the constitution ive read almost all of his letters nothing was too much of a challenge for him lukas paused looking at a window display of some chic clothes a black dress he noted she wasnt admiring it her eyes took in the outfit the way shed looked at the extortion note analytically parker was surprised something like this would distract her but cage said margaret heres one hell of a whatta you call it designer makes her own clothes shes great cage she chided absently you know anybody who does that no parker didnt he said nothing she turned away from the window and they continued down pennsylvania avenue the stately capitol ahead of them lukas asked him and you really turned down an sac yep a faint laugh of disbelief parker remembered the day that cage and the then deputy director came into the office to ask him if hed leave the document department and run a field office as cage had observed on his front porch earlier that day parker was not only good at analyzing documents he was good at catching bad guys too an agent or an assistant us attorney would come to him with a simple question about a document maybe a suspected forgery maybe a possible link between a perp and a crime scene and sitting in his bonsaitreefilled office in the lab parker would relentlessly crossexamine the unfortunate law enforcer who only wanted some technical information on the document but that wasnt enough for parker whered you find the letter no nowhich drawer does the unsub have a wife where does she live did he have a dog what were the circumstances of his last arrest as one question led to another parker kincaid was soon talking less about whether the handwriting matched a signature in a dmv application and more about where the unsub would logically be hiding out and he was nearly always right but hed had to turn the offer down a special agent in charge works long hours and at that time in his life he needed to be home for the childrens sake but none of this he wanted to share with lukas he wondered if shed ask more but she didnt she pulled out her cell phone and made a call parker was curious about the topographic archives they were headed for he asked what exactly quiet lukas whispered abruptly what he began be quiet keep walking and dont turn around he realized that she wasnt talking on the phone at all but merely pretending to cage asked her you got him too i put him twenty yards back closer to thirty no visible weapons and hes skittish erratic movement parker realized that that had been why lukas had been chatting him up and why shed stopped and gazed at the dresses in the windowshed suspected somebodyd been following them and she wanted the person lulled into thinking she didnt know he too glanced back into a window they passed and saw a man trotting across the streetto the same sidewalk they were on parker now noticed that both cage and lukas were holding their pistols he hadnt seen them draw the weapons they were black automatics and on the sights were three tiny green dots that glowed his service pistol had been a clunky revolver and what he remembered most about it was hating the regulation that required him to be armed at all times the thought of having a loaded gun anywhere near the whos disturbed him terribly lukas muttered something to cage and he nodded to parker she said act natural oh sure you think its the digger he asked could be she said plan cage whispered take him she responded calmly lord parker thought the digger was behind them with his machine gun hed been staking out headquarters and had learned they were primary on the case we nearly got him at the theater maybe the unsub had told him to take out the investigators if it looked as if they were getting close you take the street lukas said to cage kincaid you cover the alley in case theres backup i shhh on three one two but i parker began three they separated fast cage stepped into the street stopping cars lukas turned and sprinted in the direction theyd just come from federal agent she shouted you you there freeze hands on top of your head parker glanced into the alley and wondered what he was supposed to do if he saw an accomplice there he pulled out his cell phone punched in and put his thumb over the send button it was all he could think of he looked behind him at lukas beyond her the man stopped abruptly then turned and took off in a dead run down the middle of the street hold it lukas was racing along the sidewalk the man veered to the right disappeared into traffic she tried to follow but a car turned the corner quickly the driver didnt see her and nearly slammed into her lukas flung herself back onto the sidewalk inches from the fender when she started after him again the man was gone parker saw her pull her phone out and speak into it a moment later three unmarked cars with red lights flashing on the dashboard skidded into the intersection she conferred with one of the drivers and the cars sped off at a slow jog she returned to parker cage joined them lukas lifted her hands in exasperation cage shrugged you get a look at him nope parker answered i didnt either lukas muttered then she glanced at parkers hands wheres your weapon my what you were covering the alley we had a shake going down and you didnt draw your weapon well i dont have one thats what i was trying to tell you youre not armed she asked incredulously im civilian parker said why would i have a gun lukas gave a disdainful look to cage who said assumed he had one she bent down and tugged up her jeans cuff pulled a small automatic out of an ankle holster she handed it to parker he shook his head no thanks take it she insisted parker glanced at the gun in her hand im not comfortable with guns i was scicrime not tactical anyway my service weapon was a revolver not an automatic last time i fired one was on the range in quantico six seven years ago all you do is point and pull she said angry now the safetys off first shot is double action second single so adjust your aim accordingly parker wondered where her sudden anger came from he didnt take the weapon she gave a sigh which left her mouth as a long tendril of steam in the cooling temperature she said nothing but pushed the gun further out toward him he decided the battle wasnt worth it he reached out and took the gun glanced at it briefly and slipped it in his pocket lukas turned without saying anything and they continued up the street cage gave him a dubious look forewent a shrug and made a call on his cell phone as they walked along the street parker felt the weight of the pistol in his pocketa huge pull much greater than the dozen ounces the gun actually weighed yet it gave him no comfort to have this weapon at his side he wondered why a moment passed before he realized not because the hot piece of metal reminded him that the digger might have been behind them a moment ago intent on killing him and cage and lukas or even because it reminded him of the boatman four years ago reminded him of his sons terror no it was because the gun seemed to have some kind of dark power like the magic ring in one of j r r tolkiens books a power that had possessed him and was carrying him further and further away from his children with every passing minute a power that could separate him from them forever the digger is in an alley hes standing still looking around him there are no agents or police around here nobody chasing him or looking for him nobody to shoot him or capture him and send him back to connecticut where he likes the forests but he hates the barred rooms they make him sit in for hours and hours and do nothing where people steal his soup and change the channels of the tv away from commercials about cars and puppies so they can watch sports pamela said to him youre fat youre out of shape why dont you take up running go buy some nike click some nike jogging shoes go do that go to the mall ive got things to do the digger now thinks he sees pamela for a minute he squints no no its merely a blank wall in the alley do you promise to love honor cherish and click and obey he was jogging with pamela one day a fall day through red leaves and yellow leaves he tried to keep up sweating his chest hurting the way his brain hurt after the bullet bounced around in his cranium pamela ran ahead and he ended up jogging by himself ended up walking home alone the digger is worried about what went wrong at the theater hes worried about all the police and agents and worried that the man who tells him things will be unhappy because he didnt kill as many people as he was supposed to the digger hears sirens in the distance many sirens he starts through the alley lets the shopping bag swing in his arm the uzi is inside the bag and its heavy again because he reloaded it ahead of him in the alley he sees some motion he pauses theres a young boy hes black and skinny hes about ten years old the boy is listening to someone talk to him someone the digger cant see suddenly the digger hears pamelas voice have have have children with you have have have your baby if we had us a child or three or four you know id love you all the more then the memory of the song goes away because theres a tearing sound and the gun and the suppressor fall through the bottom of the shopping bag he bends down to pick up the gun and as he does he looks up hmmm this isnt funny the young boy and an older man dressed in dirty clothes the man who was talking to the boy are walking up the alley the man is bending the boys arm upward the boy is crying and his nose is bloody they are both looking at the digger the boy seems to be relieved he pulls away from the man and rubs his shoulder the man grabs the boys arm again the man looks down at the uzi he gives the digger a crooked smile says whatever you doing ain my business ima just go on my way leggo my arm the boy whines shuddup the man draws back his fist the boy cowers the digger shoots the man twice in the chest he falls backward the boy jumps back at the loud sound the suppressor is still on the ground the digger aims the gun at the boy who is staring at the body if somebody sees your face the digger starts to pull the trigger have have have children with you the words rattle around in his skull the boy is still staring down at the body of the man who was beating him the digger starts to pull the trigger again then he lowers the gun the boy turns and looks at the digger he whispers yo you cap him man just like nothin you cap him the boy is staring right at the diggers face ten feet away words rattling around kill him hes seen your face kill him killhimkillhimkillhim and things like that the digger says hmmm he stoops and picks up the spent shells and then the suppressor and wraps it and the gun in the torn puppy bag and walks out of the alley leaving the boy beside a garbage pile staring at the body go back to the motel and click go back to the motel and wait hell have some soup and wait hell listen to his messages see if the man who tells him things has called to tell him he can stop shooting when i hear you coming through the door some soup would be nice now i know i love you all the more he made soup for pamela he was making soup for pamela the night she click it was christmas night twelve twentyfive one two two five a night like this cold colored lights everywhere heres a gold cross for you he said and this box is for me a present oh its a coat thank you thank you thank you the digger is standing at the stoplight waiting for the green suddenly he feels something touch his hand the digger isnt alarmed the digger never gets alarmed he grips the gun in the torn puppy bag he turns slowly the boy stands beside him holding the diggers left hand tightly hes looking straight ahead love you love you love you the light changes the digger doesnt move all the more yo we can walk says the boy now staring at the puppies on the torn bag the digger sees the green figure in the walkdont walk light the green figure seems happy whatever happy is holding hands the two of them walk across the street the district of columbia topographic and geologic archives is housed in a musty old building near seventh and e streets it also not coincidentally is located near a littleknown secret service facility and the national security councils special operations office theres no reference to the archives in any tourist literature and visitors who notice the sign on the front of the building and walk inside are politely told by one of the three armed guards at the front desk that the facility is not open to the public and that there are no exhibitions here but thank you for your interest have a nice day goodbye cage parker and lukason her everpresent phonewaited in the lobby she shut off the unit nothing he just disappeared no witnesses a couple of drivers saw a man in dark clothes running they think he was white they think he was medium build but nobodyd swear to it jesus cage looked around howd you get us in here lukas i couldnt get us in here now it was lukass turn to shrug cryptically it seemed that new years eve was the day to call in markers and incur debts they were joined by tobe geller who entered the facility at a slow trot he nodded a greeting to the other members of the team then their fingerprints were checked by an identiscanner and their weapons secured in a lock box they were all directed to an elevator they stepped into the car parker expected to rise but this elevator it seemed went no higher than the first floor lukas hit the button marked b and the car descended for what seemed like forever they stepped out into the archives proper which turned out not to be stacks of dusty old books and mapswhich parker certified document examiner had been looking forward to checking outbut a huge room filled with hightech desks telephones microphones and banks of twentyfourinch nec computer screens even tonight new years eve two dozen men and women sat in front of these screens on which glowed elaborate maps typing on keyboards and speaking into stalk mikes where the hell am i parker wondered looking around and concluding that the issue of access to the archives had nothing to do with finding a civil servant with a key to the front door what is this he asked geller the young agent glanced tactfully at cage who nodded his okay to tell all geller replied topographic and cartographic database of two hundred square miles around the district ground zeros the white house though they dont like it when you say that in case of natural disaster terrorist attack nuclear threatwhateverthiss where they figure out if its best for the government to sit tight or get out of town and if so how they ought to do it what routes are safest how many congressmenll survive how many senators that sort of thing like the war room in fail safe way cool hmm whatre we doing here you wanted maps he said looking excitedly at all the equipment the way only a born hacker would do and thiss the most comprehensive physical database of any area in the world lincoln rhyme was saying we needed to know the area well we may not but they do he nodded affectionately toward a long row of sixfoothigh computer towers lukas said theyre letting us use the facility under protest provided we dont take any printouts or downloads with us we get searched on the way out geller said how come you know so much about it parker asked geller oh i sort of helped set it up lukas added oh by the way parker youve never heard of this place not a problem said parker eyeing the two machinegunarmed guards by the elevator door lukas said now whatre the materials rhyme found parker looked at the notes hed taken he read granite sulfur soot ash clay and brick tobe geller sat down at a monitor turned it on typed madly on a keyboard an image of the washington dc area came on the screen the resolution was astonishing it looked threedimensional parker thought absurdly how robby and stephie would love to play mario bros on a monitor like this lukas said to parker where do we start one clue at a time he responded then start narrowing down possibilities the way you solve puzzles three hawks have been killing a farmers chickens first granite brick dust and clay he mused they point to demolition sites construction he turned to geller would they be on this database no the young agent responded but we can track down somebody at building permits do it parker ordered geller made the call on a landlineno cell phone would work this far underground and besides like all secure facilities in washington parker supposed the walls were shielded what next parker wondered sulfur and soot that tells us its industrial tobe can you highlight areas based on air pollutants sure theres an epa file he added cheerfully its to calculate penetration levels of nerve gas and bioagent weapons more buttons the business of the district of columbia is government not industry and the commercial neighborhoods were devoted mostly to product warehousing and distribution but on the screen portions of the city began to be highlightedin appropriately pollutiontinted yellow the majority were in the southeast part of town hes probably living near there lukas reminded what industrial sites are adjacent to areas of houses and apartments geller continued to type crossreferencing the industrial neighborhoods with residential this eliminated some but not many of the manufacturing areas most of them were ringed with residential pockets still too many lukas said lets add another clue the ash parker said basically burnt animal flesh gellers hands paused above the keyboard he mused what could that be lukas shook her head then asked are there any meatprocessing plants in any of those areas this was a good suggestion one parker himself had been about to make geller responded none listed restaurants cage suggested probably too many of them parker said hundreds geller confirmed where else would there be burnt meat lukas asked no one in particular puzzles veterinarians parker wondered do they dispose of the remains of animals probably cage said geller typed then read the screen there are dozens all over the place then lukas looked up at parker and he saw that the chill from earlier was gone replaced by something else it might have been excitement her blue eyes were stones still perhaps but now they were radiant gems she said how about human remains a crematorium parker said yes and the polished granitethat could be from tombstones lets look for a cemetery cage gazed at the map he pointed arlington the national cemetery took up a huge area on the west side of the potomac the area around it must be saturated with granite dust but parker pointed out its not near any industrial sites nothing with significant pollution then lukas saw it there she pointed a finger tipped with an unpolished but perfectly filed nail gravesend tobe geller highlighted the area on the map enlarged it gravesend the neighborhood was a part of the district of columbias southeast quadrant parker had a vague knowledge of the place it was a decrepit crescent of tenements factories and vacant lots around memorial cemetery which had been a slave graveyard dating back to the early s parker pointed to another part of gravesend metro stop right here the unsub couldve taken the train directly to judiciary squarecity hall theres a bus route nearby too lukas considered it i know the neighborhoodive collared perps there theres a lot of demolition and construction going on its anonymous too nobody asks any questions about anybody else and a lot of people pay cash for rent without raising suspicion itd be the perfect place for a safe house a young technician near them took a phone call and handed the receiver to tobe geller as the agent listened to the caller his young face broke into an enthusiastic smile good he said into the phone get it to the document lab asap he hung up get this somebody got a videotape from the mason theater shooting a tape of the digger cage asked enthusiastically they dont know what its of exactly sounds like the qualitys pretty bad i want to start the analysis right away are you going to gravesend yep parker said looked at his watch two and a half hours until the next attack mcp geller asked lukas yeah order one parker recalled a mobile command post a camper outfitted with hightech communications and surveillance equipment hed worked in one several times analyzing documents at crime scenes ill have a video data analyzer installed geller said and get going on the tape where will you be lukas and parker said simultaneously there they found they were pointing at the same vacant lot near the cemetery not many apartments around there cage pointed out parker said but its close to the stores and restaurants lukas glanced at him and nodded we should narrow down the search by canvassing those places first theyll have the most contact with locals tobe pick up c p and hardy and bring em with you in the command post the agent hesitated a dubious look on his face hardy we really need him parker had been wondering the same thing hardy seemed like a nice enough guy a pretty good cop but he was way out of his depth in this case and that meant he or somebody else might get hurt but lukas said if its not him the districtll just put somebody else on board at least we can control hardy he doesnt seem to mind sitting in the back seat politics suck cage muttered as geller pulled on his jacket lukas said and that shrink the guy from georgetown if hes not at headquarters yet have somebody drive him over to gravesend will do geller ran for the elevator where he was as hed predicted thoroughly searched lukas stared at the map of gravesend its so damn big ive got another thought parker said he was thinking back to what hed learned about the unsub from the note he said we think he probably spent time on a computer remember right lukas said lets get a list of everybody in gravesend who subscribes to an online service cage protested there could be thousands ofem but lukas pointed out no i doubt it its one of the poorest parts of the city computersd be the last thing peopled spend money on cage said true okay ill have comtech get us a list therell still be a lot of territory to cover lukas muttered ive got a few other ideas parker said and walked to the elevator door where he too was diligently searched like a suspected shoplifter by the humorless guards kennedy paced in a slow circle around the dark green carpet in his office jefferies was on his cell phone he clicked it off slades got a few ideas but nothings going to happen fast kennedy gestured toward the radio well they were damn fast to report that ive been sitting on my butt while the citys getting the hell shot out of it they were fast to report that i didnt lift the hiring freeze at the police department so wed have more money for project jesus the medias making it sound like im an accomplice kennedy had just been to three hospitals to see the people wounded in the diggers attacks and their families but none of them seemed to care about his visit all anyone asked was why wasnt he doing more to catch the killer why arent you at fbi headquarters one woman had demanded tearfully because they havent fucking invited me kennedy thought furiously though his answer was a gentle im letting the experts do their job but theyre not doing their job and youre not either when he left her bedside kennedy didnt offer to shake hands her right arm had been so badly shot up it had been amputated sladell come up with something jefferies now said too little too late now that man is too damn pretty kennedy spat out pretty people i never trust them then he heard the paranoid words and he laughed jefferies did too the mayor asked am i turning into a crank wendy yessir its my duty to tell you your brainsve gone to grits the mayor sat down in his chair he looked at his desk calendar if it werent for the digger he would have been attending four parties tonight one at the french embassy one at his alma mater georgetown university one at the city workers union hall andthe most important where hed actually ring in the new yearthe africanamerican teachers association in the heart of southeast this was the group that was lobbying hard to get his project accepted among rankandfile teachers throughout the district he and claire needed to be there tonight as a show of support and yet it would be impossible for him to attend any parties do any celebrating with that madman stalking the citizens of his city a wave of anger passed through him and he grabbed the phone what jefferies asked cautiously are you going to do something he answered im going to goddamn do something he began dialing a number from a card on his rolodex what asked jefferies now even more uneasy but by then the call to fbi headquarters had been connected and kennedy didnt respond to his aide he was patched through several locations a mans voice answered yes thiss mayor jerry kennedy whom i speaking to a pause kennedy who often made his own phone calls was used to the silence that greeted his salutation special agent c p ardell what can i do for you that agent lukas shes still in charge of the metshoot operation thats right can i speak to her shes not here sir no i can patch you through to her cell phone thats all right im actually trying to reach the district liaison officer detective hardy agent ardell said hold on hes right here a moment later a voice said tentatively hello this hardy len hardy thats right thiss your mayor again oh well how are you sir caution now mixed with the youth in the mans voice can you update me on the case i havent heard a word from agents lukas or cage you have any idea where the diggers going to hit next another pause nosir the pause was too long hardy was lying about something no idea at all they arent exactly keeping me in the loop well your jobs liaison right my orders are just to write a report on the operation agent lukas said shed contact chief williams directly a report thats ass covering listen to me i have a lot of confidence in the fbi they do this shootemup stuff all the time but how close are they to stopping this killer bottom line no bullshit hardy sounded uneasy they have a few leads they think they know the neighborhood where the unsubs safe house isthe guy who was killed by the truck where another pause he pictured poor hardy twisting in the wind feds on one side his boss on the other well too fucking bad im not supposed to give out tactical information to anyone sir im sorry its my city thats under attack and my citizens whore being slaughtered i want answers more silence kennedy looked up at wendell jefferies who shook his head kennedy forced his anger down he tried to sound reasonable as he said let me tell you what i have in mind the whole point of this scheme was for those men to make money its not to kill i think thats true sir if i can just have a chance to talk to the killerat this safe house or where hes going to hit at eighti think i can convince him to give up ill negotiate with him i can do that kennedy did believe this because one of his talents in this respect like his namesake from the sixties was his ability to persuade hell hed sweettalked two dozen of the toughest presidents and ceos in the district into accepting the tax that would fund project hed talked poor gary moss into naming names in the board of education scandal twenty minutes with this killereven staring down the barrel of that machine gun of hiswould be enough hed work out some kind of arrangement the way theyre describing him hardy said i dont think hes the sort you can negotiate with you let me be the judge of that detective now wheres his safe house i tell me the line hummed still the detective said nothing kennedys voice lowered you dont owe the feds a thing son you know how they feel about you being on the task force youre a step away from fetching coffee thats wrong sir agent lukass made me part of the team has she pretty much you dont feel like a third wheel im asking that cause i feel like one if lanier had his wayyou know congressman lanier yessir if he had his way my only job tonightd be sitting in the reviewing stand on the mall watching fireworks you and methe district of columbias our city so come on son wheres that goddamn safe house kennedy watched jefferies cross his fingers please it would be perfect i show up there i try to talk the man into coming out with his hands up either he surrenders or they kill him and either way my credibility survives either way im no longer the mayor who watched the murder of his city on cnn while he kicked back with a beer kennedy heard voices from the other end of the line then hardy was back im sorry mayor i have to go therere people here im sure agent lukas will be in touch detective the line went blank gravesend the car carrying parker and cage bounded over gaping potholes and eased to a stop at a curb where trash and rubble spilled into the street the burntout torso of a toyota rested ironically against a fire hydrant they climbed out lukas had driven in her own car a red ford explorer and was already at the vacant lot that was the rendezvous point she was standing with her hands on her trim hips looking around the smells of urine and shit and burning wood and trash were very strong parkers parents who became world travelers after his father had retired from teaching history had once found themselves in a slum in ankara turkey parker still could remember the letter hed received from his mother who was an ardent correspondent it was the last letter hed received from them before theyd died it was framed and up on the wall of his study downstairs next to the whos wall of fame theyre impoverished the people here and that more than racial differences more than culture more than politics more than religion turns their hearts to stone he thought of her words now as he looked over the desolation of the area two black teenagers whod been leaning against a wall graffitid with gang colors looked at the men and women arrivingobviously law enforcersand walked away slowly uneasiness and defiance on their faces parker was troubledthough not by the danger by the hugeness of the place it was three or four square miles of slums and row houses and small factories and vacant lots how could they possibly find the unsubs safe house in this much urban sprawl there were some riddles that parker had never been able to figure out three hawks smoke wafted past him it was from fires in the oil drums where the homeless men and women and the gangstas burned wood and trash for warmth he saw more hulks of stripped cars across the street was a building that seemed deserted the only clue to habitation was a bulb burning behind a red towel covering a broken window just past the metro stop over a tall decaying brick wall the chimney of the crematorium rose into the night sky there was no smoke rising from it but the sky above the muzzle rippled in the heat perhaps its fires always burned parker shivered the sight reminded him of oldtime pictures of hell lukas muttered it looks like hell parker glanced at her cage shrugged in agreement a car arrived it was jerry baker wearing a bulky windbreaker and body armor parker saw that as befit a tactical agent he was also wearing cowboy boots cage handed him the stack of computerized pictures of the unsubthe death mask portrait from the morgue well use these for the canvas at the bottom thats the only description we have of the digger not much another shrug more unmarked cars and vans began to pull up their dashboard flashers reflecting in the bands of storefront windows fbi government issue wheels whiteandteal district police cars too their light bars revolving there were about twentyfive men and women in total half of them federal agents half uniformed cops baker motioned to them and they congregated around lukass truck he distributed the printouts lukas said to parker want to brief them sure she called if you could listen to agent jefferson here it took a second before parker recognized the reference to his stage name he decided he wouldve been a failure at undercover work he said the man in the picture youve got there was the perp responsible for the metro and mason theater shootings we think he was working out of a safe house somewhere here in gravesend now hes dead but his accomplicethe shooteris still at large so we need to find the safe house and find it fast you have a name one of the district cops called the unsubthe dead oneis a john doe parker said holding up the picture the shooters got a nickname the digger thats all his descriptions on the bottom of the handout parker continued you can narrow down the canvassing area some the safe house is probably near a demolition or construction site and wont be far from the cemetery he also recently bought some paper like this parker held up the clear sleeves holding the extortion note and the envelope now the paper was sunbleached so its possible that he bought it in a store that displays their office supplies in or near a southfacing window so hit every convenience store drugstore grocery store and newsstand that sells paper oh and look for the type of pen he used too it was an awi black ballpoint probably cost thirtynine or fortynine cents that was all he could think of with a nod he handed off to lukas she stepped in front of the agents looked over them silent until she had everyones attention now listen up like agent jefferson said the unsubs dead but the shooter sure as hell isnt we dont know if hes in gravesend and we dont know if hes living in the safe house but i want everybody here to assume hes ten feet behind you and has a clear path to target hes got no problem lighting up law enforcement personnel so as you go through the neighborhood i want everyone to be looking for ambush positions i want weapon hands free i want jackets and coats unbuttoned i want holster thongs unsnapped she paused for a moment she had their complete attention this thin woman with silverblond hair at eight oclockyep thats right just over two hoursour perp is going to find someplace thats filled with people and hes going to empty his weapon at them again now i do not want to work that crime scene and have to look into the eyes of someone whos just lost a parent or a child i do not want to have to tell them im sorry but we couldnt find this beast before he killed again that is not going to happen im not going to let it and youre not parker found himself drawn into her words delivered in a firm even voice he thought about the band of brothers speech from shakespeares henry v which had been robbys introduction to theater the boy had memorized the speech the day after they returned from kennedy center all right lukas said any questions anything more on his armament hes been armed with a fullauto uzi loaded with long clips and a suppressor we have no further information how greenlighted are we one agent asked to light up the shooter lukas replied totally greenlighted anything else no one raised a hand okay were on emergency frequency i dont want any chatter dont report in that you havent found anything i dont care about that you see the suspect call for backup clear your background and engage now go find me that safe house parker himself felt oddly moved by these words it had been years since hed fired a weapon but he suddenly wanted a piece of the digger himself lukas directed teams of agents and officers to those parts of gravesend she wanted them to canvas parker was impressed she had a remarkable sense of the geography of this neighborhood some people he reflected are just naturalborn cops half of the agents started off on foot the others climbed into their cars and sped away leaving cage lukas and parker standing on the curb cage made a call he spoke for a moment hung up tobes got an mcp theyre on their way hes analyzing the tape from the theater oh and that psychologist from georgetowns on his way over here too most of the streetlights were outsome shattered from bullets it looked like pale green illumination lit the street from the fluorescent lights of the few stores that were open two agents were canvassing across the street cage looked around and saw two young men rubbing their hands over an oil drum in which a fire burned cage said ill talk to them he walked into the vacant lot it seemed that they wanted to leave but figured that would look more suspicious their eyes locked onto the fire as he approached and they fell silent lukas nodded toward a pizza parlor half a block away ill take that she said to parker you want to wait here for tobe and the shrink sure lukas started up the street leaving parker alone the temperature was continuing to fall there was now a sharp edge to the air that frostiness that he enjoyed so much in the autumnevoking memories of driving the children to school while juggling mugs of hot chocolate shopping for thanksgiving dinner picking pumpkins in loudon county but tonight he was aware only of the painful sting in his nostrils and on his ears and fingertips the sensation was like a razor slash he stuffed his hands in his pockets maybe because most of the agents had left the locals were returning to the streets two blocks away a nondescript man in a dark coat stepped out of a bar and walked slowly up the street then stepped into the darkened alcove of a checkcashing outletto pee parker guessed a tall woman or transvestite obviously a hooker walked out of the alley where shed been waiting for the crowd to disburse three young black men pushed out of an arcade and cracked open a bottle of colt malt liquor laughing hard as they disappeared down an alley parker turned away and happened to glance across the street he saw a thrift store it was closed and at first he didnt pay much attention to the place but then he noticed boxed sets of cheap stationery on shelves near the cash register could this be where the unsub had bought the paper and envelope for the note he stepped to the window of the store and gazed through the greasy glass cupping his hands against the glare of the one nearby streetlight that still worked and trying to see the packages of paper his hands shook in the chill beside him a rat nosed through a pile of trash parker kincaid thought this is crazy i have no business being here but still he lifted his sleeve and using the fleece cuff of his bomber jacket wiped the grimy glass in front of him as carefully as a diligent window cleaner so that hed have a better view of the merchandise inside maybe i seen him yeah maybe margaret lukas felt her heart pump faster she pushed the picture of the unsub closer and the counterman at the gravesend pizza placea chubby latino in tomatosaucestained whitescontinued to study it carefully take your time she said please she thought lets have a break here maybe i no so sure what it is we get tons n tons of people in here you know its very important she said shed remembered that the coroner had found steak in the belly of the unsub there was no steak on the menu here still it was the only twentyfourhour restaurant on the street near the metro stop and she figured that the unsub might have stopped in at some point in the past few weeks maybe hed even planned the extortion scheme herehe mightve sat under this sickly light at one of the chipped tables to draft the note as he looked around at the sad people eating greasy food and thought arrogantly how much smarter he was than they how much richer he was about to be she laughed to herself maybe hed been as smart and arrogant as she was as much as kincaid three of them all alike three hawks on a roof ones dead that leaves two on the roof you and me parker the clerks brown eyes lifted gazed into her blue ones they dropped bashfully to the paper again it seemed to be a personal defeat when he finally shook his head no i no think so sorry hey you want a slice the double cheese its fresh i just made it she shook her head anybody else working here no just me tonight i got the holiday you did too looks like he struggled for something to say you work many holidays some she said thanks lukas walked to the front door she paused looked outside the agents from the field office were canvassing across the street cage was talking to more gangstas in the vacant lot and kincaid was ogling some thrift store as if the crown jewels were in the window the other agents were dispersed where shed sent them but had she been right she wondered who knew you can read all the books on investigative techniques ever written but the bottom line is improvisation it was just like solving one of kincaids puzzles you had to look beyond the formulas and rules in front of her through the greasy windows she could see the dilapidated streets of gravesend fade into smoke and darkness it seemed so large and impenetrable she wanted tobe geller here she wanted the georgetown psychologist she wanted the list of online subscribers everything was taking too long and there were far too few leads her hand balled into a fist a nail pushing into her palm miss came the voice behind her miss agent here she turned the anger dissipating like steam the counterman was offering her a styrofoam cup of coffee in his other hand were two packets of sugar a little plastic container of halfandhalf and a stirrer the man had brushed his hair back with his hands and looked at her with a forlorn puppy gaze he said simply its getting colder out touched by his oblique admiration she smiled took the cup and poured in one sugar hope you get some celebrating in tonight he said you too she said and pushed out of the door walking down the cold streets of gravesend she sipped the bad coffee felt the hot steam waft around her mouth it was getting colder well keep going she thought get colder and colder today had been far too like autumn for her please snow like mad scanning the street the two agents from the field office were out of sight probably on an adjacent block cage too had vanished and kincaid was still gazing into the store near the staging area kincaid and what exactly was his story turning down a specialagentincharge slot lukas couldnt understand thatan sac was the next destination on her roadmap to the dep director spot and beyond still even though she didnt comprehend his not wanting the position she respected him more for saying no than if hed taken the job without wanting it what did explain the walls hed put up around his life she couldnt guess but she saw them clearly margaret lukas knew walls he reminded her of herselfor rather of her selves plural jackie and margaret both thinking of the changeling story shed read years ago she wondered what kind of books parker read to his children dr seuss of coursebecause of his nickname for them and probably pooh and all the disney spinoffs she pictured him in that cozy suburban housea house very similar to the one jackie had lived insitting in the living room a fire burning in the fireplace reading to them as they lay sprawled at his side lukass eyes happened to fall on a young latino couple walking down the sidewalk toward the staging area the wife bundled in a black scarf the husband in a thin jacket with a texaco logo on the chest he pushed a baby carriage inside of which lukas caught sight of a tiny infant packed in swaddling only its happy face visible she thought instinctively about what kind of flannel shed buy to sew the child a pair of pajamas then the couple moved on okay parker you like puzzles do you well heres one for you the riddle of the wife and the mother how can you be a wife without a husband how can you be a mother without a child its a tricky one but youre smart youre arrogant youre the third hawk you can figure it out parker lukas alone on the nearly deserted street leaned against a lamppost curled her arm around ither right arm ignoring her own orders to keep shooting hands free she gripped the metal hard she gripped it desperately struggled to keep from sobbing a wife without a husband a mother without a child give up parker im the answer to the riddle because im the wife of a man lying in the cold ground in alexandria cemetery because im the mother of a child lying beside him the riddle of the wife and mother heres another how can ice burn when an airplane drops from the sky into a field on a dark november morning two days before thanksgiving six days before your birthday a hot autumn day and explodes into a million fragile bits of metal and plastic and rubber and flesh thats how ice can burn and thats how i became a changeling oh puzzles are easy when you know the answer parker so simple so simple hold on she thought letting go of the lamppost taking a deep breath locking away the urge to cry enough of that one thing special agent lukas didnt tolerate was distraction she had two rules she repeated endlessly to new recruits in the field office the first was you can never have too many deets the second was focus and focus was what she now ordered herself to do another breath she looked around saw some motion in a vacant lot nearbya young kid wearing gang colors he stood over an oil drum waiting for some of his homeys he had a teenagers attitudewhich was a hell of a lot more dangerous than a thirtyyearolds she knew he gave her the eyeball then up the street a block away she thought she saw a man in the alcove of a checkcashing store she squinted was anybody there somebody hiding in the shadows no there was no more motion it mustve been her imagination well thiss the place to get spooked gravesend she tossed out the remains of the coffee and walked toward the teenager in the vacant lot to see if he knew anything about their mysterious unsub pulling the computer printout from her pocket she wove easily around rusting auto parts and piles of trashthe same way jackie lukas used to maneuver through the perfume counters at macys on her way to a dropdead sale in womens sportswear parker stepped away from the thrift store disappointed the stationery hed seen inside wasnt the same as the extortion note or the envelope he looked around the streets he was shivering hard he thought stephies outgrown her down jacket ill have to get her a new one and what about robby he had the fiberfill the red one but maybe parker would get the boy a leather bomber jacket he liked his fathers he shivered again and rocked on his feet where the hell was that van they needed the online service subscriber list and the demolition and construction permit information and the shrink he wondered too what the tape of the shooting would show parker looked around once more at the devastated streets no lukas no cage he watched a young couplethey looked hispanicwheeling a baby carriage toward him they were about thirty feet away he thought about the times just after robby was born when he and joan would take afterdinner strolls like that again his eye caught the man huddling in the checkcashing alcove absently wondered why he was still there he decided to be useful and fished in his pocket for a picture of the unsub hed do some canvassing himself but something odd was happening the man looked up and though parker couldnt see clearly through the dim light and smoke from the oil drums reached into his coat and pulled something out something black shiny parker froze it was the man whod followed them near the archives it was the digger parker reached into his pocket for the gun but the gun wasnt there he remembered the pistol pressing into his hip as he sat in cages car and hed adjusted it in his pocket it must have fallen out into the front seat the man glanced at the couple who were between him and parker and lifted what must have been the silenced uzi get down parker cried to the couple who stopped walking and stared at him uncertainly down the digger turned toward him and lifted the gun parker tried to leap into the shadows of an alley but he tripped over a pile of trash and fell heavily to the ground his breath was knocked out of him and he lay on his side gasping unable to move as the man walked steadily closer parker called to the couple once more but his voice came out as a breathy gasp where was cage parker couldnt see him or lukas or any of the other agents cage he called but his voice was still merely a whisper the digger approached the couple only ten feet from him they still didnt see him parker tried to climb to his feet waving desperately to the young man and woman to get down the digger moved forward his round face an emotionless mask one squeeze of the trigger and the couple and their baby would die instantly the killer aimed his gun get down parker rasped then a womans brash voice was shouting freeze federal agents drop the weapon or well shoot the attacker turned gave a choked cry as the couple spun around the husband pushed his wife to the ground and shielded the baby carriage with his body drop it drop it drop it lukas continued screaming now moving forward steadily hand extended in front of her drawing a perfect target on the mans large chest the digger dropped the gun and his hands shot into the air cage was running across the street his own weapon in his hand on your face lukas shouted on your face her voice was so primitive so raw that parker hardly recognized it the man dropped like a log cage was speaking into his phone summoning backup parker could see several other agents sprinting toward them he climbed unsteadily to his feet lukas was crouched on the ground her gun pressed into the killers ear no no no the man wailed no please she cuffed him using only her left hand the gun never wavering from its target what the hellre he choked shut up lukas snapped she pushed her weapon harder into the mans head steam rose from the mans groin hed emptied his bladder in fear parker held his side struggling to fill his lungs lukas breathing deeply herself backed away and holstered her weapon she stepped into the street eyes contracted and icy glancing at parker then at the suspect she walked to the shaken couple and spoke to them for a few moments wrote their names in her notebook and sent them on their way the father glanced uncertainly at parker then ushered his wife down a side street away from the staging area as cage frisked the attacker one of the other agents walked over to the mans weapon and picked it up not a gun its a video camera what cage asked parker frowned it was a camera it had broken in the fall to the concrete cage stood hes clean he flipped through the mans snakeskin wallet andrew sloan lives in rockville one of the other agents pulled out his radio and called in a warrants requestfederal maryland and virginia you cant sloan began to protest lukas took a step forward you keep your mouth shut until we tell you to answer she raged understand her anger was almost embarrassing when he didnt answer she crouched and whispered in sloans ear you got me i got you he responded in a numb voice cage pulled one of sloans business cards from his wallet showed it to lukas and parker it read northeast security consultants cage added hes a private eye no warrants said the agent whod called in the request lukas nodded at cage whos your client cage asked i dont have to answer yeah andy you do have to answer cage said my clients identity is confidential sloan recited two more agents arrived under control one asked yeah cage muttered get him up they pulled him roughly into a sitting position left him on the curb sloan glanced down at the front of his pants the wet spot didnt embarrass as much as infuriate him asshole he muttered to cage i got a law degree i know my rights i wanta take a video of you beating off in the bushes i can do it im on a public street here and lukas came up behind him bent down who is your client but parker leaned forward motioned cage out of the streetlight so he could get a better look wait i know him you do lukas asked yeah i saw him at the starbucks near me and i think someplace else too in the last couple of days cage kicked the man gently in the leg you been following my friend here huh you been doing that oh no parker thought finally understanding oh jesus he said his clients joan marel who my exwife there was no reaction in sloans face parker was in despair he closed his eyes shit shit shit until tonight every foot of tape the private eye mightve shot would have shown parker to be a diligent father going to pto meetings chauffeuring twenty miles a day to school and sports practices cooking shopping cleaning wiping tears and working on suzuki piano with the whos but tonight of all nights sloan was an eyewitness to parkers being right smack in the middle of one of the citys most dangerous police actions in harms way his children lied to and entrusted to a babysitter on a holiday mr kincaid as you know the judicial system will bend over backwards to place the children with their mother in this case however we are inclined to place them with you subject to the caveat that you can assure the court there will be no possibility that your career will in any way jeopardize the wellbeing of robby and stephanie that right cage asked sloan ominously yeah yeah yeah she hired me cage saw parkers expression and asked this a problem yeah its a problem its the end of the world cage surveyed the private eye the custody fight thing he asked parker yes in disgust lukas said get him outa here give him back his camera its broke sloan snapped youre going to pay for it oh you bet you are cage undid the cuffs sloan stood unsteadily i think i sprained my thumb it hurts like a bitch im sorry about that andy cage said and howre your wrists they hurt i gotta tell you im going to have to file a complaint she put em on way too tight ive cuffed people you dont have to make em that tight what the hell was he going to do parker was thinking he stared at the ground hands shoved into his pockets andy cage asked were you the one following us on ninth street tonight an hour ago maybe i was but i wasnt breaking any laws there either look it up officer in public i can do whatever i want cage walked up to lukas he whispered to her she grimaced looked at her watch then nodded reluctantly look mr sloan parker said is there anyway we could talk about this talk what talk i give my client the tape i tell her what i saw thats all there is to it i may sue you too andy heres your wallet cage walked up to him and handed it back then the tall agent lowered his head and whispered into sloans ear sloan started to speak but cage held up a finger sloan continued to listen two minutes later cage stopped talking he looked into sloans eyes sloan asked one question cage shook his head smiling the agent walked back to lukas and parker sloan right behind cage said now andy tell mr kincaid who your employer is parker still lost in his hopelessness listened with half an ear northeast security consultants the private eye said hands together in front of him as if he were still cuffed and whats your position with them im a security specialist cage asked and whos the client youre working for tonight mrs joan marel he said matteroffactly what did she hire you for cage asked like a crossexamining attorney to follow her husband i mean her exhusband and to get evidence against him for a child custody action and have you seen anything that mrs marel could use to her advantage in that action no i havent this got parkers attention the man continued in fact mr kincaid seems to me to be a sloans voice faltered cage prompted flawless flawless father sloan hesitated he said you know id probably say perfect id feel more comfortable saying that all right cage said you can say perfect a perfect father and ive never witnessed anything uhm he thought for a moment ive never witnessed him do anything that would jeopardize his children or their happiness and you didnt get any videotape of him doing anything dangerous nosir i didnt take any tape at all i didnt see anything that might be helpful to my client by way of evidence what are you going to go back and tell your client about tonight i mean sloan said im going to tell her the truth which is that mr kincaid went to visit a friend in the hospital what hospital cage asked sloan what hospital sloan asked parker fair oaks yeah sloan said thats where i went youll work on that cage asked your delivery was a little rough yeah ill work on it ill get it down real good okay now get the hell out of here sloan ejected the tape from what was left of the video camera he handed it to cage who tossed it into a burning oil drum the private eye disappeared looking back uneasily as if to see which of the agents was going to shoot him in the back how the helld you do that parker muttered cage offered a shrug parker didnt recognize he understood it to mean dont ask cage the miracle worker thanks parker said you dont know what wouldve happened if kincaid where the hell was your weapon lukass abrupt voice interrupted him he turned to her i thought i had it it must be in the car dont you remember procedure every time you deploy at a scene you check to make sure your weapon is with you and functioning you learned that the first week in the academy but lukass face was again contracted with cold fury in a gruff whisper what do you think were doing here parker began i keep telling you im not tactical i dont think in terms of weapons think in terms she spat out cynically look kincaid youve been living life on sesame street for the last few years you can go back to that world right now and god bless and thanks for the help but if youre staying on board youll carry your weapon and youll pull your share of the load you may be used to babysitting but were not now you going or staying cage was motionless not even the faintest shrug moved his shoulders im staying okay lukas looked neither satisfied with his acquiescence nor apologetic for her outburst she said now get that weapon and lets get back to work we dont have much time the large winnebago camper rocked along the streets of gravesend it was the mcp the mobile command post and it was plastered with bumper stickers north carolina akc dog show warning i brake for blue ribbons briards are our business he wondered whether the stickers were intentionalto fool perpsor if the bureau had bought the van secondhand from a real breeder the camper eased up to the curb and lukas motioned cage and parker inside one whiff of the air told him that it had belonged to dog owners still it was warm insidewith the cold and the scare from the private eye parker was shivering hard and he was glad to be out of the chill sitting at a computer console was tobe geller he was staring at a video monitor the image on the screen was broken into a thousand square pixels an abstract mosaic he tapped buttons spun the trackball on his computer typed in commands detective len hardy sat nearby and c p ardell in his size jeans was wedged into one of the booths against the wall the psychologist from georgetown university hadnt yet arrived the video from the mason theater shooting geller said not looking away from the screen anything helpful lukas asked nuthin much the young agent muttered not yet anyway heres what it looks like full screen real time he hit some buttons and the image shrank became discernible it was a dim view of the interior of the theater very jumbled and blurry people were running and diving for cover when the digger started shooting c p explained some tourist in the audience turned on his camcorder geller typed more and the image grew slightly clearer then he froze the tape there cage asked touching the screen thats him yep geller said he started the tape again running it in slow motion parker could see virtually nothing distinct the scene was dark to begin with and the camera had bobbed around when the videotaper had huddled for cover as the frames flipped past in slow motion faint light from the gun blossomed in the middle of the smudge that geller had identified as the digger hardy said its almost scarier not exactly seeing whats going on parker silently agreed with him lukas leaning forward stared intently at the screen geller continued now this ones about the clearest the frame froze the image zoomed in but as the pixel squares grew larger they lost all definition soon the scene was just a hodgepodge of light and dark squares ive been trying to enhance it to see his face im ninety percent sure hes white but thats about all we can say parker had seen something back out again he said slowly as geller pushed buttons the squares grew smaller began to coalesce stop parker ordered the image was of the digger from the chest up look at that at what lukas asked i dont see anything hardy said squinting parker tapped the screen in the center of what was probably the diggers chest were some bright pixels surrounded by slightly darker ones in a vshape which were in turn surrounded by very dark ones its just a reflection lukas muttered distracted and impatient she looked at her watch parker persisted but whats the light reflecting off of they stared for a moment then ha geller said his handsome face breaking into a grin think ive got it what tobe parker asked arent you a good catholic parker not me he was a lapsed presbyterian who found the theology of star wars more palatable than most religions i went to a jesuit school hardy said if that helps but geller wasnt interested in anyones spiritual history he pushed himself across the tiny space in his wheeled office chair lets try this he opened a drawer and took out a small digital camera handed it to parker he plugged it into a computer he then bent a paper clip into the shape of an x unhooked two buttons of his shirt and held the clip against his chest shoot me he said just push that button parker did and handed the camera back geller turned to the computer typed and a dark image of the young agent came up on the screen handsome fella said geller he hit more buttons keeping the bright silver of the paperclip in the center of the screen as he zoomed in the image disappeared into exactly the same arrangement of bright squares as in the picture of the digger only difference geller pointed out is that his has a yellowish tint so our boys wearing a gold crucifix add that to our description of the shooter send it out lukas ordered and tell them weve confirmed hes white cage radioed jerry baker with the information and told him to pass the word to the canvassers the diggers only identifying characteristicthat he wore a cross was he religious was it a goodluck charm or had he ripped it from the body of one of his victims as a trophy cages phone rang he listened hung up shrugged discouraged my contact at the faa theyve called all the fixedbase operators in the area about chopper rentals man fitting the description of the unsub contracted to charter a helicopter from a company in clinton maryland gave his name as gilbert jones jones c p asked sarcastically i mean shit thats original cage continued he paid cash the pilot was supposed to pick up some cargo in fairfax then thered be another hour leg of the flight but jones didnt tell him where was supposed to call instructions in to the pilot at tenthirty this morning but he never did the pilot checks out okay did jones give him an address or phone number cages shrug said he did but they were both fake the door opened and a man in an fbi windbreaker nodded to lukas hi steve she said agent lukas ive got dr evans here from georgetown the psychologist the man stepped inside evening he said im john evans he was shorter than his calm deep voice suggested his dark hair was shot with gray and he had a trim beard parker liked him immediately he wore a smile as easy as his old chinos and gray cardigan sweater and he carried a heavy battered backpack instead of a briefcase his eyes were very quick and he examined everyone in the camper carefully before he was halfway through the door appreciate your coming down lukas said to him this is agent cage and agent geller agent ardells over there detective hardy my names lukas she glanced at parker who nodded his okay to mention his real name and thiss parker kincaidhes a document expert used to work for the bureau she added hes here confidentially and wed appreciate your not mentioning his involvement i understand evans said i do a lot of anonymous work too i was going to put up a web site but i figured id get too many cranks he sat down i heard about the incident at the mason theater what exactlys going on cage ran through a summary of the shootings the death of the unsub the extortion note and the killer evans looked at the death mask picture of the unsub so youre trying to figure out where his partners going to hit next exactly lukas said all we need is fifteen minutes and we can get a tactical team on the premises to take him out but we need that fifteen minutes weve got to get a leg up here parker asked youve heard the name before the digger i have a pretty big criminal data archive when i heard about the case i did a search there was a man in california in the fifties murdered four migrants his nickname was the gravedigger he was killed in prison a few months after he went inside obispo mens colony wasnt part of a cult or anything like that now some members of an acting troupe called the diggers in san francisco in the sixties were regularly arrested for petty larcenybasically just shoplifting nothing serious then there was a motorcycle gang in scottsdale called the gravediggers they were involved in a number of felonious assaults but they disbanded in the midseventies and i dont have any record of any of the individual bikers lukas said to geller call scottsdale p d and see if theres anything on them the agent made the call evanss eyes carefully studied the equipment in the van pausing on the morgue photo of the unsub he looked up now the only reference to the digger singular is a man in england in the s john barnstall he was a noblemana viscount or something like that lived in devon he claimed he had a family but he seemed to live alone turned out barnstalld killed his wife and children and two or three local farmers hed dug a series of tunnels under his mansion and kept the bodies down there he embalmed them gross hardy muttered so the press called him the diggerbecause of the tunnels a london gang in the seventies took the name from him but they were strictly small change any chance lukas asked that either the unsub or the digger himself had heard about barnstall used him as a sort of role model i cant really tell at this point i need more information wed have to identify patterns in their behavior patterns parker reflected discovering consistent patterns in questioned documents was the only way to detect forgeries the angle of the slant in constructing letters penstroke starts and lifts the shape of the descenders on lower case y g and q the degree of tremble you could never judge a forgery in isolation he told evans one thing you should knowthis might not be the first time the digger and his accomplice have done this lukas said a freelance writer contacted us hes convinced the shootingsre part of a pattern of similar crimes where boston the new york suburbs and philadelphia always the samelarceny or extortion were the main crimes with tactical murders to support them evans asked he was after money right parker said well jewelry once then it doesnt sound like theres any connection with barnstall his diagnosis was probably paranoid schizophrenia not generalized antisocial behaviorlike your perpetrator here but id like to know more about the crimes in the other cities and find out some more about his mo today hardy said what were doing here is trying to find his safe house it could have a lot of information in it lukas shook her head disappointed i was hoping the name digger meant something i thought it might be the key evans said oh it still mightif we get more data the good news is that the name isnt more common if the accomplicethe dead mancame up with the name digger that tells us something about him if it was the diggers nickname for himself then that tells us something about him see namingdesignatingis very important in arriving at psych profiling he looked at parker for instance when you and i describe ourselves as consultants therere some psychological implications to that were saying that were willing to abdicate some control over the situation in exchange for a certain insulation from responsibility and risk thats one hundred percent right parker thought you know evans said id be happy to hang around for a while he laughed again nodded at the morgue picture ive never analyzed a corpse before itll be quite a challenge we could sure use the help lukas said id appreciate it evans opened his backpack and took out a very large metal thermos he opened the lid and poured black coffee into the lid cup im addicted he said then he smiled something a psychologist shouldnt admit i suppose anybody want some they all declined and evans put the thermos away the doctor pulled out his cell phone and called his wife to let her know hed be working late which reminded parker of the whos and he took out his own phone and called home hello mrs cavanaughs grandmotherly voice asked when she answered the phone its me parker said hows the fort theyre driving me into bankruptcy and all this star wars money i cant figure out what it is theyre keeping me confused on purpose her laugh included the children who would be nearby hows robby doing parker asked is he still upset her voice lowered he got sort of moody a few times but stephie and i pulled him out of it theyd love for you to be home by midnight im trying has joan called no mrs cavanaugh laughed and funny thing parker but if she were to call and i happened to see her name on the caller id i might be too busy to answer and she might think you were all at a movie or ruby tuesday for the salad bar how would you feel about that id feel really good about that mrs cavanaugh i thought you might that caller id is a great invention isnt it wish i had the patent he told her ill call later they hung up cage had overheard he asked your boy he okay parker sighed hes fine just having some bad memories from you know a few years ago evans lifted an eyebrow and parker said to him when i was working for the bureau a suspect broke into our house he noticed lukas was listening too your boy saw him evans asked parker said it was robbys window the perp tried to break into jesus c p muttered i hate bad stuff when it happens to kids i fucking hate that ptsd lukas asked posttraumatic stress disorder parker had been worried that the boy would suffer from the condition and had taken him to a specialist the doctor though had reassured him that because robby had been very young and hadnt actually been injured by the boatman he probably wasnt suffering from ptsd parker explained this and added but the incident happened just before christmas so this time of year he has more memories than otherwise i mean hes come through it fine but evans said but youdve given anything for it not to have happened exactly parker said softly looking at lukass troubled face and wondering why she was familiar with the disorder the therapist asked hes all right though tonight hes fine just got a little spooked earlier ive got kids of my own evans said he looked at lukas you have children no she said im not married evans said to her its as if you lose a part of your mind when you have children they steal it and you never get it back youre always worried that theyre upset theyre lost theyre sad sometimes im amazed that parents can function at all is that right she asked distracted once more evans returned to the note and there was a long moment of silence geller typed on his keyboard cage bent over a map lukas toyed with a strand of her blond hair the gesture would have been coy and appealing except for her stony eyes she was someplace else geller sat up slightly as his screen flashed report back from scottsdale he read the screen okay okay p d knew about the gang the gravediggers but they have no contact with anybody who was in it most ofem are retired family men now yet another dead end parker thought evans noticed another sheet of paper and pulled it toward him the major crimes bulletinabout gary moss and the firebombing of his house hes the witness right evans asked in that school construction scandal lukas nodded evans shook his head as he read the killers didnt care if they murdered his children too terrible he glanced at lukas hope theyre being well looked after the doctor said moss is in protective custody at headquarters and his familys out of state cage told him killing children the psychologist muttered and pushed the memo away then the case began to move parker remembered this from his law enforcement days hours and hourssometimes daysof waiting then all at once the leads begin to pay off a sheet of paper flowed out of the fax machine hardy read it its from building permits demolition and construction sites in gravesend geller called up a map of the area on his large monitor and highlighted the sites in red as hardy called them out there were a dozen of them lukas called jerry baker and gave him the locations he reported back that he was disbursing the teams there a few minutes later a voice crackled through the speaker in the command post it was bakers new years leader two to new years leader one go ahead lukas said one of my s s teams found a convenience store mockingbird and seventeenth tobe geller immediately highlighted the intersection on the map please parker was thinking please theyre selling paper and pens like the kind you were describing and the display faced the window some of the packs of paperre sunbleached yes parker whispered the team leaned forward gazing at the map on gellers screen jerry parker said not bothering with the code names that the tactical agents were so fond of one of the demolition sites we told you aboutits two blocks east of the store on mockingbird get the canvassers going in that direction roger new years leader two out then another call came in lukas took it listened tell him she handed the phone to tobe geller geller listened nodding great send it hereon mcp fours priority fax line you have the number good he hung up and said that was comtech again theyve got the isp list for gravesend the what cage asked subscribers to internet service providers geller answered the fax phone rang and another sheet fed out parker glanced at it discouraged there were more online subscribers in gravesend than hed anticipatedabout fifty of them call out the addresses geller said ill type them in hardy did geller was lightning fast on the keyboard and as quickly as the detective could recite the addresses a red dot appeared on the screen in two minutes they were all highlighted parker saw that his concern had been unfounded there were only four subscribers within a quartermile radius of the convenience store and the demolition site lukas called jerry baker and gave him the addresses concentrate on those four well meet you at the convenience store thatll be our new staging area roger out lets go lukas called to the driver of the mcp a young agent wait geller called go through the vacant lot there he tapped the screen on foot youll get there faster than in cars well drive over and meet you hardy pulled his jacket on but lukas shook her head sorry len what we talked about before i want you to stay in the mcp the young officer lifted his hands looked at cage and parker i want to do something len this could be a tactical situation we need negotiators and shooters hes not a shooter hardy said nodding at parker hes forensic hell be on the crime scene team so im just sitting here twiddling my thumbs is that it im sorry thats the way its got to be whatever pulled his jacket off and sat down thank you lukas said c p you stay here too keep an eye on the fort meaning parker guessed make sure hardy doesnt do anything stupid the big agent got the message and nodded lukas pushed open the door of the camper cage stepped outside parker pulled on his bomber jacket and followed the agent as he climbed outside lukas started to ask you have its in my pocket he answered shortly slapping the pistol to make sure and caught up with cage who was moving through the smoky vacant lot at a slow trot henry czisman took a tiny sip of his beer he was certainly no stranger to liquor but he wanted at this particular moment to be as sober as possible but a man in a bar in gravesend on new years eve had better be drinking or else incur the suspicion of everybody in the place the big man had nursed the budweiser for a half hour joe higgins was the name of the bar czisman noted according to my training as a journalist czisman thought with irritation this is wrong only plural nouns take just the s apostrophe to form the possessive the name of the place should be joe higginss another sip of beer the door opened and czisman saw several agents walk inside hed been expecting someone to come in here for the canvass and hed been very concerned that it might be lukas or cage or that consultant who would recognize him and wonder why he was dogging them but these men hed never seen before the wiry old man beside czisman continued so then i go the blocks cracked whatm i gonna do with a cracked block tell me what am i gonna do and he ain have no answer for that gee willikers the fuck he think i was gonna do not see it czisman glanced at the scrawny guy who was wearing torn gray pants and a dark tshirt december and he didnt have a coat did he live nearby upstairs the man was drinking whiskey that smelled like antifreeze no answer hm czisman asked eyes on the agents studying them no and i tell him ima fuck him up he dont gimme a new block you know hed bought the black guy a drink because it would look less suspicious to see a black guy and a white guy with their heads down over a beer and a slimy whiskey in a bar like joe higgins with or without the correct possessive case rather than just a white guy by himself and when you buy somebody a drink you have to let them talk to you the agents were showing a piece of paperprobably the picture of the diggers dead accompliceto a table of three local crones painted like harlem whores czisman looked past them to the winnebago parked across the street czisman had been staking out fbi headquarters on ninth street when hed seen the three agents hurry outside along with a dozen others well they wouldnt let him go for a ridealongso hed arranged for his own thank god thered been a motorcade of ten or so cars and hed just followed themthrough the red lights driving fast flashing his brights which is what youre supposed to do as a cop when youre in pursuit but dont have a dashboard flasher theyd parked in a cluster near the bar and after a briefing had fanned out to canvass for information czisman had parked up the street and had slipped into the bar his digital camera was in his pocket and hed taken a few shots of the agents and cops being briefed then there was nothing to do but sit back and wait he wondered how close they were to findingwhat had he called itthe diggers lair hey said the black guy only now noticing the agents who they cops were about to find out a moment later one of them came up to the bar evening were federal agents the id was properly flashed i wonder if either of youve seen this man around here czisman looked at the photo of the dead man hed seen in fbi headquarters he said no the black guy said he looks dead he dead the agent asked you havent seen anyone who might resemble him no sir czisman shook his head theres somebody else were looking for too white male thirties or forties wearing a dark coat ah the digger thought henry czisman odd to hear somebody hed come to know so well described from such a distant perspective he said that could be a lot of people around here yessir the only identifying characteristic we know about him is that he wears a gold crucifix and that hes probably armed he might have been talking about guns bragging about them the digger wouldnt ever do that czisman thought but he didnt correct them and said merely sorry sorry echoed the whiskey drinker if you see him could you please call this number the agent handed them both cards you bet you bet when the agents left czismans drinking buddy said whats that all about wonder somethings always going down round here drugs bet its drugs anyway so i gotta truck with a busted block wait i tell you bout my truck you started to ima tell you bout this truck suddenly czisman looked at the man beside him carefully and felt that same tug of curiosity thatd driven him to journalism years ago the desire to know people not to exploit them not to use them not to expose them but to understand and explain them who was this man where did he live what were his dreams what sort of courageous things had he done did he have a family what did he like to eat was he a closet musician or painter was it better was it more just for him to live out his paltry life or was it better for him to die now quickly before the painbefore the sorrowsucked him down like an undertow but then czisman caught a glimpse of the winnebago door opening and several men hurrying outside that womanagent lukasstepped out a moment later they were running czisman tossed money down on the bar and stood hey you don wanna hear bout my truck without a word the big man stepped quickly to the door pushed outside and started after the agents as they jogged through the decimated lots of gravesend by the time the team met up with jerry baker two of his agents had found the safe house it turned out to be a shabby duplex two doors from an old building that was being torn downone of the construction sites theyd found clay and brick dust were everywhere baker said showed a couple across the street the unsubs picture theyve seen him three or four times over the past few weeks always looked down walked fast never stopped or said anything to anybody two dozen agents and officers were deployed around the building which apartment was his lukas asked bottom one seems to be empty weve cleared the top floor you talk to the owner got a name parker asked management company says the tenant is gilbert jones an agent called hell the fake name again the agent continued and the social security number was issued to somebody who died five years ago the unsub signed up for the online servicename of gilbert jones againwith a credit card in that name but its one of those creditrisk cards you put money in a bank to cover it and its only good as long as theres money there bank records show that this is his address priors were all fake baker asked entry now cage looked at lukas be my guest baker conferred with tobe geller who was carefully monitoring the screen on his laptop several sensors were trained on the downstairs apartment cold as a fish tobe reported infrareds arent picking up anything and the only sounds im registering are air in the radiator and the refrigerator compressor ten to one its clean but you can screen body heat if you really want to and some bad guys can be very very quiet lukas added rememberthe digger packs his own silencers so he knows what hes doing baker nodded then pulled on his flak jacket and helmet and called five other tactical agents over to him dynamic entry well cut the lights and move in through the front door and the rear bedroom window simultaneously youre greenlighted to neutralize if theres any threat risk at all im primary through the door questions there were none and the agents moved quickly into position the only noise they made was the faint jingling of their equipment parker held back watching margaret lukas in profile staring intently at the front door she turned suddenly and caught him watching her returned a cool look hell with her parker thought he was angry at the dressingdown shed given him about the gun itd been completely unnecessary he thought then the lights went out in the duplex and there was a loud bang as the agents blew in the front door with gauge shoklok rounds parker watched the beams from the flashlights hooked to the ends of their machine guns illuminate the inside of the apartment he expected to hear shouting at any minute freeze get down federal agents but there was only silence a few minutes later jerry baker walked outside pulling his helmet off clean the lights went back on were just checking for antipersonnel devices give us a few minutes finally an agent called out the front door premises secure as parker ran forward he prayed a secular prayer please let us find somethingsome trace evidence a fingerprint a note describing the site of the next attack or at the very least something that gives us a hint where the unsub lived so we can search public records to find a devils teardrop above an i or a j let us finish this hard hard work and get back home to our families cage went in first followed by parker and lukas the two of them walked side by side in silence the apartment was cold the lights were glaring it was a depressing place painted with pale green enamel the floor was brown but much of the paint had flaked away the four rooms were mostly empty in the living room parker could see a computer on a stand a desk a musty armchair shedding its stuffing several tables but to his dismay he could see no notes scraps of paper or other documents we got clothes an agent called from the bedroom check the labels lukas ordered a moment later are none hell she spat out parker glanced at the living room window and wondered about the unsubs dietary habits cooling in the halfopen window were four or five large jugs of motts apple juice and a battered castiron skillet filled with apples and oranges cage pointed to them maybe the bastard was constipated hope it was real painful parker laughed lukas called tobe geller and asked him to come check out the computer and any files and email the unsub had saved on the hard drive geller arrived a few minutes later he sat down at the desk and ran his hand through his curly hair examining the unit carefully then he looked up around the room place stinks he said why cant we get some upscale perps for a change what is that parker smelled it too something sweet and chemical cheap paint on hot radiators he guessed the young agent gripped the computers electric cord and wound it around his left hand he explained it might have a format bomb insideif you dont log on just right it runs a program and wipes the hard drive all you can do then is unplug and try to override it later in the lab okay lets see he clicked on the power switch the unit buzzed softly geller was ready to yank the cord from the socket but then he smiled past the first hurdle he said dropping the cord but now we need the password lukas muttered wont it take forever to figure out no itll take geller pulled the housing off the computer reached inside and took out a small computer chip suddenly the screen reported loading windows geller said about that much time thats all you have to do to beat a password uhhuh geller opened his attaché case and pulled out a dark blue zip drive unit he plugged this into a port on the computer and installed it im going to download his hard drive onto these he tossed a halfdozen zip disks onto the desk lukass cell phone rang she answered listened then she said thanks she hung up not pleased pen registers from the phone line here all hes called is the connection for the online service nothing else coming in or going out damn the man had been smart parker reflected a puzzle master in his own right three hawks have been killing a farmers chickens found something in the bedroom a voice called an agent wearing latex gloves walked into the living room he was holding a yellow pad with writing and markings on it parkers heart sped up a few beats when he saw this he opened his attaché case and pulled on his own latex gloves he took the pad and set it on the table next to geller bent the desk lamp over it with his hand glass he studied the first page and noticed immediately that it had been written by the unsubhed stared at the extortion note so much that he knew the handwriting as well as his own and the whos the devils teardrop over a lowercase i parker scanned the sheet much of it was doodlings as a document examiner parker kincaid believed in the psychological connection between our minds and our hands personality revealed not by how we form letters that graphoanalysis nonsense that lukas seemed so fond of but through the substance of what we write and draw when were not really thinking about it how we take notes what little pictures we make in the margins when our minds are occupied elsewhere parker had seen thousands of renderings on the documents hed examinedknives guns hanged men stabbed women severed genitals demons bared teeth stick figures airplanes eyes but hed never seen what their unsub had drawn here mazes so he was a puzzle master parker tried one or two most of them were very complicated there were other notations on the page but he kept getting distracted by the mazes his eye drawn to them he felt the compulsion to solve them this was parkers nature he couldnt control it he sensed someone nearby it was margaret lukas she was staring at the pad theyre intricate she said parker looked up at her felt her leg brush against him the muscles in her thigh were very strong shed be a runner he guessed pictured her on sunday mornings in her workout spandex sweaty and flushed walking through the front door after her three miles he turned back to the maze mustve taken him a long time to make it she said nodding at the maze no parker said mazes are hard to solve but theyre the easiest puzzles to make you draw the solution path first and then once thats finished you just keep adding layer and layer of false routes puzzles are always easy when you know the answer she glanced at him once more then walked away helped a crime scene tech cut open the mattress searching for more evidence just like life right parkers eyes returned to the yellow pad he lifted the top sheet and on the next page he found a dense page of notes hundreds of words in the unsubs writing toward the bottom of the page he saw a column the first two entries were dupont circle metro top of the escalator am george mason theater box no pm my god he thought thiss got the real targets on it its not a decoy he looked up and called to cage over here just as lukas stepped into the doorway and shouted i smell gas gasoline wheres it coming from gas parker glanced at tobe who was frowning he realized that yes that was the smell theyd detected earlier oh jesus parker looked at the bottles of apple juice it was a trapin case the agents got into the safe house cage tobe everybody out parker leapt to his feet the bottles but geller glanced at them and said its okay look theres no detonator you can and then the stream of bullets exploded through the window tearing the table into shreds of blond wood shattering the bottles and spraying rosy gasoline over the walls and floor a thousand invisible bullets a million more bullets than parkerd ever seen or heard in all his weeks on the range at quantico glass wood splinters of metal shot through the living room parker huddled on the floor the precious yellow pad still on the desk he tried to grab it but a cluster of slugs pummeled the floor in front of him and he leapt back against the wall lukas and cage crawled out the front door and collapsed into the hallway weapons drawn looking for a target out the window shouting calls for backup cries for help tobe geller pushed back from the desk but the chair legs caught on the uneven floor and he tumbled backward the computer monitor imploded as a dozen slugs struck it parker went for the yellow pad again but dropped to his belly as a line of bullets snapped into the walls heading straight for him he dodged the volley and lay flat on the floor thinking as he had before tonight that he was nearly as afraid of being wounded as he was of dying he couldnt stand the thought of the whos seeing him hurt in the hospital and he unable to take care of them there was a pause in the fusillade and parker started for tobe geller then the digger somewhere outside on a rooftop maybe lowered his aim and fired toward the metal pan that the fruit rested in it too had been placed there for a purpose the bullets clanged off it and sparks shot into the gasoline with a huge roar the pungent liquid ignited parker was blown out the door into the hallway by the explosion he lay on his side beside cage and lukas no tobe parker cried trying to get back inside but a wave of flame filled the doorway and forced him back they crouched in the windowless corridor lukas on one phone cage on another maybe the roof we dont know call dcfd one agent down make that two hes still out there where the hell is he and the digger kept firing tobe parker shouted again somebody geller called help me parker caught a glimpse of the young man on the other side of the raging flames he lay curled on the floor the apartment was awash with fire but still the digger kept shooting pumping round after round from the terrible gun into the flaming living room soon geller was lost to sight it seemed that the table where the yellow pad rested was consumed in flames no no the clues to the last sites were burning to ash voices from somewhere where is he going on where silencer and flash suppressor cant find him no visual no visual fuck no hes still shooting weve got somebody down outside jesus tobe cage shouted and he too tried to run back into the apartment which was filled with swirling orange flames mixed with black black smoke but the agent was driven back by the astonishing heatand by yet another terrifying row of black bullet holes snapping into the wall near them more shooting and still more that window no try the other one cage cried get the fire trucks here i want em here now lukas called theyre on their way soon the sound of the transmissions was lost in the roar of the fire through the noise they could just make out poor tobe gellers voice help me please help me growing softer lukas made one last attempt to get inside but got only a few feet before a ceiling beam came down and nearly crushed her she gave a scream and fell back staggering choking on smoke parker helped her toward the front door as a tornado of flames poured into the corridor and moved relentlessly toward them tobe tobe she cried coughing fiercely hes dying weve gotta get out cage shouted now foot by foot they made their way toward the front door in a madness of panic and hypoxia from the burning air parker kept wishing he were deaf so he couldnt hear the cries from the apartment kept wishing he were blind so he couldnt see the loss and sorrow the digger had brought them all these good people people with families people with children like his but parker kincaid was neither deaf nor blind and he was very much here in the heart of this terrorthe small automatic pistol in his right hand and his left arm around margaret lukas as he helped her through the smokeshrouded corridor look kincaid youve been living life on sesame street for the last few years no location no visible flash jesus what is this jerry baker was shouting or someone was near the doorway cage stumbled or someone did a moment later parker and the agents were tumbling down the front stairs into the cold air despite their racking coughs and vision blurry with tears cage and lukas dropped into defensive positions like the rest of the agents out here they wiped their eyes and scanned building tops searching for targets parker kneeling behind a tree followed their lead crouching beside the command post van c p ardell held an m close to his thick cheek and len hardy brandished his small revolver the detectives head was moving back and forth fear and confusion in his face lukas caught jerry bakers eye and in a whisper she called where where the hell is he the tactical agent motioned toward an alley behind them and then returned to his walkietalkie cage was retching from the smoke hed swallowed two minutes passed without a shot baker was speaking into his motorola new years leader two subject was east of us seemed to be shooting downward at a slight angle okay where okay just be careful he said nothing for a long moment his eyes searching the buildings nearby then he cocked his head as somebody came back on the line baker listened he said theyre dead oh man hes gone he stood up holstered his weapon he walked over to cage who was wiping his mouth with a kleenex he got into the building behind us killed the couple who lived upstairs he disappeared down the alley hes gone nobody got a look at him parker glanced toward the mobile command post saw john evans in the window the doctor was looking at the grim spectacle with a curious expression on his face the way a child sometimes looks at a dead animal emotionless numb he may have been an expert in the theory of criminal violence but perhaps had never witnessed its practical application firsthand parker then looked back at the building which was now engulfed in flames nobody could survive the inferno oh tobe sirens cut through the night he could see flashing lights reflected along both ends of the street as the fire engines sped closer all the evidence gone too hell itd been in his hand the yellow pad with the locations of the next two targets on it why the hell hadnt he glanced at it ten seconds earlier why had he wasted precious seconds looking at the mazes again parker sensed that the document itself was the enemy and had intentionally distracted him to give the digger time to attack them hell if he hey somebody shouted hey over here need some help parker lukas and cage turned toward an agent in an fbi windbreaker he was running down a narrow alley beside the burning duplex theres somebody here the agent called a figure lay on the ground on his side surrounded by an aura of blue smoke parker assumed the man was dead but suddenly he lifted his head and cried put it out in a gruff whisper damnit put it out parker wiped smoke tears from his eyes the man lying on the ground was tobe geller put it out he called again and his voice dissolved into a hacking cough tobe lukas ran toward him parker beside her the young agent must have jumped through the flames and out the window hed been in the diggers line of fire out here in the alley but maybe the killer hadnt seen him or hadnt bothered to shoot a man who was obviously badly wounded a medic sprinted up to him and asked where you hurt you hit anywhere but all geller would offer was his crazed shout put it out put out the fire you bet they will son the trucks are here theyll have it out in no time the medic crouched down but weve got to get no goddamnit geller pushed the medic aside with surprising strength and looked directly at parker the pad of paper put the fire out he was gesturing toward a small fire near his leg thats what the young agent had been shouting about not the building parker glanced at it he saw one of the unsubs elaborate mazes go up in flames it was the yellow pad in a splitsecond decision tobe geller had forgone his computer disks and grabbed the unsubs notes but it was now on fire the page with the notes on it was curling into black ash parker tore his jacket off and carefully laid it over the pad to extinguish the flames look out somebody called parker looked up just as a huge piece of burning siding crashed to the ground three feet from him a cloud of orange sparks swarmed parker ignored them and carefully lifted his jacket off the pad surveying the damage flames began spurting through the wall behind them the whole building seemed to sink and shift the medic said we gotta get out of here he waved to his partner who ran up with a gurney they eased geller onto the stretcher and hurried off with him dodging falling debris we gotta pull back a man in a black firemans coat shouted were going to lose the wall its gonna come down on top of you in a minute parker answered he glanced at lukas get out of here you cant stay here parker the ash is too fragile i cant move it lifting the pad would crumble the ash into powder and theyd lose any chance to reconstruct the sheets he thought of the attaché case inside the apartment now destroyed and the bottle of parylene in it which he couldve used to harden the damaged paper and protect it but all he could do now was cover the ash carefully and hope to reassemble it in the lab a gutter fell from the roof and stabbed the ground end first inches away from him now mister the fireman shouted parker lukas called again come on she retreated a few yards but paused staring at him parker had an idea he ran to the duplex next door pulled off the storm window and broke the glass with a kick he picked up four large pieces he returned to the pad which lay like a wounded soldier on the ground and dropped to his knees he carefully sandwiched the two sheets of scorched paperthe only ones with writing on thembetween pieces of glass this was how document examiners in the bureau used to protect the samples sent to them for analysis before the invention of thin plastic sheets chunks of burning wood fell around him he felt a stream of water as the firemen trained a hose on the flames above him stop it he shouted to them waving his arm worried that the water would further damage the precious find nobody paid him any attention parker lukas shouted now the walls about to come down more twobyfours crashed to the ground but still he remained on his knees carefully tucking bits of ash into the sandwich of glass then as timbers and bricks and fiery siding fell around him parker slowly rose and holding the glass sheets in front of him he walked away from the flames perfectly upright and taking gentle steps like a servant carrying a tray of wine at an elegant cocktail party another picture snap henry czisman stood in an alleyway across the street from the burning building sparks were flying leisurely into the sky like fireworks seen from miles away how important this was recording the event tragedy is so quick so fleeting but sorrow isnt sorrow is forever snap he took another picture with his digital camera a policeman lying on the ground maybe dead maybe wounded maybe playing deadwhen the digger comes to town people do whatever they must to stay alive they tuck their courage away and huddle until long after its safe to get up henry czisman had seen this all before picture the wall of the duplex falling in a fiery explosion of beautiful embers picture a trooper with three fingers of blood cascading down the left side of her face picture the illumination from the flames reflected in the chrome of the fire trucks snap snap snap he couldnt take enough shots he was driven to record every detail of the sorrow he glanced up the street and saw several agents talking to passersby why bother he thought the diggers come and the diggers gone he knew he too should go he definitely couldnt be seen here so he started to slip his camera into the pocket of his jacket but then he glanced back at the burning building and saw something yes yes i want that i need that he lifted the camera pointed it and pushed the button picture the man who called himself jefferson though that was not his name the man who was now so intertwined in this case was resting something on the hood of a car bending forward to read it a book a magazine no it glistened like a sheet of glass all you could really see in the picture was the rigid attention of the man as he wrapped his leather jacket around the glass the way a father might bundle up his infant for a trip outside in the cold night air snap so protect the mayor and dont trash the feds anchorman slade phillips was in a coffee shop on dupont circle there were still several dozen emergency vehicles parked nearby lights flashing through the gray evening yellow police tape was everywhere phillips had shown his press pass and gotten through the line hed been terribly shaken by what hed seen at the foot of the escalator the sludge of blood still drying bits of bone and hair he excuse me a womans voice asked youre slade phillips wplt anchorpeople are forever doomed to be known by both names nobody ever says mister he looked up from his coffee at the flirty young blonde she wanted an autograph he gave her one youre so like good she said thank you go away i want to be in tv someday too good for you go away she stood for a moment and when he didnt ask her to join him she walked away on high heels in a gait that reminded phillips of an antelopes sipping decaf all the carnage in the metrohe couldnt get it out of his mind jesus blood everywhere the chips in the tile and dents in the metal bits of flesh and bits of bone and shoes a halfdozen shoes had lain bloody at the base of the escalator for some reason they were the most horrifying sight of all this was the kind of story most reporters dream about in their ambitious hearts youre a reporter go report yet phillips found he had no desire to cover the crime the violence repulsed him the sick mind of the killer scared him and he thought wait im not a reporter he wished hed said this to that slick prick wendy jefferies im an entertainer im a soap opera star im a personality but he was too deep in jefferiess pocket for that kind of candor and so he was doing what he was told he wondered if mayor jerry kennedy knew about his arrangement with jefferies probably not kennedy was a standup son of a bitch better than all the previous mayors of the district rolled into one because if slade phillips wasnt a peter arnett or tom brokaw at least he knew people and he knew that kennedy did want a chance to fix as much of the city as he could before the electorate threw his ass out which would undoubtedly be in the next election and this project of his man it took some balls to tax the corporations in the city even more than they were already taxed bad blood there and kennedy was also coming down like a grand inquisitor on that school construction scandal rumors were that hed wanted to pay that whistleblower gary moss an additional bonus from district coffers for coming forward and risking his life to testify an expense congressman lanier had refused to approve of course there were rumors too that kennedy was going to crucify anyone involved in the corruptionincluding longtime friends so phillips could rationalize taking some of the heat off kennedys office it was for a higher good more decaf convinced that real coffee would affect his gorgeous baritone he lived on unleaded he looked out the window and saw the man he was waiting for a slight guy short he was a clerk at fbi headquarters and phillips had been currying him for a year he was one of the sources who wish to remain anonymous that you hear about all the timesources whose relationship to honesty was a bit dicey but what did it matter this was tv journalism and a different set of standards applied the clerk glanced at phillips as he stepped into the coffee shop looking around cautiously like a bumbling spy he pulled off his overcoat revealing a very badly fitting gray suit the man was basically a mailboy though hed told phillips that he was privy oh please to most of the bureaus primary decisionmaking activities egos such a bitch phillips thought hello timothy happy new year the man said sitting down and looking like a butterfly pinned to the wall yeah yeah phillips said so whats good tonight they have moussaka i love moussaka you dont have time to eat you have time to talk just a drink phillips flagged down a waitress and ordered more decaf for him and regular for timothy well he looked disappointed i meant a beer the anchorman leaned forward whispered the crazy guy the metro shooter whats going on with it they dont know too much its weird some peoplere talking about a terrorist cell some peoplere talking rightwing militia couple people think its just a straight extortion scheme but there isnt any consensus i need some focus phillips said focus what do you mean focus timothy glanced at a nearby table where a man was eating moussaka kennedys taking a hit on this thats not fair why the hell not hes a goon the anchorman wasnt here to debate the mayors competence whatever history decided about the tenure of gerald d kennedy slade phillips was being paid to suggest to the world that the mayor wasnt a goon so he continued hows the bureau handling it its a tough case said timothy who aspired to be an fbi agent but was forever destined to fall just short of every goal he set for himself in life theyre doing their best they got the perps safe house you hear i heard i also heard he pulled an end run and shot the shit out of you weve never been up against anything like this before we phillips nodded sympathetically look im trying to help you guys out i dont want to go with the story the stations got planned thats why i wanted to talk to you tonight timothys puppydog eyes flickered and he asked story theyve got planned right phillips said well what is it timothy asked the story the screwup at the mason theater what screwup they stopped him hardly anybody got killed no no no phillips said the point is they couldve capped the shooter but they let him get away the bureau didnt screw up timothy said defensively it was a highdensity tac op thosere a bitch to run highdensity tac op tactical operation phillips knew he also knew that timothy had probably learned the phrase not at fbi headquarters but from a tom clancy novel sure but add that to the other rumor what other rumor that kennedy wanted to pay the perps but the bureau set up some kind of trap only they fucked up and the shooter found out about it and now hes killing people just to kill them thats bullshit im not saying phillips began thats not fair timothy came close to whining i mean we got agents all over town ought to be home with their families its a holiday ive been taking faxes to people all night his voice faded as he realized the veil covering his true function at fbi headquarters had slipped phillips said quickly im not saying i feel that way im just saying thats the story theyve got planned this assholes killing people they need to point fingers well is there anything else to focus on something other than the bureau oh thats what you meant by focus did i say focus yeah earlier you did how about the district metro police they could be the screwup factor phillips wondered how much money wendy jefferies would pay for a story that the district police which ultimately reported to mayor kennedy was the quote screwup factor keep going that one doesnt excite me timothy thought for a moment then he smiled wait i have an idea is it a good idea phillips asked well i was at hq and i heard something odd timothy frowned his voice fading the anchorman said hey that moussaka does look good how bout we get some okay said timothy and yeah i think its a good idea iii three hawks a study of variations in the writing is especially important these qualities should all be carefully examined repeated words should be compared and natural variation or unnatural uniformity looked at osborn and osborn questioned document problems the capital of the free world the heart of the last superpower on earth and cage nearly shattered an axle once again as his governmentissue crown victoria crashed into another pothole goddamn city he muttered careful parker ordered nodding toward the glass sheets wrapped carefully and sitting on his lap like a newborn baby hed looked briefly at the yellow sheets but they were badly damaged and he couldnt see any reference to the third and fourth targets hed have to analyze them in the lab over crumbling pavement under streetlights burnt out months ago and never replaced past the empty poles that once held directional signs which had long ago been stolen or blown down more potholes i dont know why i live here cage shrugged accompanied by parker and dr john evans the agent was speeding back to headquarters through the dark streets of the district of columbia and it snows were fucked he added snow removal wasnt one of the districts strong suits either and a blizzard could hamper jerry bakers tactical efforts if they found the diggers hideyhole or the site of the next attack evans was on his cell phone apparently talking to his family his voice was singsong as if he were talking to a child but from the snatches of the conversation it seemed that his wife was on the other end of the line parker thought it was odd that a psychologist would talk to another adult this way but who was he to talk about relationships when joan was drunk or moody parker often found himself dealing with her the way he would a tenyearold cage juggled his own phone and called the hospital he asked about gellers condition when he hung up he said to parker lucky man smoke inhalation and a sprained toe from jumping out the window nothing worse than that theyre going to keep him in overnight but its just a precaution should get a commendation parker suggested oh he will dont you worry parker was coughing some himself the pungent taste of the smoke was sickening they continued on for another halfdozen blocks before cage gave parker a telling so so parker echoed then what does that mean wooee we having a good time yet the agent said and slapped the steering wheel parker ignored him and tucked a tiny scrap of burnt paper back under the glass protecting the unsubs notes cage sped around a slowmoving car after a few moments he asked hows your love life these days you seeing anybody not right now it had been nine months he reflected since hed been going with someone regularly he missed lynne she was ten years younger than he pretty athletic theyd had a lot of fun togetherjogging dinners day trips to middleburg he missed her vivacity her sense of humor the first time shed been over to his house shed glanced at a signature of franklin delano roosevelt and with perfect deadpan delivery said oh ive heard of him hes the guy started the franklin mint ive got the thimble collection but the maternal side of her hadnt blossomed even though she was nearly thirty when it came to his children she had fun going to the museums and the cineplex but parker could see that any more of a commitment to the whosand to himwould soon become a burden to her love like humor parker believed is all in the timing in the end they drifted apart with the agreement that in a few years when she was ready for children they might reconsider something more permanent both knowing of course that as lovers they were saying goodbye for good cage now said uhhuh so youre just sitting at home yeah parker said with my head in the sand like ozzie the ostrich who its a kids book dont you get the feeling theres stuff going on around you and youre missing it no cage i dont i get the feeling that my kidsre growing up and im not missing it thats important uhhuh i can see where that would be kind of important very important evans still on the phone was telling his wife he loved her parker tuned the words out they depressed him whatta you think about lukas cage finally asked what do i think shes good shell go places maybe to the top if she doesnt implode first explode no implode like a lightbulb thats good cage laughed but thats not what im asking whatta you think about her as a woman parker coughed shivered at the memory of the bullets and the flames you trying to set us up lukas and me of course not then its just i wish she had more friends id forgot that youre a fun guy you could hang out together some cage shes not married no boyfriends and i dont know if you noticed the wily agent said but shes goodlooking dont you think sure i think for a lady cop of course parker was attracted to herand by more than just her appearance he remembered a certain look in her eyes as she watched robby run up the stairs earlier in the day the way to a mans heart is through his children but what he told cage was she cant wait till this case is over and she doesnt have to see me again you think he asked but cynically this time you heard herabout my weapon hell she just didnt want to send you back to your kids with your ass in a sling no its more than that ive been stepping on her toes and she doesnt like it but ive got news for her im going to keep on stepping if i think im right hey there you go what do you mean thats just what shed say arent you two a pair cage take a break look margarets only agenda is collaring perps theres a ton of ego in her sure but its good ego shes the secondbest investigator i know parker ignored the glance that accompanied this sentence cage thought for a moment you know whats good about lukas she takes care of herself what does that mean ill tell you couple months ago her house got broken into wheres she live georgetown that happens there yeah parker said as much as he enjoyed the district hed never live there not with the children crime was terrible cage continued she comes home from the office and sees the doors been jimmied okay her dogs in the backyard and shes got a dog what kind i dont know how do i know big black dog lemme finish she makes sure her dogs okay then instead of calling it in she goes back to her van puts on body armor takes her mp and secures the house herself parker laughed the thought of any other thin attractive blonde stalking through a townhouse armed with a lasersighted machine gun would have seemed absurd but for some reason it was perfectly natural with lukas still dont get your point cage no point im only saying lukas doesnt need anybody to take care of her people being together parker you know men and women dont you think it works out best that way nobody taking care of anybody else thats a rule write it down parker supposed the agent was talking about joan cage had seen parker and joan together a number of times and sure parker had been drawn to his exwife because she was looking for someone to take care of her and parkernewly orphaned when they metwas desperate to nurture parker thought back several hours lukas addressing the troops in gravesend maybe that was what had stirred him so much listening to her not so much her expertise as her independence they drove in silence for a moment mp parker asked picturing the heavy black heckler koch machine gun yep said her biggest worry was if she had to light up the perp she might ruin some of her wall decorations she sews too makes these quilts you wouldnt believe you told me that before the perpshe bag him naw hed booked parker recalled her anger in gravesend he asked cage then what do you think it is why shes been on my case after a moment the agent answered maybe she envies you envies me what do you mean but he wouldnt answer thats not for me to say just hold that thought and when she gives you any static cut her some slack youre making no sense cage she envies me think of it like one of your puzzles either you figure it out or shell tell you the answer thats up to her but im not giving you any clues why would i want to know the answer to margaret lukas but cage only skidded around another canyon of a pothole and said nothing evans closed his phone poured himself another cup of coffee from the thermos it must have held a half gallon of coffee this time parker accepted the offered cup and drank several sips of the strong brew hows the family parker asked him i owe the kids big time the shrink smiled ruefully how many do you have two me too parker said how old in their teens theyre a handful he didnt give any details and didnt seem to want to say anything more he asked yours eight and nine ah youve got a few years of peace and quiet cage said grandkids are the best take it from me you play with em get em all dirty let em spill ice cream on themselves spoil em crazy and then you send em home to their parents you go have a beer and watch the game how can you beat that they drove for a few moments in silence and finally evans asked that incident you mentioned with your son what happened you ever hear about the boatman parker asked cage glanced at parker warily then back to the road evans said remember something from the papers but im not sure parker was surprised the killer had been featured in the news for months maybe the doctor was new to the area he was a serial killer in northern virginia southern maryland four years ago hed kidnap a woman rape and murder her and leave the body in a dinghy or rowboat the potomac a couple times the shenandoah burke lake in fairfax we had leads to this guy who lived in arlington but we couldnt make a case finally i was able to connect him to one of the murders through a handwriting sample swat arrested him he was convicted but he escaped on the way to federal detention well around that time i was in the middle of the custody battle with my ex the court had awarded me temporary custody the kids the housekeeper and i were living in a house in falls church then one night around midnight robby starts screaming i run into his room theres the boatman trying to break in evans nodded frowning in concentration his eyes were pale and they studied parker closely even now years later parkers heart trembled at the memory not only at the image of the square glazed face looking through the bedroom window but at his sons distilled terror the tears streaming from his huge eyes his shaking hands he didnt tell evans and cage about the five minutesthey seemed like hoursof absolute horror shepherding his children into the housekeepers room guarding the door while listening to the boatman stalk through the house finally with the fairfax county cops still not there he stepped into the hallway his service revolver in hand he realized that evans was looking at him even more closely he felt like a patient the doctor noted parkers expression and looked away he asked and you shot him yes i did the gun is too loud parker had thought manically as he fired knowing how the explosions were adding to robbys and stephanies terror the gun is too loud as cage pulled up to headquarters evans shoved the thermos back into his backpack and put a hand on parkers arm he gave the document examiner another close look know what were gonna do parker lifted an eyebrow were gonna catch this son of a bitch and both of us get back home to our families where we ought to be parker kincaid thought amen inside the document lab at headquarters the team was reassembled margaret lukas was on the phone parker glanced at her her cryptic look toward him in return brought to mind cages comments in the car maybe she envies you she looked back down at the notes she was scribbling he noticed her handwriting the palmer method enviable precision and economy no nonsense hardy and c p ardell stood nearby also speaking on cell phones parker set the glass sheets on the examination table lukas shut off her phone she looked at cage and the others the safe houses completely gone perts going through it but theres nothing left the computer and the disks were totaled cage asked how bout the building the digger shot from as clean as the texas book depository she said bitterly they got shell casings this time but he wore latex gloves parker said sighing right when he loaded the clips and leather when he was in the apartment not a bit of trace a phone rang and lukas answered hello oh okay she looked up its susan nance shes gotten more information back from boston white plains and philly about the other attacks czisman was telling us about ill put her on the speaker she hit a button go ahead susan ive tracked down the case detectives they tell me that just like here there were no solid forensics no prints no witnesses all of the casesre still open they got the pictures of the unsub we sent and nobody recognizes him but they all said something similar something odd which was parker asked he was carefully cleaning the glass that held the burnt yellow sheets basically that the violence was way out of proportion to the haul boston the jewelry store all he took was a single watch just one watch c p ardell asked was that all he had a chance to boost no looks like that was all he wanted it was a rolex but still worth only about two thousand in white plains he got away with thirty thousand philly the bus murder scheme the ransom was only for a hundred thousand and hes asking million from dc parker thought the unsub was going for bigger and bigger hauls lukas was apparently thinking the same she asked evans progressive offender progressive offenders were serial criminals who committed successively more serious crimes but evans was shaking his head no he seems to be but progressives are always lust driven sadosexual murderers mostly he rubbed the back of his bony hand against his beard the hairs were shortas if hed only started to grow it recentlyand his skin must have itched they become increasingly more violent because the crime doesnt satisfy their need but you rarely see progressive behavior in profit crimes parker sensed the puzzle here was much more complicated than it seemed or much simpler either way he felt the frustration of not being able to see any possible solutions the farmer has just one bullet in his gun parker finished cleaning the glass and turned his attention to the evidence he studied what was left of the two pages he saw to his dismay that much of the ash had disintegrated the fire damage was worse than hed thought still it would be possible to read some of the unsubs writings on the larger pieces of ash this is done by shining infrared light on the surface of the ash burnt ink or pencil marks reflect a different wavelength from that of the burnt paper and you usually can make out much of the writing parker carefully set the glass panes holding the yellow sheets side by side in the infrared foster freeman viewer he crouched and picked up a cheap hand glass he found on the table thinking angrily the goddamn digger just destroyed my fivehundreddollar antique leitz hardy glanced at the sheet of paper on the left mazes he drew mazes parker ignored that sheet though and examined the one with the reference to the mason theater he guessed that the unsub had also written down the last two targetsthe one at pm and the one at midnight but these pieces were badly jumbled and flaked well ive got a few things visible he muttered he squinted trained the hand glass on another part of the sheet christ he spat out shook his head what c p asked oh the targets the diggers already hit are perfectly legible the metro and the mason theater but the next two i cant make them out the midnight hit the last one thats easier to read than the third write this down he said to hardy the detective grabbed a pen and pad of yellow paper go ahead parker squinted it looks like place where i lets see place where i took you then a dash then the word black no the black then theres a hole in the sheet its gone completely hardy read back place where i took you dash the black thats it parker looked up where the hell is he talking about but no one had any idea cage looked at his watch what about the eight oclock hit thats what we oughta be concentrating on we have less than an hour parker scanned the third line of writing right below the mason theater reference he studied it for a full minute crouching he dictated two miles south the r thats an uppercase r but after that the ash is all jumbled i can see a lot of marks but theyre fragmented parker took the transcription and walked to a chalkboard mounted on the wall of the lab he copied the words for everyone to read two miles south the r place where i took youthe black whats it mean cage asked where the hell was he talking about parker didnt have a clue he turned away from the board and leaned over the glass sheets as if he were staring down a bully in a schoolyard but the fragment of paper won the contest easily two miles south of what he muttered r whats r he sighed the door to the document lab swung open and parker did a double take tobe tobe geller walked unsteadily into the room the young man had changed clothes and seemed to have showered but he smelled smoky and was coughing sporadically hey boy you got no business being here cage said lukas said are you crazy go home to my pathetic bachelor quarters having broken a new years eve date with undoubtedly my nowformer girlfriend tonight i dont think so he started to laugh then the sound dissolved into a cough he controlled it and breathed deeply how you doing buddy c p ardell asked hugging geller firmly in the huge agents face you could see the heartfelt manoamano concern that tactical agents have no trouble displaying they dont even make a degree for my burns geller explained its like i got new england tan im fine he coughed again well aside from the lungs unlike certain presidents i did inhale now where are we that yellow pad parker said ruefully hate to say it but we cant make out very much ouch the agent said yeah ouch lukas walked to the examination table standing next to parker he couldnt smell the scented soap any longer only acrid smoke hm she said after a moment what she pointed to the fragments of jumbled ash some of these little pieces might fit after the letter r right they might well whats that remind you of parker looked down a jigsaw puzzle he whispered right she said soyoure the puzzle master can you put them back together parker surveyed the hundreds of tiny fragments of ash it could take hours if not days unlike a real jigsaw puzzle the edges of the pieces of ash were damaged and didnt necessarily match the adjoining pieces but parker had a thought tobe yo the young agent coughed dusted a burnt eyebrow therere computer programs that solve anagram puzzles arent there anagrams anagrams whatre those again it was tattooed c p ardell who answereda man whose most intellectual activity youd guess would be comparing prices of discount beer assembling different words out of a set of letters like now own won geller said oh sure there are but then youd never use software to help you solve a puzzle would you parker no thatd be cheating he smiled to lukas whose stone face offered nothing more than a momentary glance and returned to the fragments of ash parker continued after the sequence two miles the r see all those bits of letters on the ash can you put them back together geller laughed its brilliant he said well scan a handwriting sample from the note thatll give us standards of construction for all of his letters then ill shoot the pieces of ash on the digital camera with an infrared filter drop out the tonal value of the burnt paper thatll leave us with fragments of letters and ill have the computer assemble them will it work hardy asked oh itll work geller assessed with confidence i just dont know how long itll take geller hooked up the digital camera and took several pictures of the ash and one of the extortion note he plugged the camera into a serial port on a computer and began to upload the images his fingers flew over the keys everybody remained silent which made the braying sound of parkers phone a moment later particularly startling he jumped in surprise and opened his cell phone he noted the caller id was his home number hello he answered his heart froze as mrs cavanaugh said in a taut voice parker in the background he heard robby sobbing what is it he asked trying not to panic everybodys okay she said quickly robbys fine he just got a little scared he thought he saw that man in the backyard the boatman oh no there was nobody there i turned the outdoor lights on mr johnsons dog got loose again and was jumping around in the bushes that was all but hes scared really scared put him on daddy daddy the boys voice was limp with fear nothing upset parker more than this sound hey robby parker said brightly what happened i looked outside he cried for a moment more parker closed his eyes his sons fear was like his own the boy continued and i thought i saw him the boatman it was i got scared remember its just the bushes were going to cut them down tomorrow no this was in the garage parker was angry with himself hed lazily left the garage door up and there was plenty of junk inside that could resemble an intruder parker said to his son remember what we do no answer robby remember ive got my shield good for you how bout the helmet parker glanced up and saw lukas staring at him raptly you have your helmet yes the boy answered and what about the lights well put them on how many lights parker asked every last one the boy recited oh it was so hard hearing his sons voice and knowing what he had to do now he looked around the lab at the faces of these people who had become his own band of brothers tonight and he thought you canwith luck and strengthpry yourself loose from wives or lovers or colleagues but not from your children never from your children they have your heart netted forever into the phone he said ill be right home dont worry really the boy asked as fast as i can drive he hung up everyone was looking at him motionless i have to go he said eyes on cage ill be back but i have to go now is there anything i can do hardy asked no thanks len parker answered jesus parker cage began looking up at the clock im sorry hes scared but margaret lukas lifted her hand and silenced the older agent she said theres no way the digger could know about you but ill send a couple of agents to stay outside your house he thought that she was saying this as a preface to talking him into staying but then she added quietly your little boy go home make him happy however long it takes parker held her eyes for a moment wondering had he found a clue to the maze of special agent lukas or was this only a false trail he started to thank her but he sensed suddenly that any show of gratitude any response at all would throw off this tenuous balance between them so he simply nodded and hurried out the door as he left the only sound in the lab was gellers raspy voice speaking to his computer come on come on come on the way a desperate handicapper pleads with a losing horse at the track pixel by pixel watching the images fall into place on tobe gellers screen still a jumble margaret lukas paced thinking about anagrams about ash thinking about parker kincaid when he got home how would he comfort his son would he hold him read to him watch tv with him would he be the sort of father who talked to him about problems or would he try to distract the boy take his mind off his fear bring him a present to bribe away his sorrow she had no idea all margaret lukas knew was that she wanted kincaid back here now standing close to her well part of her did the other part of her wanted him never to come back to stay hidden forever in his little suburban fortress she could no no come on focus lukas turned to compact dr evans watched him examining the extortion note carefully rubbing his hand over his stubbly beard his pale eyes were unsettling and she decided she wouldnt want him to be her therapist he poured more coffee from his thermos then he announced ive got some thoughts about the unsub go ahead she told him take em with a grain of salt the doctor cautioned to do this right id need a ton more data and two weeks to analyze it lukas said thats the way we work here kick around ideas were not holding you to anything i think from what weve seen the diggers just a machine wed call him profileproof its pointless to analyze him itd be like doing a profile of a gun but the perp the man in the morgue he was a different story you know organized offenders of course lukas said criminal psychology well he was a highly organized offender lukass eyes strayed to the extortion note as evans described the man whod written it the doctor continued he planned everything out perfectly times locations he knew human nature coldhe knew the mayor was going to pay for instance even though most authorities wouldnt have agreed to he had backup plans upon backup plans the firebomb at the safe house im thinking of and he found the perfect weaponthe digger a functioning human being who does nothing but kill he took on an impossible task and he probably wouldve succeeded if he hadnt been killed in that accident we had the bags rigged with tracers so no he probably wouldnt have gotten away lukas pointed out oh evans said ill bet he had some plan to counter that lukas realized that this was probably right the doctor continued now he asked for twenty million and he was willing to kill hundreds of people to get it he wasnt a progressive offender but he did raise the stakes because he knewwell he believedhe could get away he believed he was goodbut he was good in other words his arrogance was backed up by talent making the prick all the more dangerous c p grumbled exactly no false sense of ego to trip him up he was brilliant kincaid said he was highly educated lukas said wishing again that the document examiner were here to kick these ideas around with he tried to disguise it in the note but parker saw right through it evans nodded slowly at this information then asked what was he wearing when they brought him into the morgue c p found the list and read it to the doctor evans summarized so cheap clothes right not exactly the sort of thing youd expect from somebody with the intelligence to set this whole thing up and who was asking for twenty million dollars true cage said which means what lukas asked i see a class issue here evans explained i think he preferred to kill rich people society people he saw himself as better than them sort of a heroic common man hardy pointed out but in the first attack he had the digger gun down everybody not just the wealthy evans said but consider where dupont circle its yuppieville there hardly southeast and the mason theater tickets for the ballet mustve been selling for sixty bucks each and there was the third location too evans reminded the four seasons even though he didnt hit it he sent us there he was familiar with it and its very upscale lukas nodded it seemed obvious to her now and she was upset she hadnt realized it earlier she thought again about parkerhow he approached puzzles thinking broadly it was so hard sometimes though focus i think he was angry at the rich at societys elite why cage asked i dont know yet not on the facts we have but he did hate them oh he was full of hate and we should remember that when were trying to figure out what his next target will be lukas pulled the morgue shot of the unsub closer stared at him what had been in his mind what were his motives evans glanced at her and gave a short laugh what lukas asked he nodded at the extortion note i feel like its the note ive been analyzing like thats the perpetrator shed been thinking just the same exactly what parker kincaid had said too focus hold on folks geller said were getting something everyone leaned toward the screen on which they could see the words two miles south the r behind that phrase the computer was inserting combinations of the letters from the fragments of ash it would reject them if the pen stroke of one letter didnt match a stroke from the one to its left but the system had now added a letter i behind the r another one was forming behind that its that funny i with a dot parker was telling us about geller said the devils teardrop lukas whispered right geller said then after that a letter t is that a t damn tears i cant see anything yep lukas said definitely a t rit whats that next letter hardy asked leaning toward the screen i cant tell lukas muttered its too fuzzy a short letterwithout anywhatd parker call themascenders or descenders she leaned over the techs shoulders the smell of smoke on him was strong on the screen the letters were very faint but yes there definitely was an i and a t the next one though was just a blur damn geller muttered the computer says that thats the letter that fits the strokes match but i cant make it out anybody see better than me looks like a zigzag or something lukas said an a or x maybe cages head shot up zigzag could it be a z ritz hardy blurted maybe the ritzcarlton thats got to be it lukas said nodding at evans hes going after more rich people sure evans said and it makes sensegiven his tendency to fool ushed figure wed eliminate hotels because he used one before in the office chair geller rolled to a different computer in five seconds he had a yellow pages telephone directory on the screen two ritzes in the area one at tysons corner and one in pentagon city lukas said parker said hed stick to the district im voting in pentagon city she called jerry baker and told him about the latest target i want every tactical agent in the district and northern virginia mobilized and send skeleton crews to tysons she added youre not going to like it but no hoods and helmets she meant without nomex hoods and kevlar helmetsshorthand in the bureau for going plainclothes you sure baker asked uncertainly when officers dress for undercover surveillance they cant wear as much body armor as in an overt tactical operation its far riskier especially with a perp armed with an automatic weapon has to be jerry weve almost nailed this guy once and hes gonna be skittish as a deer he sees anything out of the ordinary hes going to bolt ill take responsibility okay margaret ill get on it she hung up she found len hardy staring at her his face suddenly seemed older tougher she wondered if he was going to confront her again about his being on a tactical team but he asked youre running the operation plainclothes right is there a problem with that detective does that mean youre not going to evacuate the hotel no im not she answered but therell be a thousand people there tonight lukas said its got to be business as usual the digger cant suspect a thing but if he gets past us i mean we arent even sure what he looks like i know len he shook his head you cant do it we dont have a choice the detective said you know what i do for a livingcompile statistics you want to know how many bystanders die in covert tactical operations theres probably an eighty percent chance of significant fatalities among innocents if you try to take him down in a situation like that what do you suggest she snapped back letting him see a flash of temper keep your people plainclothes but get all the guests out leave the employees inside if you have to but move everybody else out the best we could do is get fifty or sixty agents inside the hotel she pointed out the digger walks in the front door expecting to see five hundred guests and he finds that few hed take off and hed go shoot up someplace else for christ sake margaret hardy muttered at least get the kids out lukas fell silent eyes on the note please the detective persisted she looked into his eyes no if we tried to evacuate anybody word would spread and thered be panic so youre just going to hope for the best she glanced at the extortion note the end is night it seemed to be sneering at her no lukas said were going to stop him thats what were going to do a glance at evans doctor if you could stay here then a glance at hardy you handle communications hardy sighed angrily he said nothing else lets go lukas said to cage ive got to stop by my office for what cage asked nodding to her empty ankle holster oh another backup no for some party clothes weve got to blend hes got something good for us wendell jefferies the sleeves of his custommade shirt rolled high revealing healthclubtoned arms by he the aide meant slade phillips mayor kennedy knew the two men were in the city hall office the mayor had just given another embarrassing press conference attended by only a dozen reporters who even as he spoke took cell phone calls and checked pagers in hopes of getting better news from other sources who could blame them christ he didnt have anything to say all he could report on was the morale of some of the victims hed been to visit at hospitals hes going on the air at nine jefferies now told the mayor a special report with what he wont tell me jefferies said somehow he thinks that would be unethical kennedy stretched and leaned back in the coucha fake georgian settee his predecessor had bought the finish was chipping off the arms and the hassock on which his size feet rested was cheap a piece of folded cardboard was stuffed under one leg to keep it from rocking a glance at the brass clock dear your honor thank you very much for coming to speak with us today it has been an honor to hear you you are a very good person for us children and students and we would like to comment commem commemorate your visit with this gift which we hope you will like the minute hand clicked forward one stoke in an hour he thought how many more people would be dead the phone rang kennedy glanced at it lethargically and let jefferies answer hello a pause sure hold on he handed the receiver to kennedy saying this is interesting the mayor took the receiver yes mayor kennedy thats right this is len hardy detective hardy thats right is is anybody else listening no its my private line the detective hesitated then said ive been thinking about what we were talking about kennedy sat up took his feet off the couch go ahead son where are you ninth street fbi headquarters there was silence the mayor encouraged go on i couldnt just sit here anymore i had to do something i think shes making a mistake lukas hardy continued they found out where hes going to hit tonight the digger the shooter they did kennedys strong hand gripped the phone hard gestured to jefferies to hand him a pen and paper where the ritzcarlton which one they arent sure probably pentagon city but mayor shes not evacuating them shes what kennedy snapped lukas isnt evacuating the hotel shes wait kennedy said they know where hes going to hit and shes not telling anyone no shes going to use the guests for bait i mean thats the only way to say it anyway i thought about what you said i decided i had to call you you did the right thing officer i hope so i really hope that i cant talk any longer mayor i just had to tell you thank you jerry kennedy hung up and rose to his feet what is it jefferies asked we know where hes going to hit the ritz call reggie i want my car now and a police escort as he strode to the door jefferies asked how bout a news crew kennedy glanced at his aide the meaning of the look was unmistakable it meant of course we want a news crew theyre both standing awkwardly side by side four arms crossed in the diggers motel room theyre both watching tv funny the pictures on the tv look familiar to the digger the pictures are from the theater the place where he was supposed to spin around like he did in the connecticut forest and send bullets into a million leaves the theater where he wanted to spin where he was supposed to spin but he couldnt the theater where the click where the scary man with the big jaws and tall hat came to kill him no thats not right where the police came to kill him he watches the boy as the boy watches tv the boy says shit for no reason it seems just like pamela the digger calls his voice mail and hears the womans electronic voice say you have no new messages he hangs up the digger does not have much time he looks at his watch the boy looks at it too he is thin and frail the area around his right eye is slightly darker than his dark skin and the digger knows that the man he killed had hit the boy a lot he thinks hes happy he shot the man whatever happy is the digger wonders what the man who tells him things would think about the boy the man did tell him to kill anybody who got a look at his face and the boy has gotten a look at his face but it doesnt click it doesnt seem click seem right to kill him why it seems to me that every day i love you all the more he goes into the kitchenette and opens a can of soup he spoons some into a bowl looks at the boys skinny arms and spoons some more in noodles mostly noodles he heats it in the microwave for exactly sixty seconds which is what the instructions tell him to do to get the soup piping hot he sets the bowl in front of the boy hands him a spoon the boy takes one bite then another then he stops eating hes looking at the tv screen his small bulletshaped head lolls from one side to the other his eyes droop and the digger realizes hes tired this is what the diggers head and eyes do when hes tired he and the boy are a lot alike he decides the digger motions to the bed but the boy looks at him fearfully and doesnt give a response the digger motions to the couch and the boy gets up and goes to the couch he lies down still staring at the tv the digger gets a blanket and drapes it over the boy the digger looks at the tv more news he finds a channel that has commercials selling hamburgers and cars and beer things like that he says to the boy what s click whats your name the boy looks at him with halfclosed lids tye tye the digger repeats this several times to himself im going im going out butyoubeback what does he mean the digger shakes his headhis head with the tiny indentation above the temple you comin back the boy mutters again im coming back the boy closes his eyes he tries to think of something else to say to tye therere some words he feels he wants to say but he doesnt remember what they are it doesnt matter anyway because the boy is asleep the digger pulls the blanket up higher he goes to the closet unlocks it and takes out one of the boxes of ammunition he pulls on the plastic gloves and reloads two clips for the uzi and then he repacks the silencer he locks up the closet again the boy remains asleep the digger can hear his breathing the digger looks at the torn puppy bag he is about to crumple it up and throw it out but he remembers that tye looked at the bag and he seemed to like it he liked the puppies the digger smoothes it and puts it beside the boy so that if he wakes up while the digger is gone hell see the puppies and he wont be afraid the digger doesnt need the puppy bag anymore use a plain brown bag for the third time the man who tells him things told him so the digger has a brown paper bag the boy turns over but is still asleep the digger puts the uzi into the brown bag pulls his dark coat and gloves on and leaves the room downstairs he gets into his car a nice toyota corolla he loves those commercials ohhhhh everyday people he likes those better than oh what a feeling the digger knows how to drive hes a very good driver he used to drive with pamela shed drive fast when she drove and hed drive slow she got tickets and he never did he opens the glove compartment there are several pistols inside he takes one and puts it in his pocket after the theater warned the man who tells him things therell be more police looking for you youll have to be careful remember if anybody sees your face i remember upstairs in robbys room parker sat with his son the boy was sitting in bed parker in the bentwood rocker hed bought at antiques n things and tried unsuccessfully to refinish himself two dozen toys were on the floor a nintendo plugged into the old tv star wars posters on the walls luke skywalker and darth vader our mascot for the evening cage had said that but parker was trying not to think about cage or margaret lukas or the digger he was reading to his son from the hobbit robby was lost in the story even though hed heard his father read it to him a number of times they gravitated to this book when robby was frightenedbecause of the scene of slaying a fierce dragon that part of the book always gave the boy courage when hed walked in the front door of his house not long ago the boys face had lit up parker had taken his sons hand and theyd walked to the back porch hed patiently showed the boy once again that there were no intruders in the backyard or the garage they decided that crazy old mr johnson had let his dog out again without closing the fence stephie had hugged her father too and asked how his friend was the sick one hes fine parker had said looking for but finding not a bit of truth to hang the statement on oh the guilt of parents what a hot iron it is stephie had watched sympathetically as robby and parker had gone upstairs to read a story at another time she might have joined them but she instinctively knew now to leave them alone this was something about his children that parker had learned they bickered like all healthy youngsters tried to outshine each other engaged in typical sibling sabotage yet when something affected the core of one childlike the boatmanthe other knew instinctively what was needed the girl had vanished into the kitchen saying im making robby a surprise for dessert as he read he would glance occasionally at his sons face the boys eyes were closed and he looked completely content from the handbook sometimes your job isnt to reason with your children or to teach them or even to offer a sterling example of maturity you simply must be with them thats all it takes you want me to keep reading he whispered the boy didnt respond parker left the book on his lap and remained in the scabby rocking chair easing back and forth watching his son thomas jeffersons wife martha had died not long after their third daughter was born the girl herself died at age two jefferson who never remarried had struggled to raise his two other girls by himself as a politician and statesman he was often forced to be an absent father a situation he truly hated it was letters that kept him in touch with his children he wrote thousands of pages to the girls offering support advice complaints love parker knew jefferson as well as he knew his own father and could recall some letters from memory he thought of one of these now written when jefferson was vice president and in the midst of fierce political battles between the rival parties of the day your letter my dear maria of jan was received two days ago it was like the bright beams of the moon on the desolate heath environed here in scenes of constant torment malice and obloquy worn down in a state where no effort to render service can aver any thing i feel not that existence is a blessing but when something recalls my mind to my family looking at his son hearing his daughter bang pans downstairs he worried as he often did if he was raising his own children right how often hed lain asleep at night worrying about this after all hed separated two children from their mother that the courts and all of his and most of joans friends agreed that it was the only sane thing to do made little difference to him he hadnt become a single father by the quirk of death as jefferson had no parker had made that decision himself but was it truly for the children that hed done this or was it to escape from his own unhappiness this is what tormented him so often joan had seemed so sweet so charming before they were married but much of it hed realized was an act she was in fact cagey and calculating her moods whipped back and forthcheerful for a while shed plunge into days of rage and suspicion and paranoia when hed met joan he was learning how very different life becomes when youre still young and your parents die the demilitarized zone between you and mortality is gone you seek as a mate either someone to take care of you or as parker had done someone to take care of dont you think it works out best that way nobody taking care of anybody else thats a rule write it down so it wasnt surprising that he sought out a woman who though beautiful and charming had a moody helpless side to her naturally not long after the whos were born when their married life demanded responsibility and sometimes just plain hard work and sacrifice joan gave rein to her dissatisfactions and moods parker tried everything he could think of he went with her to therapy took over more than his share of work with the children tried joking her out of her funks planned parties took her on trips cooked breakfasts and dinners for the family but among the secrets joan had kept from him was a family history of alcoholism and he was surprised to find that shed been drinking much more than hed believed shed do twelvesteps from time to time and try other counseling approaches but she always lapsed she withdrew further and further from him and the children occupying her time with hobbies and whims taking gourmet cooking classes buying a sports car shopping compulsively working out like an olympian at a fancy health club where she met husbandtobe richard but she always pulled back she gave him and the children just enough and then there was the incident june four years ago parker returned home from work at the bureaus document lab and found joan gone a babysitter looking after the whos this wasnt unusual or troublesome in itself but when he went upstairs to play with the children he saw immediately that something was wrong stephie and robby then four and five were sitting in their shared bedroom assembling tinkertoys but stephanie was groggy her eyes were unfocused and her face slick with sweat parker noticed that shed thrown up on the way to the bathroom he put the girl into bed and took her temperature which was normal parker wasnt surprised that the babysitter hadnt noticed stephanies illness children are embarrassed when they vomit or mess their pants and often try to keep accidents secret but stephieand her brotherseemed much more evasive than parker would have expected the boys eyes kept going to their toy chest watch the eyes first his handbook commands listen to the words second parker walked toward the chest and robby started to cry begging him not to open the lid but of course he did and stood frozen looking down at the bottles of vodka joan had hidden there stephanie was drunk shed tried imitating mommy drinking absolutfrom her winnie the pooh mug mommy said not to say anything about her secret the boy told him crying she said youd be mad at us if you found out she said youd yell at us two days later he started divorce proceedings he hired a savvy lawyer and got child protective services involved before joan made the false abuse claim the attorney thought shed try the woman fought and she fought hardbut it was the way someone fights to keep a stamp collection or a sports car not something you love more than life itself and in the end after several agonizing months and tens of thousands of dollars the children were his hed thought that he could concentrate on putting his life back together and giving the children a normal life and he hadfor the past four years but now she was at it again trying to modify the custody order oh joan why are you doing this dont you ever think about them dont you understand that our egosparents egoshave to dissolve into benevolent vapor when it comes to our children if he truly thought it would be better for robby and stephie to split their time between parker and joan hed agree in a heartbeat it would destroy part of him but hed do it yet he believed this would be disastrous for them and so hed duke it out with his exwife in court relentlessly and at the same time shield the children from the animosity of the proceedings at times like this you fought on two fronts you battled the enemy and you battled your own overwhelming desire to be a child yourself and share your pain with your children but this you could never do daddy robby said suddenly you stopped reading i thought you were asleep he laughed my eyelids were just resting they got tired but im not parker glanced at the clock quarter to eight fifteen minutes until no dont think about that now he asked his son you have your shield right here me too he picked up the book and began to read once more margaret lukas looked over the families at the ritzcarlton hotel she and cage stood in the main entrance where hundreds of people were gathering for parties and dinner lukas was wearing a navyblue suit shed designed and made herself it was cut close to her body made from expensive worsted wool and it had a long pleated skirt shed cut a special dart in the jacket to make certain that the clock on her hip did not ruin the stylish lines of the outfit it would be perfect for the opera or a fancy restaurant but as it happened she had worn it only to weddings and funerals she called it her marriedburied suit fifteen minutes until eight nothing margaret came the gruff voice in her headset c p ardells he was downstairs at one entrance to the ritz the parking garage pretending to be a slightly drunk holiday reveler the big agent wore a considerably more mundane costume than lukassstained jeans and a black leather bikers jacket on his head was a redskins hat which he wore not because of the cold but because he had no hair to obscure the earphone wire of his radio there were an additional sixtyfive plainclothes agents in and around the hotel armed with more weaponry than youd find at an el paso gun show all looking for a man for whom they had virtually no description probably white probably average build probably wearing a gold crucifix in the lobby lukas and cage scanned the guests the bellhops the clerks nobody came close to matching their fragile description of the digger she realized they were standing with their arms crossed looking just like welldressed federal agents on stakeout say something amusing she whispered what cage asked were sticking out pretend were talking okay cage said smiling broadly so whatta you think of kincaid the question threw her kincaid what do you mean im making conversation a shrug whatta you think of him i dont know sure you do cage persisted hes perp smart not street smart this time cages shrug was one of concession thats good i like that he said nothing more for a moment whatre you getting at she asked nothing im not getting at anything were pretending to talk is all good she thought focus they studied a dozen other possible suspects she dismissed them for reasons she knew instinctively but couldnt explain street smart a moment later cage said hes a good man kincaid i know hes been very helpful cage laughed in the surprised way of histhe way that meant im on to you he repeated helpful more silence cage said he lost his parents just after college then there was that custody battle a few years ago wife was psycho thats hard she said and made a foray into the crowd she brushed up against a guest with a suspicious bulge under his arm she recognized a cell phone immediately and returned to cage found herself asking impulsively what happened with his folks car accident one of those crazy things his motherd just been diagnosed with cancer and it looked like they caught it in time but they got nailed by a truck on ninetyfive on the way to johns hopkins for chemo dad was a professor met him a couple times nice guy was he she muttered distracted again history what thats what kincaids dad taught history more silence lukas finally said i just need some phony conversation cage not matchmaking he responded am i doing that would i do that im only saying you dont meet a lot of people like kincaid uhhuh weve got to stay focused here cage im focused youre focused he doesnt know why youre pissed at him very simple he wasnt being part of the team i told him that we settled it end of story hes decent cage offered a standup guy and hes smarthis minds a weird thing you should see him with those puzzles of his yeah im sure hes great focus but she wasnt focusing she was thinking about kincaid so he had his own capital i incidentsdeaths and divorce a hard wife and a struggle to raise the children by himself that explained some of what shed seen before kincaid and thinking about him the document examiner she thought again about the postcard joeys postcard on the trip from which theyd never returned tom and joey had been visiting her inlaws in ohio it was just before thanksgiving her sixyearold son had mailed her a postcard from the airport before they boarded the doomed plane probably not a half hour before the had crashed into the icy field but the boy hadnt known you needed a stamp to mail postcards he must have slipped it into the mailbox before his father knew what he was doing it arrived a week after the funeral postage due shed paid for it and for the next three hours carefully peeled off the postal service sticker that had covered up part of her sons writing were having fun mommy granma and i made cookys i miss you i love you mommy a card from the ghost of her son it was in her purse right now the gaudy picture of a sunset in the midwest her wedding ring was stored in her jewelry box but this card she kept with her all the time and would until she died six months after the crash lukas had taken a copy of the card to a graphoanalyst and had her sons handwriting analyzed the woman had said whoever wrote this is creative and charming hell grow up to be a handsome man and brilliant with no patience for deception he also has a great capacity for love youre a very lucky woman to have a son like this for ten dollars more the graphoanalyst had taperecorded her comments lukas listened to the tape every few weeks shed sit by herself in her dark living room put a candle on have a drinkor twoand listen to what her son would have been like then parker kincaid shows up at fbi headquarters and announces with that knowall voice of his that graphoanalysis is nonsense people read tarot cards too and talk to their dear departed its bogus its not she now raged to herself she believed what the graphoanalyst had told her she had to otherwise shed go insane its as if you lose a part of your mind when you have children they steal it and you never get it back sometimes im amazed that parents can function at all dr evanss observation she hadnt let on at the time but she knew it was completely true and here was cage trying to set her up so she and kincaid were similar they were smart and yes arrogant they were both missing parts of their lives they both had their protective wallshis to keep the danger out hers to keep herself from retreating inside where the worst danger lay yet the same instincts that made her a good cop told herfor no reason that she could articulatethat there was no future between them she had returned to a normal life as much as she ever could she had her dog jean luc she had some friends she had her cds her runners club her sewing but margaret lukas was emotionally plateaued to use the bureau term for an agent no longer destined for advancement no she knew shed never see parker kincaid after tonight and that was perfectly all right the earphone crackled margaret jesus christ it was c p ardell stationed downstairs instantly she drew her weapon you have the subject she whispered fiercely into her lapel mike no the agent said but weve got a problem its a mess down here cage too was listening his hand strayed to his own weapon as he looked at lukas frowning c p continued its the mayor hes here with a dozen cops and fuck a camera crew too no lukas snapped drawing the attention of a cluster of partyers nearby they got lights and everything the shooter sees this hell take off its like a circus ill be right there your honor this is a federal operation and have to ask you to leave right now they were in the parking garage lukas noted immediately that there was a controlled entrance and exitto get in you needed to take a ticket that meant that license plates were recorded and that in turn meant that the digger would probably not come in this waythe unsub would have told him not to leave a record of his visit but mayor kennedy and his damn entourage were headed for the main entrance to the hotel where he and his uniformed bodyguards could be spotted in a minute by the killer and for gods sake a camera crew kennedy looked down at lukas he was a head taller he said you have to get the guests out of here evacuate them when the killer shows up let me talk to him lukas ignored him and said to c p any of them get into the hotel itself no we stopped em here kennedy continued evacuate get them out we cant do that she said the diggerll know somethings wrong well tell them to go their rooms at least think about it mayor she snapped most of them arent guests theyre just localshere for dinner and parties they dont have rooms lukas looked around the entrance to the hotel and the street outside it wasnt crowdedthe stores were all closed for the holiday she whispered fiercely he could be here at any minute im going to have to ask you to leave thought about adding sir she didnt then im going to have to go over your head whos your supervisor i am cage said no shrugs now just a cold glare you have no jurisdiction here the mayor snapped so whos your supervisor somebody you dont want to call believe me let me be the judge of that no lukas said firmly glancing at her watch the digger could be in the building right now i dont have time to argue with you i want you and your people out of here now kennedy looked at his aidewhat was his name jefferies she believed a reporter was nearby filming the entire exchange im not going to let the fbi risk those peoples lives im going to agent ardell she said put the mayor in custody you cant arrest him jefferies snapped yes she can cage said angrily now with the most minute of shrugs and she can arrest you too get him out of here lukas said lockup lukas considered no just stay with him and keep him out of our hair until the operations over im call my lawyer and a flash of anger burst inside her as bright as the one that made her explode at kincaid she looked up at him pointed a finger at his chest mayor this is my operation and youre interfering with it ill let you go on your way with agent ardell or so help me ill have you detained downtown its entirely up to you there was a pause lukas wasnt even looking at the mayor her eyes were scanning the parking lot the sidewalks the shadows no sign of anyone who might be the digger kennedy said all right he nodded toward the hotel but if theres any bloodshed tonight itll be on your hands goes with the territory she muttered recalling shed threatened kincaid with the same words go on c p the agent led the mayor back to his limo the two men got inside jefferies stared defiantly at lukas for a moment but she turned quickly and together she and cage walked back toward the hotel shit cage said no i think its okay i dont think the digger couldve seen anything thats not what i mean think about itif kennedy found out we were here that means weve got a leak where the hell do you think it is oh i know that she opened her cell phone and made a call detective lukas said struggling to control her anger you know that information about tac operations is secure you want to give me a reason why i shouldnt refer what you did to the us attorney she expected len hardy to deny or at least offer some slippery excuse about a mistake or getting tricked but he surprised her by saying briskly refer whatever you want but kennedy wanted a chance to negotiate with the shooter i gave it to him why because youre willing to let what a dozen people die two dozen if it meant stopping the shooter then yeah thats exactly what im willing to do kennedy said he could talk to him talk him into taking the money he you know he showed up with a goddamn tv crew hardys voice was no longer so certain he what a tv crew he was playing it for media if the diggerd seen the lights the police bodyguard hed just leave and find another target he said he wanted to talk to him hardy said i didnt think he was going to use it for pr well he did did the digger i dont think he couldve seen anything silence for a moment im sorry margaret he sighed i just wanted to do something i didnt want any more people to die im sorry lukas gripped her phone she knew she should fire him kick him off the team probably file a report with the district police commission too and yet she had an image of the young man returning to his house a house as silent as the one she returned to every night after tom and joey had dieda silence that hurts like a slap from a lover hed spend the holiday alone forced to suffer a false mourning for emmaa wife not alive and not dead he seemed to sense her weakening and said it wont happen again give me another chance yes no okay len well talk about it later thanks margaret weve got to get back on stakeout she clicked off the phone abruptly and if hardy said anything else she never heard it she returned to the lobby of the ritzcarlton lukas slipped her weapon off her hip once more held it at her side and began to circulate through the crowd cage tapped his watch it was a few minutes to eight they looked over the railing at the dark water and joked about the titanic they ate the shrimp and left the chicken livers they talked about wine and about interest rates and about upcoming elections and about congressional scandals and about sitcoms most of the men were in tuxedos or dinner jackets most of the women in dark dresses whose hems hovered an inch above the lacquered deck isnt this something look at the view will we be able to see the fireworks whered hank get to hes got my beer the hundreds of partyers had stationed themselves all over the lengthy yacht there were three decks and four bars and everyone at the new years eve bash was feeling great lawyers and doctors finding a few hours of peace from their clients and patients woes parents enjoying a respite from their children lovers thinking about finding an empty stateroom so whats he going to do i heard he was going to run but the polls suck why should he oh what about sally claire tom did they really get that place in warrenton well i dont know how he can afford it minutes clicked past and the time grew closer to eight oclock everyone was happy pleasant people enjoying a party enjoying the company of friends thankful for the view theyd have of the fireworks at midnight thankful for the chance to celebrate and be away from the pressures of the nations capital for the evening thankful for the creature comforts conferred upon them by the crew and caterers on board the luxury yacht the ritzy lady which floated regally in her dock on the potomac exactly two miles south of the fourteenth street bridge robby had moved from j r r tolkien to nintendo he didnt seem upset anymore and parker could stand it no longer he had to find out about the digger about the most recent attack had lukas and cage succeeded had they found him had they killed him he maneuvered through the toys on the floor and walked downstairs where stephie was in the kitchen with mrs cavanaugh the girl was squinting in concentration as she scrubbed one of parkers stainlesssteel pots shed made a caramel corn christmas tree sprinkled with green sugar it sat charmingly lopsided on a plate on the counter beautiful who he told her i tried to put silver balls on it but they fell off robbyll love it he started for the den but saw a hollowness in her face he put his arm around the girl your brothers okay you know i know im sorry tonights gone all kaflooey thats okay which meant of course that it wasnt quite okay well have fun tomorrow but honey you know my friend i may have to go back and see him oh i know stephie said you do i could tell sometimes youre alltheway here and sometimes youre partway here and tonight when you came back you were only partway here tomorrow ill be alltheway here its supposed to snow you want to go sledding yeah can i make the hot chocolate i was hoping you would he hugged his daughter then rose and walked into the den to call lukas he didnt want her to overhear his conversation but through the curtained window he saw motion on the sidewalk a man he thought he walked quickly to the window and looked out he couldnt see anyoneonly a car he didnt recognize he slipped his hand into his pocket and kneaded the cold metal of lukass gun oh not again thinking of the boatman remembering that terrible night the gun is too loud the doorbell rang ill get it he called abruptly glancing into the kitchen he saw stephie blink once again his brusque manner had startled one of his children still there was no time to comfort her hand in his pocket he looked through the window in the door and saw an fbi agent he recognized from earlier in the evening he relaxed leaned his head against the doorjamb breathed deeply to calm himself then opened the door with a trembling hand a second agent walked up the steps he remembered lukass comment about sending some men to watch the house agent kincaid he nodded looking over his shoulder to make sure stephie was out of earshot margaret lukas sent us to keep an eye on your family thanks just park out of sight if you would i dont want to upset the children sure thing sir he glanced at his watch he was relieved if the digger had struck again cage or lukas would have called maybe theyd actually caught the son of a bitch the shooter in the metro killing he asked the digger they got him the look that passed between the two men chilled parker oh no well sir inside the house the phone started to ring he saw mrs cavanaugh answer it the shooter he got on board a party yacht on the potomac killed eleven wounded more than twenty i thought you knew oh god no nausea churned inside him here i was reading childrens books while people were dying youve been living life on sesame street he asked agent lukas shes all right and agent cage yessir they werent anywhere near the boat they found some clue that said ritz so they thought the digger was going to hit one of the ritz hotels but that wasnt it the name of the boat was the ritzy lady bad luck huh the other agent said security guard got off a couple shots and that scared the shooter off so it wasnt as bad as it mightve been but they didnt hit him they dont think bad luck huh no not luck at all when you dont solve the puzzle its not because of luck three hawks he heard mrs cavanaughs voice mr kincaid he glanced into the house eleven dead phone for you parker walked into the kitchen he picked up the phone expecting to hear lukas or cage but it was a smoothsounding pleasant baritone he didnt recognize mr kincaid yes whos this my names slade phillips wplt news mr kincaid were doing a special report on the new years eve shootings we have an unnamed source reporting that youve been instrumental in the investigation and may be responsible for the mixup in sending the fbi to the ritzcarlton hotel when in fact the killer had targeted another location were going on the air with that story at nine we want to give you the chance to tell your side do you have anything to say parker inhaled sharply he believed his heart stopped beating momentarily this was it joan would find out everyone would find out mr kincaid i have no comment he hung up missing the cradle he watched the phone spiral downward and hit the floor with a resounding crack the digger returns to his comfy motel room thinking of the boatwhere he spun around like click like a whirligig among red and yellow leaves and fired his uzi and fired and fired and fired and watched the people fall and scream and run things like that it wasnt like the theater no no he got a lot of them this time which will make the man who tells him things happy the digger locks the motel door and the first thing he does is walk to the couch and look at tye the boy is still asleep the blanket has slipped off him and the digger replaces it the digger turns the tv on and sees pictures of the ritzy lady boat once again he sees that man he recognizesthe click the mayor mayor kennedy hes standing in front of the boat hes wearing a nice suit and a nice tie and it looks odd to see him wearing such a fancy suit with all the yellow bags of bodies behind him hes speaking into a microphone but the digger cant hear what hes saying because he doesnt have the tv volume on because he doesnt want to wake up tye he continues to watch for a while but no commercials come on and hes disappointed so he shuts off the tv thinking good night mayor he begins to pack his belongings taking his time motels are nice motels are fun they come and clean up the room every day even pamela didnt do that she was good with flowers and good with that stuff you did in bed that click click that stuff mind jumping bullets rattling around the cra crane cranium thinking for some reason about ruth oh god no ruth said dont do it but hed been told to do itto put the long piece of glass in her throatand so he did she shivered as she died he remembers that ruth shivering shivering like on christmas day twelve twentyfive one two two five when he made soup for pamela and then gave her her present he looks at tye hell take the boy out click west with him the man who tells him things told him hed call after they finished in washington dc and tell him where theyd go next where will that be the digger asked i dont know maybe out west wheres the west he asked california maybe oregon oh responded the digger who had no idea where those places were but sometimes late at night full of soup and smiling at the funny commercials he thinks about going out west and imagines what hell do out there now as he packs he decides hell definitely take the boy with him out west out click out west yes that would be good that would be nice that would be fun they could eat soup and chili and they could watch tv he could tell the boy about tv commercials pamela the diggers wife with a flower in her hand and a gold cross in between her breasts used to watch commercials with him but they never had a child like tye to watch commercials with me pamela asked have a baby with you are you mad crazy nuts fucked click fucked up why dont you go away why are you still here take your fucking present and get out go away do you click but i love you all the do you need me to spell it out for you ive been fucking william for a year is this news to you everybody in town knows except you if i were going to have a baby id have his baby but i love you all the more what are you doing oh je click sus put it down the memories are running like lemmings through the diggers cranium no dont she screamed staring at the knife in his hand dont but he did he put the knife into her chest just below the gold cross hed given her that morning christmas morning what a beautiful red rose blossoms on her blouse he put the knife in her chest once more and the rose got bigger and bleeding bleeding bleeding pamela ran for where where the closet yes the closet upstairs bleeding and screaming oh jesus jesus jesus pamela screaming lifting the gun pointing it at his head her hand blossoming into a beautiful yellow flower as he felt a thud on his temple i love you all the the digger woke up sometime later the first thing he saw was the kind face of the man who would tell him things click click he now calls his voice mail no messages where is he the man who tells him things but theres no time to think about it about being happy or sad whatever they are theres only time to get ready for the last attack the digger unlocks the closet he takes out a second machine pistol also an uzi he puts on the smelly latex gloves and starts to load the clips two guns this time and no shopping bags two guns and lots and lots of bullets the man who tells him things told him that this time he has to shoot more people than hes ever shot before because this will be the last minute of the last hour of the last night of the year a sweating parker kincaid ran into the fbi document division lab lukas walked up to him her face was paler than hed remembered it i got your message she said that reporterphillipshe got to one of the mailroom people somehow he found out your real name you promised he raged im sorry parker she responded im sorry it didnt come from here i dont know what happened dr evans and tobe geller were quiet they knew what was going on but perhaps seeing the look in parkers eyes they wanted no part of it cage was not in the room parker had called them on his cell phone as he spedwith a red dashboard flasher borrowed from the agents stationed in front of his housefrom fairfax to downtown his mind had been racing how could he control the disaster all hed wanted to do was help save some lives that was his only motive save some children and look what had happened now his own children would be taken away from him the end of the world he pictured the nightmare if joan had even partial custody shed soon lose interest in mothering if she couldnt get a babysitter shed drop them off alone at the mall shed lose her temper at them theyd have to fix their own meals wash their own clothes he was in despair why the hell had he even considered cages request for help tonight a small tv sat on a table nearby parker turned it on to the news it was just nine a commercial ended and smiling pictures of the wplt news team flipped onto the screen wheres cage he asked angrily i dont know lukas answered upstairs somewhere could they move out of the state he wondered manically but no joan would fight that and the virginia courts would still have jurisdiction on the screen that son of a bitch phillips looked up from a stack of papers and gazed at the camera with a grotesquely sincere expression good evening im slade phillips eleven people were killed and twentynine were wounded an hour ago in the third of the mass shootings that have terrorized washington tonight in this special report well have exclusive interviews with victims and with police on the scene in addition wplt has obtained exclusive videotape of the scene of the most recent killingson a yacht anchored in the potomac river parker hands clenched watched silently wplt has also learned that police and fbi agents were sent to a hotel where it was mistakenly believed that the killer would strike next leaving too few officers and agents to respond to the shooting on the boat its not known for certain who is responsible for this mixup but informed sources have have reported phillipss voice faded the anchor cocked his head probably listening to someone through the fleshcolored earphone stuck in his ear he glanced camera right and a shadow of a frown crossed his face there was a brief pause and his mouth registered defeat as he recited informed sources have reported that district of columbia mayor gerald d kennedy is being detained by federal authorities possibly in connection with this unsuccessful operation now standing by at the site of the most recent shooting is cheryl vandover cheryl could you tell us cage walked into the lab wearing an overcoat he clicked the tv set off parker closed his eyes and exhaled jesus sorry parker cage said things fall through the cracks sometimes but i made a deal with you and were keeping our end of the bargain oh one thingdont ever ask me how i did this one you definitely dont wanna know now we got one more chance lets nail this prick and this time no foolin the limo eased up to the curb in front of city hall like a yacht docking mayor jerry kennedy didnt like the simile but he couldnt help it hed just been at the potomac riverside comforting survivors and surveying the devastation that the digger had caused his tall thin wife claire at his side theyd been astonished at how the bullets had torn the decks and cabins and tables to pieces he could only imagine what the bullets had done to the bodies of the victims he leaned forward and clicked the tv off how could he claire whispered referring to slade phillipss suggestion that kennedy had in some mysterious way been responsible for the deaths on the boat wendell jefferies leaned forward resting his glossy head in his hands phillips i already paid him i kennedy waved him silent apparently the aide had forgotten about the huge bald federal agent in the front seat bribing media was undoubtedly a federal offense of some kind yeah jefferies had paid slade phillips his twentyfive thousand and no theyd never get it back whatever happens kennedy said to jefferies and claire solemnly i dont want to hire slade phillips as my press secretary his delivery was as always deadpan and it took them a minute before they realized it was a joke claire laughed jefferies still seemed shellshocked the irony was that kennedy would never have a press secretary again former politicians dont need one he wanted to scream he wanted to cry what do we do now claire asked well have a drink and then go to the africanamerican teachers association party who knows the digger might still come forward and want the money i still may have a chance to meet him facetoface claire shook her head after what happened on the boat you couldnt trust him hed kill you couldnt kill me any deader than the press has done tonight kennedy thought claire tacked down her wispy hair with a burst from a small container of perfumed spray kennedy loved the smell it comforted him the vibrant fiftynineyearold woman with keen eyes had been his main advisor since his first days of public office years ago to hell with nepotism it was only that she was white that kept her from being his primary assistant as mayor a characteristic that she too insisted would put him at a disadvantage in the percentblack district of columbia how bad is all this she asked as bad as it gets claire kennedy nodded and put her hand on her husbands substantial leg neither spoke for a moment is there any champagne in there he asked suddenly nodding toward the minibar champagne sure lets start celebrating my ignominious defeat early you wanted to teach she pointed out then with a wink she added professor kennedy and you did too professor kennedy well tell william and mary we want adjoining lecture halls she smiled at him and opened the minibar of the limo but jerry kennedy wasnt smiling teaching would be a failure a successful job at a dupont circle law firm would be a failure kennedy knew in his heart that his lifes purpose was to make this struggling oddly shaped chunk of swampy land a better place for the youngsters who happened to be born here and that his project was the only thing faintly within his grasp that would allow that to happen and now those hopes had been destroyed he glanced at his wife she was laughing she pointed to the bar gallo and budweiser what else in the district of columbia kennedy lifted up on the door handle and stepped out into the cooling night the guns are finally loaded the silencer hes been using has been repacked and the new one is mounted on the second gun the digger in his comfy room checks his pocket lets see he has one pistol with him and two more in the glove compartment of his car and lots and lots of ammunition the digger takes his suitcase out to the car the man who tells him things told him that the room was paid for when it was time to go all he had to do was leave he packs his cans of soup and dishes and glasses and takes them in a box to the everyday people toyota the digger returns to the room and looks at thin tye for a few minutes wonders again where click where out west is then wraps the blanket around him and carries the boy light as a puppy down to the car and puts him in the back seat the digger sits behind the wheel but doesnt start the car right away he turns around and looks at the boy some more tucks the blanket around his feet hes wearing tattered running shoes a memory of someone speaking who pamela william the man who tells him things sleep click click wait wait wait i want you to click click suddenly there is no pamela no ruth with the glass in her neck no man who tells him things there is only tye i want you to sleep well the digger says to the boys still form these are the words he wanted to say to him he isnt exactly sure what they mean but he says them anyway when i go to sleep at night i love you all the more he starts the car he signals and checks his blind spot then pulls out into traffic the last location place i showed youthe black parker kincaid stood in front of the blackboard in the document division lab hands on his hips staring at the puzzle in front of him place i showed youthe black the black what dr evans mused cage shrugged lukas was on the phone with the pert crime scene experts on board the ritzy lady she hung up and told the team that as theyd expected there were few solid leads theyd found bullet casings with a few prints on them they were being run through afis and identification was going to email lukas the results there was no other physical evidence witnesses had reported a white man of indeterminate age in a dark coat he carried a brown bag which presumably held the machine gun a bit of fiber had been recovered it was from the bag techs from pert had decided but was generic and provided no clues as to the source parker looked around wheres hardy cage told him about the incident at the ritz she fire him parker asked nodding toward lukas no thought she should have but she gave him helland then a second chance hes in the research library downstairs trying to make amends parker looked back at geller the young agent stared at the screen in front of him as the computers improvised anagram program vainly tried to assemble letters following the word black the ash behind this word however was much more badly damaged than that in the ritzy lady notation parker paced for a moment then stopped he stared up at the blackboard he felt the queasy sense of nearly but not quite figuring out a clue he sighed he found himself standing next to lukas she asked him your boy robby is he all right hes fine just a little scared she nodded a computer nearby announced youve got mail she walked to it and read the message shook her head the prints on the shell casingsre from one of the passengers on the boat picking up souvenirs he checks out she clicked the save button parker gazed at the screen thats making me obsolete what email he said he looked at lukas and added as a document examiner i mean oh peoplere writing more than ever because of it but but theres less handwriting nowadays she said continuing his thought right thatll be tough she said lose a lot of good evidence that way true but for me thats not whats sad sad she looked at him her eyes were no longer stony but she seemed wary once again of an inartful term echoing in such an esteemed forensic lab for me he told her handwritings a part of a human being like our sense of humor or imagination think about itits one of the only things about people that survives their death writing can last for hundreds of years thousands its about as close to immortality as we can get part of the person she asked but you said graphoanalysis was bogus no i mean that whatever somebody wrote is still a reflection of who they are it doesnt matter how the words are made or what they say even if theyre mistaken or nonsensical just the fact that someone thought of the words and their hands committed them to paper is what counts its almost a miracle to me she was staring at the floor her head down parker continued ive always thought of handwriting as a fingerprint of the heart and mind he laughed selfconsciously at this thinking that she might have another brusque reaction to a sentimental thought but something odd happened margaret lukas nodded and looked away from him quickly parker thought for a moment that another message had flashed on a nearby computer and caught her attention but there wasnt any with her head turned away from him he could see her reflection in the screen and it seemed that her eyes were glistening with tears this was something he never would have expected from lukas but yes she was wiping her face he was about to ask her if anything was wrong but she stepped abruptly up to the glass panes holding the burnt yellow sheets without giving him a chance to say anything about the tears lukas asked the mazes he drew you think theres anything there maybe a clue he didnt answer just continued to look at her she turned to him briefly and repeated the mazes after a moment he looked down studied the sheet of yellow paper only psychopaths tend to leave cryptograms as clues and even then they rarely do but parker decided it wasnt a bad idea to check they had so little else to go on he put the glass panes holding the sheet on the overhead projector lukas stood beside parker whatre we looking for cage asked do the lines make any letters lukas asked good parker said she was starting to get the hang of puzzles they examined the lines carefully but they found nothing maybe she then suggested its a map another good idea everyone gazed at the lines as head of the district field office lukas was an expert on the layout of the city but she couldnt think of any streets or neighborhoods the mazes corresponded to neither could anyone else geller looked back at his computer he shook his head the anagram thing isnt working there just isnt enough of the ash left to make any letters at all well have to figure it out the oldfashioned way parker paced staring at the blackboard the black some africanamerican organization evans suggested possibly parker said but remember the unsub was smart educated cage frowned what do you mean it was lukas who answered the word black is lowercase if it were the name of a group hed probably capitalize it exactly parker said id guess its descriptive theres a good chance it does refer to race but i doubt its a reference to a specific organization but dont forget cage said he also likes to fool us true parker admitted black parker walked to the examination table stared down at the extortion note put his hands on either side of it stared at the devils teardrop dot above the letter i stared at the stark ink what do you know he asked the document silently what arent you telling us what secrets are you keeping what ive got something the voice called from the doorway they all turned detective len hardy trotted into the lab a sheaf of papers under his arm hed been running and he paused caught his breath okay margaret you were right i dont shoot and i dont investigate but nobodys a better researcher than i am so i decided why dont i do that ive found out some things about the name the digger he dropped the papers on the desk and started through them he glanced at the team im sorry about before with the mayor i screwed up i just wanted to do something to keep people from getting hurt its all right len lukas said what do you have hardy asked dr evans when you were checking out the name what databases did you use well the standard ones the doctor answered he seemed defensive criminal hardy asked vicap nypd violent felons john jay those sure evans said eyes avoiding hardys that was fine hardy said but i got to thinking why not try noncriminal resources i finally found it the database at the religious history department at cambridge university hardy opened a notebook there were dozens of pages inside indexed and organized the young detective was right he sure knew how to research that group you mentioned in san francisco in the sixties he asked dr evans the one called the diggers but i checked them out the doctor said they were just an acting troupe no they werent hardy responded it was a radical underground political and social movement centered in haightashbury i checked out their philosophy and history and it turns out they took their name from a group in england in the seventeenth century and they were a lot more radical they advocated abolishing private ownership of land heres whats significant they were mostly economic and social but they allied themselves with another group which was political and more activesometimes militant they were called the true levelers levelers cage muttered thats a damn spooky name too hardy continued they objected to control of the people by an upperclass elite and by a central government but what does it mean for us lukas asked hardy said it might help us find the last target what would he want to hit to quote level our capitalistic society parker said before we can answer that we need to know why hes got it in for society religious nut geller said remember the crucifix could be evans said but most religious zealots wouldnt want money theyd want a half hour on cnn maybe he had a grudge parker said sure revenge lukas said this somebody hurt him parker said and he wants to get even evans nodded its making sense but who who hurt him hardy mused staring again at the ghostly extortion note he got fired cage suggested disgruntled worker no evans said a psychotic might kill for that but he wasnt psychotic he was too smart and controlled geller rasped big business big corporations fat cats wait hardy said if those were his targets wouldnt he be in new york not washington he was cage pointed out white plains but hardy shook his head no rememberwhite plains boston philly those were just trial runs for him this is his grand finale government parker said thats why hes here hardy nodded and the diggers objected to central government so maybe it isnt upperclass society at all he glanced at evans but the federal government lukas said thats it its got to be parker the government was responsible for something that hurt him looking over the team any thoughts on what ideology cage wondered aloud hes a communist or part of a rightwing militia cell evans shook his head no he wouldve delivered a manifesto by now its more personal than that lukas and hardy caught each others eyes it seemed to parker that they came up with an identical thought at the same time it was the detective who said the death of somebody he loved lukas nodded could be the psychologist offered okay cage said what could the scenariove been who died why execution hardy suggested cage shook his head hardly ever see federal capital crimes theyre mostly state coast guard rescue goes bad geller suggested farfetched lukas said hardy tried again government car or truck involved in a crash postal worker shooting spree park service accident diplomats military cage suggested most deaths involving the federal government are probably military related but lukas said there must be hundreds of fatalities every year in the armed forces was it an accident a training exercise combat desert storm cage suggested how old was the unsub parker asked lukas grabbed the medical examiners preliminary report she read looked up midforties black then parker understood he said the black wall lukas nodded the vietnam memorial someone he knew hardy said was killed in nam brother sister maybe his wife was a nurse cage said but that was thirty years ago could something like this resurface now oh sure evans said if your unsub didnt work through his anger in therapy its been festering and new years eves a time for resolutions and people taking bold actioneven destructive action therell be more suicides tonight than on any other night of the year oh jesus lukas said what i just realizedthe memorials on the mall therere going to be two hundred thousand people there for the fireworks weve got to close off that part of the park its already packed parker said theyve been camping out for hours but jesus cage said we need more manpower he called artie the buildings night entrance guard who made an announcement over the pa that all available agents in the building were needed in the lobby for an emergency assignment lukas called jerry baker and told him to get his tactical agents to the northwest portion of the mall she then paged the deputy director on call for the evening he called back immediately she spoke to him for a moment then hung up she looked at the team the dep directors on his way over im going to meet him downstairs to brief him then ill meet you at the memorial cage put his coat on geller stood and checked his weapon it looked alien in his hands which were undoubtedly much more accustomed to holding a computer mouse lukas said hold on tobe youre going home i can thats an order youve already done enough he protested a bit more but in the end lukas wonthough only after promising that shed call him if she needed any other tech assistance ill have my laptop with me he said as if he couldnt imagine ever being more than three feet from a computer lukas walked over to hardy thanks detective that was damn good police work he grinned sony i fucked up with the mayor he she waved her hand acknowledging the apology offered a slight smile everythings right as rain then she asked him you still want a piece of the action tonight oh you bet i do okay but keep to the rear tell me true you really know how to shoot i sure as hell do and im pretty good too if its not windy the young detective still grinning pulled on his trench coat parker feeling the weight of the gun in the pocket donned his jacket lukas glanced at him dubiously im going he said firmly in response to her glance she said you dont have to parker its okay youve done enough too he smiled at her just point and shoot right she hesitated then said just point and shoot here it comes here it comes my god look at them all a dozen two dozen agents running out of fbi headquarters some in bulletproof vests some not henry czisman took one last sip of jim beam and rested the brown bottle on the back seat of his rental car which reeked of tobacco and whiskey he crushed out his marlboro in the overflowing ashtray they ran toward their cars one by one they started up and sped away he didnt follow not yet he waited patient as an adder then czisman saw the tall grayhaired agent cage push through the front door looking behind him and yes there he was parker kincaid though czisman had not told the fbi agents everything he had in fact been a journalist for most of his life and a good one he could read people as perceptively as any street cop and while they were undoubtedly running their retinal scans and voice stress analysis on him in their interrogation room he was running his own tests less hightech and more intuitive his were nonetheless just as accurate as the bureaus and one of the things hed decided was that jefferson was not jefferson at all when the man had left the headquarters in a hurry and gotten into his own car several hours ago czisman had sent the mans license plate to a private eye in hartford connecticut and had gotten his real identity parker kincaid a simple search on the internet had revealed he was the former head of the bureaus document division if the bureau was using a former agent as a consultant he must be good which meant he was the one worth following not bureaucratic cage not unfeeling lukas pausing to zip up his leather jacket kincaid looked around to orient himself then climbed into an unmarked car with cage and another young agent or officer an earnest man in a trench coat they turned on a red light on the dash and sped quickly westtoward the mall czisman easily slipped into the motorcade of cars which were moving so frantically that no one noticed him around eighteenth street though near constitution avenue the crowds and traffic were so thick that the bureau vehicles were forced to stop and the agents climbed out ran to the mall czisman was close behind cage and kincaid stood together looking over the crowds kincaid pointed toward the west side of the vietnam monument and cage nodded toward the east they separated and moved off in their respective directions the man in the trench coat trotting away from them both toward constitution czisman was a heavy man and out of shape his breath snapped in and out of his congested lungs and his heart pounded like a piston but he managed to keep up with parker kincaid very easily pausing only momentarilyto take the pistol from the sweaty waistband of his slacks and slip it into his coat pocket the diggers coat is heavy heavy from the weight of the guns from the weight of the clips containing hundreds of rounds of click click of of caliber longrifle ammunition warning bullets can travel up to one mile do not allow children to shoot unsupervised but the digger would never do thatlet a child shoot unsupervised not tye never ever ever tye two nicely packed suppressors cotton and rubber cotton and rubber youre the youre the youre best the machine guns are in the inside pockets of his nice blue or black overcoat his christmas present from pamela one of the pistols from the glove compartment of his toyota is in the right outside pocket of his coat four more clips for the uzis are in the lefthand pocket no bags no puppies hes standing in shadows and none of the people nearby notice him he looks for police or agents and sees none tye is asleep in the back seat of the car a block away when the digger left him his sticklike arms were folded over his chest this is what worries him the mostif the police start shooting or if the digger has to shoot with the unsilenced pistols tye might wake up from the sound and then he wont sleep well hes also worried that the boy will be cold the temperature keeps falling but the digger remembers that he tripled the blanket over tye hell be all right hes sleeping children are always all right when theyre sleeping he is standing by himself watching some of the people who are about to die he calls one last time on his cell phone and the lady who sounds like ruth before the triangle of glass says you have no new messages so its okay to kill these people theyll fall to the ground like dark leaves chop chop chop chopchopchop hell click hell spin around like a top like a toy tye might like and hell spread the bullets throughout the crowd bullets from two guns then hell get into the car and check his messages and if the man who tells him things still hasnt called then he and tye will drive until they find click they find california somebody will tell him where it is it cant be that hard to find its somewhere out west he remembers that is the digger behind him in front beside parker kincaid separated from the other agents walked in a large frantic circle near the vietnam memorial lost in a sea of people looking for a man in a dark coat with a shopping bag wearing a crucifix far too many people thousands of them ten thousand cage was on the other side of the memorial len hardy was on constitution avenue baker and the other tactical officers were making a sweep from the other side of the mall parker was about to stop a group from walking down to the memorial itself send them to the safety of a cluster of officers but then he paused he realized suddenly that he hadnt been thinking clearly puzzles remember the puzzles three hawks have been killing a farmers chickens then he understood his mistake hed been looking in the wrong places he stepped aside out of the way of the crowd and examined the grounds near the vietnam memorial he thought of the unsubs mazes and realized that the man would have known that by the third attack the agents would have some description of the digger he wouldve told the killer not to approach the memorial along one of the sidewalks where he could be spotted more easily he should come in through the trees parker turned quickly and disappeared into a thicket of maple and cherry trees it was still crowded with people making their way to the mall but he didnt stop to tell them to leave the area his job now wasnt to be a caretaker a helping hand a father he was a hunterjust like that night years ago when he stalked through his house looking for the boatman searching for his prey searching for a faceless man in a dark coat a man wearing a cross henry czisman was thirty feet behind kincaid walking past the vietnam memorial when kincaid turned suddenly and moved into a grove of trees czisman followed looking around him at the sea of people what a target the digger would have here he could cut them down like grass czismans own pistol was in his hand pointed at the ground no one saw it the crowd was distracted wondering what was going onwith all the police and federal agents telling them to leave the mall kincaid walked steadily through the trees czisman now perhaps twenty feet behind him still there were people everywheredozens separated him from kincaidand the document examiner had no idea he was being followed they were about thirty feet from the solemn black wall when czisman saw a man in a dark overcoat step from behind a tree it was a cautious furtive movement and suggested that the man had been hiding and when he walked toward the memorial he moved too deliberately his head down focused on the ground for no reason as if he were trying not to be noticed he disappeared into the crowd not far from kincaid czisman trotted after him suddenly kincaid turned he glanced at czisman away then back again with a frown realizing that hed seen the face before but couldnt place it czisman turned away and ducked behind several large men carrying a cooler he believed he lost kincaid he returned to his search looking again for the man in the dark overcoat where yes yes there he was a man in his forties completely nondescript he was unbuttoning the coat looking around with dull eyes at the crowds around him and then czisman saw the flash a flash of gold on the mans neck he wears a gold cross the agents in the bar had told him that the digger wore a cross so here he is czisman thought the butcher the widow maker the devil hey a voice called czisman turned it was kincaid now he thought now czisman lifted his revolver aimed it toward his target no kincaid shouted seeing the gun no but czisman had no clear shot there were too many people here he danced to the side and pushed through a break in the crowd knocking several people aside he lost kincaid twenty feet away the diggeroblivious to both menlooked over the crowds like a hunter gazing at a huge flock of geese czisman shoved aside a cluster of college students what the fuck you doing man hey czisman ignored them where was kincaid where still no target too many people the diggers coat fell open in one of the inside pockets was a large black machine gun but nobody sees him czisman thought its as if hes invisible nobody knows families children just feet away from the killer the crowd seemed to swell with people the police were directing everyone toward constitution avenue but many of them were remainingso they wouldnt lose a good view of the fireworks czisman supposed the digger was squinting looking for a place to shoot from he stepped onto a slight rise in the grass kincaid emerged from the crowd czisman pulled back the hammer of his pistol the limo had parked beside the mall near the box seats reserved for diplomats and members of congress mayor kennedy and his wife climbed out accompanied by c p ardell you have to dog us like this claire asked the agent its orders ardell said you understand claire shrugged understand kennedy thought what he understood was that he was virtually under arrest and that he couldnt even avoid the humiliation of appearing in public in his own city without a babysitter any hope that his career would survive tonight was being tidily laid to rest by a few glances at the people who stood near the reviewing stand watching him the ambiguity of slade phillipss news report had been missed or ignored and it seemed that everyone here thought kennedy was practically the diggers partner cameras flashed capturing the stark images that would be identified in the papers tomorrow as mayor and mrs jerry kennedy he waved to some of the people on the viewing stand and with grave tact fielded cursory comments such as whereve you been hiding how you doing jerry no one here really wanted answers they were hard at work distancing themselves from the soontobeformer mayor the other question kennedy heard was heard you werent coming to the fireworks tonight jerry what brings you out here well what brought him out was claire the secretary of the africanamerican teachers association had called and only moderately embarrassed had said it would be better for him not to attend the party he was supposed to be keynote speaker at probably best for everybody well hed have been perfectly content to slink back home but sitting in his city hall office beside him on the couch claire had had a different idea lets get drunk and go watch the goddamn fireworks i dont know kennedy had said dubiously well i do youre not the sulking kind honey go out with your head high and hed thought for a few seconds and decided it was the smartest thing hed heard all night shed tracked down a bottle of moët and theyd drunk it on the way here as they wound through the crowd on the reviewing stand kennedy shook the hand of congressman lanier who obviously recognized agent ardell for exactly what he wasa jailor lanier probably could think of nothing to say that didnt sound like gloating so he merely tipped his head and offered a very unflirtatious claire youre beautiful tonight paul she said and nodding to the quiet mrs lanier added mindy jerry lanier asked whats the latest on the shootings im still waiting to hear weve got room for you right over there mayor said a junior aide pointing at a deserted bank of orange folding chairs behind the other viewers your friend too he glanced at the large agent no no kennedy said well just sit on the stairs no please but for the moment at least kennedy retained some social autonomy even if he had no fiscal and he waved off lanier and the aide he sat down beside claire on the top step dropping his jacket on the wood for her to sit on c p ardell seemed dense but he was apparently sensitive enough to know what kind of embarrassment the mayor would be feeling at the presence of a federal agent so the big man sat a few feet away from the mayor and his wife didnt hover over them used to come here when i was a kid the agent said to the mayor every sunday this surprised kennedy most fbi agents were transplants to the area you grew up here sure did wouldnt live in maryland or virginia for a million dollars wheres your home agent ardell claire asked him near the zoo just off the parkway kennedy laughed faintly at least if he had to be under detention he was glad his turnkey was a loyal citizen feeling warm from the champagne he moved closer to claire and took her hand they looked out over the mall gazed at the hundreds of thousands of people milling about kennedy was pleased to see that there was no microphone on the reviewing stand he didnt want to hear any speeches didnt want anybody to offer the mike to him for impromptu remarkslord what on earth could he say all he wanted was to sit with his wife and watch the fireworks blossom over his city and forget the agony of this day in his radio plea to the digger hed referred to this as the last day of the year but it was apparently the end of many things his chance to help the city the lives of many of his residents so horribly killed the end of his tenure in office too lanier and the others in congress who wanted to snatch the district away from its people would probably be able to leverage the digger incident into something impeachablemaybe interference with a police investigation something like that add in the board of education scandal and kennedy could be out of office within a few months wendell jefferies and all the other aides would be swept out with him and that would be the end of project the end of all his hopes for the district his poor city would be set back another ten years maybe the next mayor but then kennedy noticed something odd that the spectators seemed to be moving east purposefully as if they were being herded why he wondered the view was perfect from here he turned to claire started to mention this but suddenly she tensed whats that she asked what gunshots she said i hear gunshots kennedy looked into the air wondering if the sound perhaps was the fireworks starting early but no all he saw was the dark cloudy sky pierced by the white shaft of the washington monument then they heard the screaming czismans shots did what hed intended when hed realized that nobody had seen the diggerand that he himself had no clean shot at the killerhed fired twice into the air to scatter the people and clear a line of fire the explosions sent the crowd into a panic howling screaming everyone scattered knocking the digger to his knees in seconds the area immediately in front of the vietnam memorial was virtually empty czisman saw kincaid too flinging himself to the ground and pulling a small automatic out of his pocket the man hadnt seen the diggera thick stand of evergreens separated them that was fine with czisman he wanted the killer the digger was rising slowly the machine gun had fallen from his coat and he looked around for it he caught sight of czisman and froze gazing at him with the strangest eyes czisman had ever seen in those eyes was less feeling than in an animals whoever the mastermind behind the killings had beenthe one lying on the slab in the morguethat man wasnt pure evil he wouldve had emotions and thoughts and desires he might have reformed might have developed the nub of a conscience that was possibly within him but the digger no there was no redemption for this machine there was only death the killer with a mans mind and the devils heart the digger glanced at the gun in czismans hand then his eyes rose again and he stared at the journalists face kincaid was rising to his feet shouting at czisman drop the weapon drop the weapon czisman ignored him and lifted the gun toward the digger with a shaking voice he began to say you but there was a soft explosion at the diggers side a tuft of the mans overcoat popped outward czisman felt the hard fist in his chest dropped to his knees he fired his own gun but the shot went wide the digger removed his hand from his pocket holding a small pistol he aimed at czismans chest once more fired twice czisman flew backward under the impact of the rounds as he tumbled to the cold earth seeing distant lights reflected in the wall of the vietnam memorial he muttered you czisman tried to get his gun but where was it it had fallen from his hand where where kincaid was running for cover looking around confused czisman saw the digger walk slowly toward his machine gun pick it up and fire a burst toward kincaid who dove behind a tree the digger trotted away crouching through the bushes toward the fleeing crowds czisman groped for his gun you you you but his hand fell to the ground like a rock and then there was only blackness a few people click click funny a few people were nearby huddled on the ground looking around frightened the digger could easily have shot them but then the police would see him the last time kill as many as you can said the man who tells him things but how many is as many as you can one two three four five the digger doesnt think he meant only a half dozen the last minute of the last hour of the so hes hurrying after them doing the things he ought to do looking scared running the way the crowd does hunching over things like that youre youre youre the best who was that man back there he wonders he wasnt a policeman why was he trying to shoot me the digger has hidden the click click the uzi under his overcoat the overcoat that he loves because pamela gave it to him there are shouts nearby but they dont seem to be directed at him so he doesnt pay any attention nobody notices him hes moving through the grass near the bushes and trees along that wide streetconstitution avenue there are buses and cars and thousands and thousands of people if he can get to them he can kill hundreds he sees museums like the one where they have the picture of the entrance to hell museums are fun he thinks tye would like museums maybe when theyre in california they can go to a museum together more shouting people are running there are men and women and children all over the place police and agents they have uzis or macs or click pistols like the diggers pistols and like the pistol of the fat man who just tried to shoot him but these men and women arent shooting because they dont know who to shoot at the digger is just one of the crowd click click how far does he have to go to get to more people a few hundred feet he guesses hes trotting toward them but his path is taking him away from tyefrom the car parked on twentysecond street he doesnt like that thought he wants to get the shooting over with and get back to the boy when he gets to the crowd hell spin like a whirligig watch the people fall like leaves in a connecticut forest then go back to the boy when i travel on the road i love you all the more spin spin spin theyll fall like pamela fell with the rose on her chest and the yellow flashing flower in her hand fall fall fall more people with guns are running over the grass suddenly nearby he hears explosions cracks and bangs and pops are people shooting at him no no ah look above him flowers are blossoming in the air theres smoke and brilliant flowers red and yellow also blue and white fireworks his watch beeps its midnight time to shoot but the digger cant shoot just yet there arent enough people the digger keeps moving toward the crowd he can shoot some but not enough to make the man who tells him things happy crack a bullet streaks past him now someone is shooting at him shouting two men in fbi jackets in the middle of the field to the diggers right have seen him theyre standing in front of a wooden platform decorated with beautiful red and blue and white banners like the ones the fat new years babies wear he turns toward them and fires the uzi through his coat he doesnt want to do thisto put more holes in the beautiful black or blue coat pamela gave him but he has to he cant let anyone see the gun the men clutch at their faces and necks as if bees are stinging them and fall down the digger turns and continues moving after the crowds nobody has seen him shoot the men he only has to walk a couple of hundred feet further and hell be surrounded by lots of people looking around like everybody else looking for the killer looking for salvation and then he can shoot and shoot and shoot spinning like a whirligig in a connecticut forest when the first bullets crashed into the wood around him jerry kennedy shoved claire off the platform and onto the cold ground he jumped after her and lay on his side shielding her from the bullets claire kennedy shouted im all right her voice was edgy with panic whats going on somebodys shooting it must be him the killerhe must be here they lay side by side huddling smelling dirt and grass and spilled beer one person on the platform had been hitthe young aide whod been shot in the arm as congressman lanier leapt behind him for cover but no one else seemed to be injured most of the shots had been wild the killer had been aiming at the two agents in front of the viewing stand not at anyone on the platform kennedy could see the agents were dead the mayor glanced up and saw c p ardell holding his black pistol in front of him looking over the field he stood tall wasnt even crouching agent ardell kennedy shouted there he is there but the agent didnt shoot kennedy climbed halfway up the stairs tugged at the mans cuff pointing hes getting away shoot the huge agent held his automatic out in front of him like a sharpshooter ardell ahnnnn the agent was saying whatre you waiting for kennedy cried but c p ardell just kept saying ahnnnnn ahnnnn gazing out over the field then ardell started to turn slowly revolving looking north then east then south looking toward the wall of the vietnam memorial then at the trees then at the washington monument then at the flag that decorated the backdrop of the viewing platform ahnnnn the agent turned once more a complete circle and fell onto his back staring up at the sky with glazed eyes kennedy saw the top of his head was missing oh jesus claire gave a gasp as a stream of the mans blood cascaded down the stairs and pooled inches from her face the agent said ahnnnnnn once more blew a slick bubble from his mouth kennedy took the mans hand it quivered slightly then it was still kennedy stood up he looked past the podium which lanier his aide and another congressman were hiding behind the mall was dimthere were no lights on because of the fireworksbut in the headlights from the emergency vehicles kennedy had a view of the chaos he was looking for the silhouette of the digger what the hellre you doing in my city he whispered then his voice rose to a shout what the hell are you doing here jerry get down claire pleaded but he stayed where he was scanned the field trying to find the dark form of the killer once more where was he where then he saw a man in the shadows walking fast along a row of cherry trees not far from constitution avenue he was making for the crowds farther east on the mall kennedy stood and pried the pistol from the dead agents hand oh jerry no claire said no call on your phone theres no time no she was crying softly he paused turned to her touched her cheek with his left hand and kissed her forehead the way he always did before they shut the light out and went to sleep then he leapt over the huddling lumps of a young politico couple and sprinted over the grass he thought im going to have a fucking heart attack im going to have a heart attack and die but he didnt slow down the familiar sights of the city were around him the white washington monument the stark cherry trees the tower of the smithsonian the gray neogothic buildings of the museums the tourist buses kennedy gasped and ran gasped and ran the digger was a hundred feet away from him then ninety feet eighty feet kennedy watched the killer move closer to the crowd he pulled a black machine gun from under his coat there was a shot from the trees to kennedys left then another and two more yes kennedy thought theyve seen him but suddenly a tuft of grass beside kennedy flew into the air and another bullet snapped over his head jesus they were shooting at him theyd seen a man with a gun running toward the crowds and assumed he was the killer no no he crouched then pointed toward the digger its him the killer was in the tree line moving around to the side of the crowd in just a minute hed be only fifty feet from them and could kill hundreds with a single burst from the gun hell with it lets just hope the copsre bad shots kennedy began to sprint forward again there was one more shot in his direction but then someone must have identified him shouts over the bullhorn ordered the officers to cease fire get back kennedy was shouting to the crowd but there was nowhere for them to go they were packed together like cattle thousands some staring at the fireworks some looking around uneasy and confused kennedy steered toward the trees his chest on fire speeding toward the place where hed last seen the digger im dying he thought he pictured himself on the ground retching in agony as his heart shut down and besides what on earth am i doing what kind of idiocy is this the last time hed fired a gun had been at summer camp with his sonthirty years ago hed fired three shots and missed the target completely to the boys shame running running closer to the tree line closer to the digger agents had seen where he was headed and must have assumed that he was after the killer a rough line of a dozen men and women in tactical police gear were jogging toward him the digger stepped out of the bushes pointing the machine gun toward the crowd he nodded to himself kennedy stopped running lifted ardells pistol and aimed it toward the killer he wasnt even sure what to aim at how the sights on the heavy gun worked whether he should aim high or low but kennedy was a strong man and he held the gun very steadily in his hand he remembered how he and his eldest son stood side by side at camp listening to the camp counselor squeeze the trigger dont jerk it the boys giggling at the word and so tonight jerry kennedy squeezed the explosion was huge and he wasnt prepared for the pistol to buck so high in the air kennedy lowered the gun again squinted over the dim field he laughed out loud christ i did it i hit him the digger was on the ground grimacing and clutching at his left arm kennedy fired again this bullet missed and he fired another round two more the digger rolled to his feet he started to aim at kennedy but the mayor fired again this was a miss toothe bullet struck a treebut it was close and the digger stumbled backward he fired a short burst toward kennedy all the bullets missed the killer looked to his left where the line of agents and cops was moving toward him he aimed toward them and must have pulled the trigger kennedy heard nothing saw no flash from the end of the gun but one agent fell and bits of grass and dirt leapt into the air the other agents dropped into defensive postures on the ground they aimed toward him but no one fired kennedy saw whybecause the crowds were directly behind the digger they would surely have hit some people in the crowd only kennedy had a clear shot he stood up from his crouch and fired five more times at the black bundle on the ground driving the digger back away from the crowds then the gun clicked it was empty he squinted looking past the pistol the dark form of the digger was gone panting now something within the digger snaps and he forgets everything the man who tells him things told him he forgets about killing as many people as he can and forgets about people seeing his face and forgets about spinning around like a leafy seed in connecticut he wants to get out of here and get back to tye the bullets that man was firing came so close he nearly killed me and if he gets killed whats going to happen to the boy he drops into a crouch and sprints toward a tour bus the engine is idling a cloud of exhaust rises from the tailpipe his arm hurts so badly pain look theres a red rose on his arm but oh how it click how it hurts he hopes he never feels pain like this again he hopes tye never ever has to feel pain like this he looks for the man who shot him why did he do that the digger doesnt understand hes just doing what hes been told even if you loved me less id love you all the more fireworks blossom over the mall a line of police and agents is moving closer they start shooting the digger climbs up the stairs of the bus and turns spraying bullets at the cluster of pursuing agents theres a huge star burst of orange oh my he says thinking tye would like that he breaks a window in the bus and carefully aims his gun parker and cage crouched behind a squad car neither of them had much tactical training and knew it was prudent to leave the shootemup stuff to the younger more experienced agents besides as cage had just shouted to parker a minute ago it was a goddamn war zone bullets flying everywhere the digger had good protection inside the bus and was firing careful bursts through the shattered windows len hardy was pinned down with several other district cops on the other side of constitution avenue cage pressed his side and winced he hadnt been hit but a stream of bullets had ripped through the sheet steel of the car they were using for cover and hed flung himself to the ground landing hard on his side you okay parker asked rib the man moaned feels broken shit agents had cleared the area around the bus and were peppering it freely whenever they thought there was a target theyd flattened the tires so the digger couldnt drive away although parker could see there was no chance of that happening in any casethe broad avenue was one huge traffic jam for a half mile in both directions parker heard snippets of radio transmissions no target presenting get a flashbang inside whos got a grenade two down on constitution we got anybody copying we got two down on constitution snipers in position then cage glanced up over the hood of the torn car jesus cage gasped whats the fucking kid doing parker looked too toward constitution avenue following the agents gaze there was len hardy his tiny gun in his hand crawling from tree to tree toward the bus lifting his head and firing a shot occasionally parker said hes nuts he doesnt even have body armor len cage shouted then winced at the pain parker took over len len hardy get back let swat handle it but he didnt hear them or pretended he hadnt cage wheezed its like hes got some kind of death wish hardy stood and sprinted toward the bus emptying his weapon as he ran even parker knew this wasnt proper procedure for a tactical operation parker saw the digger move toward the back of the bus where hed have a good shot at hardy the detective didnt notice he huddled on the ground completely exposed reloading len parker cried get under cover he doesnt even have speedloaders cage muttered hardy was slipping the new shells into his revolver one by one the digger moved closer to the back of the bus no parker muttered knowing he was going to see the young man die jesus cage cried gasping then hardy looked up and must have realized what was happening he lifted the gun and fired three more timesall the shells hed been able to reloadand then he stumbled backward trying to get to cover hes dead cage muttered hes dead parker saw the killers silhouette near the emergency exit in the back of the buswhere he had a perfect shot at hardy sprawled on the street but before the digger could fire an agent rolled out from behind a car and crouched firing a stream of bullets into the bus blood sprayed the inside windows then there was a sensuous whoosh and fire erupted inside the bus a flaming stream of fuel flowed to the curb hardy struggled to his feet and ran for cover behind a district squad car there was a heartrending scream from inside the bus as the interior disappeared in orange fire parker saw the digger a mass of boiling flames rise once then fall into the aisle of the bus there were soft snaps from insidelike the popcorn that stephie had made earlier for her brothers surprise dessertas the diggers remaining bullets exploded in the fire a tree on constitution avenue caught fire and illuminated the macabre spectacle with an incongruously cheerful glow slowly the agents rose from cover and approached the bus they stood at a cautious distance as the last of the burning ammunition detonated and the fire trucks arrived and began pumping foam on the charred hulk of the vehicle when the flames had died down two agents in full body armor made their way to the door of the bus and looked inside suddenly a series of loud bangs shook the mall every agent and cop nearby dropped into defensive positions lifting their weapons but the sounds were only the fireworksorange spiders blue star bursts white concussion shells the glorious finale of the show the two agents stepped out of the doorway of the bus pulled their helmets off a moment later parker heard one of the agents staticky transmission in cages radio vehicle is secure he said subject confirmed dead was the unemotional epitaph for the killer as they walked back to the vietnam memorial parker told cage about czisman how the shooting had started he fired warning shots he hadnt done that the digger wouldve killed a hundred people right here maybe me too what the hell was he up to in front of them a cop was covering henry czismans body cage bent down grimacing in pain a medic had poked his abdomen and proclaimed that the fall had resulted in the predicted broken rib the agent was taped then given some tylenol the most frustrating part of the injury seemed to be that shrugging was momentarily too painful for him the agent pulled the yellow rubberized sheet away from the corpse he went through the journalists pockets took out his wallet then he found something else whats this he lifted a book out of the mans jacket pocket parker saw that it was a little gem of a book leatherbound handstitched pages not perfectgluedbinding as in massmarket books the paper was vellum which in thomas jeffersons day was smoothed animal skin but nowadays was very highquality cloth paper the edges of the paper were marbleized in red and gold and inside the calligraphic handwritingpresumably czismanswas as beautiful as an artists parker couldnt help but admire it cage flipped through it paused at several pages read them shaking his head he handed it to parker check this out parker frowned looking at the title written in gold ink on the cover a chronicle of sorrow he opened it read out loud to the memory of my wife anne the butchers first victim the book was divided into sections boston white plains and photographs of crime scenes had been pasted inside the first one was headed hartford parker turned the page and read from the hartford newstimes czisman had copied the text of the article it was dated in november of last year parker read three killed in holdup hartford police are still searching for the man who walked into the offices of the newstimes on saturday and opened fire with a shotgun killing three employees in the classified advertising department the only description of the killer was that he was a male of medium build wearing a dark overcoat a police spokesman said that his motive may have been to divert law enforcement authorities while his accomplice robbed an armored truck making a delivery to a bank on the other side of town the second gunman shot and killed the driver of the truck and his assistant he escaped with in cash cage muttered killed three people for four gs thats him all right parker looked up one of the clerks killed at the paper was anne czisman she was his wife so he wanted the prick as much as we did cage said czisman was using us to get to the unsub and the digger thats why he wanted to see the body in the morgue so much and thats why he was following me revenge this book it was his way of dealing with his grief parker crouched and reverently pulled the sheet back up over the mans face once more lets call lukas he said to cage give her the news at fbi headquarters margaret lukas was in the employees lobby on pennsylvania avenue briefing the deputy director a handsome man with a politicians trim graying hair shed heard the reports that the digger was on the mall and that there had been shooting lukas was desperately eager to get to the mall herself but since she was primary on the case protocol dictated that she keep the senior administrators in the bureau informed her phone buzzed and she answered fast superstitiously not letting herself hope that theyd captured him lukas here margaret cage said and she knew immediately from his tone that theyd nailed the killer it was a sound in a cops voice you learn early in your career collared or tagged arrested or dead she meant tagged cage responded lukas came as close to saying a prayer of thanksgiving as shed come in five years and get this the mayor winged him what yep kennedy got off a few shots that saved some lives she relayed this news to the deputy director you okay she asked cage fine cage responded cracked a rib while i was covering my ass is all but her gut tightened she heard something else in his voice a tone a hollowness jackie its toms mother jackie i have to tell you something the airline just called oh jackie but she asked quickly what happened is it kincaid no hes okay the agent said softly tell me he got c p margaret im sorry hes dead she closed her eyes sighed the fury steamed through her again fury that she herself hadnt had a chance to park a bullet in the diggers heart cage continued not even a firefight the digger shot toward where the mayor was sitting c p just happened to be in the wrong place and it was the place that id sent him to she thought bitterly christ shed known the agent for three years oh no cage was adding the digger capped four other friendlies and weve got three injured looks like six civies wounded still a halfdozen reported missing but no bodies they probably just scattered and their families havent found them yet oh and that czisman who the writer yeah digger got him what he wasnt a writer at all i mean he was but thats not what he was doing here the diggerd killed his wife and he was using us to get him the digger took him out first though so its been amateur night she thought kincaid the mayor czisman what about hardy cage told her that the young detective had made a oneman assault on the bus the diggerd holed up in he got pretty close and had good firing position mightve been his shots that hit the digger nobody could tell what was going on so he didnt shoot himself in the foot lukas asked cage said ill tell you it looked like he was hellbent on killing himself but when it came right down to it he backed off and went for cover guess he decided to stick around for a few years just like me lukas the changeling thought is evans there cage asked lukas looked around surprised that the doctor wasnt here funny shed thought he was coming down to the lobby to meet her im not sure where he is she answered must be upstairs still in the document lab or maybe the crisis center find him and give him the good news tell him thanks and tell him to submit a big bill will do and ill call tobe too parker and ire gonna do crime scene with pert then head back over there in fortyfive minutes or so when she hung up the dep director said im going down to the mall whos in charge she nearly said parker kincaid but caught herself special agent cage hes near the vietnam memorial with pert therell have to be a press conference ill give the director a headsup he may want to make a statement too say you miss a party tonight lukas thats the thing about holidays sir therell always be one next year she laughed maybe we ought to make up tshirts with that saying on them he smiled stiffly then asked hows our whistleblower doing any more threats moss i havent checked on him lately she said but i definitely have to you think theres a problem the dep director frowned oh no but he owes me a beer in the deserted document lab dr john evans folded up his cell phone he clicked the tv set off so theyd killed the digger the news reports were sporadic but as best evans could tell thered been minimal fatalitiesnot like the metro shooting and not like the yacht still from the tv images constitution avenue looked like a war zone smoke a hundred emergency vehicles people hiding behind cars trees bushes evans pulled on his bulky parka and walked to the corner of the lab he slipped the heavy thermos into his knapsack slung it over his shoulder then pushed through the double doors and started down the dim corridor the digger what a fascinating creature one of the few people in the world who really was as hed told the agents profileproof at the elevator he paused looked at the building directory trying to orient himself there was a map he studied it fbi headquarters was much more complicated than hed imagined his finger hovered over the down button but before he could push it a voice called hi he turned saw somebody walking toward him from the second bank of elevators hi there doctor the voice called again you heard it was that young detective len hardy his overcoat was no longer perfectly pressed it was stained and sooty there was a cut on his cheek evans pushed the down button twice impatient just saw it on the news he told hardy he shrugged the backpack off his shoulder the doctor grunted as he caught the bag in the crook of his arm and began to unzip it hardy glanced absently at the stained backpack he said man ill tell you i spoke a little too fast there volunteering to go after that guy i went a little crazy some kind of battlefield hysteria uhhuh evans said he reached inside the backpack and took out the thermos hardy continued chatting away he nearly nailed me shook me up some i was maybe thirty feet from him saw his eyes saw the muzzle of his gun man i was suddenly real happy to be alive that happens evans said where the hell was the elevator hardy glanced at the silver metal cylinder say you know where agent lukas is the detective asked looking up the dark corridor i think shes downstairs evans said unscrewing the lid to the thermos she had to brief somebody the lobby on ninth didnt you just come that way i came in through the garage the doctor pulled the top off the thermos you know detective the way you told everybody about the diggers and levelers you made it sound like you didnt trust me he turned toward hardy evans looked down he saw the black silenced pistol hardy was pointing at his face trust didnt have anything to do with it hardy said evans dropped the thermos coffee splashed onto the floor he saw the flash of yellow light from the muzzle of the gun and that was all he saw iv the puzzle master that handwriting was the worstest thing against me bruno hauptmann referring to the evidence in his trial for the lindbergh baby kidnapping the agent was young enough to still be thrilled at the idea of being an fbi employee so he didnt mind one bit that hed been assigned the midnightto shift new years eve in the bureaus security center on the third floor of headquarters there was also the fact that louise the agent he was working with wore a tight blue blouse and short black skirt and was flirting with him definitely flirting he decided well okay she was talking about her cat but the body language told him it was flirting and her bra was black and visible through the blouse which was a message too the agent continued to gaze at the ten tv monitors that were his responsibility louise on his left had another ten they were linked to more than sixty security cameras located in and around headquarters the scenes on the monitors changed every five seconds as the cameras sequenced louise of the black bra was nodding absently as he talked about his parents place on the chesapeake bay the intercom brayed it couldnt have been sam or ralphthe two agents he and louise had replaced a half hour ago they had totalclearance entry cards and wouldve just walked inside the agent hit the intercom button yes its detective hardy district pd whos hardy the agent asked louise she shrugged and went back to her monitors yes the voice crackled im working with margaret lukas oh on the metro shooter case right the legendary margaret lukas the security agent hadnt been with the bureau very long but even he knew that lukas would someday be the first woman director of the fbi the tech pushed the enter button spun around to face the door can i help you im afraid im lost hardy said happens around here he smiled where you headed im trying to find the document lab i got lost on the way to get some coffee documents thats the seventh floor turn left cant miss it thanks whats this louise said suddenly hey what is this the agent glanced at her as she hit a button to stop the video camera scan and pointed to one of the monitors it showed a man lying on his back not far from where they were now on this floor the monitors were black and white but a large pool of what was obviously blood ran from his head oh christ she muttered and reached for the phone it looks like ralph from behind them came a soft thunk louise gave a sudden jerk and grunted as the front of her blouse disappeared in a mist of blood oh she gasped what another pop the bullet struck the back of her head and she pitched forward the young agent turned toward the doorway lifting his hands crying no no in a calm voice hardy said relax please relax he repeated i just have a few questions dont kill me please now hardy asked matteroffactly your computersre running securechek software i ill let you live if you tell me everything i ask yes he started crying securechek what version six oh and if you dont log in at regular intervals a code fortytwo goes out over the intergov system thats right oh look mister he glanced at the body of the woman beside him which twitched twice blood flowed into the control panel oh god speaking slowly hardy asked you started your shift at midnight please i midnight he repeated a schoolteacher coaching a child the agent nodded what was your first login time he was crying hard now twelve twentyone whens the next time you have to log in oneohseven hardy glanced at the clock on the wall he nodded panic in his voice the young agent continued on holidays we use a pattern of increasing intervals so after the second login we thats all right hardy reassured the agent then shot him twice in the head and pushed the button to release the door the man who was not detective len hardy a fictional name but was in reality edward fielding made his way to the elevator he had until before the automated alarm would go off plenty of time the building was virtually deserted but still he walked the way he knew he should walk with an aura not of urgency but of preoccupation so if he were to run into one of the few remaining agents here theyd merely glance at his pass and judging fieldings demeanor decide to let him continue on to wherever he was headed on his important business he inhaled deeply took in the smells of the laboratory the offices the morgue feeling a wrenching thrill to be herein the center of the law enforcement universe the corridors of fbi headquarters he remembered a year ago the digger muttering insistently about going to an art museum in hartford fielding had agreed and the crazed man had stood for an hour in front of a doré illustration from the divine comedy dante and virgil about to descend into hell this is just what fielding felt nowas if he were on a tour of the underworld as he walked through the hallways he spoke silently to his teammates no agent lukas and parker kincaid and dr john evans no my motive isnt revenge for faded politics or terrorism its not exposing social injustice nor is it greed twenty million christ i couldve asked for ten times that no my motive is simply perfection the idea of the perfect crime was a cliché true but fielding had learned something interesting when hed been studying linguistics looking for just the right words and phrases to use in the extortion note in an article in the american journal of linguistics a philologista language experthad written that although serious writers are told to avoid them clichés have value because they describe fundamental truths in universally comprehensible terms the perfect crime fieldings holy chalice perfection it was intoxicating to him perfection was everythingthe way he ironed his shirts and polished his shoes and trimmed his ear hairs the way he set up his crimes the way they were executed if fielding had had an aptitude for the law hed have been a lawyer and devoted his life to creating the perfect defenses for impossibly guilty clients if hed had a lust for the outdoors hed have taught himself everything there was to learn about mountain climbing and made the perfect solo ascent to the summit of everest but those activities didnt excite him crime did this was just a fluke he supposed to be born utterly amoral the way some men are bald and some cats have six toes it was purely nature hed decided not nurture his parents were loving and dependable dullness was their only sin fieldings father had been an insurance executive in hartford his mother a homemaker he experienced no deprivation no abuse from an early age though he simply believed that the law didnt apply to him it made no sense why he spent hours wondering should man put restraints on himself why shouldnt we go wherever our desires and minds take us though it was some years before he learned it fielding had been born with a pure criminal personality a textbook sociopath so while he studied algebra and calculus and biology at st marys high school the young man also worked at his true calling and as in all disciplines that education had ups and downs fielding in juvenile detention for setting fire to the boyfriend of a girl he had a crush on shouldve parked my car three or four blocks away fielding beaten nearly to death by two police officers whom he was blackmailing with photos of transvestites giving them blow jobs in their squad car should have had a strongarm accomplice with him fielding successfully extorting a major cannedfood manufacturer by feeding their cattle an enzyme that mimicked a positive test for botulism though he never picked up the money at the drop because he couldnt figure out how to get away with the cash undetected live and learn college didnt interest him much the students at bennington had money but they left their dorm rooms open and there was no challenge in robbing them he enjoyed occasional felonious assaults on coedsit was challenging to rape someone in such a way that she doesnt realized shes being molested but fieldings lust was for the game itself not sex and by his junior year he was focusing on what he called clean crimes like robbery not messy crimes like rape he buckled down to get his psych degree and dreamt about escaping from ben jerry land and into the real world where he could practice his craft over the next ten years fielding back in his native connecticut did just that honed and practiced robbery mostly he avoided business crimes like check kiting and securities fraud because of the paper trails he avoided drugs and hijacking because you couldnt work alone and fielding never met anyone he trusted he was twentyseven when he killed for the first time an opportunistican impulsecrime very unlike him he was having a cappuccino at a coffee shop in a strip mall outside of hartford he saw a woman come out of a jewelry store with a package there was something about the way she walkedslightly paranoidthat suggested the package contained something very expensive he got into his car and followed her on a deserted stretch of road he accelerated and pulled her over terrified she thrust the bag at him and begged him to let her go as he stood there beside her chevy fielding realized that he hadnt worn a mask or switched plates on his car he believed that hed subconsciously failed to do these things because he wanted to see how hed feel about killing fielding reached into the glove compartment took out a gun and before she even had time to scream shot her twice he climbed back into his car drove back to juice n java and had another cappuccino ironically hed mused many criminals dont kill theyre afraid to because they think theyll be more likely to be caught in fact if they do kill theyll be more likely to get away still police can be good and he was arrested several times he was released in all those cases except one in florida he was collared for armed robbery and the evidence against him was strong but he had a good lawyer who got him a reduced sentence on condition that fielding seek treatment at a mental hospital he was dreading the time he had to serve but it turned out to be an astonishing two years in the dade city mental health facility fielding could taste crime he could smell it many if not most of the convicts were there because their lawyers were quick with the insanity defense dumb crooks are in prison smart ones are in hospitals after two years and an exemplary appearance before the medical review panel fielding returned to connecticut and the first thing he did was get a job as an aide at a hospital for the criminally insane in hartford there hed met a man named david hughes a fascinating creature fielding decided hed probably been a pretty decent fellow until he stabbed his wife to death in a jealous rage on christmas day the stabbing was a dimeadozen matter but what was so interesting though was what happened after hubby gave pamela several deep puncture wounds in the lungs she ran to the closet and found a pistol and before she died shot hughes in the head fielding didnt know what exactly had happened inside hughess cranium neurologically speaking butperhaps because the aide was the first person hughes saw when he awoke after surgerysome kind of odd bonding occurred between the two hughes would do whatever fielding asked getting coffee cleaning up for him ironing shirts cooking it turned out that hughes would do more than domestic chores thoughas fielding found out one evening just after nightduty nurse ruth miller removed fieldings hand from between her legs and said im reporting you asshole a worried fielding had muttered to hughes that ruth miller somebody ought to kill that bitch and hughes had said hmmm okay what fielding had asked hmmm okay youd kill her for me uhm i sure fielding took him for a walk on the grounds of the hospital they had a long talk a day later hughes showed up in fieldings cubicle covered with blood carrying a piece of jagged glass and asking if he could have some soup fielding cleaned him up thinking hed been a little careless about the when and where of the murder and about getting away afterward he decided that hughes was too good to waste on little things like this and so he told the man how to escape from the hospital and how to make his way to a nearby cottage that fielding rented for afternoon trysts with some of the retarded patients it was that night that he decided how he could best put the man to use hartford then boston then white plains then philly perfect crimes and now he was in washington committing what was turning out to be the most perfect crime he decided though reflecting that a linguist like parker kincaid would be troubled by the unnecessary modifier for the last six months hed spent nearly eighteen hours a day planning the theft slowly breaching fbi securitymasquerading as young detective hardy from the police departments research and statistics department hed selected his particular pseudonym because studies into the psychological impressions of names reported that leonard was unthreatening and hardy conjured an image of a loyal comrade he first infiltrated the bureaus district of columbia field office because that office had jurisdiction over major crimes in the district he got to know ron cohen the special agent in charge and his assistants he learned when sac cohen would be on vacation and which of his underlings would beas the currently invogue term wentprimary on a case of this magnitude that would be of course margaret lukas whose life he invaded as inexorably as he worked his way into the bureau itself hed camp out in conference rooms copying voluminous crime statistics for his fictional reports then would make trips to the vending machines and restrooms glancing at internal fbi memos and phone books and id documentation and procedure manuals meanwhile at his home and at his safe house in gravesend he was spending time cruising the internet and learning about government facilities police procedures and security systems and yes parker about foreign dialects fielding made hundreds of calls to interior designers whod worked at fbi headquarters to the gsa to former clerks outside contractors security specialists asking innocent questions talking about phony employee reunions arguing about imaginary invoices he usually managed to extract one vital factsay about the layout of the headquarters building the staffing on holidays the exits and entrances he learned the brand and general location of security cameras in headquarters the number and stations of the guards the communications systems hed spent a month finding the perfect front mangilbert havel a bum with no criminal record and virtually no recorded past a man naive enough to think that someone as brilliant as fielding needed a partner a man easy to kill it was arduous work but perfection requires patience and then this morning the digger shot the hell out of the metro and fielding showed up at the bureau doorstep eager to help but suitably indignant about being the third wheel on the investigation other agents would have double or triplechecked his credentials called police headquarters but not margaret lukas the poor childless widow because here was len hardy soon to be a childless widower racked with the same sorrow shed struggled through five years ago of course she accepted him into the fold without a thought and theyd never guessed a thing about him just as hed figured because edward fielding knew that combating crime today is the province of the scientist even the psychologists who profiled the criminal mind use formulae to categorize their prey yet the perpetrator himselfthe human beingis so often overlooked oh he knew that the agents believing the unsub to be dead would be concentrating so hard on the extortion note the linguistics the handwriting the trace evidence and their computer programs and fancy equipment that theyd never see the real mastermind standingliterallythree feet behind them he now came to the elevator the car arrived and he got inside fielding didnt however push the seventhfloor button to go to the document lab he pushed b the car began to descend the fbis evidence room is the largest forensic storage facility in the country its operated around the clock and usually theres a staff of two to help the agents log in evidence and sometimes to help them carry the heavier items into the locker area or drive confiscated cars and trucks and even trailered boats into the warehouse connected to the facility tonight though there were three agents on duty a decision made jointly by the deputy director and margaret lukas this was because of the value of a particular item of evidence sitting in the vault at the moment but since it was a holiday the two men and the woman were pretty casual they were lounging around the login window drinking coffee and talking about basketball the two men had their backs to the window i like rodman said one of the male clerks oh puhlease responded the other hi said edward fielding walking up to the window hey you hear what happened with that guy on the mall the woman asked him no fielding said and shot her in the head the other two died reaching for their weapons only one managed to get his sigsauer out of the holster fielding reached through the window buzzed himself in he counted eight video security cameras trained on the window shelves and vault but they sent their images to the thirdfloor security room where there was no one left alive to see the perfect crime unfolding fielding lifted the keys from the dead womans belt and opened the vault it was a large room about twenty by thirty and was where agents stored drugs and cash taken from heists in his months of research for the robbery fielding had learned that prosecutors are obligated to present to the jury the actual cash seized during say a drug bust or kidnapping this was one reason the agents would have brought the ransom money here the other was something else hed anticipatedthat mayor kennedy whom fielding had psychologically profiled would want to keep the cash available in case the digger contacted him and demanded the ransom after all and here it was the money perfect two huge green canvas satchels a red tag dangled from each strap federal evidence do not remove he looked at his watch he estimated that hed have twenty minutes before cage and kincaid and the other agents returned from the mall after their shootout with the digger plenty of time as long as he moved quickly fielding unzipped one bagit wasnt lockedand dumped the cash on the floor the satchel was wired with several homing devices as hed known it would be the money wrappers too hed learned from tobe gellera trick he hadnt anticipated he wondered if individual bills themselves had been rigged somehow he doubted it geller had never said anything still to make sure fielding reached into his pocket and took out a small silver instrumenta transdetect a scanner that could sense the faintest transmission signal of any wavelength from visual light to infrared to radio waves he ran this over the pile of cash just in case the bureau techs had managed to insert a transmitter into a bill itself but there were no signals fielding tossed aside the sensorhe had no need for it any longerand pulled a silk backpack from under his shirt it was made of parachute material and hed sewn it himself he began to pack the money into the bag hed asked for because that was a credible amount for a scheme like this and also to give some credence to the motive of revenge for a significant event like the vietnamese war fielding however would only be able to carry which would weigh seventytwo pounds generally unathletic hed worked out at a health club in bethesda maryland for six weeks after hed come to the area so that hed be strong enough to carry the cash the hundreddollar bills were all traceable of course tracing money was easy now thanks to scanners and computers but fielding had considered that in brazil where he would be in several days the in traceable cash would become in gold which would in turn become in untraceable us dollars and eurodollars and over the next few years it would easily grow to once again and then beyond the mutual fund industry and interest rates willing fielding had no regrets about leaving the rest of the money crime cant be about greed it must be about craft he packed the cash into the bag and slung it over his shoulder stepping into the corridor staggering under the weight working his way to the elevator thinking hed have to kill the guard at the front door as well as anyone in the team who was still here tobe geller he thought had gone home but lukas was still in the building she definitely would have to die under other circumstances killing her wouldnt matterhed been very careful about hiding his identity and where he really lived but the agents were much better than hed anticipated my god theyd actually found the safe house in gravesend that had shaken fielding badly he never thought theyd manage that fortunately gilbert havel had been to the safe house a number of times so neighbors would see havels picture when the police were doing their canvassing and assume he was the man whod rented the placereinforcing the agents belief that he was the mastermind of the crime and nearly finding that the ritzy lady was the site of the second attack hed sat in the document lab in horror as the computer had assembled the fragments from the note at the safe house hed waited for just the right moment and blurted out ritz maybe the ritzcarlton and as soon as theyd heard that the solution was set in stone it would be almost impossible for them to think of any other possibilities thats how puzzle solving works right parker and what about him oh he was far too smart far too much of a risk to remain alive as he walked slowly down the deserted corridors he reflected that while fielding was the perfect criminal kincaid was the perfect detective what happens when perfect opposites meet but this was a rhetorical question not a puzzle and he didnt waste time trying to answer it he came to the elevator and pushed the up button margaret lukas swung open the door to the document lab she looked inside hello dr evans he didnt answer where was he she wondered she paused at the examination table looked down at the extortion note the end is night thinking maybe parker kincaid wasnt quite correct when hed said that no one would make this kind of mistake in a way the end is night darkness and sleep and peace night take me darkness take me thats what shed thought when shed gotten the call from her motherinlaw about the crash that killed tom and joey lying in bed that windy november night or two nights later or threeit was all a jumble nowlying by herself unable to breathe unable to cry thinking night take me night take me please night take me lukas now stood hunched over the document examining table gazing down her short blond strands falling forward past her eyes like a horses blinders staring at the words of the extortion note the swirls of the sloppy letters lukas remembered watching kincaid as hed studied the note his lips moving faintly as if he were interviewing a living suspect the end is night shaking her head at her own morbidly philosophical mood she turned and left the lab she walked to the elevator maybe evans was waiting at the guard station she looked absently at the indicator lights as the elevator ascended the hallways were deserted and she was aware of the small noises of empty buildings at night the field office where she worked was located near city hall some blocks away and she didnt get here very often she didnt like headquarters very much it was too big and tonight she reflected the place was dark and spooky and it took a lot to make margaret lukas spooked she remembered kincaid projecting the extortion note onto a screen in the lab and shed thought it looks like a ghost lukas sensed more ghosts now here in these corridors ghosts of agents killed in the line of duty ghosts of victims of the crimes that were investigated here and her own personal ghosts she thought oh but they were with her all the time her husband and son they never left nor did she want them to the changeling needed something to remind her of jackie lukas she glanced down at the floor in front of the elevator there was a dark stain on the floor what was it she smelled sour coffee the elevator light flashed and a chime sounded the door opened someone stepped out oh hi lukas said got some news for you hey margaret said susan nance juggling a dozen files whats up they just tagged him got him on the mall the metro killer yep the woman gave a thumbsup excellent oh happy new year same to you lukas got on the elevator and descended to the main floor at the employee entrance guard station artie looked up at her and nodded a pleasant greeting did that dr evans sign out she asked him nope havent seen him shed wait for him here lukas sat in one of the comfortable lobby chairs sank down into it she felt exhausted she wanted to get home she knew people said behind her back how sad it must bea woman living alone but it wasnt sad at all returning to the womb of the house was a hell of a lot better than sitting at a bar with girlfriends or going out on a date with the endless fodder of eligibleand dullmen in washington home thinking about the report shed have to write about metshoot thinking about parker kincaid focus she told herself then she remembered that she didnt have to focus anymore what about him well he wanted to ask her out she knew he did but shed already decided to say no he was a handsome energetic man filled with the love of children and domestic life how appealing that seemed but no she couldnt inflict on him the sorrow that she believed she radiated like toxic fumes maybe jackie lukas might have had a chance with a man like kincaid but a changeling like margaret never would artie looked up from his paper oh forgot to sayhappy new year agent lukas happy new year artie as the digger smouldered with a foul reek and the fire department spurted foam onto the scorched cherry trees as the crowds circled the burntout bus parker and cage stood together the diggers gone so long verses from dr seuss trooped through his mind like some of the authors bizarre creatures parker blamed his mania on a cocktail of exhaustion and adrenaline he called the whos and promised them hed be home in a half hour robby told his father about the air horn someone had blasted at midnight waking up the bradleys down the street and causing a neighborhood stir stephie described the sparklers in the yard with breathless sloppy adjectives love you who he said be home soon love you too daddy the girl said hows your friend hes going to be fine cage was talking to an evidence tech from pert and parker was jockeying to get downwind of the smoke from the bus there was an unpleasant scentworse than the burnt rubber of the tires parker knew what it was and the thought of inhaling any of the diggers ashy corpse nauseated him a dead psycho smouldering before him and parker at the tail end of an evening like none other hed ever had yet its the mundane things in life that poke up like crocuses he now thought hell i dont have enough cash to pay mrs cavanaugh he patted his pockets and dug out a small wad of bills twentytwo bucks not enough hed have to stop at an atm on the way home he glanced at a piece of paper mixed in with the money it was the transcription of the unsubs notes on the burnt yellow pad the references to the last two sites of the attacks that hed found on the pad of paper tobe geller had saved from the burning safe house two miles south the r place i showed you the black whats that cage asked kneading his wounded rib a souvenir parker said looking down at the words just a souvenir edward fielding paused at the end of the corridor gasping under the weight of the money on his back he looked toward the reception area thirty feet away and saw the short blond hair of margaret lukas beyond her was the guard reading the newspaper the lights were out in the corridor and even if theyd turned toward him it would have been difficult to see him clearly adjusting the money more comfortably he clutched the pistol in his right hand and started down the hallway his leather soles tapping faintly on the tile he noted that lukas was facing away from him hed put one bullet in her head then as the guard looked up hed kill him then home free tap tap tap he closed the distance to his targets perfect margaret lukas gazing at the christmas tree in the lobby stretched like a cat she listened absently to footsteps coming up the hall behind her two weeks ago the entryway here had been filled with presents that the agents and staffers had donated for homeless families shed volunteered to give away some of the toys but at the last minute she canceled and instead worked twelve hours on christmas day investigating the killing of a black man by two whites tap tap tap now she wished she hadnt canceled on christmas at the time shed reasoned that giving out toys was frivolous when she could be doing serious work but now she admitted that the thought of seeing small children on the holiday was more harrowing to her than kicking in the door of a redneck gun nut in manassas park coward she told herself tap tap tap she looked out the glass windows crowds people returning from the mall she thought about the digger wondered about the shootout about whod fired the shots that killed him shed been in two firefights in her career and remembered mostly confusion it was so different from in the movies never any sense of slow motiona gunfight in real life was five blurry seconds of utterly terrifying chaos and then it was over with the vivid images came afterward caring for the wounded and removing the dead tap tap a buzzing phone startled her in front of her artie answered and she absently watched his grizzled face front desk oh hello agent cage suddenly the guard was frowning he glanced at lukas then focused past her his eyes went wide well the guard said uneasily detective hardy hes who what do you mean but hes right here hesoh jesus artie was dropping the phone fumbling for his weapon tap tap taptaptaptap instinctively lukas knew that the footsteps now running toward them were an attackers she fell forward just as the rounds from the silenced pistol snapped into the back of the couch where shed been sitting ripping naugahyde and bits of stuffing from the upholstery she looked behind her twisting around scrabbling for cover behind a potted plant it was wait it couldnt be it was hardy firing wildly artie shouted its him hes the killer he oh my oh no the guard looked down at his chest hed been hit he slumped to his knees fell behind the desk another bullet snapped through the back of the couch near lukass head she curled for cover behind the anemic palm tree so many agents had ridiculed she cringed as a bullet was loudly deflected by the chrome pot lukas was on automatic she didnt even try to figure out what had happened or who this man really was she looked up quickly searching for a target but she had to duck fast as another bullet chopped though the thick green blades of leaf inches from her face she rolled to her left against the wall rose and drew a target in a portion of a second she checked the backdrop behind hardy and fired three fast shots the heavy millimeter slugs just missed him and dug huge chunks out of the wall hardy fired twice more at her then vanished back down the corridor she ran to the wall beside the hallway pressed her back against it the tapping footsteps receded another voice from the far end of the corridor called whats going on whats going on somewhere along the hallway a door slammed lukas looked around the corner quickly then went back to cover shed seen a man down at the end of the hall in silhouette she dropped to her belly drew a target shouted im a federal agent identify yourself or ill fire ted yan the man called in software analysis lukas knew him he was a friend of gellers an agent but she thought great ive got a computer nerd for backup you alone she shouted im silence ted no therere two of us susan nance is here with me nances voice cracked as she called oh margaret he got louise in security shes dead and tony phelps too jesus what was going on ted said were by the okay quiet lukas barked dont give away your position did anybody go past you no ted called he couldntve gotten by me i heard a door slam in the hallway here hes somewhere between us cover me lukas called watching her back lukas ran to the guard station artie was unconscious but wasnt bleeding badly she picked up the phone but cage was no longer on the line she hit identified herself as a justice department agent and called in a code at fbi headquarters to her knowledge nobodyd ever done this not in the entire history of the bureau it meant an assault on headquarters it had become a joke over the yearswhen somebody d it meant theyd totally screwed up you armed lukas called service ted called both of us meaning their glocks or sigsauer service pistols lukas thought about her mp machine gun sitting in her truck at the moment she would have given anything for the weapon but didnt have time to get it now she studied the corridor which was still empty eight doors in the hallway five on the right three on the left hes behind one of them heres a puzzle for you parker which door leads to our judas three hawks have been killing a farmers chickens holding the gun out in front of her she eased forward saw the silhouettes of the other agents at the far end of the corridor using hand signals she motioned them aside back around the corner if hardy burst from a doorway shed have trouble acquiring a target with ted and nance in the background theyd have the same trouble too and might hesitate to light up hardy for fear of hitting her alone shed lose the crossfire advantage but could shoot freely if he tried to make a run for it lukas moved down the corridor which door she wondered think come on think if hardy had any sense of orientation hed know that the five offices on her right were exterior ones he wouldntve picked any on the left because hed risk getting trapped inside the building okay well narrow it down to those on the right of these five two were labeled receptionthe euphemism for the interrogation rooms like the one in which theyd met with czisman hardy might logically doubt that the fbi would have reception rooms and he might figure that they had something to do with security and would have no access to outsidewhich in fact they didnt they were windowless the door in the middle was labeled maintenance lukas didnt know exactly where that one led but she supposed it was a janitors closet with no other exit and concluded that hardy would have made the same deduction that left two doors both unmarked and both she happened to know leading to small offices for temporary wordprocessor operators both rooms had windows facing the street one was the office closest to the reception area the other was closest to ted and nance but whats the hurry she asked herself just wait for backup yet hardy could be trying to break out one of the windows right now close to escaping lukas wouldnt risk that this man might get away which door which one she made her choice the door nearest the lobby it made sense hardy wouldnt have run thirty or forty feet down the corridor with an armed agent behind him before taking cover once she made her decision she forgot all other options puzzles are always easy when you know the answer just like life right she tried the knob but the door was locked were they always locked she wondered or had he locked it from the inside no hed locked it he had to be in there where else could he have gone she ran to the guard station got the keys from arties belt returned she slipped the key in the hole as quietly as she could turned the latch it clicked with an alarming sound hell may as well just shout out here i come one two breathe deep she thought about her husband about her son i love you mommy and pushed through the door fast crouching weapon up pressure on the sharp trigger of the glock nothing he wasnt here wait the desk it was the only piece of furniture he could be hiding behind she stepped around it swinging her weapon in front of her nothing hell shed gotten it wrong hed gone through the other door the far one then from the corner of her eye faint motion the door directly across the hallway from this oneanother door marked maintenancehad opened slightly the muzzle of a silenced gun was lowering toward her margaret susan nances voice came from the end of the corridor then the woman shouted freeze you lukas flung herself to the floor as hardys gun fired twice but he wasnt aiming at her the bullets were meant for the plateglass window the glass shattered into a thousand pieces nance fired a group of three as hardy who ran awkwardly because of a large knapsack on his back stumbled through the corridor and into the office where lukas crouched the agents shots missed he fired blindly in lukass direction forcing her under cover she rolled to the floor the slugs clanged into the desk and hardy leapt through the empty window frame onto the deck overlooking ninth street he jumped over the fence to street level lukas returned fire but she missed too she climbed to her feet and ran to the window lukas understood what had happened hardy had tried the door on the window side of the building and found it locked hed waited in a janitors closet across the hall outguessing herfiguring shed probably pick the door she did and get the key to open it hed used her shed been dead wrong he aims at the hawk on the left and shoots and kills it standing on the crisp broken glass on the deck she looked up and down the street but could see no sign of hardy the bullet doesnt ricochet all she saw was a huge crowd of people returning from the fireworks staring in surprise at the shattered window that framed the attractive blonde with a gun in her hand how many hawks are left on the roof parker and cage were in the document lab once more joined this time by the dep director six dead the director muttered lord almighty inside headquarters dr john evans shot twice in the face had been found in a seventhfloor closet artie the guard was badly wounded but would live who the hell is he the director demanded the man pretending to be hardy had left some good fingerprints and they were being run through the automated fingerprint identification system files right now if his prints were on file anywhere in the country theyd know his identity soon lukas pushed through the door parker was alarmed to see a peppering of blood on her cheek you all right he asked arties she said in a low murmur noticing his eyes on the blood not mine she looked at parker then cage for a moment the stones in her eyes were gone but he couldnt tell what had replaced them how did you know cage glanced toward parker it was him figured it out tremble parker answered he held out the sheet of paper that hed found in his pocket when hed been looking for babysitter money i noticed there was tremble in his handwriting thats what happens when somebody tries to disguise their writing i remembered it was hardy whod written down what i dictated but why would he try to fake his writing there was only one reasonbecause hed written the extortion note i checked the lowercase i in two miles and the dot was a devils teardrop that confirmed it what happened the deputy director asked the director wants to know immediately it was all a setup parker said pacing somewhere in his mind the entire plot was quickly falling into place in minute detail he asked lukas how did hardy get involved in the case i knew him she said hes been coming by the field office for the past few months just flashed a badge and said he needed some stats on felonies in the district for a congressional report district pds research and statistics does it a couple times a year its all public informationnot ongoing investigationsso nobody bothered to check today he showed up and said hes been assigned as liaison for the case and its one of those obscure departments parker pointed out so that if the mayor or the police chief really did send somebody from major crimes or investigation over here for liaison he probably wouldnt have known there was no len hardy lukas said so hes been planning this for two months sighing in disgust probably six parker muttered planned every detail he was a goddamn perfectionist his shoes his nails his clothes flawless cage asked but the guy in the morgue the one we thought was the unsub whos he parker said a runner somebody hardyor whatever his name ishired to deliver the letter but cage said he was killed in an accident no it wasnt an accident lukas said stealing the words from parkers throat nodding he said hardy murdered him ran him down in a stolen truck to make it look accidental lukas continued so wed think the perp was dead and bring the money back to the evidence room he knew wed have tracking devices in the bags or that wed try to collar him at the drop cage wincing again from the cracked rib said he left the transmit bags downstairs repacked the money and ripped off the tracking labels too but he came up with the info about the digger didnt he the deputy director asked because of him we stopped the shooter before he could do any real damage on the mall well of course parker responded surprised they didnt get it what do you mean the dep director asked thats why he picked the vietnam memorial its not far from here he knew wed be shorthanded and that wed virtually empty the building to get everybody out looking for the digger so he could just waltz into evidence and pick up the money lukas said bitterly its just what evans said that he had everything planned out i told him that wed rigged the bags with tracers but evans said he had some plan to counter that cage asked parker the prints on the note hardy never touched it without gloves but he made sure the runner didso we could verify the body was the unsubs and he picked somebody with no record and no military service lukas added so we couldnt trace the runner jesus he thought of everything a computer beeped cage leaned forward and read its an afis report and vicap and connecticut state police files here we go he scrolled through the information a picture came up on the screen it was hardy his real name is edward fielding last known address blakesly connecticut outside of hartford oh our friend is not a very nice man four arrests one conviction juvie time too but those recordsre sealed treated repeatedly for antisocial behavior was an aide and orderly at hartford state hospital for the criminally insane he left after a nurse he was accused of sexually harassing was found stabbed to death the hospital administration cage continued reading from the screen thinks fielding talked a patient david hughes into killing her hughes was admitted two years ago christmas day he had severe brain damage following a gunshot wound and was highly suggestible fielding probably helped hughes escape the hospital board and the police were going to investigate fielding but he disappeared after that that was in october of last year hughes is the digger parker announced softly you think positive he continued and the hartford newspaper shootingwhat got czisman started on fieldings trailthat was in november recalling the clipping in czismans book that was their first crime a chronicle of sorrow but why so much death the dep director asked it cant just be for the money he mustve had some terrorist leanings nope parker said definitively not terrorism at all but youre absolutely right it has nothing to do with the money oh i recognize him you know fielding no i mean i recognize the type hes like a document forger forger asked lukas serious forgers see themselves as artists not thieves they dont really care about the money the point is to create a forgery that fools everyone thats their only goal a perfect forgery lukas nodded so the other crimesin hartford and boston and phillythey were just exercises stealing one watch a few thousand dollars it was just to perfect his technique exactly and this was the culmination this time he got a big chunk of money ands going to retire why do you think that cage asked but lukas knew the answer to that one too because he sacrificed his errand boy so he could escape he told us where the digger was recalling how hardy had fired at the bus parker added he may actually have been the one who shot the digger on the mall if they took him alive he might have talked hardy was laughing at us cage said slamming his fist down on the table the whole fucking time he was sitting right next to us and laughing but where is he the dep director asked parker said oh hell have his escape all planned out hes outthought us every step of the way he wont stumble now we can get his picture off the video camera down in the lobby cage said get it to all the tv stations at two in the morning parker said whos going to be watching and weve already missed the newspaper deadlines anyway hell be out of the country by sunup and on a plastic surgeons operating table in two days the airportsre closed the dep director pointed out he cant get any flights till morning hell be driving to louisville or atlanta or new york lukas said but well put out a bulletin to the field offices get agents to all the airports amtrak stations and bus terminals rentalcar companies too check dmv and deeds offices for an address and call connecticut state police she paused looking at parker he could see that she was thinking exactly what he was hes thought of all that parker said im not saying we dont have to do it but hes anticipated it i know she said and seemed all the more angry because of her helplessness the dep director said ill authorize tenmostwanted status but parker wasnt listening he was staring at the extortion note perfect forgery he whispered to himself what lukas asked he looked at his watch im going to go see somebody im going with you lukas said parker hesitated better if you didnt no im going i dont need any help im going with you she said firmly and parker looked into her blue eyesstone or no stone he couldnt tell he said okay they drove through the streets of the district mostly deserted now parker was at the wheel a car paused at an intersection to their right in the glare parker caught lukass profile her thin mouth her rounded nose her sweep of throat he turned back to the street and drove deeper into alexandria virginia maybe she envies you how much he wanted to take her hand sit with her in a bar or on his couch at home or lie in bed with her and talk talk about anything perhaps about the secret of margaret lukas whatever that might be or just do what he and the whos did sometimestalk about nothing talk silly they called it about cartoons or neighbors or the home depot sale or recipes or vacations past and vacations planned or maybe he and lukas would share the war stories that copsfederal or state or crossing guardsloved to relive the secret could wait shed have years to tell him he thought years suddenly he realized that he was considering a connection with her that might last more than a single night or a week or month what did he have to base this fantasy on nothing really it was a ridiculous thought whatever connection there might be between themshe the soldier he the hausfrauwas pure illusion or was it he remembered the whos in the dr seuss book the race of creatures living on a dust mote so small no one could see them but they were there nonetheless with all their crazy grins and contraptions and bizarre architecture why couldnt love be found in something that seemed invisible too he looked at her once again and she at him he found his hand reaching out tentatively and touching her knee her hand closed on his nothing tentative about it then they were at the address he sought he removed his hand he parked the car not a word said not a look between them lukas climbed out parker too he walked around to her side of the car and they stood facing each other how badly he wanted to hold her put his arms around her slip his hands into the small of her back pull her close she glanced at him and slowly unbuttoned her blazer he caught a glimpse of the white silk blouse he stepped forward to kiss her she glanced down unholstered her weapon and buttoned her blazer once more squinted as she looked past him checking out the neighborhood oh parker stepped back where to she asked matteroffactly parker hesitated looked at her cool eyes then nodded at a winding path that led into an alley this way the man was about five feet tall he had a wiry beard and bushy hair he wore a ratty bathrobe and parker had obviously wakened him when he banged fiercely on the rickety door he stared at parker and lukas for a moment then without a word retreated quickly back into the apartment as if hed been tugged back by a bungee cord lukas preceded parker inside she looked around then holstered her weapon the rooms were cluttered filled to overflowing with books and furniture and papers on the walls hung a hundred signed letters and scraps of historical documents a dozen bookshelves were chockablock with more books and portfolios an artists drawing table was covered with bottles of ink and dozens of pens it dominated the tiny living room how you doing jeremy the man rubbed his eyes glanced at an oldfashioned windup alarm clock he said my parker its late say look at what ive got here do you like it parker took the acetate folder jeremy was holding up the mans fingertips were yellow from the cigarettes he loved parker recalled that he smoked only outside however he didnt want to risk contaminating his work as with all true geniuses jeremys vices bent to his gift parker took the folder and held it up to a light picked up a hand glass and examined the document inside after a moment he said the width of the strokes its very good better than good parker okay ill grant you that the starts and lifts are excellent also looks like the margins are right and the folio size matches the papers from the era of course but youd have to fake the aging of the ink with hydrogen peroxide thats detectable maybe maybe not jeremy smiled maybe ive got something new up my sleeve are you here to arrest me parker im not a cop anymore jeremy no but she is isnt she yes she is jeremy took the sheet back i havent sold it i havent even offered it for sale to lukas he said its just a hobby a man can have a hobby cant he what is it lukas asked parker said its a letter from robert e lee to one of his generals he added i should say purporting to be from robert e lee he forged it lukas asked glancing at jeremy thats right i never admitted anything im taking the fifth parker continued its worth maybe fifteen thousand seventeen if somebody were going to sell it which i never would parker arrested me once jeremy said to lukas tweaking his beard with his middle finger and thumb he was the only one in the world who caught me you know how he did it how she asked parkers attention was not on the excellent forgery but on margaret lukas who seemed both amused and fascinated by the man her anger had gone away for the moment and parker was very pleased to see that the watermark on the letterhead jeremy said scoffing i got done in by a watermark a few years ago parker said jeremy lets say came into possession of a packet of letters from john kennedy to marilyn monroe lukas asked jeremys face twisted up those oh those were ridiculous amateurish and who cares about them no these were between kennedy and khrushchev according to the letters kennedy was willing to compromise on cuba what an interesting historical twist that would have been he and khrushchev were going to divvy up the island the russians would have one half the us the other was that true lukas asked jeremy was silent and stared at the robert e lee letter with a faint smile on his face parker said jeremy makes up things which happened to be the delicate way he described lying when he was speaking with the whos he forged the letters was going to sell them for five thousand dollars four thousand eight hundred jeremy corrected thats all lukas was surprised jeremy isnt in this business for the money parker said and you caught him my technique was flawless parker you have to admit that oh it was parker confirmed the craftsmanship was perfect ink handwriting attack starts and lifts phraseology margins unfortunately the government printing office changed the presidential letterhead in august of jeremy got his hands on several of those new sheets and used them for his forgeries too bad the letters were dated may of i had bad intelligence jeremy muttered so parker is it cuffs and chains whatve i done now oh i think you know what youve done jeremy i think you know parker pulled up a chair for lukas and one for himself they both sat oh dear jeremy said oh dear echoed parker finally it was snowing large squares of flakes parachuting to the ground two inches already muting the night edward fielding lugging the burdensome silk bag of money on his back and carrying a silenced pistol in his right hand waded through a belt of trees and brush in bethesda maryland from fbi headquarters hed driven here via two switch wheelsgetaway cars that professional thieves hide along escape routes to trick pursuers hed stayed on major highways the whole way keeping exactly to the speed limit he parked on the other side of this grove of trees and walked the rest of the way the money slowed him down but he certainly wasnt going to leave the cash in the car despite the relative safety in this placid upscale washington suburb he eased through the side yard and paused by a fence separating his rented house from the one next door on the street every car was familiar inside his house no movement or shadows he didnt recognize across the street the lights in all the houses facing his were dark except for the harkins place this was normal fielding had observed that the harkins rarely went to bed before or am he set the knapsack holding the money beside a tree on the property next door to his house and stood upright letting his muscles enjoy the freedom from the heavy load he moved along the fence checking out the ground in the front back and side yards around his house no footprints in the snow there or on the sidewalk in front of the houses fielding picked up the money once again and continued along the walk to his house there were several security devices hed rigged to let him know if thered been any unwanted visitorshomemade tricks rudimentary but effective thread across the gate the front door latch lined up with a tiny fleck of dried paint on the storm door the corner of the rattan mat curled and resting against the door hed learned these from a rightwing web site on the internet about protecting yourself from blacks jews and the federal government despite the snow which would have revealed any intruders he checked them carefully because that was what you did when you committed the perfect crime he unlocked the door thinking of his next steps hed only be here for five or ten minuteslong enough to pack the money into boxes that had contained childrens toys collect his other suitcases then drive via three safe cars already planted along the route to ocean city maryland there hed get on the chartered boat and be in miami in two days then a chartered plane would take him to costa rica and that night hed fly on to brazil then hed he wasnt sure where shed been hiding maybe behind the door maybe in the closet before fielding even had time to feel the shock of adrenaline flooding through his body the pistol had been ripped from his hand and margaret lukas was screaming freeze freeze federal agents fielding found himself not freezing at all but tumbling forward and lying flat on his belly under her strong grip gun in his ear the cash was pulled off him and his hands were cuffed by two large male agents fingers probed through his pockets they pulled him to his feet and pushed him into an armchair cage and several other men and women walked through the front door while yet another agent inventoried the money he had a completely mystified expression on his face she said oh those trip wires and things you do realize we bookmark the same web site as everybody elsethat aryan militia crap but the snow he asked shivering now from the shock there were no footprints howd you get in oh we borrowed a hook and ladder from the bethesda fire department the swat team and i climbed in through your upstairs window just then parker kincaid walked through the front door lukas nodded toward him and explained to fielding the fire truck was his idea fielding didnt doubt that it was parker sat down in a chair opposite fielding and crossed his arms the detectiveparker couldnt help but think of him that way stilllooked older now and diminished parker remembered wishing earlier that the unsub were still alive so that he could see how the mans mind worked one puzzle master to another it seemed hed gotten his wish but now he felt no professional curiosity at all only revulsion puzzles are always easy when you know the answer they become boring too lukas asked him hows it feel to know youre going to be in an eightbyeight cell for the next ten yearsuntil they give you that needle cage explained you wouldnt last very long in general population hope you like your own company i prefer it to most peoples fielding said cage continued as if fielding hadnt spoken theyre also going to want you in boston and white plains and philadelphia too i guess hartford as well fielding lifted a surprised eyebrow parker asked the digger was the patient in your hospital right the hospital for the criminally insane david hughes fielding didnt want to seem impressed but he was thats right funny guy wasnt he he smiled at parker sort of the boogeyman incarnate then parker suddenly understood something else and his heart froze boogeyman in the command post i was talking about my son and not long after that jesus not long after that robby saw somebody in the garage that was the digger you called him you sent him to my house to scare my son fielding shrugged you were too good kincaid i had to get you off the case for a while when you went off to raid my safe housefinding that was very good by the wayi stepped outside to make a call and left a message that my friend should go visit your little fella i thought about killing themwell and you too of coursebut i needed you to be at headquarters around midnight to make my deductions about the site of the last shooting more credible parker lunged forward and drew back his fist lukas caught his arm just before it crashed into fieldings cringing face she whispered i understand but it wont do anybody any good trembling with rage parker lowered his hand stepped to the window watching the snow forced himself to calm he believed if hed been alone with fielding now he could kill the man not because of the host of deaths tonight but because he could still hear the hollow fear in robbys voice daddy daddy lukas touched his arm he looked at her she was holding a notebook she said to parker for what its worth he did the same thing to me she flipped through the pages tapped several entries my house was broken into a few months ago hes the one who did it he took notes about my life fielding said nothing lukas continued speaking directly to the killer you found out all about me you found out about tom tom parker wondered you cut your hair the same way as his you said you were from outside chicago just like him you read his letters to me she closed her eyes and shook her head right as rain you stole his expression and then you told me about having a wife in a coma why so id keep you on the teamwhen everybody elseme includeddidnt want you interfering with the case i needed to get inside your defenses margaret i knew what kind of adversary youd be you stole my past fielding whats the past for but to use he asked evenly but how could you kill so many people lukas asked in a whisper appalled fielding asked he seemed exasperated but why not i mean jesus christ why not why is one death less horrifying than a million either you kill or you dont if you do then death is just a matter of degree and if it makes sense if its efficient then you kill whom you have to kill anyone who doesnt accept that is a naive fool whos the guy in the morgue cage asked his name is gil havel ah the mysterious gilbert jones parker said he rented the helicopter right i had to make you believe that i was really going to try to get away with the money from the drop on gallows road where did you find him in a bar in baltimore who was he havel hes just some loser a bum more or less i promised him a hundred thousand dollars to deliver a note to city hall and help me with the helicopter and rent the safe house i made him think he was my partner parker said and you had him walk back to the metro or bus stop along a particular route where you were waiting with the van to run him down you had to believe that the mastermind was dead so youd bring the money back to the evidence room what about kennedy you sent him to the ritz the mayor fielding asked that was a surprisewhen he called me and a risk but it worked out well he nodded analytically for one thing i had to keep you focused on the ritzcarlton not the ritzy lady and then my penance for the betrayal was bringing you the bone about the diggers name you know you really are something kincaid howd you figure it out parker continued how did i find out you were the unsub because of your handwriting i had a samplewhen i dictated to you from the yellow sheets tobe saved i was worried about that fielding said but i couldnt very well balk when you asked me to take notes could i but i tried to improvisei tried to disguise my writing the dot on your lowercase i gave you away fielding nodded oh thats right the devils teardrop i didnt think about that what did you say that its always the little things not always but usually lukas asked the information about the diggeryou had that all along didnt you you didnt go to the library nope hell thats why i named hughes the digger so youd think he had some ridiculous revenge scheme against the government but he looked around the room howd you get here to this house parker couldnt resist perfection he said and watched the arrogant smile slide off the killers face he continued to escape after the perfect crime youd want the perfect passports youd find the best forger in the business he happens to be a friend of mine well lets just say were close i put him in prison once for a moment fielding was flustered but he didnt know my real name or address no but you called him parker countered not from here fielding said argumentative whiny lukas too wanted part of deconstructing the man from the phone booth up the street she nodded toward the corner we ran the pen register numbers through bell atlantic security then she held up a computer picture of fielding we lifted it from the tape in the fbi headquarters security camera just showed it to a halfdozen people in the neighborhood tonight and got a beeline to your front door shit he closed his eyes the little things parker said theres this saying among forgers that the expression you cant think of everything doesnt count you have to think of everything fielding said i knew you were the strong link parker the biggest risk i shouldve had the digger take care of you right up front cage asked you didnt have any problem sacrificing your friend the digger wouldnt exactly call him a friend fielding added he was a dangerous person to keep alive anyway you mayve guessed this was going to be my last job i didnt need him anymore an agent walked into the doorway okay fielding your rides here they started to lead him off he paused at the doorway turned back admit it parker im good he said churlishly after all i nearly did it parker shook his head either an answer to a puzzles right or its wrong theres no nearly about it but when he was led out of the door fielding was smiling the workmen were lashing the burnt bus to a flatbed the medical examiner had carted off the diggers body in whose hands was fused horribly a scorched black machine gun edward fielding sat in federal detention legs shackled and wrists cuffed as parker said goodnight to cage looking around for margaret lukas he noticed mayor gerald kennedy start toward them hed been here with a skeleton crew of journalists surveying the damage and talking to police and rescue workers he walked up to them your honor cage said i have you to thank for that little news story agent cage implicating me in the screwup at the boat a shrug investigation had priority sir shouldntve showed up at the ritz probably wouldve been better to keep politics out of it kennedy shook his head so i understand youve caught the man behind this we did sir kennedy turned his jowly face to parker and youre agent jefferson your honor first names tom oh youre the one ive been hearing about the document examiner thats right parker said i saw you do some pretty nifty shooting there not nifty enough the mayor nodded ruefully toward the smoking bus the mayor asked say you related to thomas jefferson me parker laughed no no its a common name my aides name is jefferies he said as if making cocktail party conversation then lukas arrived she nodded to the mayor and parker could see the tension in her face as if she were expecting a confrontation but all kennedy said was im sorry about your friend agent ardell lukas said nothing she stared at the scorched bus a reporter called mayor theres a rumor that you chose not to call out the national guard tonight because you thought it would interfere with tourist traffic could you comment on that no i couldnt he too gazed at the bus lukas said tonight didnt turn out very well for anybody did it no agent lukas kennedy said slowly i suspect things like this never do he took his wifes hand and walked to their limousine margaret lukas handed cage some documentsmaybe evidence reports or arrest records then eyes still on the bus she walked to her explorer parker wondered was she leaving without saying goodbye she opened the door started the engine and put the heater onthe temperature had dropped and the sky was overcast with thick clouds which were still shedding fat grains of snow she left the trucks door open leaned back into the seat cage shook parkers hand then muttered what can i say to parkers surprise the agent threw his arms around him hugged him once hard wincing at the pain then started off down the street night lukas cage shouted night parker man my side hurts happy new year everybody happy goddamn new year parker zipped up his jacket and walked toward lukass truck noticing that she was looking at something in her hand parker wasnt sure what it was it seemed to be an old postcard that had been folded up she stared at it she glanced at parker then seemed to hesitate just before he got to the truck she put the card away in her purse she pulled a bottle of beer out of her pocket a sam adams cracked it open with a church key that rested on the dash they sell those in vending machines at headquarters now present from my witness gary moss she offered it to him he took a long sip handed it back lukas remained in the ford but turned sideways facing parker what a night hm what a night he repeated he reached forward and offered his hand she gripped his solidly theyd both removed their gloves and though their hands were red from the cold their flesh was the identical temperature parker felt no cold or heat coming from her skin neither of them let go he enclosed her hand with his left howre the kids she asked what do you call them again the whos whos right have you talked to them theyre fine reluctantly he released his grip was she reluctant too he couldnt tell then he asked youll need a report i assume he remembered all the paperwork us attorneys required to get ready for federal criminal trials mountains of it but parker didnt mind after all documents were his business we will lukas responded but theres no hurry ill do one on monday im finishing a project this weekend document or home improvement you mean home improvement as in tools he laughed oh i dont do that kitchens i know workbenches uhuh no its a possible forgery a letter supposedly written by thomas jefferson a dealer in new york wants it analyzed is it real my gut feeling is yes i have some more tests to run oh here he handed her the pistol lukas in the skirt now was no longer dressed for hiding backup weapons on her ankle she slipped the gun into her glove compartment parkers eyes strayed to her profile again why on earth would you envy me he wondered silently sometimes puzzles answer themselves in their own time and sometimes you just never do find the answer and thats because parker kincaid had come to believe you werent meant to hey you doing anything tomorrow night he asked suddenly want to have a ridiculously suburban dinner she hesitated not moving a muscle not even breathing it seemed he didnt move either just kept a faint smile on his lips the way he waited for the whos to confess about missing cookies or a broken lamp finally she too smiled but he saw that it was fakea smile of stone one that matched her eyes and he knew what her answer would be im sorry she said formally i have plans maybe some other time meaning never parker kincaids handbook for the single parent had a whole chapter on euphemisms sure he said trying to step on the disappointment some other time wheres your car lukas asked ill give you a ride no thats okay its right over there he gripped her hand again and resisted the urge to pull her close night she said he nodded as he walked to his car he looked at her and saw she was waving it was an odd gesture since her face was emotionless and she wasnt smiling but then parker noticed that she wasnt waving at all she was wiping off the condensation on the windows not even looking at him when shed cleaned the glass margaret lukas put the truck in gear and sped into the middle of the street on the way home driving through the quiet snowfilled streets parker stopped at a eleven for black coffee a hamandegg on a croissant and cash from the atm when he walked in the front door of his house he found mrs cavanaugh asleep on the couch he woke her and paid her twice what she asked for then escorted her to the door and stood on the front steps watching her walk over the snow carefully until she disappeared into her own house across the street the children had fallen asleep in his bedhis room sported a tv and vcr the screen was bright blue circumstantial evidence that theyd watched a movie he was afraid to see which video had lulled them to sleephe had a collection of rrated thriller and scifi filmsbut what popped out when he hit eject was only the lion king troubling enoughrobby would forever detest hyenasbut at least it had a noble ending and the violence was largely unseen parker was exhaustedbeyond exhaustion but sleep he felt was still an hour or so away despite his urging her not to mrs cavanaugh had done dishes and cleaned the kitchenso he couldnt work off energy that way instead he bundled up the trash from around the house and carted it out into the backyard lugging the green bags over his shoulder like santa thinking what a crazy lifeto have been pointing a gun at someone an hour ago to have been shot at himself and now to be back in the middle of suburbia lost in these domestic chores as he eased up the lid of the trash bin parker glanced into the backyard he stopped frowned there were footprints in the snow recent footprints only a few minutes old he judgedthe edges were still sharp unsoftened by the falling snow and the wind the intruder had walked up to the guest room window then disappeared toward the front of the house parkers heart began thudding he carefully set the garbage bag down and walked quietly back into the house he closed and locked the kitchen door behind him checked on the front door it was locked because of his document businessthe value of the specimens and the risk of pollution and dust in the airthe windows in the house were sealed and couldnt be opened he didnt need to check them but whose footprints just kids maybe or mr johnson looking for his dog thats all it was sure but ten seconds later he was on the phone to the federal detention facility in washington dc he identified himself as fbi special agent parker kincaid a statement only a few years untrue i was working on that case tonight with margaret lukas sure the metshoot right im being a little paranoid here parker said but the suspectedward fielding hes not out on bail is he bail no way he wont be arraigned until monday hes locked down yep i can see him on the monitor he asleep no just sitting on his bed been behaving himself talked to his lawyerthat was about an hour agothen went into his cell ands been there ever since why just spooked i guess thought i saw the boogeyman boogeyman ha hey happy new year parker hung up relieved for about five seconds talking to his lawyer parker didnt know any lawyer in the country whod be up at this hour on a holiday talking to a client who wouldnt be arraigned for two days then he thought perfection oh jesus he muttered fieldingthe man who had a plan for everything he must have had a plan for escaping if he was caught he lifted the receiver and hit the first digit of the line went dead motion outside the kitchen door he looked up standing on the back porch gazing at him through the window in the door was a man he was pale wearing a dark coat black or blue there was blood on his left arm but not a lot of blood burns on his face but they werent serious the man lifted his silenced machine gun and tapped the trigger as parker leapt aside crashing into the wall and falling to the floor the doorknob and lock of the back door blew apart under the stream of bullets glass splinters exploded into the room leisurely the digger pushed the door open and stepped inside like a friendly neighbor invited over for coffee the diggers cold the digger wants to get this over with and leave hed rather be outside he likes the click the the the snow he likes the snow oh look a nice christmas wreath and a nice christmas tree in parker kincaids comfy house tye would like this funny no puppies no ribbons here but a nice wreath and a nice tree he fires again as kincaid runs through the doorway did he hit him the digger cant tell but no guess not he sees kincaid crawling into another room shutting out lights rolling on the floor doing things like that the digger believes hes happy the man who tells him things called again an hour ago not a message from the voicemail lady who sounds like ruth but a real call on his cell phone he told the digger that the night wasnt over yet even though the digger had gone to the black wall and done what he was supposed to do not click not over yet listen to me said the man who tells him things and so the digger listened he was supposed to kill three more people someone named cage and someone named lukas and parker kincaid kill him first okay hmmm okay the digger knows kincaid he came to his house earlier tonight kincaid has a little boy like tye except the digger doesnt like kincaids little boy because kincaid wants to make the digger go back to the lousy hospital in connecticut kincaid wants to take him away from tye then at fourthirty am said the man who tells him things i want you to come to the federal detention center on third street ill be in the clinic its on the first floor in the back ill be pretending im sick kill everyone you see and let me out okay walking into the dining room the digger sees kincaid roll out from beneath the table and run into the hallway he fires another stream of bullets kincaids face looks like ruths face when he was about to put the glass in her neck and like pamelas when he put the knife in her chest below the gold cross heres your christmas present i love you love you all the more kincaid disappears into another part of the house but he wont leave the digger knows the children are here a father wont run out on his children the digger knows this because he wouldnt leave tye kincaid wont leave the little blond boy and the darkhaired girl if parker kincaid lives the digger will never get to california out west he steps into the living room holding the gun in front of him parker rolled away from the digger rolled along the floor elbows scraped head throbbing from where he hit the edge of the kitchen table diving away from the bullets the whos he thought in despair scrabbling toward the stairs he wouldnt let the digger upstairs hed die with a death grip on the mans neck if he had to but he would save the children but another burst of shots he turned from the stairs and dove into the living room a weapon what could he use but there were none he couldnt get into the kitchen and grab a knife he couldnt get into the garage for the ax why the hell had he given back lukass gun then he saw somethingone of robbys christmas presents the baseball bat he snagged it gripped the taped handle and crawled back toward the stairs where is he where then steps faint the crunch of the digger walking over broken glass and pottery but parker couldnt tell where he was the hallway the dining room the firstfloor den what should he do if he shouted for the children to leap out the window theyd just come to see what he wanted he had to get upstairs himself grab them and jump hed try to cushion the fall as best he could the snow would help and he could aim for the juniper bushes footsteps very close crunch a pause another crunch parker looked up no the digger was at the foot of the stairs about to climb them looking up no expression on his face hes profileproof parker couldnt run at him hed be in full view and would die before he got three steps toward the man so he flung the bat into the dining room it crashed into the china cabinet the digger stopped hearing the noise he turned stiffly and walked toward it like the alien monster in the old horror film the thing when he was nearly to the arched doorway parker climbed out from behind the couch and charged him he was six feet away from his prey when he stepped on one of robbys toys it shattered with a loud crunch the digger spun around just as parker rammed into him knocking him to his knees he landed a fist on the killers jaw the blow was hard but the digger dodged away and parker under the momentum of the swing fell onto his side he collapsed on the floor tried for the diggers gun but the man was too fast for him and grabbed the weapon then struggled to his feet parker could do nothing but retreat into the narrow space behind the couch his face dripping sweat hands trembling he huddled here nowhere else to go the digger backed up orienting himself parker saw something sharp on the floor in front of him glistening a long shard of glass he grabbed it the killer squinted looking around he located parker who gazed up into the mans dim eyes parker thoughtno margaret lukass eyes arent dead at all theres a million times more life in them than in this creatures the killer moved closer coming around the back of the couch parker tensed then he looked past the manat the christmas tree he remembered the three of them he and the whos opening presents on christmas morning its a good thought to die with he decided but if he was going to die hed make sure the children didnt he gripped the long splinter of glass wrapped his shirt cuff around the lower half hed slash the mans jugular vein and pray that hed bleed to death before he got up the stairs where the children were sleeping not daring to think about the sight the whos would see in the morning he tucked his legs under him gripped his impromptu knife it would be all right theyd survive that was all that mattered he got ready to leap the digger walked around the couch and started to lift the gun parker tensed then the stunning crack of the single unsilenced gunshot the digger shuddered the machine gun fell from his hands his eyes focused past parker then his head dropped and he sank to the floor he fell forward a bullet hole in the back of his skull parker grabbed the uzi and pulled it toward him looking around what he wondered frantically what had happened then he saw someone in the doorway a boy how could that be he was a young boy black he was holding a pistol he walked forward slowly staring at the corpse like a cop in a movie he kept the large gun pointed at the diggers back he needed both hands to hold it and struggled with the guns weight he kill mah daddy the boy said to parker not looking at him i seen him do it give me the gun parker whispered the boy continued to stare at the digger tears were running down his cheeks he kill mah daddy he brought me here brought me in a car let me have the gun whats your name i seen him do it he do it right in fronta me i been waiting tcap his ass found this piece in his car treyfiveseven its okay parker said whats your name he dead shit parker eased forward but the boy pointed the gun toward him threateningly parker froze and backed off just put that down would you do that please the boy ignored him his wary eyes scanned the room they stopped momentarily on the christmas tree then returned to the digger he kill mah daddy why he do that parker slowly rose once more hands up palms out dont worry im not going to hurt you he glanced upstairs but the shot had apparently not wakened the whos im just going over there for a minute he nodded to the tree he skirted the boyand the bloodstain surrounding the diggers headand walked to the christmas tree he bent down and picked up something and returned knelt parker held his empty right hand out to the boy palm up then with his left he offered him robbys star wars millennium falcon spaceship ill trade you the boy studied the plastic toy the gun drooped he was much shorter than robby and must have weighed only sixty or seventy pounds but his eyes were twenty years older than parkers sons let me have the gun please he studied the toy man he said reverently then he handed parker the pistol and took the toy parker said wait here ill be right back do you want something to eat are you hungry the boy didnt answer parker picked up the machine gun and carried it and the pistol upstairs he put the guns on the top shelf of the closet and locked the door motion beside him robby was coming down the corridor daddy hey young man parker struggled to keep his voice from trembling i had a dream i heard a gun im scared parker intercepted him before he got to the stairs put his arm around him and directed him back to the bedroom it was probably just fireworks can we get firecrackers next year the boy asked sleepily well see he heard footsteps outside slapping on the street in front of the house glanced outside he saw the boy running across the front lawn clutching the spaceship he vanished up the street headed for where parker wondered the district west virginia he couldnt spare a moments thought for the boy his own son took all his attention parker put robby in bed beside his sister he needed to find his cell phone and call but the boy wouldnt let go of his fathers hand was it a bad dream parker asked i dont know i just heard this noise parker lay down next to him he glanced at the clock it was joan would be here at with her social worker jesus what a nightmare this was there were a dozen bullet holes in the walls furniture was damaged the breakfront shattered the back door was destroyed and in the middle of the carpet was a bloody corpse daddy stephie said mumbling in her sleepy voice its okay honey i heard a firecracker petey whelan had firecrackers his mother told him he couldnt have any but he did i saw them thats not our business go back to sleep honey parker lay back closed his eyes felt her slight weight on his chest thinking about the bullet holes the bullet casings the shattered furniture the body he imagined joans testimony in court what could he do what excuse could he come up with what a moment later parker kincaid was breathing deeply content in the sleep of a parent whose children were close in his arms and there is no sleep better than that when he opened his eyes it was five minutes to ten in the morning parker had been awakened by the sound of a car door slamming and joans voice saying were a few minutes early but im sure he wont mind watch your stephe knew we were coming and he didnt bother to shovel the walk typical typical he rolled from the bed nauseous head throbbing he looked out the window joan was walking toward the house richard was with her bringing up the rear sullen he didnt want to be here and another woman toothe social worker short clattering along on stocky heels looking at the house appraisingly they walked to the front door the bell rang hopeless he stood in the upstairs hallway toes curling on the carpet well just dont let her in he told himself hed stonewall make her get a court order that would buy a couple of hours parker paused looked at his sleeping children he wanted to grab them and escape out the back door drive away to west virginia but that would never work he knew the bell rang again what can i do how can i stall but joan would still know something was wrong stalling would make the paranoid woman even more suspicious and what would two or three hours buy him he took a deep breath and started down the stairs what could he possibly say about the bullet holes in the walls the blood maybe he could parker stopped at the landing stunned a thin blond woman in a long black skirt and white blouse her back to parker was opening the door which was surprising enough but what truly shocked him was the condition of the house immaculate not a piece of broken porcelain or glass anywhere not a bullet hole in any of the walls theyd been plastered and primed buckets of paint sat in the corner of the living room on white tarps the chair that had been peppered with bullets last night had been replaced by a similar one there was a new breakfront and the diggers corpsegone on the spot where hed died was a new oriental carpet with joan richard and the social worker standing in the doorway the woman in the dark skirt turned oh parker said margaret lukas yes he answered after a moment she smiled in a curious way he tried again morning how was your nap she asked then prompted good yes he said it was good lukas turned back and nodded to the visitors she said to joan you must be parkers wife exwife joan said stepping inside the social workera pudgy brunetteentered next followed by handsome and impeccably slow witted richard parker continued down the stairs and couldnt resist touching a wall where he knew hed seen a cluster of bullets strike last night the plasterboard was smooth as stephies cheek he had a terrible pain in his shoulder and head from where hed dived to the floor last night as the digger came through the kitchen door but if not for that hed have thought the entire attack was a dream he realized that joan was staring at him with a putout smile on her face i said hello parker morning joan he said hello richard parker walked into the middle of the living room and kissed joans cheek shook her husbands hand richard carried a shopping bag of stuffed animals joan didnt introduce parker to the social worker but the woman stepped forward she shook his hand she may or may not have given her name parker was too dumbfounded to notice joan looked at lukas i dont think weve met youre jackie lukas im a friend of parkers jackie parker lifted an eyebrow the agent noticed but said nothing about the name joan glanced at lukass trim figure with a neutral look then her eyesthe color so reminiscent of robbys the cynical expression so differenttook in the living room did you what did you do redecorate or something i didnt notice it last night i had some free time thought id fix things up a little his ex studied him you look awful parker didnt you sleep well lukas laughed joan glanced at her parker invites me over for breakfast lukas explained offering the two women a look of female conspiracy then he goes upstairs to wake up the children and whats he do but fall back asleep joans grunt repeated what shed said earlier typical where was the blood thered been a lot of blood lukas asked the guests you want some coffee a sweet roll parker made them himself ill have some coffee the social worker said and maybe ill have half a roll theyre small lukas said have a whole one maybe i just will lukas disappeared into the kitchen and came back a moment later with a tray she said parkers quite the cook i know joan answered unimpressed with her exhusbands talents lukas handed out coffee cups and asked parker what time did you get back from the hospital last night uhm the hospital were the children sick she asked this with melodramatic concern glancing at the social worker he was visiting a friend lukas responded i dont know what time parker said it was late the answer was largely a question lukas was the writer of this scene and he felt he should defer to her script what friend joan demanded harold cage lukas said hell be all right just a broken rib isnt that what they said broken rib slipped and fell right lukas continued her awardwinning performance right parker recited slipped and fell he sipped the coffee that lukas had put in his hand the social worker ate a second sweet roll say could i get the recipe for these sure parker said joan kept a benign smile on her face she walked around the living room examining the place looks all different as she passed her exhusband she whispered so parker sleeping with skinny little jackie are we no joan were just friends ah ill get some more coffee lukas said ill help you parker said in the kitchen he swung the door closed and turned to lukas he whispered how how on earth she laughedundoubtedly at the expression on his face you called detention last night said you were spooked night watch called me i tried to call you bell atlantic said your lined been cut fairfax county swat got here around threethirty on a silent rollin and found a dead body downstairs and you in bed taking a nap who was the shooter who got the digger wasnt you right some kid he said the digger killed his father the digger brought him here with him dont ask me why the boy just took off now answer one for mewho was the body on the bus the bus driver we figure the digger kept him alive and then made him run for the exit in the back then digger shot him then the gas tank and when the fire started he climbed out one of the windows used the smoke for cover got away through the traffic jam smarter than he seemed but parker shook his head no it was fielding he told the digger to do that he wasnt going to sacrifice his boy at all this wasnt going to be their last job they probably had years of this ahead of them but the house parker waved his arms how that was cage he made a few calls the miracle worker i dont know what to say we got you into this mess its the least we could do parker wouldnt argue with that wait what did you call yourself jackie she hesitated nickname she said its what my family calls me i dont use it much there were footsteps on the stairs soft thuds as the children came down to the living room parker and lukas could hear the voices through the kitchen door mommy hey hello both of you joan said here here this is for you rustling of paper do you like them joan asked do you stephies dubious voice said oh its barney robby laughed out loud then he groaned and big bird parker shook his head at his exwifes incompetence and gave lukas a smile but she didnt notice her head was turned toward the living room drawn hypnotically toward the sound of the childrens voices after a moment she looked out the window and stared at the falling snow finally she said so thats your wife you two dont seem much alike parker laughed what lukas really meant was how the hell did you end up with her a legitimate question and one hed be happy to answer but doing so would require a lot more time than they had right at the moment and would also have to be part of a complicated ritual involving her sharing at least some of the answers to the puzzle of margaretor jackielukas and what a puzzle she was parker looked her overthe makeup the jewelry the softness of the white silk blouse the delicate lace of the lingerie beneath it and she was wearing perfume today not just fragrant soap what did it remind him of he couldnt tell she glanced at his perusing eyes caught once again he didnt care parker said you dont look like an fbi agent undercover lukas said finally laughing i used to be really good at it i played a mafia hit mans wife once italian with that hair i had miss clairol for backup neither said anything for a moment ill stay until she leaves thought a hint of a domestic life might help you out with the social worker its above and beyond the call he said she gave a shrug worthy of cage look he said i know you said you had plans but the whos and i were going to do some yard work in the snow right cut down some bushes in the backyard then we were going sledding what it is we dont get much snow here he stopped speaking ending declarative sentences with interrogatory inflection and he actually began a sentence with what it is the forensic linguist within him was not pleased nervous are we he continued i dont know if youd be interested but he stopped once again is that an invitation lukas asked uhm yes it is those plans i had she said i was going to clean up my house and finish sewing a blouse for a friends daughter is that an acceptance a tentative smile i guess it is silence for a moment say hows the coffee i dont make it very often usually i just go to starbucks good he answered she was facing the window but her eyes moved once more toward the door she was listening to the sound of the children she turned back to parker oh ive figured it out what the puzzle puzzle how many hawks were left on the roof this morning sitting here i figured it out okay go ahead its a trick question theres more than one answer thats good parker said but that doesnt mean its a trick question it just means youre thinking the right wayyouve realized that a legitimate answer is that there are several possible solutions its the first thing that puzzle masters learn see she continued you tend to think that all the facts you need are given in the puzzle but there are some that arent stated absolutely right he nodded and those facts have to do with the nature of hawks ah parker said and what does a hawks nature have to do with the puzzle because she said pointing a finger at him and revealing a sliver of girlishness he hadnt seen before hawks might be scared off by a gunshot but they might not becauserememberthey were far apart on the roof that was a clue right right keep going okay the farmer shoots one bird off the roof but we dont know what the other two do they both might stay so then the answerd be therere two left or one might fly off and thatd leave one or both might fly off whichd leave none so thosere the three answers well parker responded you were right to consider implied facts she frowned what does that mean am i right or not youre wrong but lukas protested i have to be right no you dont he laughed well im at least partly right arent i theres no such thing as partly right when it comes to puzzles you want to know the answer a hesitation no thatd be cheating im going to keep working on it it was a good moment to kiss her and he did briefly then as lukas poured more coffee parker returned to the living room to hug his children and tell them good morning on the first day of the year authors note in trying to solve parkers puzzle jackie lukass mistake was in making an assumption that the hawk the farmer shot would fall off the roof it might not have the question didnt ask how many living hawks were left on the roof just how many hawks so the answer is this three hawks would remain if the dead hawk didnt fall off and the other two dont fly away two hawks if the dead hawk didnt fall off and one flies away or if the dead hawk does fall off and the other two stay one hawk if the dead hawk falls and one of the others flies away or if the dead hawk doesnt fall and the others fly away no hawks if the dead hawk falls off the roof and the others fly
