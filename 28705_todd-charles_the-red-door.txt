charles todd the red door chapter november hobson lancashire she stood in front of the cheval glass the long mirror that peter had given her on their second anniversary and considered herself her hair had faded from shimmering english fair to almost the color of straw and her face was lined from working in the vegetable beds throughout the war though shed worn a hat and gloves her skin once like silkhed always told her thatwas showing faint lines and her eyes though still very blue stared back at her from some other womans old face four yearshave i really aged that much in four years she asked her image with a sigh she accepted the fact that she wouldnt see fortyfour again but hed have aged too probably more than she hadwar was no seaside picnic on a summers afternoon that thought failed to cheer her she wanted to see joy and surprise in his face when he came home at last the war was finally overthe eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month yesterday it wouldnt be long now before he came striding over the hill and up the lane surely they would send the men in france home quickly it had been four long lonely unbearable years even the army couldnt expect families to wait beyond a monthsix weeks it wasnt as if the allies must occupy germany this was after all an armistice not a surrender the germans would be as eager to go home as the british peter was some years younger than she for heavens sakethough shed never confessed to that lying cheerfully about her age from the start a man in his midthirties had no business going to fight in france but of course he was a career soldier fighting was what he did in all the distant corners of the empire france was nearly next door it would require only a channel crossing and hed be in dover she had never gone with him to his various postingsafrica china indiato godforsaken towns whose names she could hardly remember and so hed bought her a map and hung it in the sitting room where she could see it every day with a pin in each place hed stayed it had brought him nearer one year he had nearly died of malaria and couldnt come home on leave that was the awful winter when timmy died and she had been there alone to do what had to be done she had expected to lose peter as well sure that god was angry with her but peter had survived and the loneliness had been worse than before because there was no one in the cottage to talk to except for jake hed sent her small gifts from time to time a sandalwood fan from hong kong silk shawls from benares and cashmere ones from kashmir a lovely woolen one from new zealand soft and warm as a welsh blanket lacey pillow slips from goa a painted bowl from madeira its flowers rampant in the loveliest colors thoughtful gifts including that small but perfect ruby set in a gold ring hed brought back from burma she had asked on his next leave after timmys death to go with him to his next posting but he had held her close and told her that white women didnt survive in the african heat and hed resign his commission before hed lose her she had loved him for that though she would have taken her chances if hed asked she had kept back a new dress to wear for his homecoming and each day now she must wash her hair in good soap rinsing it in hardtocomeby lemon juice she had also saved for the occasion she could see too that she needed a little rouge only a very little so he wouldnt notice the new lines thinking instead how well she looked shed reread all his letters until they were as worn as her hands and knew by heart every one of them they lay in a rosewood box by her favorite chair where she could touch them and feel his presence it occurred to her that she ought to do somethingsomething so special that hed always remember the day he came through the door and found her waiting something that would take his mind off her and the changes he was sure to see first thing another thought struck her his letters had been fewer and the weeks between them longer in the past two years and there had only been one this year was he concealing something she had dreaded word that he was dead even though hed spent most of the war safely behind the lines at hq but men were wounded every day still if anything terrible had happened to him he would surely have told heror asked the sister in charge of his ward to write to her if he couldnt he would never keep a secret from her never they had always been close and truthful with each other about the smallest thing well of course not about the difference in their ages hed always lived a charmed lifehed told her about the tiger hunt that went badly wrong and the african warthog that had nearly got him and the storm that had all but wrecked their troop ship in the middle of the atlantic the volcanic eruption in java when he was trying to bring the natives to safety but even charms ran out after a while didnt they his last letter had been written in early summer telling her how enthusiastic the british were to have the americans come into the fighting after long weeks of training hed told her that hed soon be busy mopping up the hun cant last much longer now the yanks are here so dear heart dont worry ive made it this far and ill make it home youll see but what if she put the thought out of her mind even before it could frame itself if anything had happened surely someone would have come to tell her instead she tried to think what she could dowhat would cry welcome and love and hope and show her gratitude for his safe return at last she gazed around the small bedroom at the curtains she kept starched and crisp at the floral pattern of the carpet and the matching rose coverlet on the bed no not here leave their room as he remembered it she went down the stairs walking through each room with new eyes trying to see it as peter might there was neither the time nor the money to buy new things and besides how many times had peter told her he liked to find himself in familiar surroundings because they offered him safety and the sure sense that he was home desperate she went out to the gate to see if she could fasten something there a banner or ribbons not flags flags had taken him off to war and not flowersthere were none to be had at this time of year she turned to look at the house neat and white and holding all her happiness except for timmy she wouldnt change it for the world and then all at once she knew what she must do it stared back at her with such force she wondered she hadnt thought about it before the next morning she walked down to the village and bought a tin of paint and carried it home jubilantly that afternoon as the sun came out from behind the clouds and the light breeze felt like early autumn again she painted the faded gray front door a vibrant and glorious red chapter essex late may there were japanese lanterns strung high across the lawn the paper ribbons tied between them lifting and fluttering with the evening breeze the lanterns hadnt been necessary in the lingering dusk of a springs night but as the hour neared eleven they came into their own sparkling in the stream that ran by the foot of the lawns adding a fairytale look to the facade of the old house and gleaming in the windowpanes red gold and blue most of the guests had gone home finally leaving behind the usual detritus of a party the plates had been stacked at the ends of the three tables for dora to collect tomorrow and a pile of table linen like a miniature iceberg stood out in the green sea of the grass i ought to move that walter teller thought before the damp comes and ruins the lot but he stood where he was looking toward the house his back to the darkness beyond the stream a penny for your thoughts his brother said walter had forgot that he was there peter had taken two of the chairs and brought them together so that he could rest his bad leg sitting quietly as he often did when he was in grievous pain turning walter said sorry you were miles away peter commented lightly tapping his chairs leg with his cane birthdays remind me that im a year older walter lied any of that whisky left my leg is being attacked by angry devils yes i think so he went to the drinks table found a clean glass and poured a measure of whisky into it thanks peter downed half of it in one swallow you ought to be careful of that walter said keeping his voice level without judgment so they tell me which is why i wait until im going up to bed it helps me sleep he shifted his leg searching for comfort i should have gone back to london tonight with edwin but i couldnt face bouncing about in the motorcar for hours on end cowardly of me wasnt it he added wryly why this is where the four of us grew up you edwin leticia myself it will always be home but it was in fact edwins house the eldest sons inheritance he himself lived here because edwin preferred london it had been a thorn in his side for ten years this kindness but jenny loved witch hazel farm and so he had said nothing it was a small sacrifice to make for her sake jenny and i are going up to london tomorrow he went on you and susannah can come with us or stay on here for a few days walter considered his brother the damaged leg was beyond repair and there was no doubt his pain was real still of late there were times when he had the feeling that peters nightly whisky dulled more than the ache of torn muscle and smashed nerves alls well between you and susannah he asked lightly yes of course it is peter answered testily why shouldnt it be no idea old man except that she was a little quiet this weekend peter shifted under walters gaze weve been talking about adopting a child she has its complicated walter looked away i didnt intend to pry no changing the subject he said is harry looking forward to school he doesnt say much about it i expect he is he knows his mother is against it for her sake he doesnt dwell on it jennys a marvelous mother edwin was saying as much the other day peter hesitated harrys only just seven you know i dont see why you cant wait a year walter turned on him suddenly angry in the light of the blue lantern above his head his expression was almost baleful its what father wanted harrys the only heir its whats been arranged since the day he was born you know that as well as i do peter said gently father has been dead these six years why are we still under his thumb when walter didnt answer he went on he got it all wrong you know the eldest son to the landthats edwin and hes no farmer the next son to the armythats me and i hated it the next son to the church thats you and you lasted barely a year in your first living i think truth be told that you found you werent cut out to convert the heathen savage either it was too close to the mark only that morning walter had received a letter from the alcock missionary society wanting to know when he would be ready to return to the field that and harry had haunted him all day jenny called from the house saving walter from having to answer his brother yes coming he replied and then to his brother he said ill just put these candles out why dont you go on up to bed you arent going to find any peace until you do peter reached for his cane and struggled to his feet walter caught one of the chairs hed been using as it almost tipped over peter swore at his own clumsiness leaning heavily on his cane he made his way across the lawn toward the house and halfway there he turned and said to his brother things will look better tomorrow walter nodded then set about reaching into the colorful paper cages and pinching out the flame of each candle as he came to the last of them he stopped it was too bad he thought that life couldnt be snuffed out as easily as a candle flame could a man will himself to die hed seen it happen more than once in west africa but never really believed in it now he wished he could his sister leticia would call that arrant nonsense after all he didnt suffer in the same way that his brothers did not physical pain he could have borne that it was not knowing what to do that haunted him chapter london late may before leaving the next morning to give evidence in a court case in sheffield ian rutledge had taken his sister frances to dine at a new and popular restaurant there they encountered friends just arriving as well and on the point of being shown to a table they were invited to join the other party and as new arrangements were made rutledge made certain that his own chair remained at what had become the head of a larger table his claustrophobia after being buried alive when a shell blew up his salient in had never faded even four years later he couldnt abide a crowded room or train and something as ordinary as a chair in a corner with otherseven good friendsbetween him and the door could leave him shaken frances unaware of her brothers irrational fear was already enjoying herself and he watched her flirt with maryanne brownings cousin an attractive man named geoffrey blake she had met him before and as they caught up on events and old friends rutledge heard someone mention meredith channing he himself had called on mrs channing not ten days earlier to thank her for a recent kindness only to find that she was away now blake was saying shes in wales i think and barbara westin turned to him surprised wales id understood she was on her way to norfolk someone at the other end of the table put in was it norfolk frances said i dont think ive seen her in a fortnight longer doesnt she visit her brotherinlaw around this time of year ellen tyler asked brotherinlaw rutledge repeated yes he lives in the north i believe ellen replied he went back to inverness at the end of the war apparently he was sufficiently recovered to travel a back injury alfred westin put in his ship was blown up and he held on to a lifeboat for two days before they were picked up a brave man and a stubborn one he was in hospital for seven months but hes walking again i heard albeit with canes now he was here in the spring for the memorial concert rutledge remembered in early spring hed spotted meredith channing trying to hail a cab just as a rainstorm broke and hed stopped to offer her a lift she had said something about a concert st martininthefields im surprised she hasnt married him ellen tyler went on her brotherinlaw i mean hes been in love with her for ages speaking of love have you seen the announcement of constance turners engagement in the times i am so pleased for her she deserves a little happiness barbara smiled but wouldnt you knowanother flier rutledge had known constance turners husband medford turner had died of severe burns in early after crashing at the front hed been pulled from his aircraft by a french artillery company that had risked intense flames to get to him rutledge and his men had watched that dogfight before both planes had disappeared down the line he hadnt known it was turner at the time only that the english pilot had shown amazing skill their orders were given to the waiter and the conversation moved on hamish ever present at the back of his mind said to rutledge now inverness is a verra long way the voice was deep scots and inaudible to the other dinersa vestige of shell shock guilt and nightmares that had begun during the fierce battle of the somme in july in the clinic dr fleming had called that voice the price of survival but for rutledge it had been a torment nearly beyond enduring inverness might as well be on the other side of the world rutledge had made it a point since the war to avoid going into scotland and hamish knew why even his one foray there on official business had not ended well in truth hed nearly died taking hamish into the darkness with him at that same moment frances turned to her brother with a question and he had to bring his attention back to the present but after hed dropped her at the house that had belonged to their parents and driven on to his flat he couldnt shut the words out of his mind doesnt she visit her brotherinlaw around this time of year im surprised she hasnt married him hes been in love with her for ages meredith channing had never spokento himof her family or her past and he had been careful not to ask questions of others that might draw attention to either his ignorance or his interest she was reserved a poise almost unnatural in one so young rutledge suspected it had been the result of what she had seen and done in the war nor would she have cared to be discussed as she was tonight hamish said she refuses to let hersel feel anything was that it something must have hurt her very badly or someone the loss of her husband im surprised she hasnt married him hes been in love with her for ages chapter when the weekend was over walter teller had dropped peter and his wife susannah at their house in bolingbroke street and driven on to call on his banker he conducted his business there arranging for his sons school fees to be paid as they came due and strode purposefully out the door of the bank and back to his motorcar his thoughts moving ahead to the rest of the days errands those accomplished he had only just reached the outskirts of london on his way home when his body failed him sweating profusely he fought to see the road ahead through what seemed to be narrowing vision and his limbs felt like lead moving slowly clumsily what the hell is wrong hed never felt this way before am i dying he started to pull to the side of the road out of the light traffic and then thought better of it if im to die id rather die at home not here not in the middle of the street ive survived everything elsemalaria dysentery parasites i can make it to essex he drove with utmost concentration his hands clenched on the wheel forcing muscles that had no will of their own to respond to his counting the miles now why wasnt jenny here as she ought to be she should be driving damn it but there had been words last night over harry leaving for school she had been unapproachable this morning and hed known better than to press for her to come to london with him there was the sign for repton the farm was beyond the next turning i havent died he told himself his voice overly loud in his ears ive come this far but he couldnt have said how he got here from london harry it isnt you its harry something has happened to harry the motorcar turned into the drive seemingly of its own accord and as he came into sight of the house he blew the horn over and over again jenny he shouted jenny for gods sake come and help me it was all he could do to pull on the brake and stop in the circle before the house his hands refused to open the door his feet refused to lift from the pedals fear held him in a vise and he could do nothing for harry he couldnt even save his son his wife came running from the house walter whats the matter whats happened jenny cried taking in his pale sweating face and shaking hands somethings happened to harry hes in monmouthshire visiting the montleighs i knowi know call them pray god it isnt too late tell them well be there as soon as possible but how was he to drive to monmouthshire hed find a way she ran back into the house and he sat there fists clenched eyes shut his mind straining to hear the conversation that was going on inside the house he felt he would stop breathing before jenny could bring him the answer there she wasrunning toward him he scanned her face harrys all right walter hes just fine mollie the housekeeper was on her heels wiping her hands in her apron ive called dr fielding hes on his way can you come inside walterwhats wrong exhausted he sat there not moving he could die now it was all right if that was demanded of him hed understand chapter london early june after several days of giving evidence in the case in sheffield ian rutledge had returned to the yard to find superintendent bowles suffering from dyspepsia and a headache glowering at rutledge bowles had snapped youre late there was a heavy storm in the north trees down in fact and part of the road washed away if you took the train like the rest of us youd have been on time as it happens the train was late as well and how would you know that when i came in just now i overheard sergeant gibson telling someone there had been problems with tracks in the north as well as the road what was the outcome in sheffield well dont keep me waiting bowles snapped the jury was not long in convicting tuttle will spend the rest of his life in prison i thought the crown hoped hed hang the jury was not for it damned county jurors it was a hanging case if ever there was one it would have been in london rutledge made no answer hed agreed with the jury it had been as the french would say a crime of passion an overwhelming grief that had ended in the death of tuttles ill wife whether by design or by accident only god knew for tuttle hanging would have in many ways been a travesty bowles took out his watch and opened the case looking at the time just as well youre back im informed theres trouble in brixton and were shorthanded at the moment clarke is in wales and ive just sent mickelson to hampshire he waited for rutledge to raise any objection satisfied that none was forthcoming he went on four barrow boys in a brawl with a handful of irishmen but it has to be sorted out two are in hospital and one could be dead by morning and hes the brotherinlaw of the constable who broke it up therell be hard feelings and no end of trouble if the man dies and so rutledge had taken himself off to brixton only to learn the fight had occurred because the men involved were out of work gambling in an alley behind the queens head and were far too gone in drink to do more than bloody one another when one side had accused the other of cheating the man said to be on the verge of death by his hysterical wife was nothing of the sort merely unconscious and expected to recover his senses momentarily and the irishmen were as sheepish as their english counterparts a night in gaol would sober them sufficiently to be sent home by the desk sergeant with a flea in their ear and they had already informed rutledge during his interview with them that they were the best of friends despite a small misunderstanding over the dice they swore on their mothers graves that it wouldnt happen again rutledge pointed out that one of their number was still in hospital and that more serious charges would be brought if he suffered any lasting harm properly chastened the irishmen promised to say an ave for his swift recovery the englishmen were all for assuming the cost of his care after speaking to the desk sergeant suggesting that the offenders be held for another twentyfour hours until the doctors were satisfied that the injured man would make a full recovery rutledge left the station he had a strong suspicion that bowles had sent him to brixton out of pure spite and that feeling was confirmed by sergeant daviss commiserating grin when rutledge finally walked back into the yard wild geese are the order of the day sir chasing them that is inspector mann is in canterbury on much the same errand and chief inspector ellis is on his way to chichester idle hands and all that its been a week of quiet you see that rubs the old bowels on the raw free to leave at last rutledge was too tired to go home and too angry to rest once he got there instead late as it was he had taken to the streets trying to walk off his own mood and finding himself beset by hamish at every turn he watched the last of the summer light fade from opal to rose to lavender and thence to darkness as the stars popped out above the blackness of the river the streets around him emptied of pedestrians and wheeled traffic alike until his footsteps on the pavement echoed in his head and kept him company it occurred to him at some point that today had been the anniversary of his return to the yard a year ago it had been a long and difficult twelve months finding himself at the foot of westminster bridge he went along the parapet and leaned on an elbow watching the dark water swirl far below mesmerized by the motion as it surged and fought its way through the arches that struggled to hold it back lost in thought he came to the conclusion that the past year was in some fashion comparable to the battle he was watching between river and stone the implacable stone was the past anchored forever amid the torrent of his days redirecting obstructing thwarting and frustrating him at every turn hamish said ye canna resign ye ken before a fortnight was out yed be back in yon clinic sunk in useless despair and that was the truth of it he wouldnt be able to live with his own failure or with the voice that was in his head hamish lay dead in a french grave there was no disputing that nor did ghosts walk but putting that voice to rest was beyond him working had been rutledges only salvation and he knew without it the only escape would be drinking himself into oblivion hamishs victory then his own lay in the bottom of his trunk the loaded service revolver that was more to his liking swift certain without disgrace hed learned in france that a good soldier always left himself a sure line of retreat without conscious awareness rutledge had registered the footsteps passing behind hima man on crutches a woman hurrying in shoes too tight for her tired feet a dog trotting purposefully back to his side of the bridge but he had missed the soft footfalls of someone creeping toward him half hidden by the dark jutting islands of the lamps hamish said sharply hark and rutledge was on the point of turning when something sharp dug into the flesh of his back a muffled voice said your money any other valuables be quick if you want to live rutledge could have laughed instead he said quietly i wont give you my watch it was my fathers but you can have whatever money you may find in my pockets the point of the knife dug deeper and he could feel it pulling at his shirt the man said a nervous anxiety in his voice ive told you and nerves could lead to a killing rutledge didnt respond for a moment then without changing his tone he said i saw a constable on the far side of the bridge hell be here soon youre lying he turned the other way hamish said ware hes verra young that too could be unpredictable and deadly rutledge said you dont want to commit a murder take the money ive offered left pocket i wont stop you whats your name ill kill you see if i dont he pushed hard on the knife piercing the skin and rutledge could feel a trickle of blood slowly making its way down his back it makes no difference to me if you do i was in the war my lad and im not afraid of dying but i wont give you my watch ill throw it in the river first you must take my word on that he could smell the fear on the man behind him and listened for sounds of traffic turning into the bridge road what are you called there was a brief hesitation then billy rutledge doubted that it was but the name would do hamish warned have a care theres no one about even as he spoke the words big ben behind them struck one trying to reason with his assailant rutledge said you dont want to do this billy ill help you find work if thats the problem i give you my word there was a distant splash my watch is next he commented taking advantage of the sound i wont turn you over to the police if you give me the knife now he could feel the boys uncertainty in the pressure brought to bear on the blade against his back he could feel too the twisting of the boys body to look up and then down the bridge for witnesses and then the pressure increased the time had come before his attacker could shift his weight and drive the knife home rutledge wheeled and caught billys free arm in an iron grip twisting it behind him in a single move his other hand reached for the knife startled the boy cried out and rutledge misjudged the swift reflexes of the young the knife flashed as it swung wildly in the direction of rutledges face before he could force it away and down it sliced through his coat and into his right arm as billy fought with the strength of fear rutledge swore and ruthlessly pinned his assailant against the parapet knocking the wind out of him for an instant as his fingers bit into the wrist of the hand with the knife it flexed and all at once the knife spun in the air catching the lamplight before it clattered on the pavement rutledge managed to kick it out of reach then concentrated on subduing the boy gradually forcing his body backward until the fight went out of him he was just reaching for the cap that half covered billys face when he heard a constables whistle and the heavy thud of his regulation boots as he came pounding over the crest of the bridge startled rutledge sent the cap flying into the darkness here now the constable exclaimed as he got closer and took in the two men a knife lying some two yards away from his vantage point rutledge appeared to be the aggressor and rutledges attacker took swift advantage of it he screamed dont let him hurt mehes trying to kill me help me the constable was there catching at rutledges shoulder hauling him away from his victim and for the first time rutledge glimpsed the flushed and frightened face of a boy who looked eighteen or nineteen but for all his size must be no more than sixteen and then as the constables fist closed over rutledges bleeding arm his fingers just as quickly opened again whats this then the constable demanded stepping back he was thin and middleaged an imposing figure with the light reflecting from the crown of his helmet giving the impression he was taller than he was is that your knife or his he asked the boy in that split second of hesitation billy wriggled free of rutledges grip and set off over the bridge his feet flying the constable looked from him to rutledge and rutledge said rapidly im scotland yard rutledge inspector go after him man but it was too late by the time the constable had collected himself and pelted after the suspect he had turned at the bridge abutment and was lost in the darkness on the far side of the river the constable came back breathing hard to meet rutledge halfway im sorry sir so am i his next victim might not be as lucky he gave the constable a description of the boy including the false name and added hes frightened enough to be dangerous i didnt get a close look at him the constable admitted but ill see word is passed on he gestured to rutledges arm youd best have that seen to sir the wound was beginning to hurt now rutledge warned he may not always choose this bridge yes sir i understand that he shook his head as he bent to retrieve the knife a pity nothing here to tell us where it came from common enough by the look of it he ran his finger along the edge and sharp enough to bone a chicken ill come to the station tomorrow to make a statement rutledge told him where are you and whats your name lambeth station constable bishop sir he grinned tentatively adding as if it were a longstanding joke though there are none in the family that i know of rutledge didnt return the smile he nodded and walked back to where hed left his motorcar the blood trickling down his arm to his hand left a trail behind him and he thought cynically that it was too bad that the boy hadnt cut his own arm instead dr lonsdale answering the summons at his door was in his dressing gown and still knotting the belt it cant wait until morning and then he noted the dark patch of blood on rutledges sleeve come in then he said and led rutledge directly to his surgery its not deep the doctor informed him turning to wash his hands after examining and then bandaging the wound but it will be sore enough for a few days be careful how you use it accustomed to patching up men from the yard he added providing infection doesnt set in from the knife that did this it was good advice the next morning the arm was still sore and felt heavy but he reported to the yard where news of events had preceded him bowles said as they crossed paths in the corridor constable walker has reported that a week ago on the lambeth road a boy tried to rob a doctor returning from a lyingin someone came along and the boy ran but the description is similar he claimed he had a knife but neither the doctor nor his rescuer actually saw it so i wasnt the first victim he had hoped that he was in fact there have been a number of robberies at knifepoint south of the river but most victims hand over their money without any fuss you and the doctor argued what were you doing on the bridge at that hour anyway a good question rutledge answered him shortly and then seeing that bowles was intent on having an answer he went on making plans of a sort a mad place to go woolgathering bowles commented hows the arm it will do bowles grunted dr lonsdale tells me otherwise youll be on light duty for several days he handed rutledge the stack of folders he was carrying inspector mickelson is behind in his paperwork you can deal with these he walked away without looking back rutledge stood there for all of ten seconds then strode in the direction of his office his expression grim lonsdale had said nothing about light duties this was rutledges punishment for not taking his assailant into custody and having him do mickelsons paperwork was intended to drive the point home chapter jenny teller woke from a deep sleep disoriented sitting up in bed she stared at the room this wasnt the clinicwhat was she doing here and what was that strident sound in the distance a telephone this was edwins house she realized brushing back a tendril of hair that had come loose as she slept and this was the bedchamber she and walter always used when they were in london the telephone was still ringing should she answer it rubbing her face with her hands she tried to collect her wits shed had no idea how tired she was everyone had been kind at the clinic but she hadnt been able to shut her eyes her worry driving her and only an occasional nap snatched when walter was with the doctors or asleep himself had kept her going why was there no change in his condition why was he refusing to talk to look at her to eat why couldnt the doctors do something she remembered now amy and edwin had begged her to come away for a few hours of rest walter was sleeping it would do her good and they would bring her back in time to have dinner with him oh god had they let her oversleep but no sunlight was still pouring through the curtains making bright squares on the mauve carpet it couldnt be more than five oclockperhaps half past the telephone had stopped ringing she lay back against the pillows one part of her begging to sleep a little longer the other lashing her with guilt for leaving the clinic even for such a short time there was a tap at her door and she called come in amy im awake but it was rose the housekeeper im sorry to disturb you mrs teller but theres someone on the telephone asking for you who is it she swung her feet out of the bed and stuffed them into her shoes my sister its the clinic mrs teller i told them you were resting but they said it was urgent she rushed past rose nearly tripping over her untied laces as she raced down the stairs at the door to the telephone closet she paused trying to catch her breath then she snatched up the receiver and leaned toward the mouthpiece mrs teller here she listened her mouth so dry she couldnt speak ill be there im on my way putting up the receiver she called edwin where are you he opened the study door and she hurried down the passage to meet him and then to her surprise she saw over his shoulder that the family was gathered there amy of course peter and his wife leticia walters sister their faces turned toward her were strained as if they already knew but of course they couldnt shed only just been informed herself its walter she told them baldly and then unable to say the words afraid that to do so would make them real she added oh please hurry we must go there was a deafening silence and then everyone was moving at once and someone amy she thought distractedly was kneeling to tie her shoelaces for her she stood there waiting for the motorcars to be brought around counting the minutes refusing to answer their questions her mind was filled with only one thought what she must say to harry how she was going to explain chapter rutledge was walking out of his office at the end of the day when he encountered bowles bearing down on him the chief superintendent waved rutledge back into his office and sourly regarded the stack of folders beside his blotter something has come up he said taking the chair and forcing rutledge to sit again behind his desk walter teller has gone missing he went on as if the name should mean something to rutledge teller author of that book in on the reality of the missionarys life in the field but rutledge had been on the point of joining his regiment in france when the book had come out to critical acclaim there had been no time to read it in fact if asked he would have been hardpressed to supply the name of the author gone missing in west africa was it he asked dredging up a memory no thank the lord god here in london he was being treated in the belvedere clinic some sort of nervous condition as far as i can judge from what sergeant biggin was saying theyve searched the place from top to bottom and theres no sign of him they even searched among the cadavers ghoulish thing to have to do but thorough sergeant biggin is a good man yes yes but this is a matter for the yard important man shows were on top of it results quickly and all that if you take my meaning rutledge did he would not fail to bring in his man this time one other thing see that you show the family every courtesy theyll be worried keep them informed who made the initial report the family or the clinic and when the clinic an hour ago they sent someone around to the nearest station when he saw the lay of the land sergeant biggin contacted the yard and rightly so bowles stood up pacing the narrow room the facts are these the clinic contacted the london police sergeant biggin went to have a look and then he contacted us it seems teller had come into the city from his home in essex to speak to his bankerstheres a son off to harrow shortlyand took ill on the way home his doctorman by the name of fieldingsent him directly to the belvedere hoping the medical men there could sort him out rutledge nodded they have a good reputation that was last week and according to biggin teller was not showing any improvement at all in fact his paralysis was progressing and then as quickly as it came on it apparently disappeared because in the middle of the afternoon today teller dressed himself and walked out of the clinic on his own the clinics porter never saw him leave so they searched the place then called the police and summoned mrs teller shed been resting at the home of her brotherinlaw in marlborough street and the family came to the clinic at once it was a measure of bowless personal interest in the matter that he had briefed rutledge so thoroughly thats all i can give you bowles turned to leave my compliments to mrs teller and well do everything in our power to bring this matter to a happy conclusion with a nod he was out the door rutledge sat where he was for a moment missing persons were seldom brought to the attention of the yard unless the search ended in a suspicious death or the person in question was important or well known many of the cases were closed by the recovery of the pitiful body downriver others with a trial for kidnapping or murder he had a feeling that none of these applied to tellers disappearance but something had caused the man to leave his sickbed and it was the sort of puzzle that appealed to him ye ken hamish was pointing out that yon puffedup chief superintendent is looking for a scapegoat suddenly bowles was there again poking his head around rutledges door good youre still here bowles said another thought to carry with you teller was in the field for quite a few years for all we know he may be walking around london suffering from a new plague that would set the cat amongst the pigeons it may be the reason why tellers doctors are closemouthed about his condition the terrible epidemic of spanish flu as it was called at the time that killed more people around the world in than the war had done was still fresh in the public mind i thought you said that hed recovered dont confuse issues rutledge theres no telling how long these things might fester talk to his doctors and discover if you can what the risks are when was he last in the field rutledge asked what difference does that make bowles demanded irritably he pulled out his watch you should have been on your way a quarter of an hour ago and inspector mickelsons reports rutledge asked blandly unable to stop himself he gestured to the half dozen folders still on his desk damn it man hand them over to gibson someone else will see to them this is urgent business leaving the yard rutledge drove to the belvedere clinic it was housed in what had been the offices of a large canadian firm that had returned to ottawa with the end of the war ironically enough because it had suffered severely in the spanish flu and the depressed state of business after the armistice the clinic looking for new quarters had taken it over because they were expanding it was not far from the british museum and traffic on the busy thoroughfare it faced was heavy at this hour when rutledge went up the steps to the ornate entrance the clinic had kept during renovations a porter in a dark blue uniform nodded to him and opened the door for him inside was a highceilinged foyer and his footsteps echoed on the patterned marble floor as he crossed it the orderly seated at the reception desk greeted him and asked how he might help rutledge had intended to ask for mrs teller but at the last moment he changed his mind matron please inspector rutledge scotland yard indeed sir the orderly pressed one of six buttons on a pad to one side of his desk a sister will be here shortly to take you to matrons office were you on duty this afternoon when mr teller left the clinic yes sir i was he cleared his throat his fingers fidgeting with the panel of buttons our visitors leave at four oclock you see its quite busy for several minutes mr teller must have been amongst them but how was i to know i had no reason to notice him in particular you dont recall anyone who could fit his description no sir theyre mostly relatives discussing their visit its the usual pattern i see it every day and today the porter squinted at the ceiling there was a man and a woman three sistersthey visit nearly every afternoon its their father who is ill another man with grown daughters a priest a woman alone an elderly woman in a chair with her son a larger family five or six of them he returned his gaze to rutledge im sorry sir its the best i can do were more careful about who comes in not who goes out if theyre very ill im to summon matron directly if teller had come out this door he had been clever enough to pretend to be with others a comment before opening the door and a response that appeared to be a part of normal conversation how was your visit today thank you for asking mama is a little better i think and you not much change im afraid but the doctors are more optimistic nowthey feel my brother will recover face turned slightly away listening to what was being said it could have happened that way if indeed teller had left of his own volition and knew what he was doing which means rutledge pointed out that mr teller must have been able to dress himself properly or youd have noticed thats right sir a young probationer opened the inner door and came forward to greet rutledge he said to the orderly this is the only public exit indeed sir the young woman said to rutledge matron will see you now are you the man from scotland yard she was told to expect you rutledge thanked the orderly for his help and accompanied the probationer into a busy passage where nurses were coming and going with a minimum of conversation is this area always busy yes sir the doctors have their offices here the wards are through the door at the far end and upstairs she stopped at a door to her left and tapped lightly before entering matron was coming around her desk to hold out a cool hand to rutledge as he identified himself she shook his with firmness and gestured to a chair she was a tall woman with erect bearing her hair already showing more gray than blond her eyes a blue that brooked no nonsense her voice when she spoke was cool as well good afternoon inspector thank you for coming so promptly she doesna care for the police hamish said and she corroborated that almost at once it is distressing that your presence here is necessary at all but mrs teller has been quite worried and although the local police are doing all they can it will reassure her that the resources of scotland yard are now involved in finding her husband the sister who had brought him had quietly shut the door behind him he found himself thinking that matron had had a very difficult few hours first searching the clinic and dealing with the police and then answering the questions of tellers agitated family do you have any reason to think mr teller was intending to do himself harm he asked her hes been very ill im told we havent been able to diagnose his illness she said but theres reason to believe he was disturbed about something and his distress took a physical form the fact that he recovered so quickly leads us to hope that his mental state was also restored to normal she hadnt answered his question is he likely to kill himself she looked at him directly we cant answer that the door behind him opened again and the same probationer ushered in a tall slim woman with fair hair who was wearing a dark blue walking dress her eyes were red with crying her face pale rutledge guessed at once who she was rising he went to her and took her hand identifying himself mrs teller im so sorry to learn of your husbands disappearance the yard will do everything in its power to return him to you as soon as possible thank you jenny teller replied her voice still thick with tears he led her to the second chair which was already placed to one side of matrons desk in doing so he glimpsed matrons face she was not happy that he had so quickly taken the interview away from her jenny teller took a breath has there been any news she asked hope in her voice thats why im here to collect more information to aid in our search but ive told the sergeant sergeant biggin has noted it in his report but sometimes as we ask our questions we are able to elicit new details that could be useful would you mind telling me a little more about your husbands illness she began haltingly to describe her husbands journey to london and how it had ended with their family doctor sending him to the belvedere clinic for further examination i didnt want to go to london with him wed had words the night beforeabout harry going to school so soonand now i blame myself for not being there when he became ill we might have found help for him soonerand perhaps he would have recovered soonerand none of this would have happened she found a handkerchief in her pocket and pressed it to her eyes then took a deep breath giving rutledge a watery smile this has been the worst five days of my life and there was nothing wrong with your son then or later no he was and is perfectly fine i cant imagine what the montleighs thought of me but id caught some of walters fear and im afraid i sounded ratherhovering did you have any idea what was wrong with your husband my first thought was that his malaria was returning but after id told him that harry was all right walter tried to step out of the motorcar and he couldnt it took three of usmy housekeeper was the third personto get him into the house where dr fielding could examine him properly what was his opinion walters heart was racing and dr fielding asked me if hed had a shock or bad newsthat sort of thingbut of course i didnt know and walter couldnt remember anything happening to him and the motorcar was all right there hadnt been a crash rutledge turned to matron and the doctors here examined him as soon as he was brought in yes mr teller had a history of malaria and hed lived abroad we had several specialists in to see him and one was concerned about parasites but mr teller hadnt returned to the field since before the war and therefore parasites werent likely dr sheldon an expert in tropical medicine came to examine him and he could find no evidence of disease she glanced at jenny teller and then went on we asked another specialist to speak with mr teller to see if his problems were more likely to be the result of some illness of the mind but mr teller was quite rational in his answers and then that nightthe second day of his having come to the belvederehe refused his dinner turned his face to the wall and was unresponsive to the staff or to mrs teller and he was that way for the remainder of the week we could see that his paralysis was growing steadily worse and we had to do everything for himfrom lifting a glass of water to his lips to helping him turn in bed hamish said ye ken there was something on his mind rutledge nearly answered him aloud instead he said to jenny teller do you know of anything that was troubling your husband no id have told the doctors straightaway she sniffed i was the one in distress over harry going to school walter was insistent that we carry out his fathers wishes and his father has been dead for six years why was mr teller so determined to send your son away did he and the boy get along she stared at him of course they got along theyre very close its his fathers fault harry is the only heir you see neither of walters brothers have children and his sister isnt married theres hemophilia in the family edwin suffers from it and peters wife susannah is his first cousin his mothers sisters child so when harry was born walters father put his name down for harrow where all the heirs have gone for generations its a family tradition and i have nothing to say about that i just didnt want harry to go so soon where is your husbands family now driving around searching for walter they spoke to the police and then hurried away they believed he must still be in the vicinity and your son my sister mary has been caring for him weve tried not to worry him and he enjoys staying with her she spoils him so there was nothing more he could ask her and so rutledge assuring her that everything possible was being done took his leave he went next to look at tellers room but it offered nothing the cupboard where patients kept their street clothes was empty and nothing in the drawer by the bed or even under the mattress offered any clues to the mans state of mind or his intentions he spent the next half hour meeting with tellers physicians and found that they were reluctant to admit that they had no idea what had struck the man down the general opinion was that he was in mental distress thanking them rutledge remembered bowless fear that teller might be carrying a new plague and asked if there was any possibility that teller was contagious there was immediate assurance that he was not but rutledge wouldnt have been surprised to learn that they had crossed their fingers behind their backs dr harmon said the mind is a curious thing mr rutledge it can create demons where there are none and remember events that never happened and it can cause the body to fall ill he smiled my son is sick whenever he has an appointment with the dentist quite sick with a fever thats a simple example but it illustrates the power of the mind rutledge knew all too well how powerful the mind was and how once it had fixed itself on a course altering it was nearly impossible he wondered what the good doctor would make of hamish he asked would this lead mr teller to harm himself thats unfortunately a strong possibility i think he willed himself to die and when that didnt happen he came to the conclusion that other measures would be necessary id keep a watch on the river if i were you rutledge thanked him and left sergeant biggin was just coming in the clinic door as he was walking out and he stopped to speak to rutledge weve found no sign of him sir ive had men searching the streets for the past hour or more and were circulating mr tellers description and that of the clothing he was wearing as well mrs teller was kind enough to help us there you wouldnt think that a man who had been as ill as mr teller was said to be could disappear so quickly weve even had a man walking through the rooms at the museum on the unlikely chance that he wandered in there are you also watching the river ive put out the word sir but thats some distance away do you think he could have got that far ill and on his own i think he could do whatever he put his mind to keep me informed biggin there is nothing more i can do here did you meet the rest of the family yes sir i did they were angry well youd expect that but it seemed to me they were as angry with teller as they were with the clinic though thats an odd thing to say all the same ill keep it in mind the next morning rutledge returned early to the clinic he found mrs teller in matrons small sitting room and again she was alone except for matron she was on her feet and asking him for news as soon as he stepped through the door but he had none to give her he found himself apologizing as if it were his fault that her husband hadnt been found to distract her he asked if her family was with her this morning jenny teller sighed and shook her head they came back close to eight oclock and they werent at all satisfied that the police were doing everything they could to find walter i told them youd come to see me but they were still upset and then this morning amyshes edwins wifecame to tell me that edwin and peter werent convinced that walter is still in london and so they have each gone to look for walter where they felt he might be i know that susannah peters wife went to cornwall because his family often summered there when he was a boy i think its nonsense but theyre as worried as i am she turned away so that rutledge couldnt see her face i asked amy if she could stay here with me but she wanted to drive down to witch hazel farm on the off chance that walter might have decided to go home to heal he knows im here in londonhe wouldnt go to essex knowing that he might have awoken to find you werent here and he may have gone to essex to seek you rutledge pointed out but he knew i wouldnt go that far as for his family i feel let down somehow as if his brothers are more worried about walter than about me that sounds selfish doesnt it but they were here last night badgering the police and i could see that they could hardly sit still do you think they might know something they havent told the police about your husbands illness or his disappearance what could they know she considered that for a moment and then said walter is a good man hes tried to live up to his calling and he takes his responsibilities seriously hes kind and considerate and not the sort of person who has secrets he wouldnt leave me to worry like this if he were in his right mind im sure of it i dont believe for a moment that he knew what he was doing yesterday and thats whats so frightful to think aboutthat hes ill and not able to judge things properly and cant care for himself i understand rutledge glanced at matron to see if she had anything more to add but she was watching mrs teller with concern for her distress feeling his gaze she turned to look at him i can add very little to that except to say that mr teller was very depressed by his illness i had wondered if he feared his condition was permanent then when it changed for the better rutledge pointed out it should have been very reassuring and it was not which leads me to believe that something else was on his mind he turned again to mrs teller where would he be likely to turn if he were troubled why should he turn anywhere he only needed to ask one of the sisters where i had gone they would have told him she blinked back tears it was the first and only time i left him i hadnt slept at alli was so afraid he would die matron said when sister agnes looked in on him shortly before three oclock he appeared to be asleep when she returned at twenty past four he was gone in little more than an hour he recovered the use of his limbs and dressed himself it seems hardly possible someone might have helped him dress helped him to leave who to what end jenny teller put in quickly everyone was at edwins housethey were all there hamish said did he wait for her to go it was a good point jenny herself had just said that she had never left her husbands side and he could hardly dress and slip away with her there in the room rutledge left mrs teller in matrons care and searched the clinic himself as the staff and then the police had done the night before sister vivian accompanied him and answered his questions but it was clear that a patient would have found it difficult to slip out the staff entrance or the door where supplies came in and the dead were carried out one fact was certain walter teller was no longer in the belvedere clinic aye hamish said but for his grieving wife its as if he never existed at all chapter as rutledge was leaving tellers room he found sergeant biggin looking for him biggin said i didnt want to disturb the wife but theres a body youll have to come and see i cant recognize teller and i wont put mrs teller through this until i know whether or not youve found her husband fair enough wait here rutledge went back into the sitting room where mrs teller was just joining matron in a morning cup of tea it was painful to see hope flaring in her eyes at the sight of him then watch it dashed again mrs teller would there be a photograph of your husband at your brotherinlaws house that the police could use to help them search for witnesses anyone who might have seen him ill be glad to send someone around for it a photograph she opened her purse and brought out a small velvet case i have this but its very precious ill see no harm comes to it he promised and took out the silver frame inside the case he was younger then she warned him he gave me this before we were married looking down at the likeness of walter teller rutledge saw a strong face marked by something he couldnt define the years in the field possibly it was there in the eyes a shadow that belied the smile for the camera he thanked mrs teller and went back to where biggin was waiting lets go he said hes not wearing the clothing mrs teller described for us when he first went missing biggin told him as they walked out to the motorcar but the physical description fits height weight coloring what happened to him rutledge asked he was stabbed on westminster bridge he was found shortly after dawn rutledges heart sank had billy killed him bowles would have an apoplexy if the boys first victim was walter teller they drove in silence to the morgue where the body had been undressed and the mans clothing had been put in a cardboard box do you care to examine his belongings first the attendant asked was he robbed i expect he was no watch or rings no money then ill see the body now he was accustomed to looking at the dead sometimes he was surprised at how much he could read in the dead face at other times there was nothing but a blankness as if the substance of the living being had been wiped away with his death biggin was right the victim was of the same general height and build as walter teller his fair hair parted on the left side but one look told rutledge that this was not teller even given the changes over the years it was not in fact the dead man resembled rutledge in size and weight as well rutledge asked that the body be turned so that he could examine the wound in the mans back the knife had been shoved in hard just where rutledge had felt the faint prick of the blade against his own skin hed found after he left lonsdale that small bloodencrusted spot in his own back he had had the boy pinned against the parapet he should have brought him in in spite of the constables interference he should have stopped him before he killed now it was too late nodding to the attendant to cover the body again rutledge said to biggin it isnt teller but i can probably identify the person who did this if you bring in a suspect send for me fair enough biggin said rutledge left the morgue in grim spirits and after dropping biggin at his station he drove back to the belvedere clinic mrs teller had gone again to her husbands empty room and he found her there staring out the window lost in her own thoughts she turned as rutledge stepped through the door he could see the worry in her face and he wondered again at the familys abandoning her at such a time it didnt make sense he said nothing about the dead man smiling instead and telling her no news im afraid but the police have been bringing me uptodate on their activities he had spoken to biggin at length in the motorcar the search has been expanded to include the river she cried out at that but he said mrs teller we must be realistic your husband has been under some stress he may have left the clinic with the intent to do himself a harm and if were to find him in time we must try to understand his state of mind no she said forcefully walter wouldnt kill himself i know my husband he has no reason to want to die and every reason to want to live i wont listen to this he spent another ten minutes trying to make a dent in her certainty finally he asked if we knew what had caused your husbands extraordinary illness we might be better able to judge where he has gone and why what happened to him between the bank and your house that changed him and brought on his paralysis dont you think id have told dr fieldingor the doctors hereif i had any idea at all she was angry with him my sister was here earlier this morning i asked her if she knew anything that would help sometimes walter talked to her about his mission work mary has always strongly supported missions and she has no illusions about the hardships people in the field endure she couldnt think of any reason either and i could see that she was as worried as i was so i didnt have the heart to ask her what i really wanted to know i wondered if someone could have cursed walter out there ive heard about such things i mean i dont really believe in them and im sure walter doesnt either still you never know her voice broke and she put her hands over her eyes partly ashamed of her fears and partly afraid to speak them aloud to give them a reality rutledge had nothing to say in response it had hardly been twentyfour hours since her husband left but irrational fears were already supplying answers to questions that had none he summoned a nursing sister to come and sit with her then left chapter rutledge found the london addresses for edwin and peter teller and drove to each house but he was informed by the maids who answered the door that the family was away wherever they were searching he had a feeling that they were having no better luck than he had had in finding their brother the second day of walter tellers disappearance brought no new information it was as if hed never existed hamish said if he were wandering abouttruly lostsomeone would ha noticed him and brought him to a hospital or the police it was what had been on rutledges mind all morning he might not wish to be found he replied an alternative to suicide theres that aye hamish agreed it made a certain kind of sense if one cant face the nightmare one can try to avoid it but what sort of nightmare haunted a man like teller he went back to question tellers doctors they had failed to unlock their patients secrets he said tellers wife has been casting about for answers as well she has even considered a curse on her husband from his time in places like west africa curses are interesting things dr davies replied they work when people believe that they will work in short the curse is effective because the victim accepts that it will happen and that nothing can be done to prevent it from happening as foretold in my view teller was far too intelligentand knowledgeable about the people with whom he workedto be taken in by such a threat ive talked to several other missionaries who told me that a curse had been put on them by a tribal shaman a way of discouraging competition one might say and of course it failed which caused no end of trouble for the shaman his power was seen to be weak what would be a modern equivalent of a curse rutledge asked ah davies answered him thats an even more interesting question i expect it would take the form of something happening once and the fear that it could happen again if one finds an intruder in ones house on a dark night it might well be something one would fear coming into that same house on another dark night he smiled guilt can produce irrational fears as well was teller likely to die of his illness was that on his mind at a guess no it wouldnt have killed him the fact that he recovered so quickly points to the same conclusion dr sheldon put in i can tell you this walter teller wasnt afraid of dying when he turned his face to the wall it was his acceptance that death was preferable preferable to what but they had no suggestions in tellers case he said do you have any reason to think that walter teller was being poisoned no we considered poisoning we found no evidence of it is there any reason to believe rutledge cut in quickly no its something a policeman must bear in mind hamish said as they left the clinic it isna likely that he went away to die he could ha hanged himself in his room while his wife was resting at his brothers house he didnt want his wife to find his body rutledge spent much of that day and well into the early evening going to police stations all across london showing the photograph hed been given to each shift of constables coming in or going out they studied the photograph but no one had seen anyone resembling teller and as a rule constables on the street could be counted on to remember the faces of people not normally seen on their patch keeping an eye out for troublemakers and strangers alike even a wellspoken welldressed man like walter teller would be noted for future reference one constable shaking his head said to rutledge its more likely that he found a cab soon after leaving the clinic well before the search began he could be anywhere now he could have taken an omnibus a train or cadged a lift from someone but rutledge had already sent a man from the yard to speak to any cabbie who had taken up custom near the clinic at four oclock on the afternoon in question no one remembered seeing walter teller or even someone who looked like him yere searching for a needle in a haystack hamish told rutledge or for one man when there might well have been two if someone had come for him or was there to help him dress and leave the clinic had had no record of visits to walter teller other than the immediate family still it was possible to use another patients name to pass the porter and gain access but that led him nowhere either rutledge had even driven to essex to the house of dr fielding arriving there just as fielding was preparing for his first patient of the afternoon the man reluctantly put aside the pipe hed been smoking and addressed himself to rutledges questions about walter teller i can give you a brief sketch of his background missionary for many years and then he married jenny brittingham rather than returning to the field he chose to write a book about his experiences and this was just a year or so before the war rutledge thought how the war had defined timebefore the warafter the war as if that great cataclysmic event that had interrupted and ended so many lives was still with them like a personal watershed and of course there is harry the son quite a nice child and not at all spoiled as youd expect with doting aunts and uncles surrounding him jennymrs teller has seen to that shes a very good mother did teller serve in the war as a matter of fact he did chaplain but he was struck down with malaria in that rainy spring before the somme and was sent home to recover it was decided not to send him back to france and so he worked among the wounded here was there anything in his war years that might have affected what happened to him last week fielding raised his eyebrows not to my knowledge in fact i remember teller commenting that hed seen death in so many guises that hed lost his fear of it long before going to france there was something about a famine in west africapeople dying by the droves and of course in china death was as common as flies he said no youre barking up the wrong tree there then what caused his illness that i cant tell you which is why i sent teller to the belvedere clinic and the last progress report i received was rather grim he was showing no improvement and in fact was beginning to feel paralysis in his arms and hands as well as in his legs do you think this paralysis was genuine fielding said are you asking me if his illness was feigned no of course not id take my oath on that then how would you account for the fact that three days ago walter teller got out of his sickbed while his wife was resting dressed himself and walked out of the clinic he did what youre saying there was a full recovery and what did his doctors make of that leaning forward fielding stared hard at rutledge they had no better understanding of events than you do but teller is missing and theres been no word from him since he walked away my god hes still missing how is jenny she must be distraught shes taken it very hard as youd expect now i repeat my earlier questioncan you shed any light on his illness or his miraculous recovery if thats what it was i cant imaginelook inspector the man was ill i saw that for myself it was all i could do with mrs tellers assistance and that of their maid mollie to get him into their house so i could examine him properly he was a dead weight and thats not easy to fake id look on the road between his bankers and essex for my answers as for his recovery someone else must have been there when he dressed and left the clinic i cant see how it was managed any other way why should anyone help him leave the clinic and not inform mrs teller that he was safe and well elsewhere fielding said you arentdo you think there was foul play no thats not possible he shook his head walter had no enemies except perhaps himself because if this illness is in his mind the reasons must go deep into something none of us is aware of from fieldings surgery rutledge drove on to witch hazel farm and knocked at the door the housekeeper mollie answered the summons and as rutledge introduced himself she said quickly dont tell me something has happened to mr teller why should you think something has happened to him rutledge asked misunderstanding the direction of her question because youre a policeman and he wasnt himself at all that day when he came home from london so ill his doctors are still uncertain about the cause of his illness tell me was he in pain when you were helping mrs teller work with him pain she repeated no id not call it that he was more fearful i heard him ask mrs teller twice if she thought it was his heart were there any visitors to the house before he went to london any letters or telegrams no visitors since the party for mr tellers birthday mollie told him and i dont remember any letters in particular im not in the habit of looking at the post when its brought i just set it on the salver there she turned slightly to point to a long narrow silver tray on the polished table in the large hall behind her and then she frowned as if the act of pointing out the salver had reminded her i do know there was a letter from the missionary society the morning of the party i heard him say under his breath that god had remembered him at last it was an odd thing to say wasnt it did he receive letters from the society on a regular basis i dont make a habit of looking at the post she repeated but rutledge said you may not look at it but you cant help but see whats there this could be important if i was to guess she said after a moments hesitation then id say it had been some time since hed had a letter from them it was my understanding with the war and all not to speak of his malaria that he was on what mrs teller called extended leave had the letter been a recall to duty it could explain tellers distress rutledge said has any of the family come to the house since mr teller was taken to the hospital in london mr edwin and mrs amy came to look through his papers last week i think they were hoping to find a reason for mr tellers illness that would have been before his disappearance did they find what they were after i cant say i didnt see them leave i was in the kitchen making tea and when i came up with the tray the study was empty and the motorcar was no longer in front of the door anyone else mrs amy came back two days ago she said she was collecting fresh clothes for mrs teller i helped her choose what she thought was suitable did she go anywhere else in the house besides mrs tellers bedroom she didnt for instance return to the study no sir id have known if she had and all she took from the house was clothing yes sir i did ask her how mr teller fared she told me that mrs teller would be staying on in london for the time being while the doctors came to a conclusion about him i could judge from her face that she was worried come to think of it the clothing she took was mostly black now thats distressing and rutledge thought two days ago amy teller had known that walter teller was missing back in london rutledge went again to marlborough street and to bolingbroke street to call on edwin teller and his brother peter but neither of them had returned to the city he stopped by his own flat afterward for a change of clothing and found a telegram on his doorstep the early darkness of an approaching storm had settled over the streets and a wind was picking up lifting bits of papers from the gutter and tossing the flower heads in the garden next but one to his flat the war had taught so many people that telegrams brought bad news someone missing a death the end of hope he reached down to pick it up and had the strongest premonition that he shouldnt open it hamish said the war is oer theres no one left to kill bitterness deepened the familiar voice rutledge lifted the telegram from the doorstep and shoved it in his pocket as the storm broke overhead lightning flaring through the darkness like the flashes of shells followed by thunder so close it was like the guns of france pounding in his head he poured himself a drink forcing the images that were crowding his mind back into the blackness whence theyd come and this time succeeded in breaking the spell or was it only the storms fury moving on downriver and fading safely into the distance that erased the memories of the fighting he couldnt be sure he found a clean shirt and put it on then reached into his pocket for the telegram the skies were just clearing enough that he could read it without lighting the lamp he recognized the name below the message and realized that his premonition had been right the telegram had been sent by david trevor a surge of guilt swept through him too many letters from his godfather had gone unanswered this was surely a summons to appear in scotland and explain himself trevor had written plaintively in his last letter the press of an inquiry what are you killing off the good citizens of london at such a rate that theres not a minute to spare for us i find that hard to believe and rutledge could almost hear the amusement in his words as well as the uncertainty and the sadness he scanned the brief message arriving tomorrow stop meet us at station and the time of the train followed for an instant of panic rutledge considered that us oh god surely not the entire household but no trevor must have meant himself and his grandson and that was bad enough rutledge swore with feeling trapped and without any excuse or escape he found an umbrella and went back out to his motorcar driving through the wet streets to his sisters house for a mercy she was at home and he came through the door almost shouting for her ian im neither deaf nor in the attics whats the matter she demanded coming down the stairs he held up the telegram trevors coming did you know hell have to stay with you im afraid theres no hope that the flat can be made habitable in time the thought of trevor being there in the same flat hearing rutledge scream in the night was unbearable explaining why he screamed at night would be beyond him and trevortrevor would speak to frances and ask if she knew habitable dont be silly when has your flat been anything but scrupulously tidy i sometimes wonder if you ever really live there but yes hes staying here she laughed at the panic in his eyes darling this is your godfather not your colonel in chief hes bringing the little boy he told me that morag was turning out the cupboards and beating the mattresses and it was no place for sane men to linger but the panic hadnt subsided in her brothers eyes and she said her laughter vanishing ian surely you dont mind giving up a day or two to spend with david ill see to his comfort of course i will but hell want to talk to you dine with you that sort of thing hes been worried if you must know you havent written in ages and he needs to be reassured that alls well she paused still considering him all is well isnt it ian its just been the press of work hasnt it he was well and truly caught the trouble was david trevor was an insightful man and he would see too much what if hamish sent him into darkness in the middle of a dinnera drink at trevors clubduring a walk in st jamess park and there had been insufficient warning not enough time to prepare himself hed be on parade as surely as if he were in the army again and in the end hed betray himself out of sheer witless nerves something would slip a word a hesitation an instants lapse in concentration trevor would know frances said gently its david my dear and hes lost his son hes still grieving i cant replace ross no one can rutledge stood there helplessly with nowhere to turn he isnt asking you to replace him i think he merely wants to hear your voice and see your face and laugh with you at some bit of foolishness the way you and he did before the war a little space in time where theres neither past nor future where he can pretend do you understand what im trying to say he did all too well the question was could he provide the strength and the ease someone else required and not find himself mourning too rutledge took a deep breath he should have given me a little time to arrange matters at the yard his voice trailed off there was the inquiry into tellers disappearance it was taking up all his time and youd have put him off i suspect he knew that meanwhile im the one with the preparations to see to weve aired the spare bedroom and the nursery and theres food for meals and an invitation for his old partner in the architectural firm to lunch with david at his club and theres even a lady who wants him to come to tea that got his attention he looked up a lady melinda crawford of course she smiled were going to kent the day after tomorrow its arranged he could see how much had been planned without his knowledge but if there was a luncheon and a visit to kent as well as the zoo or whatever else a small restless boy might wish to see he mightjustmake it through ian all right but you must go to the station i cant take but you can take a half an hour she said gently and bring them here to me and so it was that he found himself at st pancreas the next morning waiting for the train from edinburgh hamish ringing in his ears and his mouth dry as bone chapter for nearly eight months rutledge had refused every invitation from his godfather david trevor to come back to scotland what had happened there in september of the previous year had left him physically near death and emotionally shattered he needed no reminder of that timeevents were still etched in his memory and hamish had seen to it that every detail remained crystal clear for he had entered hamishs world without any warning to prepare either of them and the price had nearly been too high he could not tell his godfather why the very thought of traveling north was still anathema because of fiona the woman hamish should have lived to marry because too many young scots like hamish had died under his command all the same he sometimes felt that trevor already understood much of the story at least the part that had taken place in scotland please god no one would ever learn the whole truth about hamish and what had happened in france he was grateful now for the inquiry that was presently taking up so much of his timeit would give him the excuse to absent himself from his visitors when the strain of pretense was too much rutledge met the travelers at the station as promised and as the train came into view he felt tension invest his body like steel rods hamish said derisively it willna help rutledge said nothing in reply swallowing the bitter taste that rose in his throat and then the carriages were passing him slowing as the train came to a halt and it was too late to run his godfather was at the window waving to him before the carriage door opened and then trevor was stepping out holding the small boy named for rutledge by the hand he said something to the child and reached back into the carriage for the leather valise hed left on the seat rutledge had a few seconds in which to realize that his godfather looked better than when he had last seen him some of the strain was gone from his face and his step was lighter the boys doing at a guess the two crossed to where rutledge was waiting rooted to the spot hallo ian its good to see you trevor said heartily taking his outstretched hand everyone sends their love and here is the young chatterbox as we call him my lad do you remember your honorary uncle he knew your father very well once upon a time the boy shyly held out his hand and said how do you do uncle ian as rutledge took the small hand in his the boy added i rode the train all the way from scotland and i was very good wasnt i he turned to look up at his grandfather and i shall have the pick of the litter of pups in the barn if i mind my manners while im in london his slight scottish accent came as a surprise though it shouldnt have done rutledge searched for words of welcome and found none and so you shall trevor said filling the awkward silence as they turned to go trevor added well then are we to stay with you at the flat or with frances at the house the relief that this first encounter had gone off well enough was nearly intolerable yet after all his apprehension the weeks visit had turned out to be an unexpectedly happy one nothing was said about the more recent pastnothing was said about anyone who had stayed at home though morag had sent him the dundee cake she had made for him at christmas in the hope that he might have come north after all its past its prime she says trevor warned him but the fault is no ones but yours rutledge had taken it with apologies and promised to send trevors housekeeper something in return he knew none better that trevor refrained from saying that she would have preferred to see him that she was getting no younger and still doted on him the thought was there in trevors eyes when rutledge arrived at the yard after settling his godfather with frances a patient sergeant biggin was waiting for him in his office he rose as rutledge walked through the door and wished him a good morning theres news he asked the sergeant goodor bad it appears to be bad news biggin reported wed like to have you come with us sir and have a look at what weve found it appears mr tellers clothing has come to lighton the back of a costermonger near covent garden an alert constable spotted the man and is keeping him in sight rutledge said only ill drive and he led the way to his motorcar as they turned toward covent garden rutledge asked do the clothes appear to be damaged in any way torn bloodstains washed out no sir according to the constable they only appeared to be a little soiled from pushing a barrow through wet streets but that was at a distance they found a place to leave the motorcar and walked the rest of the way covent garden was quiet the frenetic life of the dawn fruit and produce market in the piazza had finished for the day only the sweepers busy cleaning up the last of the debris and gossiping among themselves their voices loud in the silence after the morning bustle the opera house looked like a great ship stranded on a foreign shore sergeant biggin found his constable on a street corner his back to the doorway of a tobacco shop he nodded to biggin and then acknowledged rutledge just behind the sergeant morning sir that tea shop down the street the costermonger is in there thats his barrowthe one with the red handlesjust outside has he seen you rutledge asked the barrow wasnt evidence the mans clothing was i think not sir waitthe shop door is opening they watched as a heavyset man sauntered through the door but instead of the lightcolored suit of clothes that jenny teller had told the police her husband had worn to the clinic and presumably out of it as well he was wearing a pair of coveralls and wellingtons a flat cap on his head damn the constable said grimly beg pardon sir but thats him the costermonger but wheres his clothing hes just sold it to someone else come on rutledge strode swiftly down the street toward the tea shop the costermonger looked up and then his gaze sharpened as he recognized that one of the men bearing down on him was a uniformed constable the other a sergeant moving fast in the wake of a man in street clothes they could see the changing expressions on his facealarm the debate over whether to flee or stay where he was outnumbered he chose to stay bracing himself as biggin said good morning their quarry said nothing ive been told that you were seen wearing different clothing earlier in the day biggin went on wed like to have a look at it they could see the man weighing any profit he might have made against trouble with the police he chose a middle course whats wrong with an honest man making a living out of old clothes that have come into his possession he demanded grudgingly nothing biggin retorted except they arent old and its the gentleman who was once wearing those items that were interested in hearing about i know nothing about him i found the suit of clothes in a neat pile by the river just below tower bridge i hung about to see if anyone was to come along and claim them and when no one did i thought i ought not to look a gift horse in the mouth as the saying goes it was interesting rutledge observed that the costermonger knew precisely which clothing the police were after they would have been a windfall worth as much as he might earn in a weeks time selling old clothes and boots and mens hats there had been no pretense of ignorance no denials it was possible he was telling the truth and where would the items in question be now biggin asked the costermonger reluctantly answered i sold them to a gent in the tea shop he fancied the cut of them he said the constable was already reaching for the door latch and disappeared inside the shop he came out shortly thereafter with a known pickpocket one sammy underwood a wellspoken man of fortyfive who could pass for a gentleman in tellers suit of clothes rutledge had seen him at flat races hobnobbing with rich punters and readily accepted in his pressed castoffs a better sort of purse to pick there than the casual encounter at a street crossing underwood demanded his own apparel back before he would consent to give up tellers clothing the exchange made he scuttled off before the police took an interest in his activities they spoke to the costermonger for another quarter of an hour but he refused to change his story although he claimed that he had not found shoes or hat with the trousers shirt and coat sergeant biggin turned to rutledge a man doesnt leap into the river wearing his hat and shoes for all we know they were taken away before the costermonger found the rest of tellers belongings rutledge made a brief examination of the clothing the labels had been removed the costermonger said quickly they were that way when i found them yes biggin retorted and the moons the suns daughter its true the man exclaimed ill swear to it if you like rutledge tended to believe him although the sergeant remained dubious but if it wasnt the costermongerthen who had taken the time to remove them someone intent on throwing dust in the eyes of the police but if it hadnt been for the vigilance of a constable the clothing would have disappeared into the backstreets of east london never to come to light ye canna find a man sae easily in different clothes hamish pointed out to buy a little time perhaps or travel in the end the costermonger lost his sale and rutledge after complimenting the constable for his good eye left with a box under his arm containing what appeared to be walter tellers clothing he went directly to bond street and walked up and down looking in shop windows and then he saw what he was after grantwell amp sons specialized in dressing men who spent much of their time in the country and displayed over a handsome chair in the window was a mans suit of similar style and cut the shop was not busy at that hour and rutledge had the full attention of the owner bolts of fine cloth trays of buttons and collars and an array of hats indicated a clientele with the resources and taste to dress well sammy underwood had found himself a bargain mr grantwell recognized his workmanship at once though he deplored the missing labels and the condition of the items he was scrutinizing after consulting his client book with its diagrams and lists and measurements he identified the owner of the clothing looking up he asked quietly may i inquire why you are bringing these to me does it mean that some harm has come to mr walter teller we havent spoken to mr teller these were found in the possession of a costermonger and we are trying to discover who they belonged to and how they came into his hands rutledge answered him it was the truth as far as it went and mr grantwell could make of it what he chose the tailor nodded indeed which of course explains their state i must say ive always admired mr teller he went on in his book he described his years in the field it was quite shocking accustomed as he was to the life of a gentleman it was remarkable how well he coped with hardship and deprivation it is a tribute to his upbringing that he had the resources of spirit to fall back on rutledge was struck by grantwells remark jenny teller had also mentioned the terrible conditions of her husbands fieldwork but from a police point of view rutledge had considered them as a possible explanation for tellers disappearance events that could have preyed on his mind years afterward but now he could see another point of viewthat if walter teller had deliberately disappeared for whatever reason he was better prepared than most to deal with a completely different way of life sleeping rough for one and for another disappearing into the london scene not as walter teller gentleman but as an ordinary man of the streets invisible to police eyes and a first step would have been altering his appearanceincluding ridding himself of the clothing that would identify him hamish silent for some time told him if yere right hes no coming back grantwell was saying my father had the pleasure of serving mr tellers father before him and id like to think well serve young master harry in the years to come he was fishing an experienced angler in search of information and it occurred to rutledge that a mans tailor knew nearly as much about him as his servants tidbits garnered in fitting sessions or the type of cloth ordered military funeral wedding baptism riding a weekend in the country or a shooting party in scotland receptions at the palace or a day at ascot his own tailor solicitous of the gaunt haunted man who walked into his shop a year ago in need of new suits of clothing for his return to the yard had asked if his wounds were healing well and if there was to be a happy event in the near future rutledge hadnt been able to tell him the truth the words refusing to form in his mind and so he had murmured something about no date had been set and then barely heard what followed as the man prattled on about his own sons marriage in the winter he said now mr tellers brothers are among your clients as well yes indeed mr edwin teller has never enjoyed good health but during the war he was engaged in work for the admiralty serving with distinction im told he was for many years a designer of boats and often traveled to scotland to oversee their construction he was given a private railway carriage captain teller was severely wounded a few months before the armistice i understand there was some concern that he might never walk again the shop door opened and an elderly man stepped in a clerk hurried from the back of the shop to greet him and mr grantwell said to rutledge is there any other way i can help you my next appointment his voice trailed off and rutledge took the hint thanking him and leaving now came the unpleasant duty of showing the items of clothing to mrs teller to confirm what the tailor had said that they did indeed belong to her husband leaving the sergeant with the box rutledge looked first in tellers private room and then went to matrons sitting room there he found jenny teller in conversation with another couple the atmosphere was unexpectedly tense and as he opened the door hed caught a fleeting expression of relief on jennys face as if she were glad of the interruption then her expression changed to alarm as she realized that it was rutledge and not a member of matrons staff is there news she asked quickly we havent found your husband no he answered her she nodded she was beginning to cope with her shock and her fear her husbands disappearance coming on the heels of his mysterious illness had shaken her badly her emotions raw her tears not far below the surface now rutledge could see changes in her face a new strength and determination an unwilling acceptance of the unacceptable that her life had changed she turned to present her companions my brother and sisterinlaw edwin teller and his wife amy amy teller came forward with her hand outstretched yes jenny was just telling us that the yard had joined in the search were very grateful rutledge was struck by edwins wife she was well dressed attractive in the way she held herself and had clear intelligent eyes but there was something behind that intelligence that spoke of worry and a sleepless night edwin pale and showing signs of an even deeper fatigue was a rather handsome man with an edwardian beard he stood to greet rutledge and said weve just come back from searching ourselves im afraid weve had no better luck i was hoping he shrugged eloquently unwilling to finish the sentence in the presence of walters wife rutledge said you were looking for your brother may i ask where weve only just got back amy answered for her husband i thought he might have gone to the house in essex i know jenny disagreed but i did look edwin and peter went to cambridge on the odd chance walter had gone to see someone there edwin seemed to remember being told that a colleague had retired there jenny said i didnt know that was it percy i thought he had gone back to northumberland as it turned out percy is there for the summer amy told her he wasnt at home when edwin called he was meeting with someone at the college edwin said to rutledge my brother was severely wounded in the war and is still recovering he kept me company it was an unnecessary clarification and amy spoke quickly to cover it indeed amy teller appeared to answer for her husband almost as if uncertain that he knew his lines on cue susannahshes peters wife inspectordrove to cornwall where the family often went on holiday and leticia edwins sister was in portsmouth on the off chance that walter might haveshe hesitated glancing uncertainly toward jennywhere he might in his confusion have thought he was returning to the field edwin said we didnt find him but it was better than waiting for the police to get around to looking beyond london and we might have got lucky theres always that he sounded defeated but smiled for jennys sake and added we could count on jenny here at the clinic if the police came through jenny glanced from one to the other and said portsmouth was a waste of time leticia should have stayed here walter wouldnt have left the country without telling me he wouldnt have left harry without a word no matter how confused he might be do you know for a fact that he didnt try to contact his son rutledge asked wellno but mary would have sent word at once if he had edwin replied you should have informed the police before leaving london rutledge told them it would have been helpful it wasnt a yard matter then amy answered and theres something else jenny was just telling us that a watch is being kept on the river surely these men could be put to better use searching the city none of us can believe that walter intended to do away with himself rutledge said i dont think any of us can say with certainty what was in tellers mind when he left the clinic jenny teller said stubbornly ive told you walter wont kill himself with respect mrs teller he hasnt been seen for days he hasnt contacted you he hasnt come back to the clinic your husbands family seems to feel he left london almost at once id like to know why they were so certain of that edwin said because we know him because hes our brother and so you believed that he would visit a colleagueor his childhood holiday homeas soon as he came to himself again edwin said shortly dont be absurd thats not what we believed its justlook we were clutching at straws we drove around london searching for him that first afternoon and then we tried to think where he might go if he needed to talk to someone or remember where he was happy as a child you think then that he isnt fully cured damn it i dont know edwin told him youre the policeman what do you think the evidence we have is circumstantial he was able to walk out of the clinic all well and good he was able to dress himself presentably so that he wouldnt attract attention leaving with the afternoons visitors that argues a certain awareness an ability to think ahead with respect mrs teller he went on he chose a time when no one was here to stop him or ask questions that tells us he knew where he wanted to go and why and perhaps it didnt necessarily march with your opinion on the subject and you mr teller werent here pacing the floor your sister wasnt here demanding that something be done and quickly making a nuisance of herself with the staff and the police thats what generally happens you see instead the family left london with almost indecent haste mrs teller unable to reach any of you was left to cope on her own what i wonder was so urgent in your minds that it took precedence over every other consideration and dont talk to me again about old friends and childhood holidays bowles had urged rutledge to be careful in his handling of the teller family but if they were withholding information he needed to know now i wont listen to this edwin said getting to his feet rutledge said the only alternative sir is that someone came here for your brother and spirited him out of the clinic the consternation on the face of edwin teller was a reflection of his wifes expression rutledge couldnt tell whether they accepted the possibility or were shocked by it but he was nearly certain that it had never occurred to them jenny said this is nonsense i wont listen to any more we need to concentrate on whats important now and thats finding walter theres one other piece of business to attend to rutledge turned from her brotherinlaw to her as he spoke give me a moment he went out to find sergeant biggin and retrieve the box returning to the room he crossed to the table where matron served tea to her guests and set the box carefully on the polished surface jennys gaze hadnt left the box from the moment rutledge came through the door with his burden it was almost as if she had a premonition of what lay inside without a word he removed the lid he thought at first that jenny was going to faint and he moved to help her but she shook her head and resolutely looked into the box edwin followed her and then amy looked over his shoulder one glance was enough jennys gaze lifted to rutledges face and then she reached out her hand and caressed the cloth of her husbands coat its not very clean she began then stopped as if afraid to hear why i must ask you to make a formal identification of the clothing if you like ill remove each item and hold it up for you you neednt do that she said huskily its walters but he lifted out the coat the shirt and the trousers all the same along with a necktie where are his shoes and stockings she asked we havent found them so far where did these come from amy asked moving to jennys side and linking arms with her how did you find them the clothing was in the possession of a costermonger near covent garden he claimsim sorry but i must tell you thishe discovered them neatly folded by the river not far from tower bridge but no undergarments and not his wallet that can mean one of two things that mr teller is alive and still wearing them or they were taken awayor went into the riverto keep us guessing about what happened to him no thats not possible amy said its a trick walter was playing a trick on us she had lost her veneer of helpfulness anger replacing it rutledge turned to her surprised what makes you feel it was a trick itit stands to reason walter hasnt killed himself he only wants us to think so so well stop looking she was very upset show me his body and then ill believe you jenny said amy but she turned away im tired she said you mustnt pay any attention to me im justtired edwin had said nothing staring at the clothing as if waiting for it to speak and explain itself but now he said quietly to rutledge put those things back in the box where we cant see them youve made your point chapter as rutledge was refolding the clothing and settling it into the box again jenny teller said thoughtfully the mission station in west africa was by a river i remember walter telling us that he couldnt wear his english clothing therethe damp ruined everything and so he put them in a tin box and left them behind he didnt have a tin box just now but he left his clothing behind as he was accustomed to doing edwin said jennydont no i think its true its oddlycomforting somehow it means hes still alive ive said from the beginning that he was edwin swore under his breath and cast a glance at his wife she was watching jenny a look of anguish in her eyes rutledge set the lid back on the box we dont know what he might be wearing now he warned them the search will be all that much more difficult i understand jenny said she took a deep breath hell come back when hes ready rutledge was halfway to the door when jenny called to him theres something i should tell you i hadnt before it was verypersonal and walter has always been a very private man he turned and waited matron very kindly had a cot put in my husbands room for me so that i might stay with him the night before he disappeared i woke up because i could hear him talking it was only a murmur i couldnt make out the words and at first i thought he must be talking in his sleep but then i remembered another time when id heard him doing the same thing it was when he was writing his book and he had come to a chapter that disturbed himhe kept putting off working on it and i told him that he should just writeyou know like getting back on a horse after its thrown you it might not be the best material but it would be a start and he could revise it when he was finished and so he did and it was that night i heard him talking to himself or to someone i never knew for certain what it was and you think theres a connection yes i think walter has made his decision i think hes decided hes going back into the field there must be something that he feels hes left undone and whats sent him away is that he doesnt know how to tell me edwin and peter must have guessed its why they went looking for him where they did in the passage rutledge met matron coming toward him there is no news she asked im afraid not what do you have there may i know weve found mr tellers clothing i brought it here for mrs teller to identify matron was silent a moment and then she said but you dont know yet that hes dead you havent found him mr teller no as ive just explained to his family if hes wearing different clothes it will make spotting him all that much more difficult and we dont know what other changes he has made unless finding these by the river is an indication that he took his own life she said i think he wanted to die while he was here but wanting something and having the opportunity to achieve it can be two very different things she gazed down the passage the way shed come i must tell you that i had the oddest feeling that mr teller had lost his faith perhaps thats what hes trying so hard to find his wife feels hes made the decision to return to mission work perhaps thats why she said and walked away rutledge looked after her considering her words he was turning to go when he nearly collided with a welldressed man just stepping out of one of the doctors offices pushing an invalid chair the woman swathed in shawls and a motorcar rug looked up and smiled at rutledge her thin illnessravaged face still attractive and sweet he smiled in return and held the door for the man from the clinic rutledge drove directly to bolingbroke street intending to speak to captain teller before either edwin or his wife could describe their conversation with scotland yard hamish said do you believe what yon missionarys wife told you it could be true it would explain many of the loose ends for instance why teller is so insistent that he enroll his son in harrow but why take the boy fra his mother at sich a time and that was the sticking point it might be well to have a word with the family solicitors the house in bolingbroke street was a corner property trees overhanging the tall fence that enclosed the back gardens giving it privacy when rutledge knocked at the door the maid who answered told him that captain teller was in the garden he noted as he passed through the house to the study where french doors gave onto the garden that it had been tastefully decorated with an air of old money that was unmistakable there were two or three landscape paintings of the dutch school and one portrait of a woman in a white gown with rich blue sleeves and ribbons she was of another generation and dressed for a ball but her stance and her dark blue eyes which matched her sleeves suggested intelligence and humor a half smile lurked at the corners of her mouth when rutledge stepped out onto the terrace he could see peter teller sitting in a chair by the small pond his left leg pillowed on a hassock captain teller had stronger features than those shown in the photograph of his brother that rutledge still carried there was already a touch of gray at his temples and his bluegray eyes were bloodshot for the captain was very drunk who are you he demanded i told iris i wasnt at home today inspector rutledge scotland yard im looking into the disappearance of your brother are you indeed well i hope you have better luck than we have had any news nothing promising as rutledge crossed the lawn teller indicated the chair opposite him sit down it strains my back when i have to look up at you rutledge took the chair teller went on im not usually drunk at this hour the last three days have been hellish i do my best but sometimes the medicines my doctor prescribes cant touch the pain id have been better if id let them take the damned leg when they wanted to is there nothing more to be done rutledge asked sympathetically the doctors have washed their hands of me after two or three surgeries and endless treatments with heat and massage and the like they cant think of anything else to do im told that im fortunate the sort of treatments now available didnt exist in the past they took your leg and you went home on crutches or a wooden limb and that was that but you havent come to discuss my leg i take it im hoping that you can shed some light on your brothers disappearance or if not on his state of mind the last time you saw him peter teller was very still for a moment then he said his state of mind the last time i spoke with him was worrying i said something to my brother edwin about it walter seemed to have lost the will to live i expect it was the thought of being paralyzed for the rest of his life and i couldnt blame him there the doctors were doing damn all well to be fair they couldnt tell what should be done i think the consensus was some unknown disease or else walter was losing his mind do you know how his will stands by any chance his will damned if i know but i should think there would be the usual bequests to molliehis housekeeperand the church and the rest left to jenny in trust for harry he frowned trying to clear his head are you suggesting that we ought to be prepared we found your brothers clothing early this morning in possession of a costermonger who claimed hed found them neatly folded close by the river just south of the tower good god peter said blankly is the man telling the truth or do you think something has happened to walter did you speak to edwin what did he have to say were not sure what to think rutledge said thats why im here why did your brother walk out of the clinic without a word to anyone why has he made no effort to reassure his wife that hes alive and well has the marriage been a happy one or is it troubled ii have no answer to give you theres been a disagreement over harrys future but it was bound to come at some point in my opinion walter is wrong on that subject but jenny is jennyshell be angry for a time and then find a way to cope where did you go when you left london to look for your brother where for an instant peter teller seemed to be at a loss and then he asked didnt edwin tell you i had rather hear your version of events damn it ive nothing to add to what he said we went looking for walters old adviser hed left cambridge and moved to scotland it was a wild goose chase which wasnt what amy teller had told rutledge can you give me the direction of walters solicitors id like to speak to them peter teller moved so quickly he knocked his glass from the table at his elbow and he swore as the sudden movement hurt his back the man is still alive as far as we know i think its obscene to read his will before hes dead ive told you as far as i know its straightforward when you find his body come to me and ill give you the name of the firm there was nothing more to be gained from peter teller rutledge thanked him and left walking back through the house he encountered an attractive young woman with hair the color of honey and dark brown eyes she started and said ohi didnt know we had guests rutledge apologized then identified himself scotland yard her gaze shifted to the passage behind him then back again youvewere you speaking to my husband susannah teller then he said ive just come from the garden hes a littleunder the weather she told him i hope youll consider anything he said with that in mind what he wondered had she thought her husband might have said i would like to ask you the same questions if you dont mind ive been put in charge of the search for your brotherinlaw apparently you went to cornwall on the off chance that he might be there it was hardly an off chance as you put it his family had a summer cottage just north of st ives and they often spent holidays there the cottage was sold at his fathers death but he might not have remembered that he might have wanted a quiet sanctuary why why leave his wife to worry if hed recovered why not take her with him she was watching his face we were trying to think where he might have gone thats all cornwall was a place of happy memories what would you have done if youd found him in cornwall confused and difficult to handle ii dont believe i considered that possibility i thought he might be grateful that someone was there and come back with me without fuss rutledge let it go whatever motivations the teller family had had for going off on their own they werent about to confide in the police until walter teller was found dead there was no way to persuade his family otherwise has teller had a history of such disappearances good heavens no nor has he ever been this ill except of course for his bouts of malaria thats what was so worrying was not is as if the solution was already known to them rutledge said early this morning the police discovered tellers clothing in the possession of a man who claims he found them beside the thames but he couldnt have she caught herself and added surely you dont believe walter drowned himself i wont for one mrs teller the mans been missing for several days half of london is searching for him and hes nowhere to be found suicide to put it bluntly remains an option with that he thanked her and wished her a good day but he had the strongest feeling that a good day was not in the cards for the teller family it had been a long morning he changed his mind about going on to the yard and instead turned toward francess house rutledge had spent as much time as he could spare from the yard with his godfather during the day trevor entertained the boy with the swans in st jamess park the ravens at the tower and the giraffes at the regents park zoo and in the evenings after the child had been put to bed the two men sat in the garden talking as they had once done before the war and the loss it had brought in its wake trevor had been a very fine architect before the death of his son had sent him into early retirement he said one night i remember when your parents lived here in this house and the parties they gave nothing elaborate you understand but we always enjoyed those evenings sometimes your mother would sit in the drawing room and play the piano while your father and i took our brandy out here after dinner she was such a fine pianist your father was very proud of that rutledge said i remember her playing i wish frances would use the piano from time to time but it sits closed from one year to the next yes trevor sighed tell me about frances she hasnt married was there someone in particular i always thought she might marry ross but there was someone else she loved for a time nothing came of it nothing could lately there was another man who seemed to take her fancy i thought she was in love with him but she hasnt mentioned him for some weeks and what about you rutledge moved uneasily in his chair i dont think ive healed sufficiently from the war to think about marrying anyone you arent still grieving for jean are you rutledge looked away watching the twilight fade to night no i grieve for her but not out of love out of sadness that her life wasnt filled with the happiness she was searching for so hard yes the war to end all war hasnt turned out to be the blessing they promised us it would be i look back at king edwards reign and i think to myself we were blissfully unaware of what was to come although there had been some talk about the kaisers ambitions no one took it seriously i remember those days as sunlit and untrammeled by shadows rutledge replied at a guess half of britain feels the same they laughed quietly in the darkness and frances said as she stepped out into the garden have i missed something trevor held out a hand we were longing for the past a sign were growing old come and sit here next to me what time do we leave tomorrow to drive down to kent and she told him as she came to join them in the back of rutledges mind hamish said softly the scots accent pronounced and the day after they leave are ye no glad of that rutledge found that he wasnt chapter the next morning constable evans ran rutledge to ground at his sisters house just as he was seeing his godfather and frances off on their excursion to kent to call on melinda crawford they were trying to persuade rutledge to join them after all when evans appeared rutledge was not loathe to miss the journey and the reminder of pressing business at the yard was timely while he was very fond of melinda rutledge wasnt comfortable spending so many hours in the company of three people who knew him entirely too well melinda who had survived the lucknow massacre during the great mutiny in india knew more than most about the scars war could leave behind and for far too long now hed been hardpressed to avoid her sharp questions about the shadows under his eyes and the thinness that came from tension and long sleepless nights expecting to be told that there was fresh information about walter teller he went to his office summoned sergeant gibson and said evans told me it was urgent what do you have for me the chief superintendent sent evans along to fetch you youd best hear it from him rutledge went along the passage to find bowles fuming in his office he looked up as rutledge appeared in the open doorway and said what kept you im sorry sir i came as quickly as i could theres been another stabbing are you quite sure theres nothing more you can tell us about this man you call billy i saw him only briefly who is the victim this time thats the trouble this time it was the secretary to an mp just leaving the house and walking along the embankment to clear his head bynum his name is theres going to be one hell of an uproar over this if youd held on to the young bastard while you had him wed not be facing the wrath of parliament and theres no break on the teller inquiry what have you been doing with your time ive spoken to everyone but the sister leticia teller i was planning to drive to suffolk today see that you deal with this latest knifing first there may be something you can learn from the only witness as for the tellers mind how you go i dont want them on my doorstep complaining that you arent handling the matter to their satisfaction do you understand me yes i do understand but i have a feeling that there isnt going to be a happy solution to this case if we find teller alive he may be in a worse state than he was in the hospital then the sooner you find him the better by the time rutledge arrived at the embankment the body had been taken away but the police were still combing the area looking for evidence the sergeant in charge by the name of walker greeted rutledge and said we arent certain why the assailant was lurking on this side of the bridge sir he wasnt likely to find a target at that hour of the night and with dawn coming as early as it does this time of year he could well have been spotted hamish said quietly he was looking for you rutledge nearly answered him aloud catching himself only just in time why he demanded silently because yeve seen his face but rutledge wasnt sure that he agreed to walker he said which way did he go did your witness see that back across the bridge sir then its likely its the same man i encountered so i understand sir theres been a rash of robberies at knifepoint did they tell you that at the yard but in most cases the victim handed over his money without a struggle and then was instructed to count to one hundred before turning around most did as they were told and of course he was gone by the time they looked behind them we think it must be the same person as killed this mr bynum walker shook his head sad isnt he was only just having a breath of fresh air because his wallet and his coat were still in his office he had nothing to give his murderer id only been told about the one other attempt which had ended in death and that was on westminster bridge where have these robberies occurred mostly south of the river sir he doesnt venture this far often but there are fatter purses on this side of the bridge all told hes got no more than forty pounds so far hes too young to have a family to feed unless its his mother hes supporting there may be brothers and sisters younger than he is as to that sir wed only be guessing but hes killed twice now one of the constables searching along the path looked up and called here sir walker and rutledge hurried to where he was standing a mans coat button sir he said pointing it out anyone walking along here could have lost it the sergeant told him but well have it anyway in case rutledge took it from the constables hand it was a very ordinary button dark brown and with four holes in it for a coat as the constable had said remembering the drawers of buttons to choose from in the tailors shop he said youre right it would be hard to prove either way but we might be lucky on the river a boat swept by and bursts of laughter carried over the water wheres this witness you spoke of a constable took him along for a bite to eat the man looked half starved how much did he see he said he was coming from the direction of the abbey walking toward the bridge when he heard something that sounded like someone choking he turned toward the sound in time to see one man falling down and another bending over him as if trying to help but then he saw that the second man was rifling the pockets of the first and he shouted for him to stop the second man turned and stared at him for several seconds then turned and ran by the time our witness reached the victim he was dying but there was nothing anyone could do the witness stayed with him then saw a motorcar on the road coming toward the bridge and shouted for help and youre certain this witness wasnt the killer he was in the clear he neednt have hailed the motorcar and hed made an effort to staunch the bleeding yes youre right it sounds as if hes exactly what he claims to be walker was looking toward the road here he comes now sir with the constable rutledge turned the constable was walking beside a vagrant a man in shabby clothes unshaven and thin he moved with a limp as if footsore his eyes cast down as if searching the pavement for lost coins rutledge went to meet them and greeted the constable before speaking to his companion i understand you witnessed what happened here last night i did it was murder right enough there were two men struggling together and one fell the other knelt beside him and i thought at first he was trying to help but then i saw he was going through the other mans pockets he ran as i came up the mans voice was rough a workingmans accent did you get a good look at the one who ran away rutledge asked it was too dark but he ran like a young person quick and with ease i thought he must be wearing padded shoes he made almost no sound rutledge remembered how easily billy had crept up on him yes thats quite possible anything else his size his age he looked to be about eighteen or nineteen well set up he was wearing a cap i couldnt see his hair dark he squinted as if in thought i cant remember anything more it happened very quickly and then i was more concerned for the victim he seemed ill at ease now eager to be off how long did he live after you got to him a matter of seconds i couldnt tell in the dark then he wasnt able to speak no who was he do you know the man glanced toward where the body had lain theyve just identified him walker said one of the constables happened to recognize him george bynum hed stayed late to finish a paper he was preparing for debate in the next session a bit of bad luck that and your name rutledge asked the witness hood charlie hood the words were clipped unwillingly given thank you for coming forward mr hood if youll go with the constable now someone will take your statement and you can sign it hood hesitated i dont have a regular place to live thats all right just so we can find you if we need to have you identify the man once we have him in custody rutledge told him hood bobbed his head in acknowledgment and turned to follow the constable someone was calling to them again and rutledge went with walker to see what the constable had found this was more promisinga small scrap of paper that had an address scribbled on it in pencil it was off the lambeth road we cant be sure its his walker said examining it but it could have fallen from his pocket when he pulled out the knife send someone there at once rutledge advised walker the sooner the better walker nodded to the constable who had found the scrap right you are son see what you can discover the constable hurried away toward the bridge half an hour later the search by the bridge was called off rutledge his mind on the long drive to suffolk and back said ive got to go if anything comes of the address leave word with sergeant gibson at the yard hell see that i get it rutledge was halfway to his motorcar when he stopped short and swore setting out at a dead run he went back to find walker who was just leaving the scene of the crime himself where did your constable take hood the yard or the station to the station is anything wrong i hope to god there isnt rutledge responded and hurried in the direction of trafalgar square with any luck at all he told himself hed reach the station in time but he didnt hood had given his statement and gone rutledge asked for the address hed used and drove there next it was a stationers shop near st pauls rutledge left his motorcar in the street and went inside the woman behind the counter greeted him with a smile that faded quickly as he asked if she knew of anyone by the name of hood charlie hood but she didnt he described hood and she told him that such a person was not likely to be among the shops clientele rutledge thanked her and left while the voice of hamish macleod drummed in his head he drove back to the police station and circled the blocks as best he could on the off chance that he could spot hood again but by this time the streets were busy people hurrying about their business and one man could be anywhere coming out of a pub just after hed passed walking into a shop just before he arrived it was a waste of time but he gave it an hour anyway he couldnt be sure but something about the shabby scruffybearded man had struck him and he wanted to speak to him again what had walker said that the man was coming from the direction of the abbey and that a constable had taken him to find something to eat he told himself it couldnt be walter teller but there was a good chance that it might have been rutledge drove on to suffolk to a small village not far from the essex border the house he was searching for was down a lane beyond the high steepled church a winding stretch of road bordered by wildflowers that meandered another quarter of a mile before he saw the stone gates the house itself was not as large as witch hazel farm but set among trees as it was he could feel the country quiet and hear birds singing as he came to a halt by the door he was directed to the gardens by a housekeeper and there he found leticia teller entertaining a small boy who was squatting by a pool watching pollywogs swim through the murky water and theres another one harry she pointed one out to him just there beside the lily pad ohthere it goes another woman sat in the shade smiling fondly at the child miss teller looked up as rutledge came through the hedge she was tall like her brothers her face a softer version of peters attractive with hazel eyes and a presence that some might find chilly he gave his name and showed her his identification and she proceeded to look him up and down i didnt know the yard had been brought into this matter from her tone he thought she disapproved of such a move i believe you were in portsmouth when that decision was made he countered perhaps it might be wise to speak privately she turned to harry well well leave the pollywogs to rest awhile shall we i think there might be lemonade in the kitchen if you ask nicely and clean your feet before you run in the boy straightened a sturdy fairhaired child with a ready smile they wont go away will they no they live here and theyll be waiting when you come back he nodded happily and dashed off walters son leticia teller told rutledge she turned to the other woman who had risen from the bench on which shed been sitting and come to join them mary brittingham jenny tellers sister she was fair like her sister but a little shorter a pretty woman with an air of someone who knew her own worth miss brittingham he acknowledged now to what has brought you here is there any news you wouldnt have come all this way if there wasnt clothing that has been identified as your brothers was found by the river mrs teller recognized them but theres no news of walter mary put in none are you saying that the police believe hes drowned himself while in an unsound state of mind nonsense i dont believe it for a moment leticia teller led them to a circle of chairs out on the terrace do sit down inspector im not drawing conclusions rutledge said taking the chair indicated but the possibility is there why did your brother leave the hospital miss teller he chose a time when his wife was not at his side he dressed himselfor someone helped him dressand he walked away who helped him dress she asked sharply wemy brothers and iwere in edwins house when the news came of his disappearance who was there to help thats what we would like very much to know he turned to mary brittingham you were not in london at the time no i went to monmouthshire to fetch harry and brought him back to stay with me while jenny was at the clinic with walter hes been with me ever since she took a deep breath he believes his parents are visiting friends i didnt have the heart to tell him otherwise if walter teller dressed himself and left the clinic knowingly where would he be likely to go rutledge asked them mary said its possible you know that he left the clothing by the river himself to buy himself a little time to think thats probably why he left the clinic in the first place leticia teller regarded her with distaste are you saying that my brother is aware of what hes doing i think its likely that he hasnt found a solution to whatever caused him to be ill in the first place did you know hed heard from his bishop they want him back he wrote to tell me he didnt know how to answer them no i hadnt heard that leticia said slowly he said nothing to us about it or to jenny he felt jenny was distressed enough over harry i dont think walter wants to go back into the field im of two minds myself i know they need good men experienced men but i dont think walter is emotionally prepared to resume his work he told jenny before the war that hed spent too much of his life in places where he felt hed done very little good he was praised for his honesty leticia said after the book came out you know how people admired it he gave the proceeds to his mission society for good works i imagine in lieu of his physical presence in the field you saw his book as a triumph i saw it as an exorcism thats an odd choice of words rutledge put in mary said ive always believed in the importance of mission work i think a great deal of good can be done by setting an example and the alcock society has been especially fortunate in the people theyve sent into the field but walter was a missionary by default because his father gave him to the church and because he was unsuited to parish work i know she said turning to leticia that this is hard for you to hear but if walter comes through his present crisis alive and whole it would be a travesty to send him back to africa or china you must see that leticia replied i believe this is walters decision to make and hes made it by falling ill hes made it what other reason can there be for him to vanish as hes done i tried to explain this to jenny when i was in london she doesnt want him to go abroad again of course she doesnt but i think she has this rather naive belief that hes a saint and she mustnt stand in his way he isnt a saint hes bitter i dont think his calling has anything to do with his illness leticia was adamant then how else would you explain it coming on the heels of his letter from the society mary regarded her with exasperation rutledge listening could see that the two women had very little in common their relationship by marriage was their only connection and even that was tenuous interrupting again he said do either of you have any idea where he may be but they didnt and he could see that both women were far more worried than either of them was willing to admit to the other i just want to see jenny happy mary said as if shed read his thoughts she tries hard and she loves walter without question and that could lead her to heartbreak leticia said grudgingly i must admit youre right there walter is not like his brothers he lost something out there in africa and china part of himself he lost it when he failed in his first living it was the wrong church for him to be sent to and the congregation was not prepared for an intellectual priest they wanted someone more like themselves a local man who understood them leticia said you didnt even know him then how can you judge that mary turned to rutledge i met walter when he spoke at a meeting i was attending about his work in china in fact it was i who introduced him to jenny the tension between the two women was interesting rutledge thought perhaps the root cause of it was familial mary was bound to protect her sister and leticias loyalty was to her brother he said interjecting a new question before hard feelings arose on either side have you heard mr teller mention anyone by the name of charlie hood they stared at him the question completely unexpected it was clear that the name meant nothing at all to either of the women and possibly he had made too much of it as well but there had been something in the mans face that he couldnt identify something he felt he ought to recognize harry came racing back gleefully informing his aunts that there had indeed been lemonade rutledge watching him could see in him the boy that ian trevor would be at the same age it was an unexpected insight and it touched him he took his leave refusing miss tellers lukewarm invitation to stay for tea he thought it had been in a way a suggestion that mary brittingham should also refuse it in her turn that she had also outstayed her welcome miss teller walked with him through the hedge and around to where hed left his motorcar saying as they went will he come back do you think your brother when hes ready to be found if whatever reason he left the clinic is resolved for him in a fashion he can live with the problem is how lucid is he is he thinking clearly or still in the throes of his illness even though the paralysis has apparently disappeared she nodded thoughtfully and then stood there as he cranked the motorcar he was on the point of driving away when she came to his side of the vehicle and put her hand on the door even as a child walter would take to something new with almost ferocious enthusiasm and then he would tire of it and lose interest domestic life may havepalled are you telling me hes bored with his marriage no that he may have decided to do good works among londons poor to salve his conscience rather than converting the heathen if he doesnt come back this may be of some comfort to jenny when you went to portsmouth you didnt actually believe that your brother would take ship without a word to anyone such a journey requires an enormous amount of preparation i should think he asked her leticia teller shrugged eloquently in the first shock of his disappearance anything seemed possible it was a chance i didnt feel i could take and my brothers agreed even while they disagreed hamish said shes lying ill keep that in mind as well he told her and let in the clutch she stepped back and let him go over her shoulder he could see mary brittingham standing at the opening in the hedge watching them but then mary smiled and waved when she saw him looking in her direction twa women ye ken with a child holding them together hamish said as the boy ran up to mary and clung to her hand and then he darted forward to take leticias hand as well and wave goodbye to the man from london who had come unexpectedly it was late when rutledge reached london he stopped by the yard to see if there were any developments in the search for the boy he called billy or if hood had been located but like many of their ilk they had disappeared into the dark corners of a city that knew how to keep secrets chapter the journey to kent had been successful and both frances and david trevor were in high spirits carrying melinda crawfords greeting and best love to rutledge and telling him about the great pheasant hunt that had left them all exhausted and hurting from laughter a stray pheasant had wandered into melindas garden and the boy had been very taken with it he had persuaded his grandfather to let him carry it back to scotland if he could capture it that had led to an afternoon of merriment as every scheme they had tried saw the pheasant still at large and mocking them from a safe distance in the end it was ian who had tired first and after one last glorious chase through the kitchen gardens had ended with the promise of cake for tea the pheasant had been forgotten listening to them rutledge was reminded of another child bribed by the promise of lemonade unaware that his father was missing and possibly no longer the familiar figure the boy remembered he joined in the laughter despite the days frustrations unwilling to spoil their high spirits and found the tension in his mind slowly relaxing it wasnt until they were saying good night that rutledge remembered that his godfather would be leaving on the morrow the time had gone too quickly and hed got his wishto be too busy to spend much of the day with trevor and the child he regretted that now as he drove back to his flat but there had been no way to change it even if hed recognized the need in time the next morning as rutledge collected his godfathers cases and stowed them in the boot he wished he could find the words to ask trevor to stay longer but hamish in the back of his mind had been a source of stressful emotions while david trevor talked of scotland and the war and his son ross of the boys young governess who was being courted by a solicitor in edinburgh of things best forgotten of people left unnamed consequently fatigue had racked him and rutledge had spent sleepless nights walking the streets in the cool summer darkness until he was too tired to stay awake and still hamish reminded him over and over again of what he a dead man lying in a french grave had lost there was nothing left now except their goodbyes coming to the door of the house rutledge said to his godfather i think thats everything frances kissing first david and then the boy goodbye wished them a safe journey and sent her love to morag along with the gaily wrapped shawl that rutledge had purchased for this woman who had served the trevor household as long as he could remember he had wanted to buy one in tartan plaid but frances had told him that the seagreen irish woolen one was a better choice he hoped she was right the boy scooped up his box of toy soldiers hugged frances again and ran out to the motorcar excited to travel by train once more he had already asked over and over whether he could come back again to london they reached the station in no time at all and rutledge had been silent most of the drive fighting with himself and with hamish over how to prolong the visit then they were in the station the train was coming in amidst clouds of white steam that set the boy dancing with glee and it was time to board rutledge said hurriedly before it was too late im glad you came trevor smiled im glad i came as well and ill do it again if you fail to come north to us rutledge said tightly i cantnot yet not ever the men you commanded and sent to their deaths have forgiven you long ago ian when will you forgive yourself trevors words were too close to the mark rutledge could only answer time that was as far as he could trust his voice time has a way of slipping through our fingers then they were embracing the carriage door was closing and rutledge could hear a whistle somewhere down the line as the engine gathered steam the train began to move trevor had dropped his window and called back to his godson christmas ian come for christmas rutledge stood there knowing it was too late far too late and waved the train out of sight from the station he drove to the belvedere clinic to inform jenny teller that there was no word still on her husbands whereabouts but when he got there he was told that mrs teller had stepped out with her sisterinlaw for a cup of tea matron said mrs teller is quickly losing heart it took some persuasion to convince her that it was all right to leave for a little while will you tell her for me that there has been no news you could probably catch themtheyve only just left he was restless not in the mood to sit in a tea shop and tell a wife that her husband was still missing and that the yard couldnt find him despite all its trained personnel and experience no let her have her brief respite ill only remind her of what shes trying to put out of her mind matron said thats very generous of you ill see that she gets your message he went instead to marlborough street to ask edwin teller if he possessed a later photograph of his brother only to be told that mr edwin teller was resting and left orders not to be disturbed nor was amy teller available at the yard in the passage on the way to his own office he encountered chief superintendent bowles who said in passing still no trace of teller and that witness you wanted from bynums knifing hasnt been found either are you certain hes not the man were after hes a witness nothing more i just wanted to ask him other questions i saw billy remember more clearly even than hood who called him dark your priority is the teller case ill put mickelson on to finding bynums killer he cleared his throat are you quite certain teller is still alive we cant give more manpower to the search for him with this murder case hanging over us but i wouldnt wish the family to feel we arent doing all we can at least thank god there has been no plague theres something wrong with this inquiry rutledge told him i sometimes feel im chasing a ghost nevertheless if you know whats best youll find himor whats become of himas soon as may be am i understood yes sir have you taken the time to read tellers book it might be useful ill keep that in mind rutledge moved on pausing to speak briefly to sergeant gibson just as constable turner came up the stairs two at a time gibson frowning said that ones in a tearing rush turner reached chief superintendent bowles and saluted smartly sir theres a train off the tracks up the line word just came in rutledge called to him which train the northbound to edinburgh turner answered over his shoulder rutledge said quickly where man where did it derail just to the north of a village called waddington not that far but rutledge was already racing for the stairs his mind filled with his godfathers last words time has a way of slipping through our fingers if hed asked trevor to stay if hed come out with the words in time they wouldnt have been on that train he ran to where hed left his motorcar out of breath and damning himself for not speaking up when hed had the chance rutledge drove out of london at the best speed he could make cursing the motorcars and lorries and pedestrians that held him up as soon as the outskirts of the city lay behind him he gunned the motor and prayed he would be in time chapter the train to the north had just come around a curve before it derailed and that had slowed its speed enough to prevent a catastrophe it was bad enough as it was three of the carriages were still smoking when rutledge got there a fire having started from a spark from the firebox it was a scene of chaos people milling about debris everywhere twisted metal and the stark white of shorn wood marking where the worst of the damage had occurred the great engine lay half on its side like some wounded beast and steam still trickled from the cooling boiler the cars nearest it had accordioned before they derailed as he slowed the motorcar and looked across the flat pasture that had been scarred and torn by the impact he could see where a short row of bodies already lay covered in whatever was to hand coats a blanket and even a tarp marked piers brewery in block letters that someone must have carried down from a brewery wagon left in the middle of the road the horses standing patiently heads down half asleep in their traces he could hear people crying and shouting and a child screaming hamish said oer there hamish had always had the keenest hearing in the company rutledge turned to look for a small boy and saw instead a little girl crouched beside her weeping mother neither of them able to take in what had happened to them he hurried across the uneven ground and knelt by the girl and she clung to him as the mother said her fathertheyre having to cut him out of the carriage comforting both of them as best he could he scanned over their heads looking for a man and a boyor come to that either of them alone then a woman from the nearest village was there to help and he left her to it moving past broken carriages toward the pathetic remains recovered before hed arrived he looked at each in turn and felt a swift surge of hope trevor and his grandson werent among the dead it was difficult now to be sure which carriage hed put his godfather in and so he leaned into the wreckage of each one as he walked down the line calling trevors name trevor and the child were not there either i should have begged him to stay rutledge said aloud unaware that hed spoken its my fault its no your fault hamish said thereyon man waving he helped lift three more passengers down from damaged windows or doorways then with another mans aid pulled a fourth from the rubble it was a woman too frightened to cry her eyes huge in her pale face she looked around dazed uncertain and then saw her husband standing to one side earnestly telling the man who was clumsily bandaging his arm that his wife was still in the carriage with a small sound like that of a frightened animal she stumbled toward him and he buried his face in her shoulder gripping her with his good arm rutledge walked on still searching more people were arriving to help as word spread among them was a doctor who began to organize a makeshift infirmary listening to hamish scanning faces trying to keep his own fear at bay rutledge did what he could a woman crouched in the opening where a carriage door had once stoodthe splintered remains still clinging to torn hingescalled to him he clambered over wreckage to lift her down and then hand her over the worst of the debris she was mumbling disjointed prayers interspersed with hail marys he could see the blood in her fair hair another cut bleeding through a tear in the sleeve of her shirtwaist he turned to look for the doctor urging her to come with him when she pulled free no dont leave theres someone still in therei think shes dead can you walk as far as that line of trees he asked her gently where the women are helping others like you do you see ill do what i can here she nodded holding on to his arm until she had regained her balance and then walked on a woman in an apron came to collect her and guide her the rest of the way offering words of encouragement and comfort rutledge turned back to the task at hand testing his footing he pulled himself into the compartment shed just left a redfaced man sweating from exertion came up just then and said theres a doctor coming down the line looking for the worst cases were you a passenger ive come to help then follow me the woman just therethe one walking to the treesneeds medical attention and she told me someone is still trapped in here have a look then ill be back as soon as ive passed the word the compartment he was in was a shambles seats at an angle door hanging ajar he almost put his foot through a hole in the flooring and then felt the car shift very slightly rutledge paused then gingerly swung himself around the splintered door into the passage beyond but there was no access that way he came back again and tried to shift the splintered door at first it wouldnt budge then it gave way with a groan nearly pitching him forward onto feet and a pale rose skirt he caught himself in time waited a moment for the carriage to settle again and then crept through the opening hed made from the far side he was able to slide the door out of the way then turn to the injured passenger it was a young woman her trim ankles almost touching the toe of his left boot she lay on her side her face hidden by a valise that had fallen next to her and all he could see was a shoulder and dark hair a crumpled hat lay beyond the crown of her head there was just room to kneel beside her rutledge said miss can you hear me he wasnt sure what it was that warned him but just as she moved her head crying out a little with the effort he recognized her it was meredith channing she was dazed her eyes not focusing right away but then she saw him and there was an intake of breath as her gaze sharpened ian were you on the train as well are you all right i came as soon as i heardi was in london but how did you know i was on board i didnt i came to look for my godfather she tried to smile is he all right i havent found him yet he said making an effort to keep the worry out of his voice how badly are you hurt he was afraid to touch her but she had trained as a nurse and he waited for her assessment i dont know my shoulderi think it must be broken or dislocated he could see blood on her stockings and one shoe was missing and there was a smear of blood across her cheek the carriage swayed again i must get you out of here its not safe no please it hurts too much to move glancing beyond her he could just see a mans legs he got to his feet and leaned forward for a better look the man was dead there was no doubt of it and suddenly he wondered if the two of them had been traveling together he knelt again by her side youre one of the lucky ones he said trying to divert her theres a man in one of the other carriages pinned where no one can get to him and hes bleeding can you move your feet she wiggled her toes they seem to be all right she said a little bruised from the tossing about its my shouldermy chestthat hurts your fingers now he told her move them if you can but only her free hand could obey are you dizzy did you hit your head on anything i was knocked down and lost my hat but i dont think i hit my head it was my shoulder that took the brunt of the fall he looked just beyond her at the hat that matched her coat he reached for it and at the same time the seat against which mrs channing lay shifted with a grinding noise the dead man beyond her moved as well sliding away as she cried out rutledge sank back to his heels reached again and using just his fingers he coaxed the hat toward him until it fell into his hand not too much the worse for wear he said putting it down beside her ian i know what the pain most likely represents and moving is agony id have sat up long ago if it werent for that i cant think how im going to get out of here he smiled someone said a doctor was on his way the redfaced man was back leaning into the carriage he called anyone there did you find her yes rutledge said a woman broken or dislocated shoulder we need to get her out ill find someone to help clear a way out of there he was gone again and meredith channing said lightly a reprieve meredith it will take some time to clear a path for you it might be best not to wait this carriage could be resting on whats out there it could be all that keeps it from sliding down onto its side its already halfway there do you understand ive been selfish there are others who need help more than i do she was silent for a moment then she said do what you must and dont mind if i beg you dont stop someone stepped into the carriage at its far end and it swayed again dangerously it was the redfaced man im afraid to move much closer in this direction stand by rutledge told him then to meredith channing said first you must sit up ill help you brace that shoulder as best i can he took off his belt and with her assistance drew it across her body bringing her bad arm close to her chest she whimpered with the pain biting her lip and clenching her hands he didnt want to think how much it must have hurt but he managed to move her into a sitting position her face was pale with pain her dark hair spilling out of its pins and falling over her shoulders giving her a few moments to collect herself and steady her breathing he said now you must stand do you see my shoe if im to walk out of herethe splinters he looked around and there was the shoe under the seat he gave it to her then took it back and put it on her bare foot himself tying the laces all right let me help with your weight hold on to me with your good arm and ill make it as painless as possible he tried but she fainted before he could lift her to her feet while she was unconscious he carried her closer to the door of the next compartment and then through it but the redfaced man wasnt there it was someone else saying sharply here what do you think youre doing his shirt was torn and bloody his trousers ripped to the knee and blood dripped from a cut on his ear im a doctor he went on she may have internal injuries broken ribs its her shoulder rutledge said either broken or dislocated let me see but as he stepped toward rutledge the car swayed again the sound of metal rending and wood snapping dear god is there anyone else in there i saw a man hes dead can you be sure im from scotland yard yes im sure all right pass her to me we cant stand on ceremony now rutledge did as he was told lifting merediths limp body through the outer door barely on its hinges and clear of the carriage the sun touched merediths face and her eyelids fluttered the doctor bracing himself with the help of the redfaced man took her from rutledge and then between them lowered her safely to the ground the doctor knelt and felt her shoulder youre right dislocated lets get her away from here were collecting cases under that tree over there can you carry her that far yes of course then ill keep going and come back to you have you seen a manwith a young boy ive come to find them a good few men are all right i havent seen a boy among them the doctor helped him lift meredith channing again bracing her bad arm and then disappeared into the carriage rutledge had just left to look at the man rutledge carried her to the area where the walking wounded were being collected and someone there spread a blanket over the bruised grass for him to lay her on he took off his coat rolled it and set it under her head then he remembered her hat stay with her he said to the woman beside her and jogged back to the train the doctor was just coming out again you were right hes dead broke his neck from what i could see he wanted to ask the doctor if he had searched the mans pockets for his identification instead he asked theres a rose hat just behind youand a small valise the woman yes they all worry about such things he said testily but handed both out to rutledge when he reached the trees again meredith channing was conscious her eyes bright with unshed tears from the pain as he put her things beside her she offered him a bleak smile ian she murmured i thought id imagined you there was something i had to do he said sitting down beside her trying to judge whether she was comfortable enough to leave and continue his search she shut her eyes again frowning a little i must have fainted yes a good thing she tried to nod and then thought better of it after a moment she said your friend did you find him my godfather not yet ohyesthats right i remember she opened her eyes go and look im all right but she still seemed a little dazed after a bit he said now come back and tell me when you find him will you i shant be going anywhere it seems he took her good hand and held it for a moment before letting it go walking swiftly away he scanned the people working around the wrecked carriages more had appeared now from the village and from a distance as word spread and three more bodies had been added to the makeshift morgue but trevor was not among them he found himself thinking about the man just beyond where meredith channing had been lying tall graying distinguished hamish said it doesna signify leave it clearing his mind of everything else he started back up the line leaning in to see who might still be in each carriage sometimes helping rescuers bring out another injured passenger sometimes unable to see beyond the upturned seats and collapsed ceilings and always calling trevors name to be sure and then suddenly there was his godfather coming toward him a bloody handkerchief tied around one hand a cut across his forehead and a decided limp in his stride the boy clung to him still clutching the box of toy soldiers rutledge was so relieved he stopped unable to speak the two men stared at each other trevor saying what in hells name are you doing here news reached the yard and i came directly well im afraid youll have to put up with us for a few days more rutledge began to laugh helplessly then he said where have you been i must have walked up and down this train a dozen times on the far side of the engine examining all the wheels where the lad couldnt see what he shouldnt we were very lucky in our car but they want us to give our names to a constable and so i came round to find him rutledge remembered meredith channing do you see my motorcar there on the road when youve given your name to the constable go to it and wait i wont be long ive promised someone id come back trevor nodded go on well be all right taking in his godsons appearance scraped and bloody and disheveled he added if you need to stay longer and let his voice trail off rutledge answered the unspoken question like you she was lucky there is the constable i think and then he was gone hurrying back the way hed come he could feel trevor watching him as he turned toward the trees he was ready to propose that he bring meredith channing back to london with them but when he reached the blanket where hed left her she was gone his coat was still there and his belt he looked around a frown on his face to see where shed been moved a woman sitting nearby said are you looking for the pretty young woman she said someone might come i believe they carried her to a house in the village theyve been moving the injured wherever possible ill be next he realized she was clutching her arm and saw that it was broken the bruising already dark he hesitated torn if you see hertell her i found the man i was looking for and i must take him back to london if she needs me she can send for me ill come for her but he had a feeling she wouldnt send for him he had a feeling that what she had seen when hed turned to her a few weeks earlier had shown her what was wrong with him shed been a nurse shed been at the front she would recognize shell shock and know him for what he was and he couldnt explain he couldnt tell her about hamish he could never tell anyone in another part of his mind he saw that shed taken the hat and the valise with her no excuse then for him to follow her to the village and knock on doors and he shouldnt leave the boy in this chaos while he searched thanking the woman he went back to his motorcar listening to the silence that had been hamishs response since hed found meredith channing a constable stopped him asking him for the names of any persons on the train he might have known he gave the man three names and then thought about it and asked you dont happen to know where mrs channing has been taken which house in the village no sir i dont ive been given the task of collecting names others are seeing to the comfort of the injured another thought occurred to him he pointed to the carriage still teetering on its neighbor theres a dead man still in that one he described him my name is rutledge scotland yard if you learn who he is ill like to be told the constables gaze lifted from the papers he was holding to focus on rutledge does the yard have an interest in him then no its justi thought i recognized him thats all the man nodded and moved on rutledge stood there still hearing in his mind the lie hed just told hamish broke his long silence it doesna signify he said again hes deid the dead can live on rutledge answered grimly death is not always the end i should know chapter after settling trevor and his grandson in their rooms to rest reassuring frances and promising to send a telegram to scotland informing the trevor household that man and boy were safe and would come north again as soon as the line was cleared rutledge went home to change his own clothes he thought that his godfather and the boy would sleep for a while and cast about for something to amuse his namesake and take his mind off events hed been unusually quiet on the journey to london leaning against his grandfathers shoulder in the motorcar and reluctant to let him out of his sight rutledge decided a river journey to hampton court might suit and stopped in mayfair again to tell his sister what a lovely thought ian will you go with us theres business at the yard to see to when i heard of the train crash i simply walked out and drove straight to the site it must have been dreadful you look as if you could use a rest as well he laughed sheer worry it took some time to find david and the boy i had imagined every catastrophe known to man by the time i saw them safe and whole she smiled with him understanding that he was speaking lightly of something too frightful to contemplate i didnt like to ask in front of david were many hurt injured and killed he told her and then before he could stop himself he said meredith channing was on the train as well dear god is she all right did you bring her back to london too shed already been taken away by the time i found david i expect the doctors were working on her shoulder it was dislocated i left a message for her to let me know if there was anything more i could do that was kind and then feminine curiosity took over do you know where she was going she answered her own question was it to inverness he hadnt considered that possibility she might have been traveling alone after all he found he wasnt as sorry as he ought to be that her journey was interrupted she never said there was no time to talk about anything but finding help for the injured no of course not ill call on her later in the week he left then and drove to the yard but there was no news of walter teller and no one had located charlie hood frustrated rutledge shut himself in his office and turned his chair to face the window walter teller he thought had had to survive unimaginable difficulties in the field he had had to be clever enough as well to deal with unexpected problems facing his flock not to speak of coping with doubters and those who clung stubbornly to their own gods even to the point of threatening him and his converts the climate would have been against him the long journeys in and out of his mission post would have been trying hed been responsible for the lives of his converts and would have had to keep their faith fresh in spite of tribulations and setbacksa failed harvest an infestation of insects plagues and natural disasters and war even on a tribal scale then what could possibly have frightened the man between his london bank and his house in essex hamish his voice loud in the small office said his son and that son had been walter tellers first concern when he finally reached his house yet he had walked away from harry as well as his wife hardly more than a week later had his dead father insisted that the heir go away to school at such an early age rutledge had been told that but there was no proof he wished hed thought to ask leticia teller about it wanting to go against his dead fathers wishes was hardly reason enough to have a breakdown of the magnitude that had assailed teller there was the letter from the mission society but teller hadnt got ill immediately after receiving it rutledge turned and reached for his hat it was time to find the alcock society and ask a few questions he discovered through sources at the yard that the society had a small house outside of aylesford kent and he drove there without waiting for an appointment aylesford with its handsome narrow bridge and narrower twisting streets was a pretty little town on the medway the house rutledge was seeking was within sight of the church it was a tudor building almost as narrow as it was tall he knocked at the door and was received by an elderly man in rusty black his long face wrinkled with age and exposure to the sun rutledge identified himself and explained his errand mr forester it seemed was the secretary of the society and handled all correspondence for it the alcock he informed rutledge had been founded in the early part of the nineteenth century and since that time had been very well supported by patrons who believed in the societys work and its attempt to bring enlightenment to the forgotten parts of the world victoria herself had visited the tiny headquarters before she had succeeded to the throne and above the hearth there was a small painting of the event done by foresters predecessor he pointed it out proudly and invited rutledge to admire it he asked rutledge to join him for tea and they sat in the parlor on chairs rutledge was certain the great elizabeth would have recognized with straight backs and seats hard as iron discussing the societys aims and goals and record and walter teller he was always reliable a steady man who was able to find common ground with the local people and work with them in projects designed to better their lives a school for instance or a new well or a market that attracted commerce to the area very practical things you might say but through them people could be persuaded to find worth in christianity and turn their thoughts to conversion i understand rutledge said that youve only recently written to mr teller yes in fact i have a copy there in my desk i keep meticulous copies of all correspondence my records are excellent he set aside his cup and went to the desk where he found the folder he wanted and brought it back to his chair let me see he thumbed through several sheets before finding the one he was after here it is mr teller has been some years out of the fieldhis book of course and then the warand we are experiencing a little difficulty in finding good men to send to established missions much less new ones he looked up at rutledge sadly the world has changed now before the war there was a fervor for service weve grown sadly bitter and tired these past two years our missionaries are older on the point of retiring wed like to see mr teller return to the field indeed it is more than likethere is need and has he responded to your call for serving not so far but you told me earlier that hed been ill perhaps that has been the reason possibly rutledge replied evading a direct answer its mr tellers illness that has brought me here the doctors are at a loss to explain it he seems deeply troubled by something the family can think of nothing that would have provoked a sudden and unusual attack of paralysis mr forester looked steadily at rutledge and this has required the attention of scotland yard rutledge smiled in fact mr teller has had a miraculous recovery and he disappeared from the clinic ive been in charge of the search for him forester shook his head this is very odd id have never thought of walter teller experiencing a collapse of any kind i do know he is very attached to his son an only child as i recall thats correct and nothing has happened to the boy hes on the point of going to public school how the years fly i remember when he was born how proud mr teller was of him all the plans he spoke of i have had the strongest suspicion that he didnt return to the field because of the boy i can appreciate that having had a son of my own late in life the wonder of watching him grow was precious beyond words something in his voice as he spoke the last words alerted rutledge he was in the war yes how did you guess he was lost on the somme i have long wanted to go to france to see his grave but thats not to be im too old for such a journey now clearing his throat he said but to return to walter teller i shant expect an answer any time soon im grateful to know the circumstances the society has need of him i hope his recovery will be complete rutledge thanked him and left on the drive back into london rutledge gave some thought to walter tellers relationship to his son and then stopped at francess house david trevor was in the garden enjoying the late evening breezes before the sun went down and looked up with a smile when he saw his godson walk through the french doors and across the terrace ian youve had a long day frances told me youd gone back to the yard rutledge smiled and took the chair across from trevors how are you feeling i wont lie to you it was not the pleasantest experience i have bruises and no recollection of how i got them but we survived and thats what matters he held up his bandaged hand frances saw to it not deep but bruised as well a small price to pay considering what happened to so many is your friend all right rutledge was surprised that trevor had remembered his brief absence going back to find meredith channing yes i have every reason to think so he paused then said i need to bring up a painful subject how you felt about having a son when he was bornhis first few years as a child is this to do with a case sadly yes i dont mind talking about those years it was a miracle finding myself a father i cant tell you he was so small and yet so real he moved he made sounds he opened his eyes and stared into my face his hands clutched at my fingers it was unexpected the depth of my feelings for him even then id have done anything for him died for him if need be nothing id ever done to that point in my life seemed half so important he smiled wryly the late sun just touching his face and lighting his eyes it seems absurd doesnt it i dont think ive ever told anyone that before i was embarrassed you see i didnt know for the longest time that what i felt was natural his words touched rutledge and he said quietly thank you i hope one day youll know for yourself what having a child means frances came out just then bringing a pitcher of cold water and rutledge stayed a little while longer before rising to take his leave he spent a restless night hamish ever ready to bring up memories that rutledge could sometimes bury during the daylight hours pressed him hard and it was nearly four in the morning when he finally fell into a deep sleep only to wake up an hour later calling out to the men under his command warning them to take cover he rose and dressed grateful to be alone in the flat and was in his office at the yard long before anyone else had come in none of the reports from the night staff dealt with walter teller although there was information on bynums murderer the knife used in the attack on rutledge was too ordinary to be traced but postmortem evidence indicated it was very likely the same kind of knife that killed bynum the coat button was of doubtful provenance the address on the scrap of paper proved to be a lodging house the woman who ran it reported that a male who appeared to be around nineteen years old fair and with freckles had come to ask if there was a room available in the house the woman told the police that although he had claimed he could pay for the room she had her doubts that he would fit in with her other lodgers two older men and an elderly woman restless he was the constable quoted from his notebook couldnt sit still a minute the man had argued with her and then left the report concluded and she had no idea where he had come from or where he went after leaving her it was mickelsons case now rutledge was a witness nothing more but he had taken a personal interest in billy and with each new victim his own sense of responsibility grew he set aside the nights reports and considered his next step in the case that was his he couldnt put a finger on what bothered him most about the disappearance of walter teller there were strong reasons why teller might be experiencing bouts of depression and despair his sons future his own obligation to his calling but these couldnt altogether explain his disappearance or why he had been paralyzed by indecision if that was what it was even the teller family wasnt in agreement about the reasons behind what had happened although rutledge had a feeling that they knew more than they were telling it was useless to speculate no one was likely to solve the mystery of what lay so heavily on walter tellers soul until the man himself could answer the question and rutledge had a feeling that that was not likely to be very soon how long would the yard continue to search when would the decision be made to call it off it had gone on longer than the average missing persons case because walter teller was walter teller manpower was becoming a crucial issue in the hunt for bynums killer he was on the point of leaving his office to speak to chief superintendent bowles when sergeant gibson stopped him theres a constable downstairs with a message youd best speak to him yourself rutledge went down to the lobby to find one of sergeant biggins men standing there breathless from his bicycle ride across london its urgent sir sergeant biggin asks if you can come to the clinic at once stowing the bicycle in the boot of his motorcar rutledge said to the constable whats happened as to that sir youd best wait and ask him they were halfway to the belvedere clinic when rutledge thought he glimpsed charlie hood walking the other way he swore as he lost sight of the man but traffic was heavy and he had to keep his attention on the motorcars lorries and drays that filled the street did you see that man with the unkempt hair and a dark brown coat he demanded of the constable in the seat beside him we just passed him on your right no sir i didnt the man answered him craning his neck to look back the way they had come a brewery lorry was pulling in just behind them blocking rutledges view as well it would do no good to set the constable down to follow hood he hadnt seen the man rutledge took a deep breath and said never mind they reached the clinic and the constable took up his stance by the door passing through the outer lobby rutledge nodded to the porter on duty then walked through to matrons sitting room there he was almost swept into an embrace by a joyful jenny teller her face blindingly bright with happiness over her shoulder he saw a man stand and step away from his chair a tentative expression on his face oh jenny exclaimed i thought it was edwin do come in inspector rutledge i want to show you that i was right all along here is my husband walter this is the scotland yard inspector ive told you about and walter teller had the grace to stare sheepishly at rutledge he had changed from the younger man in the photograph that his wife had let rutledge borrow there were deeper lines on his face fatigue mostly and an uncertainty rutledge thought about his reception he neednt have worried despite his shabby appearance hair that looked as if hed combed it with his fingers and the beginnings of a beard walter teller was the most wonderful sight in the world to his wifes eyes then who was charlie hood as rutledge crossed the room he caught the distinct odor of incense with a soupcon of cabbage on tellers clothing he found himself remembering what leticia teller had said that her brother would salve his conscience in serving the poor of london ive sent for edwin and peter but the doctors want to take walter away and examine him jenny was saying rutledge felt an odd mixture of relief that the man was alive and a strong sense of anger at what he had put his family through mr teller he said his voice cold i know teller admitted ive done a terrible thing but i cant tell you why or even tell you where ive been i came to my senses outside a greengrocers shop this morning watching as he put trays of vegetables in his window i went inside and asked him what day it was and where his shop was he told me i was drunk and to get out id never been spoken to like that before on the street i passed a milliners shop with a mirror in the window and i saw myself then small wonder the man thought i was drunk or mad jenny tears in her eyes said you mustnt think about it youre safe now youre here tellers gaze was on rutledge wanting him to believe wanting him to accept what he was saying rutledge was saved from answering by the appearance of one of the doctors urging teller to come and let them examine him but jenny said no his brothers are on the way please weve been so worried let them see hes safe now then you can have him but rutledge thought it was jenny herself who couldnt let her husband out of her sight just yet she clung to his arm as if still not sure this miracle was real or if she had dreamed it dr sheldon said half an hour and then we really must insist he left shutting the door behind him teller said jenny do you think matron might arrange a cup of tea im dry as a desert she was of two minds about leaving him rutledge said ill be here and finally she walked out the door looking back at her husband as if she expected him to vanish before her eyes teller said quietly as soon as she was out of earshot i left here with every intention of drowning myself but when i got to the river the water was filthy oily and with things floating in it paper and feathers and the odd tin i even saw a dead seagull some twenty yards away feathers a dirty gray and i thought i couldnt let them find me like that so i began walking my god i dont know how far i walked halfway to france it seemed at night i slept in churches i know churches i felt safe there id wait until nearly dark and then slip inside there are places in the organ loft where its not as cold and im used to sleeping on the ground when i have to i managed never the same church twice for fear id be seen i had money with me i could buy enough food to keep up my strength he smiled ruefully once a constable nearly took me into custody id offered to pay for my meal with a fivepound note he thought id stolen it that i was a pickpocket i had to convince him i was down on my luck and living on the kindness of strangers id bought workmens clothes is any of this true rutledge asked him its true but i dont want to tell these things to my wife so im asking you to let her believe i was dazed or ill it will hurt her to know i was in my right mind and still let her believe the worst she never accepted the possibility that you were dead he flinched why did you leave here i told you i wanted to die theres usually a reason for suicide what happened on the road between london and essex you might as well ask me what happened on the road to damascus i dont know at first i thought i was dying and then i feared for harry dr fielding couldnt find anything wrong and i thought he was lying rutledge judging him could believe that as far as it went teller seeing that rutledge wasnt fully convinced shrugged i know i have much to live for a fine wife a fine son a home i love i have no worries about money or my health what right have i to feel the weight of depression but i dont think depression is measured by what you have he broke off with a warning glance to rutledge as the door opened but it wasnt jenny with their tea it was edwin teller and his wife who came into the room and stopped stockstill staring at the apparition before them my god edwin said moving as if to embrace his brother and then he stopped where the hell have you been do you know what you have put jennyall of usthrough if father were alive now hed horsewhip you amy put her hand on her husbands arm no dont edwin please walter said i have no excuses no explanation im sorry more sorry than you know more sorry than you will ever know peter teller and his wife came in just then and peter recognizing his brother glowered at him i hope you can explain yourself he said through clenched teeth i hope there was a damned good reason for what youve done susannah her face flushed said wheres jenny i asked her to bring me a little tea i couldnt bear her relief any longer someone should telephone leticia and mary susannah said and then in a burst of anger she said accusingly its been a terrible week weve driven miles weve tried to console jenny weve tried to think where you might be and then your clothes were found by the river she turned away brushing angrily at the tears in her eyes rutledge recalled that peter had been drinking heavily it explained a little his wifes distress i know i say again im sorry its not enough but its all i can do the door opened and jenny held it wide for one of the sisters to bring in matrons tea tray she carried it to the table and then turned to walter were very happy to see youve returned safely she said and matron would appreciate a word when youve seen the doctors teller looked overwhelmed but he said yes of course jenny was saying triumphantly to his brothers i told you he wasnt dead but when they brought him in to me i couldnt believe my eyes she laughed trying hard to ignore the tension in the room amy went to the tray and began to pour tea into cups the practical one rutledge realized orless involved she carried one to walter without a word and then gave one to jenny peter refused his but edwin accepted one as well as if needing to keep his hands busy matron came in saying im so sorry to interrupt your celebration but im afraid we must borrow mr teller for a bit he followed her almost as if he was glad of escape jenny started after him then stopped at a glance from matron edwin said when hed gone im sorry its been a very difficult time for us for walter as well i shouldnt have lost my temper smoothing what oil she could over troubled waters amy said jenny you must be so happy he looks well doesnt he a little tired perhaps i want to leave here as soon as the doctors will let him go she answered i want to go home and i want to have harry back again you ought to stay with us for a few days amy suggested but jenny shook her head im sick of london edwin moved to stand beside rutledge has he told you why he left or where he was he asked quietly im not sure how much i believe rutledge answered but at a guess id say he never left london london edwin stared at him well that most certainly is good news he hesitated there are no charges i hope growing out of this the inquiry the search none bowles would never agree to any rutledge knew but before rutledge left the clinic he had a last word with walter teller the doctors had pronounced him in good health and told him that he was free to return to essex what they really believed they kept to themselves rutledge said this will not happen again is that understood walters head reared back as if about to challenge rutledge and then he said it wasnt deliberate i didnt ask the police to search for me what did you think would happen when the clinic discovered you were missing to protect themselves the first order of business was to summon the police yes i suppose i should have expected that but why the yard youre an important man mr teller we were concerned teller had the grace to look ashamed of himself yes all right it wont happen again for that matter i cant think of any reason why it should rutledge said as he walked to the door theres something else youve put your wife through a very difficult time the least you can do for her sake is change your mind now about your sons schooling teller said it was my fathers wish hes dead teller your wife is very much alive do it for her ill consider it i can at least do that rutledge nodded and went out rutledge could hear hamish before he reached his motorcar he could feel the sunlight fading replaced by the raw gray light of the trenches just before dawn and then the guns picked up their shells dropping with precision without a break between them it had driven more than one man mad the shelling and he had lived with the sound until it was almost a part of his very bones somehow he managed to start the motorcar but how he reached the yard he didnt know and then the trenches faded as quickly as they had come rutledge sat in his motorcar staring through the windscreen trying to shake off the aftermath and then the motorcar began moving again and almost without thinking he found himself driving toward chelsea a reasonable time had passed it would be proper to call and see how meredith channing was faring it would be expected but when he got there and knocked at the door no one came to answer it hamish said shes no in london rutledge stood there on the steps accepting the silence beyond the closed door and then he turned and walked back to his motorcar chapter it was necessary to report to bowles how the inquiry into the disappearance of walter teller had ended rutledge braced himself and knocked at the mans door come it was difficult to judge his mood from the one word but as rutledge walked into the office he could see that for once bowles was not scowling rutledge said the teller inquiry is closed teller returned to the clinic on his own and from what the doctors have said hes recovered and free to return to essex bowles raised his eyebrows in an expression of surprise did he now and where has he been all this time pray sleeping in churches walking the streets thinking who knows i wasnt sure how much i could believe hes a very private man and i dont expect anyone will ever know the truth about what happened not even his wife youre the policeman whats your opinion rutledge considered the question it seemed to me that the arrival of a letter from his missionary society coincided with problems with his wife and he didnt know how to respond to the letter at the same time he was on the point of sending his son to harrow early against her wishes that answer would serve well enough for a report he had no idea why walter teller had been ill or left the clinic without a word he rather thought but had no intention of telling bowles that tellers brothers had suspected something yet they hadnt confronted him and that was decidedly odd given their anger when he returned was it jennys presence that had stopped them bowles nodded i should think it might be very difficult to go back to those godforsaken posts after all these years away i wouldnt fancy it myself but he may have felt honor bound to fulfill his commitment to the society rutledge said nothing if it were anyone but walter teller id have a word with him wasting police time and putting us all through the hoops i must say i expected better of the man i already have made it clear at least you managed to keep this business out of the newspapers with the number of police involved in the search its a wonder word didnt get out if it had gone on much longeror had had a different endingwe might not have escaped their attention theres that all right let me have your report before the day is out but instead of returning to his own office rutledge went out of the yard and walked to trafalgar square and then past st martininthefields taking the streets at random while his mind was busy it had reached a very unsatisfactory conclusion this inquiry he thought ignoring the people coming and going around him the busy traffic of a london day why had teller returned on his own and where was he what had he really been doing with his time hamish said he willna tell anyone and rutledge thought that that was probably true he wondered if teller had decided to return to the field perhaps his soulsearching had found his answer suddenly he recalled what mary brittingham had said that walter teller wasnt a saint he was bitter about what it would be enlightening to know and that rutledge decided was the best explanation of the man hed heard but of course that was not something that could be expressed in a report chapter peter teller sat in his garden in bolingbroke street and poured himself another glass of whisky his hand was shaking but he was far from as drunk as he wanted to be his brother walter was back greeted like the prodigal son it was a travesty all that was needed was the fatted calf he told himself sourly what did he know he had stared into his brothers eyes and seen nothing and not even walter was that coldblooded draining the glass he sat back in his chair moved his bad leg a little in the hope of finding a more comfortable position and stared through the silhouetted leaves above his head at the night sky black as he was sure his soul was what in gods name had he done to make matters worse he couldnt have said under oath what had become of his cane it wasnt in the motorcar in his haste he must have dropped it in the grass along the road when he got out two hours later to stretch and massage his leg he hadnt intended to frighten her he had only wanted to say what hed come to say and walk away he wasnt even sure now just what he had saidthe words had spilled out a reflection of fear and anger hed charged german positions under fire hed killed men hed fought for king and country and yet in those few seconds hed lost his courage and with it lost his head what sort of man was he to run as he had to leave her there an act of such sheer cowardice that he couldnt blot it out of his mind no matter how much he drank and he could tell no one not edwin not susannah certainly not leticia for a time he considered going inside finding his service revolver and putting an end to his shame and revulsion but he couldnt do it the same tenacity that had made him fight over and over again to keep his damaged leg when the surgeons were intent on removing it forced him to face the man he was perhaps he told himself bitterly after the shock wore off he might even learn to stand himself again he was becoming a maudlin drunk and that he despised susannah came out into the garden wrapping her dressing gown closer against the late night chill wont you come to bed a nights rest will do you more good than this she nodded toward the glass in his hand in a little while he said still studying the stars avoiding her eyes you promised two hours ago please wont you see the doctor tomorrow and ask him for drops or something to help with the pain you cant go on drinking to dull it i blame edwin if you want the truth for not going himself there were no drops to cure this pain he answered her silently and then aloud i expect the doctor will say what he always does that i shouldnt drive she regarded him for a moment and then asked whats wrong peter its eating away at you is there something you havent told me go to bed susannah ive had too much to drink to make any sense well talk about it tomorrow she turned and walked back to the terrace door there she paused and said her voice carrying perfectly to him where he sat did you kill her peter was all the rest of what you told us a lie he pretended he didnt hear reaching for the decanter again he poured himself another measure concentrating on not spilling it the terrace door closed behind his wife and in a sudden fury he flung the glass of whisky against the trunk of the ginkgo overhanging the iron rail fence it shattered but he was already regretting what hed done and he shoved himself to his feet to cross the lawn and pick up the shards before someone found them in the morning and read more than anger in the glittering whiskysoaked pieces chapter rutledge finished his report and handed it to a constable to be typed for chief superintendent bowles and still restless he considered going to francess house and spending the remainder of the afternoon with his godfather then he recalled that today was the grand excursion to hampton court by boat he stopped to speak to chief inspector cummins who had just returned from paris where hed been persuading the french to allow him to bring a witness back to england to testify in regard to a killing in surrey cummins greeted him then said go away for four days and my desk grows papers like the french grow grapes what sort of mood is his lordship in rutledge smiled mercurial damn the french are being pigheaded hes not going to like that rutledge hesitated and then in spite of himself asked has the front changed much he had meant the france of the war years the blackened ruin of a countryside cummins had not pretended to misunderstand him not very it takes trees a while to grow back although theres more grass now i found myself feeling depressed and turned around but the french farmers are a hardy lot theyll not let good land go to waste for very long bloodsoaked land rutledge shivered at hamishs words they talked for several minutes then rutledge returned to his office a quarter of an hour later constable ellis was at his door saying quickly youre wanted sir chief superintendent hamish said ware as rutledge crossed the threshold and he guessed that cummins had been there before him with his own bad news and bowles had not taken it well he was muttering about the french under his breath then he looked up and said what the hell kept you but before rutledge could frame an answer bowles went on testily i thought we were finished with these tellers sir the chief superintendent barked now we have a request from a village in lancashire to look into the death of a mrs peter teller seems she was murdered it required a moment for rutledge to digest the news sir he repeated i just saw the captains wife yesterday surely theres some mistake are you deaf or is your mind wandering ive just told you peter tellers wife who said anything about captain teller shes just been found dead by the constable in hobson unusual name all the same might be a relation though its unlikely lancashire he shook his head in bowless view the farther from london the more benighted the place youll have to deal with it i cant spare anyone else he closed the file and looked rutledge in the face id counted on you to handle walter tellers disappearance it would have pleased a number of people to see us successful in that quarter instead he came back under his own power you reported that he slept in a church why didnt someone think to have a constable concealed there failure on your part you know see that were not embarrassed a second time do i make myself clear i understand rutledge replied as bowles searched his cluttered desk for his pen and he did understand political repercussions were always uppermost in bowless mind using them or avoiding them he had become quite adept at sensing the way the wind would blow but to clear the record rutledge added teller slept in different churches not just one thats to say if he was telling the truth there are dozens of churches in london hes a cleric is he not someone should have taken that into account he found his pen and uncapped it youre to leave for hobson straightaway he made a final note on the file and passed it to rutledge rutledge crossed to the door bowles said and rutledge he turned i shouldnt think the family would like seeing this bruited in the newspapers for all we know this teller could be on the wrong side of the blanket might explain hobson if you take my meaning the family has had a very trying time of it already as rutledge walked back to his office to set his desk in order hamish said ye willna be here to take yon godfather to the station ill leave a note sergeant gibson standing in the doorway asked sir rutledge had answered the voice in his head aloud without thinking he turned to face gibson and forced a smile a commentary on whats ahead he answered lightly do you know anything about the police in this village of hobson the constablesatterthwaite is his namegives the impression hes a sound man sir hell steer you right let us hope all right anything else i should know no witnesses no sign of robbery no physical assault nothing to go on but the womans body found in the front passage of her house what did the husband have to say about it it appears hes dead sir indeed so the constable informed me sir didnt come home from the war i dont remember hobson is it hard to find satterthwaite says look for the turning after the crossroads its not very well marked from this direction but its off the road to thielwald ill bear that in mind rutledge stopped at his sisters house and left a note for her explaining his absence and another of farewell to his godfather he would have liked to see trevor and the boy to say goodbye and wish them a safe journey but they werent planning to return until late that evening hoping to dine near hampton court and he had a long drive ahead with no time to lose half an hour later he was on the road north facing little traffic with hamish unsettled in the seat just behind him the voice close enough that sometimes over the soft purr of the motor he could almost swear he heard hamish breathing he was always careful not to look in the rear seat and he kept the small mirror turned in such a way that he couldnt see any reflection but his own hed made a bargain with himself four years before when he realized that he couldnt shut the voice out of his head the day he saw hamish macleod would be the day he sent both of them to the grave even when he stopped for a late dinner this side of derby the voice followed him a counterpoint to his own thoughts he had traveled this road before coming down from westmorland although instead of warm breezes sweeping through the motorcar there had been a harsh wind off the winter snow the aftermath of a blizzard that had shut down roads and cut off families from one another but not from a murderer and then the turning he was after appeared around a bend in the road and he was heading in a different direction the shadows in his mind receding with distance after one last turn he found crossroads and the fingerboard pointing toward thielwald some three miles beyond that he saw the side road that bore to the left toward hobson he followed that through grassy pastures and a thin stand of trees before cresting a slight hill and coming down to the first of hobsons houses sturdy and uncompromisingly independent like the people who lived in them a milking barn in the distance to his left caught the last long rays of sunlight and ahead of him just leaving the muddy lane that led to it a line of cows made their way down the high street heading for their nights grazing on the other side of the village their udders flaccid after milking the bell on the leather strap around the neck of their leader clanked rhythmically as she swayed from side to side paying no attention to the motorcar in her wake rutledge could see the police station just beyond the herd and waited patiently for the last of the cows to pass constable satterthwaite had just come out the door and was standing there on the point of filling his pipe he was a heavyset man of middle years with an air of knowing his patch well as rutledge pulled up he greeted him inspector rutledge youve made good time sir the lights still good would you like to go on out to the teller house or wait until morning rutledge considered the sky now is best ill drive constable satterthwaite shoved his pipe back into his pocket and got in giving directions to the scene of the crime then he settled back and said im that happy to see you sir this is a puzzle i cant fathom florence teller is the last person id have expected to find murdered were a quiet village not a place where theres been much in the way of violence over the years we know one another fairly well and for the most part thats a good thing if someone is in need we try to help no one needs to go stealing from his neighbor murder isnt always to do with need rutledge told him theres passion and greed and anger and jealousyand sometimes just sheer cruelty i understand sir but i dont know how any of those things might touch florence teller why someone would come to her door and then strike her down and leave her for dead where she fell is beyond me the doctor says it would have done no good if shed got help straightaway the damage was done but how was her killer to know that she might have lain there suffering for hours and no one to help her that was a cruelty she lived alone yes sir the aunt who brought her up when she lost her parents died about fifteen years ago maybe more and her son died some twelve years back then her husband didnt come home from france that took the heart out of her though i never heard her complain and she more or less kept to herself afterward gardening was always her joy you might say and even that couldnt make a difference rutledge glanced his way you seem to know her well i know all my people well satterthwaite said with dignity but yes i kept an eye on her to be sure she didnt fall ill or lack for anything he could hear the pain in the other mans voice as he tried to keep his feelings in check not love precisely but a protective fondness all the same she would do anything for anyone satterthwaite went on when rutledge made no comment she stayed up three nights with the burtons little girl when she had typhoid and the mother was too ill to nurse her all of us knew what sort of person she was so where was the need to kill her what was her maiden name marshall her parents lived in cheshire the father was originally from cheshire as i recall the village had straggled along the high street and then as if tired of trying to grow any larger it simply stopped beyond hobson the land spread out in a carpet of early summer green rising a little to show where plowed fields and pastures intersected and flocks of shorn sheep cropped the grass save for the sheep and a man on a bicycle passing them there was no other sign of life yet the emptiness was friendly not like the great haunted barren sweeps of the highlands rutledge could hear hamish making the comparison in his mind where is mrs tellers body over to the doctors surgery in thielwald it was a single blow he says delivered with some force from behind looking at her face youd never guess shed been killed i was that surprised to see a peaceful expression as if she had been put out of her pain like thats an odd thing to say but it was my feeling yes i understand they made two more turnings and came up a slight rise to meet a hedge that surrounded the front of a twostory white house the land continued to rise about fifty yards behind it but sloped away from the road at the front giving a long view across a high stand of grass down toward what to rutledge appeared to be a distant line of the bay thats the cottage constable satterthwaite told rutledge you can see how isolated it is from the point of view of finding any witnesses theres a farm just down this road a bit but the owner was trying to save a sick ram and he doesnt know if anyone passed this way or not and just over the shoulder of the rise is where the widow blaine lives mrs blaine still keeps the farm but has given up running sheep and planting corn a small dairy herd is all thats left shes short and square with a temper to match her red hair if the killer had gone there shed have taken her broom to him or her he smiled at rutledge village gossip says shes twice the man her husband was and she saw nothing unusual here either no sir she has to milk the cows twice a day and muck out the milking barn but she comes into hobson once a fortnight for whatever goods she wants thats how she came to find the body she stopped to ask mrs teller if there was anything she needed there appears to be a good bit of fallow land around the cottage did mrs teller farm it they had come to a white gate set into the hedge it led up a grassy walk to a painted door weathered a soft rose rutledge drew up just past the gate she hasnt since the war years no help not with all the men we lost and probably no heart for it either she didnt need the money they left the motorcar and opened the gate rutledge noted the sign on the front of it with the name sunrise cottage then he stood there looking up at the house it was typical of farmhouses out in this rolling country tall and square and open to the buffeting of the wind as if daring it to do its worst there were no trees to shelter it and no fuss about the architecture guessing the age of sunrise cottage was nearly impossible built as it was to withstand whatever the seasons or the years brought a hundred years old fifty he followed the constable up the path taking in the flowers that gave the walk and the door a little touch of color a softness that belied what had happened here there was no indication of a struggle or that mrs teller had tried to run from her killer nothing to tell us anything she was just lying there face to one side as if she had decided to have a little nap there wasnt much blood she must have died very quickly and no sign of the murder weapon he must have taken it with him a walking stick there are enough visitors in the summer on walking holidays a hammer or tool from a motorcar if it was a summer visitor he had his walking stick with him if the weapon came from a motorcar or a lorry the killer carried it to the door with him with the intent of committing murder thats very likely satterthwaite agreed they had reached the door its not locked we never lock our doors she might still be alive if she had the constable said she opened it to whoever was on the doorstep she was never afraid out here ive wondered you know if he had stopped for a drink of water or the like and recognized her but that would mean she had a past and thats not in the character of florence teller what did she do before she married she came here to live with her aunt when she was very young and later taught school over in thielwald she was a good schoolmistress by all accounts but not two years after shed begun teaching she met and married peter teller what about his family is there any is he by any chance related to the teller family in london i wouldnt know sir but i doubt it there was never anything said about family in london rutledge remembered what bowles had suggested that this peter was from the wrong side of the blanket he reached out to open the door it swung back on its hinges quietly without disturbing the evensong of a robin somewhere on the other side of the hedge who inherits the house now theres a good question i dont know who her solicitor is we havent come across a will the passage was narrow a second door just beyond where they were standing opening into the house itself in this tiny hall a small shelf of trinkets on one side faced a framed photograph of morecambe bay on the other and only a small stain on the scrubbed wood flooring marked where a woman had died rutledge examined the walls and the floor even glancing at the ceiling above his head but there were no scuff marks nothing to show that a struggle had taken place she must ha turned to go into the ither part of the house hamish said her back to him rutledge said too late to catch himself from answering hamish aloud yes very likely constable satterthwaite agreed she might have known him or if not liked the look of him enough to invite him in a good many of the university lads come walking hereabout and some of them couldnt be much older than her timmy would have been if hed lived she had a soft spot for them were a trusting lot but not foolish she wasnt afraid of him a priest a schoolboy on holiday a woman in distress i hadnt thought of it in that way satterthwaite admitted but yes whats beyond this entry there are three rooms downstairs and three bedrooms above her aunt lived in one of them the boy timmy in another i dont think from the look of them that she used either room after they died rutledge crossed the entry and went through the open door beyond he could see the short passage continued with the stairs to one side the kitchen straight ahead the parlor to his left and a small dining room or sitting room to the right as he walked through the rooms he found himself thinking that the parlor appeared to be frozen in time intended for the use of guests of another generation who never came a settee and two chairs a worn but handsome carpet small tables with little treasures on them there was another framed photograph this time from keswick in the lake district surely a souvenir of a visit a tall blue vase intended for summer flowers took pride of place on one table beside it a wellthumbed book of verse with no inscription just above the table hung a sandalwood fan in a case spread to show the lacquered painting on parchment and the carved sticks handsomely embroidered pillow slips with chinese scenes of mountains rising about a misty river set off the plainness of the dark furniture they were unusual pieces to find here in hobson what did her husband do before the war was he a farmer a career soldier he was always sending her gifts from all over the world i sometimes brought the packages out here on my rounds her face would light up and shed smile as if it were her birthday the dining room had been turned into a sitting room cum workroom with a tabletop easel on it was a watercolor of a cat curled up on a windowsill it was only half finished there was also a book of accounts on the table a low bookshelf of leatherbound classics by the chair that was obviously her favorite the cushions were worn and the padded back had taken on a comfortable shape the kitchen was tidy telling rutledge that she had not expected guests for the teapot and the cups and saucers were in their proper places in the cupboard or ha been washed and put away again hamish suggested the square footed dish on the table covered by a linen handkerchief held honey and there was bread in the tin box by the stone sink looking out at the kitchen yard he could see that flowers and herbs grew in profusion turning the silvery wood of the shed into a backdrop for beauty and using the rough stone foundations of what must have been the ancient barn and other outbuildings as a sheltered place to grow more delicate plants upstairs the two unused rooms yielded nothing of interest in one there were a boys playthings in a wooden chest an armoire a coverlet with appliques of animalsa cat a dog a duck a sheep and a cowagainst a forest green background the animals were cleverly sewn with cotton wadding behind the figures to give them a threedimensional quality on the wall were shelves with birds eggs a cattail nearly gone to seed and other small things that might catch a boys eye including a conch shell in the aunts bedroom the bed was neatly made with a tufted coverlet and flowers embroidered on the pillow slips the armoire like the one in the boys room was empty of clothing as if these had long since been donated where they might do more good florence tellers bedroom was equally simple but the same hand had embroidered a picture on the wall entitled our happy home with a house that looked remarkably like this one save for the black door on the bedside table was a single photograph of a small boy holding a football his face tilted toward the photographer with a shy smile just touching his lips a handsome child but a frail one the tall oval mirror standing in the corner was the only unexpected furnishing crossing to look at it more closely he thought the dark wood was either cherry or rosewood and it was finely made at the top of the frame was a small bouquet of roses tied by a ribbon carved in a piece with the wood of the frame itself he could picture florence teller standing before it admiring a new dress smiling up at the man shed married pleased with the gift hed brought her hamish said its no like the rest of the furniture and that was true while everything from the dining room table to the high bed frames was of good workmanship it was from another generation late victorian pieces dark and solid the polish deep enough to reflect the light inherited he thought they might have been the sort of pieces a young couple just at the start of their marriage might have been offered by an aunt or mother or cousin pieces stored in the attic until they were needed again there was little of a personal nature here and he wondered about the sort of life this woman had led had her husband written to her his letters the high marks of her world although the constable frowned in disapproval rutledge opened drawers but found nothing to indicate that something was missing aside from her gardening her needlework was clearly her main interest but as ones needle clicked in and out of the cloth even following the most intricate pattern what did her mind dwell on or as she pulled weeds and deadheaded flowers what occupied her thoughts while her hands were busy she must have been a woman of extraordinary patience he thought all at once always waiting like the faithful penelope why had she accepted such a life and what in the end had it brought her but he thought he had found the answer to her acceptance in one small thingthere must have been a pet here at one time something to keep her company a cat a small dog for safety and for friendship from the upstairs window he could see a little graveyard with whitewashed headstones four or five of them as if over the years she had lost her companions as well as her son and laid them to rest in a garden of remembrance for around the stones grew pansies in profusion and forgetmenots he went back down the stairs feeling depression settling over him and walked out to the little graveyard three cats two dogs judging from the names painted in dark blue script on the whitewash and one marked only mr g do you want to speak to the farmer constable satterthwaite asked as rutledge turned back to the house if he was busy with a sick animal hes probably right he saw nothing what about his family his wife had gone to visit their daughter the son is married and helps out at the farm on most days but he walks over from where he lives he gestured toward the distance on the far side of his fathers land therefore nobody from his household came this way all right lets speak to mrs blaine if something is missing here we have no way of guessing what it is but downstairs again he paused long enough to flip the pages of the books by mrs tellers favorite chair to see what might have been secreted among them she had good taste in reading he thought as he scanned nothing but an occasional starched and embroidered bookmark fell out rutledge stood in the passage for a moment listening to the sounds of the house around him trying to feel the presence of the woman who had spent most of her life here and left so little of herself behind but she was elusive and he wished there had been a photograph of her in better times then he followed satterthwaite outside the sky was a bright rose fading to shades of gray and lavender as the sun crept over the far horizon and in the east the lavender deepened to purple they closed the door on the silent house and walked back to the motorcar while the roof of mrs blaines farmhouse could just be seen from the teller house the way there was not as direct they turned down a rutted lane and bounced along it to the house nestled in the curve of the hill it was very much like the one theyd just left but the barns and outbuildings were still very much in use and the yard was muddy with the hoof marks of cattle they tapped at the front door and it opened to a small compact woman with dark red hair and a grievance there you are she said at once to constable satterthwaite ignoring the man from london clutching the startled constables arm she dragged him toward her kitchen all the while complaining over the earsplitting screams of something in great pain somewhere in the house youve got to rid me of that thing do you hear she told me it was thirty years old and i cant even cook it itll be stringy as an old shoe i tried to shove him out the door but he wont leave i cant sleep for this racket all day all night theres no peace rutledge had followed them to the kitchen and saw nothing as he crossed the threshold but he nearly backed into the passage again to save his ears from whatever was shrieking with such highpitched horror hamish silent in the face of what could only be called a cacophony was as speechless as rutledge himself hed heard the irish speak of banshees but until now hed never given these harbingers of death much thought he found himself remembering what old michael flaherty once a jockey had talked about in his cups a sound beyond any other it tears at the soul it wails like a lost spirit and it cant be seen except by someone in the family and then something moved and for the first time rutledge could see the source of the incredible noise it was a small dove gray parrot with a flash of red on its tail and it was clinging to a plate on the top of the dresser against the far wall almost invisible in the last rays of sunset outlining the open kitchen door its bright eyes were fixed on the newcomers as if expecting them to attack there you see mrs blaine said pointing excitedly all day i tell you and all night i dont see how she stood it id shoot it if it werent for my best staffordshire ware he was always sending her gifts lieutenant teller was but what possessed him to send her that thing i dont know they can live a hundred years she said rutledge remembered the little pet graveyard and the animals resting there a hundred yearsshe would never have to weep over a lost love again a lonely woman given something to talk to the parrot shrieked again hardly talking as hamish was pointing out i couldnt leave it could i mrs blaine went on her sense of injustice still strong shed been dead for days i could see that much the flies on her face and it hadnt been fed nor watered so i took pity on it for her sake little knowing quiet as it was what was in store for me i surely didnt bargain for this rutledge stepped into the room moving quietly and went to the overturned cage that was on the floor on the far side of the kitchen table he picked it up and held it high tall as he was he could bring the cage nearly to the level of the bird and to his own astonishment after a long moment it stopped squawking and hopped into the open door made for one of the swings and sat there bobbing back and forth plucking at the feathers of its breast he shut the door carefully then reached down for the cloth covering mrs blaines kitchen table she hurriedly caught the sugar bowl and the saltcellar before he pulled at the cloth then lifted it over the cage shutting the bird into darkness even the frantic creaking of the swing stopped and a blessed quiet descended over the kitchen well ill be damned the constable said into the silence mrs blaine stared from the covered cage to the man from london and then the bird said in a very human voice good night peter wherever you may be in a hushed whisper mrs blaine said thats her voice for all the world as if she were still alive youd never heard it speak rutledge asked lord no never in her house and not in mine either he was quiet as a lamb there and here hes done naught but to scream like a creature in pain i didnt know youd taken anything from the housethis bird the constable was saying accusingly i asked if youd touched anything its a live bird i thought it would be like a canary i took it out of kindness she said defending herself youre not telling me it could name her murderer no its just that you saidwas there anything else did she ever ask you to burn some letters for her if something happened to her rutledge asked or take a photograph and post it to her late husbands family you were her nearest neighbor she might have confided in you he added though he couldnt see a strong friendship springing up between two such different women still needs must and two widows alone on isolated farms could have turned to each other to carry out last wishes incensed mrs blaine said look here i never touched a thing in that house i took pity on this creature as i would on a stray cat and look how its repaid me i ask you it could have been evidence constable satterthwaite pointed out trying to keep his own temper a birds not evidence she retorted ill wring its neck and be done with it and bury it up there in her little graveyard see if i dont she marched around the table toward the cage rutledge said constable ive got a cat he said as if that absolved him of all responsibility rutledge stepped forward he could hear hamish it was clear that the voice in his head was trying to tell him something but he reached for the cage and said ill take possession of it the bird may not have seen who killed her or watched if the killer searched the house but until we know differently its a ward of the court constable satterthwaite turned to him as if hed taken leave of his mind mrs blaine said ward or not ill thank you to remove it from my house did she have any enemies anyone who had had a fallingout with her anyone who might have held a grudge against her he asked gingerly lifting the birdcage cloth and all ill have my tablecloth back she told him as for enemies you might as well ask if i have any she wasnt the sort to make people angry she never asked for much and it was just as well she was never given much in this life but great sorrows to bear she had nothing to steal though she never lacked for what she needed it was people whod failed her and i cant think why anyone would have wished to see her dead rutledge looked around the kitchen and saw nothing he could use to cover the bird he set the cage down again and took off his coat wrapping it around the cage in place of the tablecloth the bird had his head tucked under his wing and hardly stirred youre a right fool mrs blaine said to rutledge as he handed her the tablecloth but ill thank you all the same for ridding my house of this nuisance what can you tell us about mrs tellers husband he asked only that he never came back from the war they said there was a collection being taken up in london for a monument to the men gone missing ive no doubt lieutenant tellers name will be on it i asked her if she was going to make a contribution but she said that would be like walking over his grave as long as she held him to be alive he was though in the last months i think even she had begun to give up all hope she painted that door red to welcome him and shed set a dress aside for the day well if hes in heaven shes found him now and is at peace she walked with them to the door she told me once that shed read a story about a man who had gone on the crusades and he lost his memory and it was years before he came home again she asked if i thought it was a true story and i told her i did because i couldnt say could i that some writer had made it up out of whole cloth to make women readers cry i was never one for that sort of thing myself if you can think of anything that would be helpful constable satterthwaite told her youll let me know first thing i will and im locking my door at night and bringing in the dog i dont want to be found dead like she was how long do you think she lay there it was a cruel thing to do kill her and leave her to the flies they thanked her and left for a second rutledge didnt know what to do with the bird standing there looking at the motorcar and unwilling to put it on the floor by what would be hamishs feet but the constable took it from him and set it there saying heres a travel rug shall i put it around the cage instead of your coat ohyes thank you rutledge took his coat back and pulled it on as he opened the door of the drivers side as the constable cranked the motorcar he said to rutledge what will you do with that thing you cant be serious about taking it to london why not rutledge asked for the time being at least who knows what else it might say aye and id give much to see the judges face when you offer a parrot in evidence rutledge laughed what matters is whether or not someone else thinks the bird can talk that could be interesting the motor caught and the constable got in all color had gone from the sky now and the first stars were growing brighter shall we go and see the body sir i think the doctor would like it released as soon as possible for burial released to whom rutledge asked theres no family you said as much yourself what else are we to do ill be there and some of the village women no doubt she wont be put in the ground without someone by her they drove through the dark streets of thielwald light from house windows making bright patches on the road satterthwaite pointed out the doctors surgery and they knocked at the door dr blake answered the summons himself nodding to rutledge and saying to the constable another five minutes and id have gone up to my bed but im glad youve come any word on her killer he was a short man graying at the temples perhaps fiftyfive with pale heavylidded eyes no sir but this is inspector rutledge from scotland yard hell be looking into her death dr blake took them back to the room where florence teller was being kept and lighted the lamps he carried one to the sheetdraped figure and held it high so that rutledge could see her clearly in the flickering light rutledge studied the body a slim trim woman of perhaps forty he thought older than the teller wives hed just dealt with the doctor was pointing out the location of the wound but rutledge only half heard him seeing the look of peace that constable satterthwaite had spoken of with the lines that sorrow had put in her face smoothed away she looked young again is there anything more you can tell me rutledge asked im afraid not that one blow on the back of the head near the base of the skull was enough i should think the killer was righthanded considering the direction of the blow and possibly on a level with her rather than shorter or taller and he was either very strong or very angry no one interfered with her no one moved the body from where it fell there were no other wounds he shook his head a tragedy i knew her he added to rutledge she was seldom ill but her son was my patient he had measles when he was very young and never fully recovered he died of typhoid fever and i thought she would go mad with grief there was nothing i could do there are times when i curse my profession for its ignorance after a few more questions and a promise to release the body for burial they thanked him and left rutledge drove the constable back to hobson and asked where he might spend the night there was no hotel in the little town and after the long day of driving the thought of going another ten miles or more to find lodging was daunting the constable sent him to the house of a mrs greeley who sometimes took in summer walkers the room was at the back of the house and as she led him there she said i was just putting the kettle on for my tea theres bread and butter creamed eggs and some slices of ham if youd care for it he thanked her and offered to pay for the meal as well as the room she accepted his offer and he could tell that she was pleased to have the money she insisted on serving him at the small table in her sitting room though he was perfectly willing to sit in her kitchen but mrs greeley was agreeable to talking as she laid out his cutlery and brought in a soup that she had made with beans from a tin and bits of bacon did you know mrs teller very well he asked after complimenting her on the soup none of us knew her really well she said she was a quiet sort kept to herself i remember she met the lieutenant in morecambe where she had gone for a few days by the sea after a chest cough lingered beyond the winter he was on a walking tour but he came back later in the summer and called on her then back again he came before the end of october i could tell she liked him and he was very taken with her they were married two years later he liked the army he said it gave him the opportunity to travel but he couldnt take her with him not then and later with the boy being sickly he never wanted to take her to his postings i always thought she must be very lonely out there on the west road as they called it then but she seemed to be happy there over the flan he asked if she could think of anyone who held a grudge against mrs teller her never she wasnt one to attract trouble if you know what i mean i dont know whats got into folks these days the war changed everything didnt it people could live anywhere and be safe no one would think of any harm coming to them ive taken in strangers young men on holiday and never feared for my life i understand she painted her door red to welcome her husband back from the war it was a seven days wonder that red door everyone found an excuse to walk out that way just to see it afterward when he didnt come home i thought it must be a daily reminder of her loss but she wouldnt hear of having it painted something else i even offered one of the lads who stayed with me hed caught himself a chill and was at his wits end for something to do until he could move on he would have painted it any color she liked he waited until she had gone to bed before bringing the bird in and settling it in a corner of his room he gave it some sunflower seeds hed seen in mrs greeleys kitchen and filled up its water bowl and then as he covered it again it said softly good night peter wherever you may be chapter the next morning rutledge could hear the parrot mumbling to itself and so could mrs greeley i see youve got jake lord id forgotten all about that poor bird or id have gone up myself to see to him i understand mrs tellers husband brought him to her on one of his leaves he did and i could have laughed myself silly when i heard florence say jake could speak i didnt believe a word of it he was silent as the grave whenever i called they say its possible to teach a magpie to speak but i dont believe that either all the same jake was company for her and thats what mattered shed just lost callie sue her cat when jake arrived and i was glad she had something to take her mind off her loss callie sue had been timmys cat you see rutledge left the parrot to mrs greeleys tender careshe appeared to know what the bird ateand spent the morning walking around the village asking residents about mrs teller but most of the answers to his questions were a variation on what hed already learned from mrs blaine the constable and mrs greeley and no one could offer any explanation for her murder when they spoke of peter teller it was with warmth but it was also clear that they had never quite felt he was one of them for one thing hed never been in hobson long enough to put down deep roots the ironmonger mr taylor told rutledge when he came in for this or that bit of hardware for the house or outbuildings he talked about dorset more often than not thats where he lived before he went into the army did he say anything to you about his familybrotherssisters not directly no though when timmy was born he told me he hoped the boy wouldnt be an only child as he was what did his father do was he in the army as well his father was a rector and teller mentioned that hed regretted it all his life that hed have been an army man if the choice had been his like his son sam jordan the man who owned what was the closest thing to a pub that hobson possessed could add very little more to what rutledge already knew but he made one remark in passing that was helpful id ask him sometimes about his regiment and where he was stationed i never got a clear answer to that i expect on leave he didnt want to think about going back then jack blaine said he thought teller was in the buffs florence told my wife he was in a hampshire regiment did he come home on leave during the war as i remember he didnt well its a long way from london and the trains were carrying troops and the wounded my own boy came to london twice and there was no way to travel down to see him upset my wife no end mrs greeleys neighbor commented that teller had brought her a box of cherries from the tree that grew out beyond the teller barn and she had made preserves with the last of her sugar i wasnt to know the war was coming and wed see no more i sent a bottle up to mrs telleri sometimes did the heavy washing for her when mr teller was at homeand she said they were the best cherry preserves shed ever tasted i remember it as if it were yesterday her standing there in her doorway praising my preserves and then the jordan boy come up on his bicycle to say we were at war mr teller came to the door and said it will be over by christmas but it wasnt was it nor for four more christmases to come i asked mr teller if he must join his regiment straightaway and mrs teller poor thing looked as if id struck her her face went all white then flushed as if she was about to cry it was the last time i saw him two days later and he was gone at first light to make the train mr kerr the curate of the small church told rutledge he never came to services which i thought was sad not even after timmy died but florence was here every sunday until near the end of the war i think she must have had a feeling you knowa premonitionthat he wasnt coming back the curate rubbed his bald head thoughtfully of course i talked to mr teller whenever i saw him in hobson and i wondered if hed lost his faith soldiers do sometimes you know rutledge understood that all too well the curate added with a smile of course attending services here at st barts was never compulsory rutledge found he was learning as much about peter teller as he was about the mans widow she was well liked people had known her as a child and accepted her as one of their own but her husband apparently had kept to himself when he was in hobson making very little effort to fit into his wifes social life which of course had made the local people more curious about him than they would have been if hed attended church services and spent an evening in the pub it was in a way very selfish hamish said selfish or secretive or perhaps peter tellerlike chief superintendent bowlesfelt he was a cut above the local people unwilling to sink to their level then why had he chosen to live here he didnt make his living in hobson he was free to go or was it his wifes choice because he was away so often and she preferred familiar surroundings to dorset or london a little silence had fallen rutledge said im curious about tellers background did you marry them did any of his family come to hobson for the ceremony it was my predecessor who officiated i wouldnt know who was or wasnt among the guests or who stood up for him what attracted peter teller to florence marshall was it money do you think you never met florence there was something about her that drew people to her as for money shed inherited from her aunt and i understood that peters late father had left him welltodo it was never an issue as far as i know can we find the date of their marriage in the church records i neednt consult them they were married in the early spring of my sister was married in may of that same year in when i happened to mention to mrs teller that i was taking a few days to go and celebrate katie and ralphs tenth anniversary she told me it was her tenth as well i brought her a small gift from katie on my return she was that pleased i dont believe her husband was here to mark the occasion a pity rutledge walking back to the high street paused at the great war memorial just at the turning into church lane he always spared a moment to acknowledge the dead the hobson men who had gone off to fight had served together it was a common practice for these men who had never been as far as carlisle or chester much less london felt more comfortable in one anothers company and consequently they often died together he could see that it was the case here for every surname there was a list of christian names under satterthwaite he saw three and under greeley five there was a taylor a blaine and two jordans he could see them in his minds eye marching together out of hobson to find the nearest recruitment office then returning together in new uniforms where the crease was still sharp and their caps sat at a jaunty angle off to kill the hun and die themselves whether they shot a hun or not he was turning away when the elderly man walking past stopped to speak to him although graying and distinguished with a trim white mustache his shoulders were beginning to stoop with age his voice was educated and strong without the heavy local accent thats from the fields he said using the tip of his cane to point to the irregular stone some three feet high that was the centerpiece of the memorial we thought that fitting they came from this land and many of them never returned to it and so they still have a part of it yes its moving rutledge answered the man lowered his cane to marble tablets encircling the stone my sons are there both of them my nephews too the cane moved on to point to the name of cobb and the long list beneath it my elder son browning and his brother tennyson a schoolmasters folly those names i come by every morning to greet them and every evening to say good night its a quiet place to be remembered you served in the war france the somme you saw some of the worst fighting though i daresay none of it was better than any other rutledge could only nod youre here i think because of mrs teller a sad thing theres no one in hobson who would have hurt her i cant think why a stranger might no one has been able to offer the police any useful information yet ive discovered in places barely as large as hobson that grudges can run deep and in the end they often surface in violence cobb shook his head i repeat not here apparently her husband was with his regiment more often than he was here in hobson rutledge said changing the subject it must have been a lonely life for her waiting for him to return and not knowing throughout the war if he would she was orphaned as a child and brought up by an elderly aunt well meaning of course but not precisely accustomed to children and their needs i expect thats why florence became a teacher to surround herself with children but they werent hers were they they went home every day to their own families it was on the first holiday shed taken from teaching that she met peter teller and fell in love i dont believe she had high expectations of it turning into something more not from the start knowing he was in the army did you meet teller talk to him id see him on occasion on the high street he didnt frequent the pub and he wasnt gregarious but i found myself thinking sometimes that he was a tormented man i dont know precisely whyhe was a cheerful sort in a brief conversation about the weather where hed be serving next or what plans he might have for his sons education alas timmy died young it was a devastating blow to both parents as youd expect no one should have to endure such tragedy hamish said he speaks for himsel was teller eager to see his son follow him into the army not at all in fact he told me once that the only bright spot in the coming war was that timmy would never have to go off and fight a war to end all wars they claimed but it will be forgotten in a generation and there will be another and then cobb hesitated perhaps i should tell you my nephew lawrence cobb worked on mrs tellers farm when she needed help he was glad to do it i think hed have married her if word had come that teller had been killed but of course he was missing and thats very different was she in love with your nephew no loneliness might have in the end brought them together but it was not to be lawrence married mrs blaines daughter instead only last year id like to speak to lawrence rutledge said if youll give me your nephews direction cobb did after a moments hesitation hamish said hes no pleased now he wishes he hadna telt ye about his nephew rutledge thanked him and cobb nodded then walked on without looking back leaning heavily on his cane rutledge drove out of hobson to the northwest and after two false starts he found the farm where lawrence cobb lived a man was in the barn working on a steam tractor rutledge could hear the clang of a hammer on metal he walked back there and as he came through the door the man yelled damn and began to suck his thumb where the hammer had struck a glancing blow lawrence cobb rutledge asked and identified himself when the man nodded ive come from hobson your uncle suggested i might speak to you about florence teller suddenly wary cobb set down his hammer glanced briefly at his bruised thumb and then said youre here about her death well i had nothing to do with it but if i ever lay hands on the bastard who did it ill finish with him before the police can touch him do you still care that much for florence teller cobb shot a look toward the house what if i do she was married i couldnt speak to her it came to nothing she guessed what i was feeling and we decided it was best that i move on i did my wife and i are happy but rutledge thought it was not true content perhaps but at least on cobbs part not happy do you know who might have wanted to kill her no one in hobson id have torn out their throats if anyone touched her i think if it hadnt been for timmy she might have turned to me when teller went missing but she loved her son and she loved his father never mind how he treated her what do you mean treated her if id had a wife like that i wouldnt have stayed away so many years at a time id have written more often he sent gifts but it wasnt the same as being there after timmy died she needed him more than ever but i think coming here hurt too much and his visits got fewer and farther between or so it seemed to me there were letters she kept them in a little rosewood chest on the table beside her favorite chair when i was working there and came in for a cup of tea or mug of water i sometimes saw her putting one away as if shed just read it again her lifeline she called that chest but there had been no such chest by the chair nor anywhere else in the house as hamish was remarking you worked for her as a handyman when you might have done far better for yourself rutledge told him my mother left me her money and id have wanted to be there helping out rather than in some position in carlisle or chester where i couldnt see her every day im not ashamed that i loved her but ill thank you not to pass that on to my wife betsy is jealous i found that out too late he picked up the hammer and struck the frozen nut around a screw this time the blow broke the rusty bond that had locked the two together and he could spin the nut how can you be so wrong about a womans smile but i was lonely and i wanted a son ive not had even him yet hamish said ye ken he was more likely to kill his ain wife than the lass in the cottage rutledge had got the same feeling he thanked lawrence cobb and left but not before cobb said ill tell you this and then deny i ever said it but its crossed my mind a time or two since i heard florence was dead its possible her husband didnt want her anymore that hed met someone else he wanted to marry and he couldnt find a decent way out of his dilemma and so he killed her ask jake he might know but how did you ask a parrot about a murder rutledge reported his conversations to constable satterthwaite who said i expect that tallies with what ive been told its sad that lawrence cobb couldnt have married her he would have done his best to make her happy and you dont think he might have come to her been turned away and lashed out hes a strong man i found him working on his tractor and wielding his hammer with some force an angry force but satterthwaite shook his head ive known lawrence since he was a boy and ill tell you this if he killed her he wouldnt have left her there in the doorway for anyone to find well weve got word out for people to watch for a walker that may be our only hope now if he didnt get the wind up and leave this part of the country why would a walker kill her he asked for the second time thats puzzled me too but im used to puzzles and answers that make no more sense than the puzzle did unless of course he was here on purpose to take that chest of letters and she caught him at it that makes a certain sense now why would he want to steal old letters its a matter of record that they were married she and teller at the church satterthwaite laughed when it comes to money people change its amazing how quickly distant relatives come out of the woodwork when someone dies wanting their share never gave the poor soul the time of day when he was alive but now hes dead hes their dearest cousin however many times removed they arrive to present their case then they stumble over a wife in some dark corner of lancashire and something has to be done about her doesnt it for all we know peter tellers last will and testament was among those letters and someone wanted it destroyed thatud toss the cat amongst the pigeons wouldnt it an interesting explanation for the missing letters as well as the murder is the farm all that valuable the farm is hers not his but how do we know what else he might have owned elsewhere that was valuable florence might not have been told about that or never wanted to face up to the fact that he was dead and the will ought to be taken to a solicitor she had everything she needed right here it was possible but a stretch of the imagination still rutledge found himself considering it again over his dinner losing track of mrs greeleys gossip he stayed one more night with mrs greeley and then left early to make the journey back to london speaking to satterthwaite the night before his departure he said i want to see if i can find tellers relatives they may be able to shed more light on who inherits did florence teller have a solicitor she never had cause to need one the constable told him as far as i know then perhaps peter teller did meanwhile if you find any information on a walker call me at the yard if im not there ask for sergeant gibson on the drive south the bird jake in the cage set in the passengers seat was quiet almost rutledge thought as if he understood he would never go back to sunrise cottage he sat on one of his perches sometimes plucking listlessly at his feathers occasionally muttering to himself and showing no interest in his surroundings rutledge spoke to him from time to time as he would have spoken to a dog traveling with him but except for that one moment in mrs blaines kitchen and again when the rug was put over the cage last night hed said nothing remotely resembling human speech hamish said he remembers what he hears oer and oer again and that was just as sad arriving in london rutledge stopped at the yard and handed the cage and parrot to a startled sergeant gibson find out what to feed him and see that hes kept quiet until i come back for him what to feed him the sergeant repeated i dont know anyone who has a parrot try the zoo rutledge suggested and look to see if we have any information on a peter teller other than the one related to walter teller and he was gone traveling through dorset in search of peter tellers family would take time but there was a possible shortcut edwin teller might know of a connection there a distant cousin or an unrelated family of the same name it was late in the evening when rutledge found himself in marlborough street drawing up in front of the teller residence the house white and three storied stood among others very like it a street speaking of old money and long bloodlines it was quiet almost no one about and rutledge was prepared to find that it was too late for him to speak to anyone he lifted the brass knocker and let it fall the maid who opened the door informed him that mr teller had left for the country and mrs teller she accompanied him will you tell him on his return that inspector rutledge from scotland yard has called and id like to speak to him at his earliest convenience uncertain she said you may call on mrs teller in the morning if its important i thought she was in the country as well this mrs teller is mr edwin tellers grandmother then ill speak to her tonight if i may ill inquire sir the maid returned very quickly and showed him into the parlor overlooking the street the woman sitting there in a brocadecovered chair looked up as he came into the room her hair was completely white her face deeply lined but her blue eyes swept him as she greeted him with a smile youre the handsome young man who just passed my window my apologies mrs teller for the lateness of my call ive just returned to london and this is a matter of some urgency im told youre from scotland yard yes thats true he realized she was the woman in the portrait in captain tellers house you havent come to tell me that walter is missing again have you its really entirely too much ive been in the country visiting and i arrived here to find everything at sixes and sevens in fact im hardly in the door before edwin and amy were out of it on their way to essex as far as i know mr teller is with his wife and son recovering recovering from what id like to know nice people dont disappear without a word and upset the entire family i hardly knew what to say to george when i was asked to stay a week longer with him it was thoughtless of walter thats all i have to say do sit down young man youre quite tall and it hurts my neck to look up at you he took the chair across from hers now tell me why you are here if it isnt walter youre looking for im here to ask about another member of the family im aware that you have a grandson called peter but i wonder if perhaps you have a nephew by the same name not that i know of why should i were trying to find a lieutenant peter teller who served in france and was reported missing around the end of the war our peter did come home he was a captain you know the peter teller im looking for apparently came from dorset although he lived in lancashire after his marriage his wifes name was florence what is this catechism in aid of she demanded irritably i dont care to be questioned in this way we are trying to locate members of lieutenant tellers family peters wife was a darley before her marriage susannah darley my grandniece yes i understand that how long have they been married she frowned im not quite sure twelve years yes that sounds about right now young man ive answered your questions you must answer mine willingly he told her did you know that my grandson walter went missing they had already spoken of that but he humored her yes i was at the clinic shortly after he returned then explain to me if you will why he disappeared its bothering me and no one will satisfy my curiosity its not something our family does you know causing a scandal it was really selfish of walter in my view i wish i could understand it perhaps you should ask him rutledge answered gently the police were pleased that he was safe and unharmed now im trying to find one peter teller whose wife florence lived in lancashire is he missing as well such a pity when did he go missing im told he never returned from the war how sad walter was in the war of course a chaplain peter was with the army and he still has shrapnel in his hip and leg nearly died of his wounds edwin couldnt be in the fighting of course but he was in charge of shipping and materiel i couldnt sleep at night worrying about peter and then the zeppelins came and i was sent to the country to stay with george and annie but i still couldnt sleep hamish said she doesna ken what youre asking rutledge asked who are george and annie george darley is my sister evelyns grandson susannahs brother annie is his wife evelyn and i were twins i still miss her terribly they say that twins do another thread that went nowhere when was peter wounded the spring before the armistice i remember that well the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month the germans must have chosen that its very like them they have quite orderly minds you know we still observe two minutes of silence on that date does peter have a namesake in the family oh no dear walters son is named for his greatgrandfather my husband rutledge found himself at a loss of course my husbands grandfather was the black sheep in the family he killed three men in duels and had to flee to the continent for several years my motherinlaw told me that it was feared hed come home with an italian wife because he appeared to spend so much time in venice but in the end he was sensible and married a girl from dorset quite a good family too everyone was amazed that shed accept the proposal of such a scoundrel then the connection with dorset was on your motherinlaws side not the tellers didnt i just tell you you must pay attention young man my husbands people were from essex thank you for your help mrs teller he said rising i apologize again for disturbing you at this late hour but you havent had your tea my boy surely youll stay for tea she reached for the small silver bell by her chair i like having someone call on me not many people do these days and evelyn is dead you know i miss her so the maid appeared at the door could we have tea do you think mrs teller asked turning to speak to her its late rutledge said i was just on the point of leaving the old womans face clouded must you go its lovely to have a guest for tea and rose was just on the point of bringing it in werent you my dear she came forward and said to mrs teller of course ill bring it but wouldnt you prefer a nice warm bath first and then your tea theres a flan left from your dinner rutledge forgotten the old woman got to her feet and said that sounds quite nice thank you dear she followed rose to the door rutledge said quietly to the maid ill see myself out suddenly aware of him again mrs teller turned and said you were asking about peter werent you how odd it was walter who was missing im sure of that peter went looking for walter you know all of them did they must have been out of their minds with worry i cant think what walter might have done that was scandalous he was a missionary you know my son was wrong choosing professions for his sons peter was never right for the army and edwin hated taking over the estate he let walter have the use of the house and spent his time in london walter protested saying that his congregation in west africa didnt live so grandly but jenny loved it and he gave in walter wasnt suited to the church he never had a true calling if you ask me i heard him say once that hed seen such shocking things his very soul was scarred a dreadful thing for a man of god to say dont you think if walter could have escaped from that life i think he would have but like his brothers he was a dutiful son i find that very sad of course leticia never minded anyone she went her own way from childhood i never trusted her i dont know why she had no smooth edges only sharp ones i expect thats why shes never married im rather tired now thank you for coming well visit again another day i hope its been very pleasant and she walked out of the room with the maid and never looked back chapter an old woman on the verge of senility had told him more about the teller family than shed realized driving to his flat rutledge considered the small pieces of information shed supplied that the family had connections to dorset though not in the teller line that there was no other member in the extended teller family by the name of peter that her sonthe father of three sonshad chosen their professionsand the school for his grandson as well these were echoes of what rutledge had heard in lancashire florences husband had claimed his family was from dorset that his father had chosen his profession for him hed also claimed to be an only childbut that could have been the reason given for never taking his bride south to meet his family and never being visited in turn by anyone from dorset hamish said captain teller has a wife so he does and he wasnt always a captain ill have a word with him in the morning undressing for bed rutledge stood by his window where a very faint breeze was stirring the day had been hot nearly breathlessly so chief superintendent bowles was likely to have an apoplexy if he was presented with a possibility of bigamy in the teller family it was nine oclock when rutledge reached bolingbroke street and knocked on the door of peter tellers house the housemaid who had admitted him before took him this time to the study and left him to stare at the books lining the walls as hunting trophies stared back with glassy eyes even though it was a warm day the doors into the garden were closed peter teller came in shortly afterward and rutledge noted that he was sober although he looked very tired and he was limping heavily walking without crutches or cane he regarded rutledge with a mixture of surprise and apprehension but said only dont tell me my tiresome brother has gone missing again as far as i know hes in essex and safe as houses no ive come to speak to you this time about a murder in lancashire there was a sudden strain in peter tellers face i dont know why anything in lancashire should concern me certainly not a murder the interesting thing is that the victim was married to a peter teller tellers lips tightened im sure she was but she was not married to me are you aware of another peter teller in your family are you aware of all the rutledges in england who may or may not be related to you he countered i have only to match the dates of your leaves with your namesakes appearances in hobson it may take some time but it can be done then come back and talk to me when youve done that rutledge considered the man was it bluster or was he speaking the truth if he had to guess it was a little of both the question was where did the truth end and the lies begin hamish said in rutledges ear and who in lancashire will remember the exact dates in truth someone had removed the letters that might go a long way toward proving those dates perhaps it wasnt a matter of inheritance after all but of a mans handwriting but why kill florence teller now when the secret had been kept safe all these years dont stare at me like that teller said irritably i dont even know who youre talking about pray who is this woman im said to have married florence teller nee marshall and she married a peter teller lieutenant peter teller a career army officer who was posted all over the empire at various times as i believe you were my grandfatheryou have only to ask my grandmotherwas a man who liked women how do i know that your lieutenant peter teller isnt one of his bastards i did speak to your grandmother last night it appears her side of the family came from dorset not the tellers they were an essex family as your brother is now that shook teller indeed he strove to recover and said you had no business speaking to my grandmother without edwin or i being in attendance her mind is slipping it was clear enough on the important issue last night youre barking up the wrong tree rutledge i daresay we could compare the handwriting where that peter teller signed the church register to yours theres your desk if you care to write a brief sample for me and then ill take my leave im writing down nothing ill speak to my solicitor about this business well see what he has to say because im innocent you know and i wont be dragged into another mans folly just because i share a similar name he gestured to the door i think you ought to leave now ive made my position clear theres nothing more to discuss rutledge left but as he was shutting the door he glanced back into the study peter teller was dragging his bad leg in the direction of the whisky decanter on a tray by the desk if peter teller was at home the chances were his brother edwin had returned as well rutledge left his motorcar outside the captains house in bolingbroke street and walked the short distance to marlborough street amy teller was at her door just bidding a woman goodbye she was on the point of shutting the door after her guest when she happened to see rutledge coming toward her down the pavement she froze uncertain what to do and finally as the motorcar with her guest inside drove away she called to him i didnt expect to see you again inspector what have we done now he smiled hed had time to do some thinking on his walk and he said i hope nothing no its information im after hed reached the steps to the house door and she moved aside to let him enter the cool hall theres been a murder he began and watched her eyes widen at the words no one you know i shouldnt think but she happened to be married to a peter teller who died in the war were in search of any family he might have had here in london or perhaps in dorset edwin has cousins in dorset on his mothers side she hesitated doeswas the murder in dorset no the dead womans name was florence teller she lived in lancashire he watched her face and then said theres the matter of a will we cant seem to locate one and its rather important that we do we need to know her wishes in regard to her burial as well as the disposition of her property that could lead us to her murderer youd better come into the sitting room she told him and led the way to a small very feminine parlor with a desk and several comfortable chairs you think her husbands family might have killed her for her property she went on when they were seated we wont know will we until we find the will and contact them what about her own famiy sadly she had none andand there were no children to the marriage a son he said and she bit her lip doesnt he know where the will might be we have no way of asking him that he wasntwas he harmed when his mother was killed he wasnt in the house at the time she nodded of course you would need to find her will but im afraid i dont know any other peter teller which doesnt mean there isnt one or half a dozen of them for that matter we wonderedforgive me but the police must consider all possibilitiesif perhaps this peter teller was not anerrecognized member of the family amy stared at him are you suggesting that my husbandor his brothersmight have a child out of wedlock but you met edwin and hes the eldest its not possible that he could have had a child old enough to serve in the war she was deliberately misconstruing his words it would have been his father i should think he corrected her patiently she laughed outright you never met the man i could believe edwin had an affair before i could see his father with another woman you knew the man when he was older and had grown children you cant judge what he might or might not have done as a young man these things happen in the best families amy shook her head he could have matched prince albert in rectitude she told him and then suddenly seemed to realize that she had closed a door that the police were willing to walk through rutledge could almost read her thoughts as they flicked across her face and he wasnt surprised when after a moment she said of course youre right i cant say with certainty perhaps your grandmother might be in a position to know gran she all but squeaked in her astonishment but shesi mean to say you couldnt possibly expect a woman of her age and her diminished mental capacity to remember something like that she was right but then as if to prove her wrong after all the sitting room door opened and the elder mrs teller stepped in her face anxious amy dear has that awful woman gone she stopped frowned and then said oh its that handsome young man i was telling edwin about the one who came to call last evening crossing the room with the aplomb of a duchess she held out her hand how nice of you to come again amy said gran but mrs teller was seating herself in the chair next to rutledge and saying are you staying for luncheon mr her voice trailed off and her eyes were suddenly filled with tears i am so sorry i cant recall your name i have troubles with names sometimes its a terrible affliction getting old rutledge ian rutledge he told her omitting his title ah yes mr rutledge she smiled the tears vanishing its so nice to see you again she repeated youve met amy i see shes my favorite granddaughter of course i love jenny as well everyone loves jenny have you met jenny shes walters wife do you have a granddaughter by the name of florence she was married to the man i was looking to find last night amy was about to protest but he glanced at her warning her not to interfere the other peter teller theres only one peter dear she told him our peter a very brave man during the war you know decorated and all that but his leg is bad he walks with a cane i was thinking perhaps that your sonpeters fathermight have had a child by someone else and that son was also called peter peters father oh no dear thats not likely the teller men are extraordinarily faithful its part of their charm they love only once besides she said as she glanced at amys stricken face it would be bad form to name a child on the wrong side of the blanket for one of your own it brings bad luck you see like a curse you know one of them will surely die rutledges eyes met amys one of them has he said in the war he stood up adding ive taken enough of your time id like to speak to mr edwin teller if i may and then i must go amy was on the point of saying that her husband was resting when mrs teller said brightly i saw him stepping into the study as i was coming here shall i take you to him he accepted her offer and said a formal goodbye to amy teller preventing her from following him to the study if theres anything more you can think of that would be helpful you know where to reach me she glared at him why had he thought she was less involved gran conducted him into the passage and without knocking opened the door to the study and walked straight in this had been her house as a wife and then as the dowager of the family and she stood on no ceremony her appearance caught edwin teller by surprise and when he saw who was just behind her in the passage his smile of welcome turned grim hullo gran he said thank you for bringing mr rutledge to me if youll excuse us we have some business to conduct im afraid she looked at her grandson disappointment clouding her face he was staying for luncheon rutledge took her hand and said gently im afraid it must be another day he told her after your grandson and i have conducted our business i must return to the yard yes of course she said smiling and shaking rutledges hand i shall look forward to it and she took her leave with the dignity of a woman who had all her life been accustomed to the niceties of social interaction business was business and women were not a part of that world as the door shut behind her edwin said through clenched teeth what the bloody hell do you mean coming here and interrogating my grandmother when im not present rutledge said your wife was present during todays interview but not last nights walter is in essex where he is supposed to be the search for him is over he did nothing during the period when he was missing that would interest scotland yard you have no business here ill take this up with your superior if you continue to harass my family hardly harassment ive come to ask if you could help me locate one peter teller youve met my brother edwin said shortly as far as i know hes in bolingbroke street where he lives this peter teller rutledge said is being sought because we cant find the last will and testament of one florence marshall teller his wife or i should say his late wife she was murdered several days ago edwin opened his mouth and shut it again after a moment he asked in a very different tone of voice where was she murdered here in london in lancashire where she had lived almost all of her life teller was making quick calculations he said the day walter returned to the clinic two days before that someone came to her door and when she answered it struck her down and left her lying there a passerby finally saw her lying there and summoned the police edwin teller said before he could stop himself my god and then he continued quickly i dont see why any of us should know anything about this murder walter was missing the rest of us were searching for him i wasnt suggesting that you might know anything that would help the police rutledge responded mildly lieutenant teller wasnt from lancashire he came from dorset or so he said were trying to trace his family weve been unable to find mrs tellers will the police are always interested in who inherits property greed can be a powerful impetus to murder a pity we cant help you my brother is the only person in the family whose christian name is peter edwin was doing his best in a rearguard action but he was not the strongest of the three brothers we arent sure that the murderer knew mrs teller was dead rutledge persisted but it appears that all her husbands letterswhich she kept in a box in her sitting roomwere taken at the same time he stepped over her once walked into the house and stepped over her again on his way out it suggests a rather coldblooded person in the view of the yard teller cleared his throat whatdo you know what sort of weapon was used in the murder rutledge said we arent releasing that information at the moment then changing his line of questioning without warning rutledge asked when was your brother promoted to captain ias far as i remember it was shortly before war was declared they were bringing the regiment up to strength in the event the kaiser caused any trouble over the situation in the balkans you said that mrs tellers husband was in the war he never came home from france so ive been led to believe which is why we must find his family his wifes will could very well be among his papers or in the hands of his solicitor we would have no way of knowing who that might be teller said shortly a pity we cant help you he added a second time as an afterthought which is why i was speaking to your grandmother in the event she might know more about other branches of the teller family you didnt tell her of the murder did you damn it shes nearly eighty years old there was no need to tell her about the murder she understood that we were looking for information on the other peter teller who is believed to have come from dorset make certain you leave it that way edwin got up from his desk and came around it standing facetoface with rutledge now if you will show yourself to the door i have other matters to attend to rutledge crossed to the door and with his hand on the knob he said i understand that before the war you were often in scotland building private boats i wonder if in your comings and goings you might have stopped off in lancashire or walked in that vicinity its said to be a very popular spot for walking edwin alarmed said i have never been to hobson in my life in the first place i was too busy and the second because of my health i always traveled by private rail carriage rutledge thanked him and went out closing the door behind him hamish was battering at the back of his mind and as rutledge cranked his motorcar to continue his rounds he said ye never telt him yon woman lived in hobson rutledge pulled the crank listened to the motor turn over softly and came around to the drivers side to open his door interesting isnt it that family knows about florence tellerill give you any odds you like and who her husband is but which of the brothers married her and which of them killed her leaving london rutledge drove to essex the telephone could outpace him but there was still the possibility that whatever the rest of the family knewor thought they knewabout florence teller their brother walter had not been a party to it hamish said his brothers were fashed wi him when he came back that was true they had been very angry for vanishing instead of playing his part in whatever was happening during those crucial days ye ken hamish pointed out yon doctors believed hed had a great shock after leaving the bank was that it had he been drawn into something that he couldnt face but why now why had florence teller suddenly become a problem if any of this speculation was true she had not seen her husband since the war she thought he was dead she had lived for years as far as anyone in hobson could testify perfectly quietly in sunrise cottage making no demands on anyone who then had felt threatened by her but ye havena asked the person in the post office if there were ither letters he hadnt it was an important oversight the only excuse was at that early stage of the inquiry he hadnt been sure who peter teller really was a member of the family that chief superintendent bowles had demanded that he treat with circumspection and courtesy or an outsider who happened in a bizarre twist of fate to be christened with the name of peter that rosewood boxwhat had it contained besides letters from a soldier on the other side of the world to a lonely wife waiting for him to be given another leave a will an exchange of correspondence of a different sort that had gone unnoticed in a tiny village like hobson where the business of everyone was everyones business hardly likely theres the ither town and hamish was right there was thielwald but how would florence teller have got there and back to fetch her mail it was too far to walk still the farmer with the sick ram might occasionally have given her a lift rutledge couldnt accept that the woman hed seen lying dead on a table in dr blakes office was a blackmailer or ye do na wish to believe the main road forked and rutledge followed the sign to repton not five miles on he came to the turning into witch hazel farm as the drive meandered toward the house it passed a bed of handsome roses just now in their prime that gave off a sweet perfume in the warm air and filled the car with their spicy scent all the way to the door of the house he lifted the knocker and let it fall after a moment or two mollie the housekeeper answered the door mr teller please inspector rutledge to see him inspector she repeated the word cautiously ill see if hes in she said finally and disappeared leaving him to admire the white roses in stone tubs by the door they hadnt been here when last he called he thought mollie had come back and she led him to the study whose windows looked out toward the drive teller had seen him coming rutledge suspected walter teller was sitting in a chair an open book in his lap and he said as rutledge came in one of my brothers has disappeared it was dark humor not intended as a jest he offered rutledge a chair and then went on do people always suspect the worst when a policeman knocks at their door or do you sometimes bring joy in your wake we seldom have the opportunity to bring joy but yes sometimes did you come from london may i offer you some refreshment yes i drove here from london and no thank you teller marked his place closed his book and set it to one side as if preparing himself rutledge said theres been a murder and im trying to find the family of a man who died in the war they may be able to cast some light on the last wishes of the victim and who is to inherit teller frowned a death in repton why wasnt i told he got to his feet ill come at once rutledge said not here in repton no the man im after is lieutenant peter teller walter teller had turned at his words and walked to the window the only peter teller im aware of is my brother and he survived the war there was a silence and when rutledge didnt carry on teller said tensely who was murdered surely you can tell me that a woman in lancashire by the name of florence teller flor he broke off and then as if the words were torn from him he said i dont know anyone by that name im sorry but i think you do rutledge said your brothers know who she was teller wheeled dont lie to me ask me what you want to ask and get out of here but dont lie his face was ravaged aged im not lying ive just come from asking them the same questions and while they deny all knowledge of this woman or the peter teller who married her theres something theyre both concealing and edwin tellers wife amy as well i dont believe you its a ruse and im not stupid rutledge get out of here i wont hear any more of this you arent even curious about how florence teller died rutledge could see that he was torn between asking and giving himself away finally he said i dont know her im sorry to hear that she has died but i can do nothing about it i hope you find the husband youre looking for standing his ground rutledge said she was struck over the head and left lying in her own doorway for two days until someone passing by the house happened to see her there and called the police its a murder inquiry mr teller and youd be wise to tell me what you know i can prove i have not left this house since my wife and i returned from london now get out it happened while you went missing from the clinic your brothers and your sister are unaccounted for as well you may have been sleeping in churches or you may not have they may have been searching in cambridge and cornwall and portsmouth or they may not have unless i can find this lieutenant teller and prove beyond a doubt that he is no connection of yours i have no choice but to consider you all as suspects in mrs tellers murder walter teller crossed the room took up the book from the table beside his chair and in one motion heaved it at rutledge it missed his head by inches and clattered against the door before falling hard to the floorboards ill assume that was a reflection of your distress rutledge told him coldly but ill advise you now never to try that again and he opened the door and left the study as he walked out of the house shutting the outer door behind him as well hamish said to rutledge he kens the lass but did he kill her back in london rutledge was met with a message left at the yard by edwin teller he drove to marlborough street and found teller waiting for him in the study teller said without preamble ive sent for you because i need to know when this woman will be buried ive given permission for the body to be released rutledge said and watched teller wince at the word body i should think services will be held in hobson tomorrow or the next day i should like to attend teller saw the surprise on rutledges face and said she was married to a man by the name of teller is that not so as far as we know and you havent found his family i take it no then i feel honor bound as the present head of the family to be there when she is interred as a gesture you may discover that her husband has no connection to my family its what i expect but i have a duty all the same then be there day after tomorrow if you are serious about this ive never been more so but i shall also tell you in no uncertain terms that it is a duty on my part entered into freely and it has nothing to do with her life or her death it is merely a show of respect i understand rutledge said and he thought he very likely did but he thought there might be as well a measure of curiosity mixed in with that sense of duty and he wondered who else might decide to come to hobson out of curiosity rutledge was driving back to the yard and was nearly there when he saw a woman walking along the street and stopping at the next corner to cross over she looked up at the same time and he realized it was susannah teller pulling over just beyond the crossing he said mrs teller mr rutledge i was just on my way to see you let me drive you the rest of the way he said or would you prefer to talk to me somewhere else perhaps we could walk to the bridge what i have to say israther private he took her to the yard left his motorcar there and then accompanied her to the river where a slight cooling breeze moved across the water she paused to look at the river and he realized she was not more than five feet from where bynum had been murdered shall we he said and gestured in the opposite direction it seemed that whatever she had to tell him was weighing on her mind but she was not certain how to begin or possibly where to begin he kept in step with her and let her take her time finally she said my husbandpeter has told me about this poor womanin lancashire is it the one who was murdered and he told me as well that you cant seem to find her husbands family he was from dorset i believe apparently yes its what we were told in hobson yes well i may have an explanation for this mystery she paused again and watched a small boat pulling upriver there was a young subaltern in my husbands regiment burrows was his name and he was from a good family he had connections to dorset but i believe his family lived outside worcester she glanced up at him and looked away again he was a very nice young man we saw a good bit of him and im afraid my husband and i made fun of him behind his back it was unkind but thomas admired my husband no end he had no older brothers and i think he saw peter as a role model in a way and he emulated peter at every turn when peter showed an interest in golf it became thomass enthusiasm when peter bought himself a pair of matched blacks to pull his carriage the next month thomas sported a pair that was almost identical peter grew a mustache and thomas must have one as well peter shaved his and soon after so did thomas it would have been very trying except for the fact that we knew it was harmless and what has this to do with the dead woman in hobson i dont know anything at all about hobson susannah teller said but i should imagine it was a very small place and that the dead woman her name he said was florence florence then that florence was not from a wealthy influential family however nice she might have been if you are trying to say she wasnt of his class she was a schoolteacher and not an heiress although she had property of her own oh her face flushed this is difficult enough for me inspector im not trying to disparage thisflorence teller but i wonder if perhaps thomas fell in love with her and married her under a false name or perhaps felt obligated to marry her and knew his mother and father would not approve of the match in fact they might well have cut him off without a penny i have no way of guessing his reasons but he might have been desperate enough to marry her not as thomas burrows the nephew of a member of parliament and the grandson of a baronet though the title went to his mothers brother but as the man he most admired peter it was rutledge thought as likely to be true as the possibility that her own husband was a bigamist and possibly a murderer as well ill look into it where is thomas burrows now lieutenant burrows died in the war he was shot leading his men across no mans land peter saw it happen by the time lieutenant burrows could be brought in he was dying and never reached an aid post and he never told his family about his marriage i find that difficult to believe i dont know whether he did or not but if he did they surely disowned him all i can tell you is that thomas burrows was a very different man when the war began the brash young subaltern striving so hard to please ten years before was by that time a very good officer but he had lost his illusions about the army and about himself he seldom spoke of his family nothing more was said about the army as a steppingstone to his uncles seat in parliament her voice rang true and yet he found it interesting that susannah teller had come to tell him this story and not her husband but sometimes women were more perceptive than men they caught undertones and nuances that were lost to male ears and drew conclusions that depended as much on intuition and instinct as on solid fact does your husband know that youve come to give me this information she blinked you can ask him if you like about thomas burrows hell tell you that thomas did all those things and perhaps more than even i can recall but i think he will be less willing to accept the fact that thomas could have married without his familys knowledge and consent and yet peter had to fight for me i was his cousin on his mothers side you see the family was against it from the start it was very likely that my children would have the same blood disorder that afflicts edwin they were right actually we lost two before we gave up it might color his feelings about thomas you see the fact that he never fought for thatfor florence and there he knew she was telling the truth but how much of it thank you mrs teller ill look into this matter may i drive you home no thank you ill just walk up to trafalgar and find a cab but he accompanied her that far anyway and hailed the cab for her as he was about to shut the door she put her hand out to stop him and said you wont tell peter where you heard this hell be very angry with me not he said unless its absolutely necessary thank you she spoke to the driver and the cab pulled away the last sight he had of her was a handkerchief in her hand pressed against her eyes when she thought he could no longer see her rutledge had asked the yard for information on any other peter teller and gibson had answers for him though from the sergeants terse manner rutledge knew that jake had been troublesome gibson said as to that infernal bird sir weve a list of things hes likely to eat ive put that on your desk along with a box of samples to see you through until you can decide what to do with the creature thank you sergeant is there anything else weve come up emptyhanded in our search for one peter teller you havent found one in all of england oh weve found them right enough one lives in gloucester and hes just on the point of celebrating his seventysixth birthday the other is one of a pair of twins peter and helen mowbray teller who are seven there was another peter teller in ely who died in of pneumonia the constable there believes he was about thirteen at the time the man outside new castle on tyne lost both his legs in a mining accident in he was a supervisor went down with his men to look at a troublesome face and there was an explosion the last one was the son of peter and susannah teller died age two of bleeding internally the list is also on your desk thank you sergeant ill relieve you of the infernal bird meanwhile if you will i need to know more about one lieutenant thomas burrows who didnt survive the war rutledge gave the particulars of his regiment and added uncle is an mp or was i believe his mother still lives somewhere outside worcester ill see to it sir and if i may make a suggestion id take the bird out covered before the chief super learns he was here we were able to blame one squawk on a baby whose mother had come in to complain of her neighbors rutledge laughed and went to recover jake not knowing what else to do at this time of dayit was well past his dinnertime and possibly jakes as wellrutledge took the bird home with him it was silent as the tomb on the journey in the motorcar but jake took an instant dislike to a jackdaw outside the flat window where rutledge set him at first and the loud denunciation of rutledges choice of accommodation was nearly deafening moving jakes cage to another window he took note of that beak and the condition of the papers inside the cage and wondered how to manage cleaning them without losing a finger or two in the process as a last resort rutledge put a little food on the table across from the cage and left the door open while he went to change his clothes and find something cool to drink when he came back jake didnt appear to have budged but the food rutledge had left out for him was gone he was tired and said to jake well deal with you tomorrow my lad shutting the cage door he sat down across from the bird and considered the days events but he found himself on the edge of sleep instead hamish said it wasna a verra profitable day but a beginning rutledge answered him drowsily the question now is how to put the pieces together and what well have when weve done it and then he had a horrible thought what if jake could hear hamish and began to speak in his voice that brought him wide awake a solution eluded him but he got up and flung a cloth over the birdcage and listened silently as jake began his nightly ritual of saying good night to peter chapter the parrot had finished its seeds and taken a bath in the water rutledge had left in the cage in the gray light of a misty morning rutledge showed the fatigue of a long drive and a short nights sleep he looked down at the stained newspapers in the bottom of the cage hed just watched jake crack a nut with ease and he had no intention of testing that beak against bone but something had to be done he was collecting fresh newspaper when there was a knock at the door of his flat and frances came in calling ian are you here i saw your motorcar shouldnt you be at the yard im in here he told her and she walked through to his bedroom where the bird was ensconced on a table by the double windows what possessed you to buy a parrot she asked stopping in astonishment but what a pretty creature does it have a name surely you dont have the time to care for it properly rutledge straightened and gazed fondly at his sister frances this is jake the bird is presently a ward of the court sergeant gibson has already cursed my offspring my hope of promotion and my mental capacity and so its here but youre right i dont have time to care for it properly you do would you like to be its guardian for the next several days ian you must be out of your mind what am i to do with a bird thats exactly what sergeant gibson said to me although he called me inspector rutledge you have a lovely window looking out onto the gardens it would be very happy there and all you have to do is feed it water it anderkeep the newspapers at the bottom of the cage fresh she had come over to the cage the bird was sitting on a swing regarding her with a fixed gaze then it blinked and ducked its head down in a shy motion i think its flirting with me she told her brother laughing look rutledge had wisely stepped aside yes i think it actually is the bird ducked its head down again and frances touched the wires of the cage with her fingers does it talk ive heard it say good night thats all so far pretty birdie she said lightly and then good morning jake to her surprise jake sidled over to her fingers and tucked his head down close to them i think he wants to be petted she moved her fingers through the wire and touched his feathers first on his shoulder and then his bent head he likes it she was smiling with that fondness women reserve for small children and baby animals oh you are a sweet boy rutledge had been on the point of warning her to watch the birds beak but stopped just in time hamish said ye ken it belonged to a woman jake was leaning into francess fingers clearly enjoying the personal contact then it shook itself and flew to the door of the cage he wants to come out not on your life rutledge told her but ian she was already unclasping the cage latch and she put her hand in the bird hopped on her fingers like a hawk perching on a falconers glove frances lifted her hand out of the cage then held it in the air looking at jake they stared at each other and then he flew to her shoulder moving back and forth across it in a bobbing motion if men were as malleable as this she said smiling at her brother women would be happy as larks frances he began no i cant imagine having to mind it all day no it likes you look at the feathers in the bottom of his cage hes been plucking them out i think in mourning his owner is dead but he likes you and he may be a witness who knows i need to see to it that hes safe and comfortable do you think he saw a murder is that it i doubt if he did but its possible that someone might confess if the killer thought jake knew something she held up two fingers and jake stepped passively on them no dont put him back not until ive cleaned out those newspapers frances talked quietly to the bird as her brother worked jake cocked his head as if trying to understand then ducked it for more petting was his owner a woman yes he lived with her for quite a few years they must have grown close he thought of that touching good night that jake must have heard week in and week out i believe he understands that im not his mistress but he knows im a woman the woman who had temporary care of him threatened to wring his neck he was screeching like a wild thing thats terrible will you take him if only for a few days frances took a deep breath i will not keep him ian are we clear on that but ill take him for your few days wonderful erwhy was it you stopped by for one thing david and little ian arrived home safely i thought youd like to know thats good to hear and she went on i must admit i miss the company i came to see if you could arrange a few days of leave we might go down to cornwall or somewhere for a bit just to get away and now im saddled with a parrot but she smiled wryly rutledge had cleaned the bottom of the cage and put in fresh newspaper washing his hands he said it wont be for long i promise you as for leave its just not possible at the moment in fact im driving north again this morning i cant say with any certainty when ill come back he followed her back to her house and settled jake in the breakfast room where sunlight breaking through the clouds promised a better day through an open window the scent of roses came wafting by on the light breeze jake bobbed as he gazed with interest out the open window roses he said quite clearly his owner rutledge told frances had a garden outside the kitchen windows this must remind him of his home it was a verra clever thing to do bringing him here hamish said rutledge left his sister coaxing jake to speak to her crooning softly and letting her fingers brush the birds feathers he was very grateful to make his escape before she changed her mind at the station he spoke to gibson who had no news of thomas burrows and then went to see the chief superintendent he filled bowles in on the direction he felt the case was taking and got in return a tonguelashing for disturbing the teller family without permission youre mad if you believe they have had any hand in this business ill be hearing complaints next and what am i to say that youve taken leave of your senses and why arent you in the north it makes no sense to be frittering your time away in london she wasnt murdered here this teller woman and there must be a dozen peter tellers out there find him gibson has given me a list of those he found not one of them is of the same age as we believe teller would have been now then tell sergeant gibson to look again rutledge went in search of gibson the sergeant said in resignation ill be bound i found every one there is but ill look again rutledge left him muttering to himself about time wasted he headed north picking up rain showers halfway and then it cleared as he turned toward thielwald and hobson constable satterthwaite had nothing to report when rutledge walked into the station and greeted him but im that glad to see you again any luck in the south the yard is still searching for lieutenant peter tellers family im beginning to think we have already found it the chief superintendent disagrees here are the facts theres a teller family in london three brothers one of them presently a captain in the army theres no reason they should even know florence tellers name but her death came as a shock to them im beginning to wonder if her killer realized she was dead he made no effort to find it out satterthwaite responded angrily which in my book is still murder what brought him here rutledge said thats why ive come back that and the funeral do you think mrs greeley will have a room for me again indeed sir she was asking just yesterday if i was expecting to see you no sign of the murder weapon as to that he must have taken it with him the services for florence teller theyre tomorrow satterthwaite told him im glad youll be here for them so am i rutledge said and went to find mrs greeley to his surprise the next morning edwin and amy teller arrived in good time for the service they found rutledge just coming out of the police station and asked if he could give them directions to the house where florence teller had lived you cant go inside he warned them this is still an active murder inquiry what he wanted to say was that it wasnt a spectacle for the teller family how florence teller had lived and died was now police business i understand edwin said and rutledge was surprised to realize that the man did it just seemedthe right thing to do then ill go with you he could tell it wasnt what they wanted but he got into the motorcar and told edwin to follow the high street out of hobson as they went amy commented on how empty the landscape was and how lonely rutledge thought it was a reflection of someone brought up in the south where the roads seldom lacked some form of habitation for very long edwin was silent concentrating on driving when at last they began to crest the rise before the house rutledge said ahead youll see a hedge stop at the gate he could feel the tension in the two people in the front seat and he thought is this how hamish knows whats on my mind but there was no time to consider that as edwin came to a halt in front of the house sunrise cottage amy read then looking up the path to the house she said a red door once rutledge said mrs teller painted it to celebrate her husbands homecoming only he never returned she left it perhaps in the hope that someday he would or because she couldnt bear to give up all hope edwin sat there looking up at the house its not a very pleasing house is it he mused aloud small and plain and isolated she lived here alone thats sad he could have done better by her perhaps it was what she wanted amy said after a moment what she was used to she took pride in ityou can see that still the silence lengthened finally edwin let in the clutch and said i must find somewhere to turn around theres a farmyard just down the road rutledge told them edwin found it and was soon headed back into hobson when they reached the police station rutledge said mrs greeleys house is just there im sure she will let you have a room to freshen up she needs the money edwin thanked him and drove on rutledge could see them speaking together but not even hamishs sharp hearing could discern what was being said satterthwaite had come out and was looking after them and who might they be when theyre at home edwin teller and his wife from london he considers himself the head of the essex branch of the family he felt it was his duty to be here to represent the family that we havent found his brother is captain peter teller kind of him satterthwaite said shortly wheres his brother then does he resemble peter teller do you think satterthwaite considered the question in a vague way hard to judge with yon beard remember ive not seen the man for years i dont know how the war changed him after a moment he said does the wife know about florence amy yes she must rutledge looking back to his first meeting with her nodded but its peters wife who has taken the news the hardest st bartholomews bell rather more tinny than deep throated had begun tolling the age of the departed satterthwaite nodded its time they walked down the high street turning up church lane at the war memorial rutledge saw cobb pausing there for his morning greeting to his sons then move on his cane supporting him over the uneven ruts of the lane watching him rutledge said thoughtfully edwin tellers brother was badly wounded in the war hes in need of a cane as well but he doesnt always have it to hand im told mr cobb sleeps with his on the bed on his wifes side youve looked into his nephew lawrence anything more on that front since i left ive kept my eye on him but theres nothing there i saw him wielding a hammer in anger well see shall we if theres any guilt shown today fair enough people from the village were also walking up the lane and among them rutledge saw the tellers in mourning black that was stylishly cut and out of place here among the rusty black of ordinary clothes that hung unused from monday to saturday st barts was as plain inside as it was on the outside built for sturdiness built to last built to worship and not adore rutledge had the fleeting thought that cromwell would have approved but the people of hobson had probably not approved of cromwell or king charles their independence came from the land they farmed not from london and it was a hard life short as well the service was brief and as plain as the surroundings in which it was held the curate spoke simply about our dear departed sister listing the major events of her life and commenting only once about her death as an undeserved tragedy he read several psalms and the choir led the mourners in three hymns including rock of ages and then they moved to the churchyard watching the plain coffin being lowered into the ground next to the open grave was the small patch of grass slightly lower than its surroundings that marked her sons resting place a rosebush bloomed where a stone should have been the small pink blossoms reminding rutledge of one very much like it hed seen in florence tellers garden beyond timmys grave was a third the sod flat and untouched no one stepped forward at first to throw in the first handful of earth until the constable came up did his duty and said under his breath i hope youve found peace now edwin walked up stared for a moment into the grave as if he were praying and then took a firm handful of earth and scattered it gently it dropped like the first sounds of a heavy rain on the roof as it struck the wooden coffin amy teller followed him and others came up as well among them mrs greeley and then sam jordan lawrence cobb watched by his uncle paused for a moment looking up at the cloudless sky then gently dropped a yellow rose into the grave it landed at the broadest part of the coffin and he nodded as if that was what hed intended without a word he walked on ignoring the redhaired woman just behind him rutledge could see her resemblance to mrs blaine but betsy was slimmer prettier her mouth was drawn tight now and he noticed that she didnt look into the grave or reach for a handful of earth instead her eyes were fixed on her husband hamish said hell no spend a restful night rutledge was the last of the mourners to step forward mr kerr gave the benediction and then florence marshall teller was left to the attentions of the gravediggers and the sexton rutledge stood there for a moment longer then went to join edwin and amy teller as they walked back to their motorcar im glad we came edwin said with conviction it was the right thing to do a very simple service rutledge said but i think it suited her ive always liked that psalm amy said i will lift mine eyes unto the hills edwin said the curate spoke of a child a boy were there any other children only the one son im told he died of illness many years ago but you told mei thought you said he was still alive amy accused him i said i was unable to ask his views rutledge answered her how sad edwin teller said the words sounded sincere rather than a conventional expression of sympathy for her was she your sisterinlaw rutledge asked without emphasis edwin teller stared at him this is neither the time nor the place he snapped rutledge replied where then is the proper place but there was no answer to that even amy teller looked away her face pale they had nearly reached the teller motorcar before he could press the issue rutledge was distracted by a boy running toward the churchyard in the direction of constable satterthwaite rutledge excused himself and left the tellers standing there by the time hed reached the spot where satterthwaite was standing listening to the boy the constable looked up he said in a low voice a message from the police in thielwald theyve found a walker who admits to being in the vicinity around the time mrs teller was killed he cant be sure of the exact day but it fits well enough hes being held there are you coming sir yes my motorcar is at mrs greeleys house ill meet you there in five minutes satterthwaite said he thanked the boy and turned to speak to the curate commenting on the service thielwald had ancient roots but the town itself looked as if it had been born in the last century and had no recollection of any past before that rutledge had only seen it in late evening the night he and constable satterthwaite had called on dr blake whose surgery was in a side street before they had reached the high street he could see now that thielwalds gray stone houses were crowded along the main road which was bisected by a few cross streets in the town center there were the usual shops and a busy pub called the vikings head the church was just beyond the center as plain as the one in hobson but slightly larger its churchyard clustered around it like lost souls on the windswept rise hamish who had been quiet during the service and the drive here said its no a place id like to live rutledge had been thinking the same thingno character to set it off no natural features to make it more attractive a small town with no pretensions seeing the post office set in a corner of an ironmongers shop rutledge said ah id like to make a brief stop here before we see this walker i want to ask the postmistress a question can it wait no he halted the motorcar and leaving it running he said to the constable wait here i shouldnt be more than five minutes striding into the ironmongers he turned to the left and found the tiny square of space that was thielwalds post office the middleaged woman behind the counter smiled as he approached and said what can i do for you today sir rutledge identified himself and asked if she handled the mail for hobson as well oh yes sir its carried up to the village once a day and delivered not that theres much of it now the wars over business was quite brisk then you know everyone writing to a soldier son or father or brother quite brisk do you recall mail for mrs florence teller yes sir thats florence marshall that was she got the most exotic packets sometimes covered with foreign stamps i always wondered what was inside you know mrs greeley told me once there were silk pillow slips from china i hardly know where to find china on the map and heres silk pillow slips coming to my own post office it must have been quite exciting he agreed did mrs teller write to her family or her husbands family in england letters you mean yes was there an exchange of letters with members of her husbands family were trying to locate them its the matter of her will i dont believe she ever did no nothing like that she wrote to lieutenant teller and he wrote to her and that was the end of it where did she send the letters to lieutenant teller what regiment do you remember but they didnt go to his regiment sir they were mailed to an address in dorset lieutenant teller had told her it was faster than waiting for the army to send them on still and all it was sometimes many months before a reply came where in dorset do you remember he tried not to sound eager she frowned a place called sedley i think it was peter teller in care of a rno i believe it was a p repton mistletoe cottage sedley dorset she finished triumphantly and smiled at him i rather liked mistletoe cottege repton was the name of the village outside witch hazel farm where the teller family had lived for generations in essex not dorset he thanked her and left so much for the theory of blackmail any luck sir the constable asked when rutledge came back to the motorcar and they drove on another dead end most likely at least there was no correspondence between mrs teller and her husbands family satterthwaite said just there and pointed out the police station which looked as if it had once been a shop itself the front window overwhelming the door set to the side inspector hadden was waiting for them with a scruffylooking young man who was rutledge thought an undergraduate student somewhere he was introduced as benjamin larkin who stood to shake hands with rutledge and the constable his voice when he spoke was educated and he said at once i was in a pub south of morecambe when i heard there was a murder over by hobson a woman in an isolated farmhouse so i got in touch with the police it appears to be the same one i passed several days back i was going to stop in and ask to refill my water bottle but there was a motorcar on the far side of the hedge and so i moved on a motorcar did you see anyone in it hadden asked but rutledge said start at the beginning if you will it was midafternoon i think i was coming over the rise taking in the view and there was a house to my left i saw a pump in the kitchen yard and i thought i might stop and refill my bottle but no one was about so i thought perhaps id come around the front and knock rather than help myself the view was rather nice and i moved toward my right to see more of it when i realized there was a road below the house not just a lane i didnt remember that being on the rough map i had so i stopped and dug in my gear for it to be sure i wasnt in the wrong place i was walking and looking at the map when i saw a motorcar was stopped at the end of the high hedge surrounding the front garden it seemed to me that the owner might have come up from morecambeit was that kind of motor and it occurred to me that it would do no harm to ask for a lift no one was around so i sat down by a small shrub and ate the last of my biscuits hoping he wouldnt be long i was just putting away my map when i could hear footsteps and there he was hurrying back to the motorcar he was lame finding it difficult to deal with the crank but before i could collect my gear and hail him the motor turned over and he hobbled around to haul himself in i didnt like the look of the situationhe appeared to be angry or upset not the time to ask favors i just walked on and thought no more about it until i heard talk in the pub where i spent last night did he see you hadden asked i have no idea probably not i did notice that he glanced around as if looking for something but it all happened rather fast where did he go from there rutledge asked he was driving east what can you tell me about the motorcar it was a black rolls well kept and quite clean i hadnt expected to see that out here he turned to inspector hadden adding with no disrespect but it was more the sort of vehicle youd find in a city it hadnt been used to haul cabbages or saddles or hens and the man rutledge said he had more or less taken over the questioning hadden deferring to him lame as i told you tall slim darkish hair military cut well dressed like the car he seemed out of place here was there a quarrel do you think was that what had upset him i cant say i wasnt close enough to hear if there was but no one was shouting if thats what youre asking still not the time to be knocking on doors or asking for a lift did he have a cane or some sort of tool in his handdid you see him toss anything into the motorcar like a box i dont knowno actually i do larkin squinted as if bringing back the scene in his memory he was emptyhanded when he went to crank the car but if id seen a cane i wouldnt have been surprised given the problem with his legs describe the rolls if you will black well polished ghost touring car rather like the one you drove up in save for the color and very like the one edwin teller had just driven away in hamish said do ye believe the lad all things considered rutledge thought he did larkin neednt have come forward for one thing hed already disappeared into the landscape but sometimes cases turned on unexpected evidence like this where are you studying rutledge asked curious cambridge larkin answered and named his college which is why this was a walking tour and not two weeks in italy i couldnt afford it he added with a grin did you see anyone at the house a woman or notice that the house had a red door i never saw the door no one was in the kitchen yard i dont know about the front garden there was the hedge you see nearly as tall as i was rutledge turned to hadden and satterthwaite anything else they had no further questions rutledge thanked larkin and told him he could go and then he said as larkin reached behind the desk and lifted his haversack would you mind if i looked in that larkin slung it off his shoulder and said help yourself mind the dirty wash but there was nothing in the pack that could have been used for a weapon and nothing that could have come from florence tellers house only spare clothes a tarp for wet weather a hairbrush a toothbrush a comb a block of soap a razor a book on english wildflowers and another on birds a heavy bottle for water and a small sack of dried fruit biscuits sweets and a heel of cheese nothing in fact that a walker shouldnt have and everything he should hamish said he could ha left behind anything he didna want you to see it was true but the very compactness of the haversack intended to minimize weight and maximize comfort in a small space didnt allow for extras rutledge nodded asked for his address at cambridge and when that was done thanked him again larkin went out the door what do you think inspector hadden asked echoing hamish ill ask the yard to be sure hes who he says he is but i expect hes telling the truth was it teller coming home satterthwaite asked if it was he has money now i never thought he did before he had enough that he wasnt looking to live on florences money from her aunt but not rich a good point rutledge acknowledged pass the word to keep an eye on larkin while hes in the district he might be able to identify the driver if we find him turning to satterthwaite rutledge said did you look at that hedge around the front of the house if i wanted to rid myself of a murder weapon i might consider sticking it deep in there its thick enough satterthwaite said slowly no we did not under it yes but wed have seen anything in the branches wouldnt we it wont hurt to have another go at it by the time they reached sunrise cottage clouds were building far out over the water and satterthwaite scanning them said looks like this fine weather is about to break im glad the service was dry rutledge agreed with him but he thought they had another hour they searched the hedge carefully together pulling at the thickest parts of it and then letting them fall back into place inch by inch they worked one side and across the front as they came round to the corner closest to the house rutledge had to step into the hedge to make it easier to part the thick branches there and grunting satterthwaite pushed and shoved at them rutledge nearly lost his footing and caught the constables shoulder to steady himself he turned to look down the earth under the hedge was thick with last winters fallen leaves and possibly those of winters before that they formed a light bed perhaps a good inch or so deep cobb the schoolmaster had told rutledge that since the war there had been no one but his nephew to help with the farm and this was proof of it whats the matter satterthwaite asked as rutledge knelt to run his fingers through the damp and rotting mass he had to dig deep into the soil below but it was loose enough and damp enough for him to wedge his fingers behind something there he found what he was after and pulled it toward him he could hear the constables indrawn breath as he realized what was coming to light not a walking stick as the doctor had first suggested but the remains of a malacca cane rutledge stood up with it in his hands although filthy with leaves still clinging to it it was not an old and rotting thing it had been hidden here fairly recently buried just deep enough that a policeman searching among the sparse hedge trunks close to the ground would have seen only what he expected to seethe carpet of leaves but someone had taken the sharp end and used it to thrust the length of the cane out of sight well below that layer if i hadnt felt it under my sole i wouldnt have thought to dig rutledge said running his hands along the wood gently brushing off the debris theres no head satterthwaite pointed out the head had been broken off and the smooth dark red shaft was still raw where the wood had been splintered it would match the wound in florence tellers heador at least the murderer thought it might he frowned it wouldnt be easy to snap off the head rattan palm canes are very strong there must have been a weaknesswhere the cane had dried and cracked around the knob that served as a handle why leave the rest why not take the cane and throw it off a bridge far from here the killer wouldnt have wanted to be seen with it in his possession but if he brought it here yes thats the point but it only became a weapon once florence teller was killed before that it was simply someones cane he looked around the tidy bit of lawn the flowers on the path the step and the street door they hadnt been disturbed hamish said the step it was a long rectangular slab of stone smoothed to serve the doorway rutledge walked over to it and ran his hands along the edge someone could have shoved the head of the cane under the slab and with the force of anger or of fear managed to snap it off brush the earth back again where the head had dug in and who would notice what had been done if the police hadnt found the cane the slab of step would hold no significance someone having just killed had taken the time to think through what to do with the weapon that was an interesting look into his state of mind whoever he was rutledge began to sift the earth very gently through his fingers moving aside a plant and reaching down under the stone the head of the cane wasnt there he hadnt expected it to be but hed had to be sure he was just smoothing the earth back into place when hamish said there rutledge stopped there was nothing he could see at first and then he recognized what was caught in the roots of the pansy it was not as big as a toothpick just a fine splinter of wood like the proverbial needle in a haystack it was in fact more like a needle than anything else one that had been held to a flame and tarnished he dug it out carefully blew away the earth that smothered it and put up his hand for the broken end of the cane that satterthwaite was still holding there was no match of course but there was no doubt that it was the same wood satterthwaite said it was savagely done hed have liked to hit her a second time i expect one blow was not enough to satisfy him i wonder why because she died so easily or would her battered head give him away the walker larkin i doubt it the only thing taken was a box of letters i wonder where the head of the cane might be was it valuable do you think larkin indicated he had no money to speak of this summer he might have found the cane here and stolen the head but that would be after the murder and her body would have been lying here in plain sight still rutledge turned to stare beyond the gate in the direction of thielwald its just as well were keeping an eye on him he returned to the cane in hand it will be a miracle if we ever find the rest it must have been distinctive he thought this head they were usually ivory or gold with initials or a figure that could easily be identified and therefore was equally damning he wondered if edwin teller would be willing to describe his brothers cane tellers motorcar tellers cane but none of these was proof of murder only that he was here on the day that florence teller died or one of his brothers was here the man in the motorcar he didna have a cane when he left hamish pointed out but we dont know if he carried one with him when he arrived for all we know he found the body and panicked hed spoken aloud satterthwaite said the man in the motorcar that could be he didnt have the casket of letters either what if hed already put them in the boot he might have returned to the house to destroy the cane true enough id sworn wed searched that hedge carefully im sure you did but not the ground below it only for something caught in it rutledge put the splinter of wood carefully away in his handkerchief and then dusted his hands looking up at the sky at the heavy dark clouds drawing closer he said well be caught yet turning to satterthwaite he said did you sift the ashes in the stove in the event anything was burned in there we did and nothing came to light of course it might not have if there were no hinges on that box or clasp itud burned right up but that would take time in my mind he took the box with him all right then i think we should be on our way to hobson before that storm gets here as it happened they had only just reached the police station when the dark clouds heavy with rain rolled in on their heels satterthwaite thanked rutledge and said youre staying the night i want to take the cane to london as quickly as i can ill see that you know what we found out you think the answer is in london then one of those brothers i dont know rutledge told him but you and i have run out of suspects here let me try in london satterthwaite grinned youll drown before you get there and he made a fast dash for the door of the station just as the first heavy drops of rain became a raging downpour backed with wind it was a cold rain for june and it followed rutledge nearly as far as chester he ran out of it there and considered staying the night another fifty miles down the road but his mind was busy with new directions and he was in a hurry to test them chapter edwin teller drove through the night after leaving hobson intent on getting as far from hobson as possible they had discussed stopping halfway as they had done coming up and he had overruled the idea london was home it was sanctuary it was not on the north road where every mile was a reminder at home he could forget amy was asleep in the seat beside him and he felt more lonely than he could ever remember feeling in his life he had done the right thing attending the services for florence teller they had all tried to dissuade him amy and susannah and peter he hadnt asked walters opinion it wasnt important to him given the circumstances he wasnt sure why he had felt such an urgent need to be there she wasnt what the others called herthe woman as if she had no identity that mattered someone who had caused more trouble with her death than she had ever caused in her lifetime florence marshall teller he whispered the words and the night wind whipped them away florence marshall teller he recalled reading somewhere that as long as someone living still remembered ones name one was never truly dead florence marshall teller beside him amy stirred then settled herself again without waking he envied her he thought that of all of them inspector rutledge had understood his need a member of the familyeven if she had no family to call her own and was only a teller by marriage there was a dignity in that and something in the policemans face as he stood by the graveside reflected what he himself was feeling that she had deserved better he didnt want to remember that plain house on its windswept knoll he didnt want to think about the plain wooden coffin and the plain little churchyard it had made him want to lash out at all of them and tell them the truth but it would have hurt too many people and so it had had to be buried with her next to the boy she must have loved beyond bearing alone as she was edwin shook his head trying to clear it and concentrate on the road ahead his duty to the family that meant all of them divided though his loyalties were the duty remained and he would say nothing he would go to his grave in silence if need be but if he did he would carry it on his conscience beyond his last breath god bless you florence marshall teller chapter rutledge reached london in the small hours of the night and went to his flat to sleep he was in a quandary over the cane peter teller of course would deny any knowledge of it but edwin would have made the journey back to london in easy stages and would reach marlborough street tomorrow at the earliest walter teller then leaving london for the trunk road he caught sight of charlie hood again this time walking briskly along the pavement head down and buried in his thoughts rutledge pulled over and called to him hood turned around stared at rutledge for a moment then placed him reluctantly he came toward the motorcar saying you dont have that mans murderer in custody do you there was a mixture of emotions in his voice fear uppermost not yet i dont think hes killed again no hes lying low somewhere ill be bound he didnt expect to stir up a hornets nest now did he do you know a walter teller rutledge asked still trying to place that vague sense of having seen hood before teller should i is that what youre calling the boy we still dont have a name for him i have a feeling the one he gave me was not his stands to reason he was committing a crime wasnt he is your name charlie hood rutledge countered its as good a one as any hood straightened up then he said watch yourself mate with that he walked off ignoring rutledge who called to him to come back and finish the conversation turning a corner hood was quickly out of sight hood had heard something rutledge thought in that secretive telegraph system that tied the poor and the wanted and the running together and no policeman knew the key hamish said he answered the question aboot teller wi one of his ain so he did ill give you odds he and teller crossed paths he considered that when he gave his account of the bynum killing he was coming from the direction of the abbey i wonder if teller slept there or if it was in another church and then he swore in his pocket was the photograph of walter teller that jenny teller had let him borrow to help the police find her husband he had carried it with him first to use and then to return to her and he had not yet kept his promise he could have shown it to hood who knew what nameif anyteller had been using while he was invisible in london people behind rutledge were sounding their horns telling him to move on he did for a moment consider returning to the yard but by the time he could send anyone to search for hood the man would have been lost to sight again he drove on to essex and found teller deadheading his roses after the nights rain teller looked up when he saw the motorcar coming up the drive and straightened as if preparing himself for what was to come rutledge left the motorcar on the drive and walked across the lawns toward the roses theyve done well this year he said you havent come all this way to praise our roses no but they reminded me that lawrence cobb had put one in florence tellers grave i think he was in love with her tellers face tightened i dont know a lawrence cobb no thats probably true did you know a charlie hood no then can you describe the cane that your brother peter uses for his leg his cane the swift change in direction caught teller unprepared yes was it ash by any chance as i remember teller said frowning it was malacca ive seen it so often to tell you the truth i dont heed it anymore the knob at the end teller was wary now ivory i think a gorgons head why was he lying or telling the truth it was hard to read his face we have reason to believe it was a cane that killed florence teller we found part of it in the hedge surrounding the front garden i havent seen your brother using his of late instead he struggles to get around without one i suspect hes trying to wean himself from the use of it i doubt that from the type of wound he suffered i should think he will need a cane for the rest of his life that may be its likely rutledge said harshly that he used that cane to kill florence teller his motorcar was seen outside the house that same day weve found that cane and we have a witness who can describe both the driver and the vehicle teller said peter would have no reason to kill the woman whats she to him he went back to the roses his face turned away his first wife very likely rutledge said i think youve suspected that all along she had a child you know a boy if timmy had lived he would have displaced your son as heir this is arrant supposition my brother was in love with susannah and it was three years before he could win the familys approval to wed her why would he take another wife in the meantime lawrence cobb wanted to marry florence teller ive told you and when he couldnt he married mrs blaines daughter your brother may have acted in haste and disappointment and then lived to regret it the strain on tellers face was plain to see as he looked up do you think id have countenanced that do you think id have let him wed susannah if id known there was an impediment to the marriage i dont know did you attend their wedding i was in west africa i didnt learn of it until months later and so you let it stand by default but he continued to visit hobson in fact even after his marriage i have witnesses to that too after the war when his leg was so badly damaged he couldnt travel north he let her believe he was dead an easy solution i wont listen to any more of this its a hodgepodge of wishful thinking and makebelieve theres not a grain of truth in it it was more a cry of pain than of denial rutledge nodded and walked back to his motorcar he turned it and then drove back up the drive when he was nearly out of sight of the rose bed he glanced in his rearview mirror walter teller was bent over his arms wrapped around his body as if he were in pain his head down rutledge was too far away to see his face but he carried with him the image of a man in agony he decided to drive on to leticia tellers house and when he got there he found that once more mary brittingham was ahead of him when the maid showed him into the garden he realized that the two women had been having words they hadnt heard his approach their faces flushed their eyes bright they were confronting each other standing several feet apart as if any closer might lead to blows as he stepped through the gate from the shrubbery they turned to stare at him as if hed dropped down from the moon a creature they had never seen before and dangerous leticia forced herself to smile inspector rutledge she said mary is just leaving on the contrary i want to hear what hes got to say leticias mouth tightened its nothing to do with you this business id be grateful if you leave mary said my sister is married to your brother im here to protect her shes not as strong as i am leticia said through clenched teeth that can wait until we see what the inspector has come to say turning to him she added i must assume we owe the pleasure of your company to yard business he said ive come to ask you what you know about florence teller yes that woman in lancashire i understand she was found murdered its a tragedy of course but nothing to do with us i dont understand how we can help you leticia said your brother felt it had enough to do with your family that he attended her funeral yesterday the two women their quarrel forgotten were giving him their undivided attention now which brother leticia demanded finally its the first ive heard of this not peter surely edwin teller as we havent yet been able to locate her husbands relations he felt it was his duty to represent the teller family there was amy with him leticia asked as marys voice cut across hers duty theres damning evidence piling up against peter teller he told them i have a shard of cane in my motorcar part of the murder weapon if im not mistaken i have not seen your brother use a cane since ive met him but im sure sergeant biggin in london will remember if there was one before i came on the scene a witness saw what we believe was your brothers motorcar in front of the victims house the day she died and then watched a lame man matching your brothers description hobbling out to crank it and drive away in some haste he was angryupset according to the witness and if we take a sample of your brothers handwriting im sure it will match the signature in the records of st bartholomews church in hobson where florence marshall and peter teller were married for that matter i could bring a dozen or more witnesses from hobson who knew teller well enough to recognize him if they saw him now leticia said then why havent your arrested him there are one or two loose ends to tie up for instance when you were in portsmouth looking for your brother walter where was peter he was with edwin she said immediately they went together to share the driving since both of them have had health problems it was agreed but that makes very little sense the four of you left jenny teller in london at the clinic alone why didnt peter since he found it so difficult to drive stay with her and cope with the police cambridge was not so great a distance for edwin we did what we thought was most useful we might well have found walter if hed left london we were fairly sure we would and peter was there to spell edwin if he were too tired to carry on leticias eyes were hard peter couldnt have been in two places at once he pointed out i suggest to you that he went to lancashire under cover of his brothers disappearance because he knew walter would try to stop him whether edwin knew at the time what it was peter was intending to do i cant say but it would explain very well why edwin felt compelled to attend florence tellers funeral it wasnt a kind gesture to another of his name it was a guilty conscience because he lied to protect peter mary said with interest youve worked out all the details but what if they arent true what if its all circumstantial evidence it could be you know ive known peter for a good many years i cant believe he would have married someone else when he was so devoted to susannah thats the human evidence mr rutledge however beautiful or exotic or wealthy or socially prominent this woman was he was waiting to marry susannah she was none of those things and that may be the key an opportunist perhaps he met her on a walking tour and there was a child he might have had no choice but to marry her but this child leticia added hes older than harry or was he never born because he didnt exist whats become of him he was the elder hes dead well then she countered if the child is dead there was no longer a tie he would have divorced the woman as soon as he uncovered her lie we have it on good authority that he was still involved with florence teller until the war i dont think he could make up his mind mary said im glad i stayed this is nonsense but it will upset jenny no end shes very fond of peter and susannah she turned to leticia were all invited to the farm to celebrate jennys birthday on friday its going to be a very uncomfortable state of affairs i must contact our solicitor the time to stop this ridiculous business is now before the police act on what they consider their evidence thank you for your information inspector i hope you will come to your senses and realize that you are about to take a step that will seriously jeopardize your career i suggest you look into the background of this woman the solution to her murder is there not with my family he accepted his dismissal there was other information he needed to collect now a p repton for one that would explain why florence teller had never tried to contact peter through the army or at his london house at the wars end rutledge stopped in cambridge and asked the porter at kings for information about one benjamin larkin the porter looked him up and down and who might be inquiring about one of our young gentlemen sir rutledge scotland yard rutledge produced his identification and the porter scanned it closely then satisfied he said hes one of our brighter lads never been in trouble comes of a good family ive seen his father visit a time or two a doctor im told he hesitated and whats he done if i may ask to draw the attention of the yard hes helping us with an inquiry i would expect no less of him very fine young lad is larkin rutledge digested this as he drove west and then south toward dorset he found sedley in the middle of the county a village with houses directly on the road some of them whitewashed others of local stone there was a small but handsome church a pub and a green where geese swam in the warm waters of a shallow pond in the pub he paused for a late lunch and information mistletoe cottage the man who brought his meal repeated its just on your left as you go out of sedley does a p repton still live there a poh youll be meaning alice preston not repton she died in the summer of and is buried along there in the churchyard a strange old bird she came into money some years ago and told rector she had only to receive and mail letters to earn it rector thought she was going dotty but she traveled to shaftesbury every week on the bakers cart to the post office there faithfully rain or shine if you want the truth i expect she was just having us on what else did she do to earn this windfall that was it then how did this woman in dorset come to know peter teller did she have a son or nephew in the army by any chance not that any of us knew about the man told him what did she do with her free time when not traveling to the post office she knitted for a missionary society shed collect odd bits of yarn around the village and then shed make these scarves and gloves and hats for children in faraway places quite colorful some of them she said foreign children liked bright colors which mission society do you know one in oxford i think it was not kent no im sure it was oxford they have missions amongst the eskimos a dead end circumstantial evidence with no way to learn if she was the same woman the postmistress had described likely yes but that was as far as it went all the same when hed finished his lunch rutledge went to shaftesbury and inquired at the post office there but all the postmistress could tell him was that miss preston sent and received letters sporadically although she didnt recall the name peter teller i remember her only because she was eccentric she told him apologetically and then just as rutledge reached the post office door the postmistress said ohtheres something else alice told me once she was nursery maid in the household of evelyn darley my mother remembered evelyn and her twin sister when they came out she said they were the prettiest girls shes ever seen i asked alice if it was true and she said it was rutledge stared at her in disbelief then smiled and thanked her this was the connection hed hoped for and very nearly missed evelyn darleys twin sister was gran the teller grandmother peter teller had paid alice preston onetime nursery maid to his greataunt evelyn long since retired to sedley in dorset to act as gobetween so that florence teller never wrote directly to him through his regiment and his letters back to her never gave away whether he was on leave or with the army hed told her according to the postmistress in thielwald that it was the safest surest way to reach him and when alice preston died in the summer of peter let this only link to florence die with her lieutenant teller never came home from the war rutledge went to find a telephone he could just see the mellow stone of the church from where he was standing in the hotel lounge asking to be connected to the yard when gibson was brought to the telephone rutledge asked if there was any more news about one lieutenant burrows whom susannah teller had told him about its true enough he was killed in the war the only son widowed mother lives in worcester off the milton road the familys well connected army and politics ive also had the army looking for another peter teller they move like treacle but they searched the regimental records where our captain teller served and hes the only one of that name they could find going back a generation any reason to believe that a widow turning up would distress the burrows family thats the interesting bit sir the lieutenant married on his last leave and leaves a widow no children she has married again and now lives in scotland hamish said it wouldna signify yon lass didna ken how to find her husbands family but rutledge was prepared for anything he thanked gibson and put up the receiver no stone unturned hamish said again it doesna signify it was important enough for susannah teller to bring it to my attention aye with lies to throw you off the track of her ain husband he drove on toward worcester tired now and ready to end the game of chase hed been playing but it was the last of the outstanding questions and when it came to trial rutledge preferred not to leave anything to chance the house where the burrows family lived was on the southern outskirts of worcester with a river view it was a large and comfortable estate set back from the road the house was of the same stone as the famous cathedral with a portico and white pillars leading up two steps to the door a fountain featuring a statue of neptune a conch held to his lips and water horses at each corner spouting streams of water formed the centerpiece of the circular drive from the age of the fountain rutledge thought it might have been shipped home from a grand tour a generation ago wisteria climbed the wall of one wing of the house and an old climbing rose set off the stonework on the opposite side when rutledge lifted the knocker he could hear the sound echoing through the house and expected to find it was empty for the summer but a maid in crisp black came to answer his summons and he asked to speak to mrs burrows she wanted to know his business and he identified himself after a time she came back and escorted him to a sitting room overlooking a shrubbery where a woman of perhaps sixtyfive waited to greet him her graying hair was put up in the older style and her clothing was rather oldfashioned as well but her blue eyes were alert and wary what brings the yard to my door she asked after asking him to sit down a wildgoose chase at a guess he said smiling your son thomas was im told lost in the war yes such a promising future lost with him as well it was a pity does this have to do with thomas i cant think why i understand that his widow has remarried and lives in scotland yes elizabeth was the sweetest girl a perfect match my husband and i were terribly pleased can you tell me where your son might have been in im sorry i cant give you the month summer i should think of she smiled thats very easy to do he contracted rheumatic fever and nearly died it was something of a miracle that he lived we had him with us for almost fifteen more years the doctor warned us there might be lasting effects but thank god he sprang back to health with the vigor of youth and was chafing at the bit to rejoin his regiment did he walk as a way of recovering his strength for instance in lancashire which isnt as demanding as the lake country or derbyshire or perhaps he took the sea air in morecambe i dont believe anyone in this family has ever been to morecambe im beginning to think you must have the wrong burrows inspector were trying to find anyone who might have been in that vicinity in and into it couldnt have been our thomas he was very ill for weeks and then there were weeks of recovery after that walking tours would have been impossible she frowned ive always had the feeling that thomas knew he was living on borrowed time he grasped life with such eagerness after that i was surprised his regiment allowed him to sail with them for india but of course the long sea journey was good for him rutledge hadnt intended to name names but he could see no other choice do you perhaps know peter teller who was in your sons regiment yes we met him at a regimental affair quite a handsome young man in his dress uniform and his wife was charming susannah was that her name imagine remembering it after all these years but i couldnt help but think watching her that i hoped thomas would find someone just as loving i heard from friends that captain teller was severely wounded and is still recovering is there better news now hes walking again rutledge told her though still with great difficulty im glad thomas admired him so i must say that if my son had to emulate anyone peter teller was as fine a choice as i could wish for susannah teller had been right about the imitation then but either shed forgotten or didnt know about thomas burrowss illness hamish said ye ken hed ha put it behind him it was no something to bring up and that was true stiff upper lip and all that for a young subaltern just learning to fit in rutledge took his leave thanking her for her help but ive given you very little she said i hope your inquiry prospers in the motorcar once more rutledge said as he let out the clutch i dont think susannah teller expected her story to collapse so quickly aye thats verra likely but shes afraid her husband is a murderer and she may be right he took a deep breath its time to go to hobson constable satterthwaite and his superiors have the right to know where were looking and what the evidence is he will be verra angry hamish warned it was a cruel thing to do to such a lass he stayed the night in cheshire and drove the rest of the way to hobson just after first light the village was awake and the shops busy when he got there constable satterthwaite was pleased to see him standing in the police station doorway with a packet of tea biscuits in his hand and smiling did you learn anything more about larkin i went to his college in cambridge the porter there vouched for him meanwhile ive been searching for the real peter teller not the man you thought you knew that man never existed i met himwe saw him time and again here in hobson the constable argued he wasnt a figment of her imagination or ours besides theres the boy he was someone else theres much to tell you rutledge said taking the chair across the desk as they reached the office the man in london then satterthwaite said with resignation rutledge proceeded to outline what he had learned so far and how he believed it all fit together satterthwaite listened in silence but his face reddened as the evidence against peter teller mounted why did he have to kill her then he asked finally she thought he was dead it was finished i dont know yet rutledge admitted damn the man he said heavily and then to rutledge im sorry sir but you werent here i was id like very much to watch him hang for what hes done not just the murder you understand although that was bad enough but for her empty life for not being there when timmy died and she was half out of her mind with grief wanting to bury him at the farm and not in the churchyard we had all we could do to convince her to let us take him away she wanted him there where she could see him every day rutledge was reminded of mr cobb who spoke to the memorial to his sons every morning and every evening he could understand her need satterthwaite got up and paced the floor his feet heavy on the boards as he traced the same line back and forth back and forth then he stopped and looked at rutledge it all fits together i must say it does but in spite of what i feel about the bastardbegging your pardon sirits hard to believe isnt it that someone could be that cruel i never got to know teller well of course but i wouldnt have put him down as that coldblooded selfish yes he was that he shook his head itull take a little getting used to youll bring him back to hobson to face charges yes on monday id like to be with you when you take him to thielwald ill see that its arranged thank you sir and thank you for telling me it means more than i can say ill keep it to myself until you bring the man here he cleared his throat will you be staying the night i might as well and get an early start tomorrow mrs greeley will be that pleased to see you she was asking only yesterday if there was word of jake hes with my sister rutledge told him in good hands satterthwaite nodded rutledge went back to sunrise cottage in the late afternoon he couldnt have said why he was drawn there satterthwaite offered to go with him but rutledge thanked him and shook his head the day was fair with a stiff breeze that cooled the air and made it feel more like early spring than june fat lambs followed slowgrazing ewes in the pastures along the road as he drove he asked himself again as he had on the journey to lancashire what had become of the canes head it was the last piece of crucial evidence and he wanted very badly to find it if it had been taken away and dropped from a bridge as satterthwaite had suggested it would never come to light which meant that the rest of the evidence against peter teller had to be damning hell have a verra good defense hamish agreed the house was just ahead first the roof and then the hedge coming into sight on its knoll he left the motorcar on the road and walked through the gate intending to dig around in the flower beds with his fingers to see if the canes knob was there it was hopeless he knew that very well but he had to try but someone had watered the plants and pulled out any weeds that would mar their appearance he bent down to touch a leaf it was still wet instead of opening the door he went out the gate again and walked around the house to the gardens by the kitchen door the man squatting beside one of the beds leapt to his feet with surprise as rutledge suddenly appeared braced for anything that might come at him it was lawrence cobb his trousers stained from working the earth and pulling weeds a pile of wilting debris lay on the grassy path next to his boots ohits only you then cobb said in relief ive come here to keep the gardens for her until someone knows whats to happen to this place its the least i can do her flowers shouldnt die too rutledge could read the unspoken words in his eyesand it brings her closer as if she were still alive and somewhere inside i see nothing wrong with it rutledge answered him a pity you werent out here working on the day she was attacked dont you think i dream about it at night if your wife hears of it it will be on your head cobb said if i had been here she might still be alive but thats hindsight i hear you found that walker was he the man as it turned out he was a witness and a very helpful one he saw the motorcar by the hedge and the man who was driving it cobb dusted his hands nodding i knew it someone from his family most likely with an eye to the property someone from his family yes but i dont think this property entered into it i think hed come to see her and decide what to do about her what i dont know is whether or not she invited him in it must have been a shock to her to see him there she wouldnt have known what to say cobb stared up at the bedroom windows as if he could see the answer written there on the glass she stopped looking for himwaiting listening for the doorover a year ago she told me he must be dead but you could tell she hadnt really started to believe even then i think she expected some miracle and then when it never happened she lost hope the logic in her head told her one thing her heart something else was he good to her cobb brought his gaze back to rutledge it depends on how you define good of course she never wanted for anythingfood on the table wood for the fire in the winter clothes to keep her warm he never struck her or called her names this was the place she wanted to live in and bring up her son just as shed grown up here with her aunt and he made no objection of course if hed asked her to go wherever his regiment was sent she would have just to be with him no matter what the hardships were but the truth is he wasnt here as often as he should have been theres the army i understand that of course i do but id have moved heaven and earth to come home if shed been mine id left the army and found other work to do digging ditches if i had to anything to be near her you knew her well rutledge said quietly i loved her and so i listened to her and read between the lines sometimes but she saw me as her friend and i was scrupulous about keeping it that way id have lost her otherwise i think you would have rutledge said he rubbed his forehead with his gloved hand and left behind a long streak of rich earth i was here when timmy died not in the house i meant in hobson i thought shed lose her mind she stopped coming into town stopped eating stopped looking out for herself but some of us saw to it that she had whatever she needed mrs greeley satterthwaite others people would bring her food for fear she wasnt cooking i chopped wood that winter and piled it outside the kitchen door there within reach even on the worst days and kept it covered with a tarp when she didnt milk the cow because it reminded her too much of feeding the boy those last days i took it down to mrs greeley to keep until she was ready to have it back ive never seen so much grief as she felt i saw the photograph of her son in her room that was the only photograph she had and i took that for her she said that teller never cared for pictures set about but she was glad of it youd have thought teller would have understood something like that there was never a photograph of her husband not even a wedding picture there was a small one of the wedding couple she kept it safe somewhere out of sight and out of mind with his letters very likely rutledge thought and gone with them cobb took off his gloves and swatted at an insect busy about his ears i want to know have you found her killer dont lie to me i want to know i cant sleep nights sometimes thinking about everyone who knew her anyone who could have done such a thing and i need to know i come into hobson sometimes and look at the faces of people i meet on the street or in a shop or sitting next to me on a sunday and i think could that be him or that one my uncle tells me ill drive myself mad doing that but its the only way ill have any peace finding him before the police do i cant tell you how the inquiry is progressing i will say that its possible that we know who it was and the bird hes been no help my motherinlaw told me youd taken jake i was glad i thought she might do it a mischief with its squawking so loud she couldnt sleep and betsy wanted no part of it the bird hasnt said much so far he hesitated then said if you found something unusualout of placetell satterthwaite will you he left cobb there and went into the house walking through the empty rooms listening to the sounds of his own footsteps in the silence hamish in the back of his mind was busy but he could find nothing to trigger a sudden thought or offer a glimmer of light nothing had changed he hadnt expected it to and that was the problem nothing had changed he could see only what he had before with the eyes of the past not the present he considered what to do about cobb coming to tend the flowers and decided he was doing no harm and it gave him something to think about besides taking the head off whoever had killed florence teller without speaking to cobb again he left the house and drove back to hobson rutledge and satterthwaite ate their dinner together at a pub in thielwald the food was heavy suitable for men who did physical labor filling and satisfying as satterthwaite promised the pudding was excellent and as they were finishing it he said to rutledge youre quiet i was thinking about a birthday celebration tonight in essex did you want to be there i wasnt invited i just have a feeling that i shouldnt have stayed over i should have gone directly back to london one day wont matter chapter rutledge was putting his valise and a packet of sandwiches prepared by mrs greeley into his motorcar when lawrence cobb came down the high street and nodded as he walked up to mrs greeleys door it was then that rutledge saw the left side of his face there was an angry welt along his cheekbone it was oozing a thin line of fluid and blood shutting the drivers door rutledge said swiftly whats happened nothing im leaving betsy i told her as much last night that this marriage is a pretense and were both better off out of it i came to see if mrs greeley will give me a room for a few days just until i can make arrangements why not stay with your uncle hes old i dont want him caught up in my troubles rutledge said work it out florence teller is dead look im tired working in florencesmrs tellers garden yesterday i could see my way for the first time im still mourning her i will be for a very long while its not fair to betsy its not fair to me pretending i have deep feelings for her weve no children thats a blessing and so ive told her i also told her that she could have the farm i wont send her back to her mother they dont get on he smiled grimly i should have waited until shed set down the hot bread tray the corner of it clipped me shes gone home to her mother but shell be back she likes the house it will matter more than i do before very long hed thought it all out just as he said but rutledge persisted youre doing to betsy what teller did to his wife no i married a betsy who didnt exist the true woman is nothing like the one i courted shes not sweet and loving and caring shes like her mother meanspirited discontented selfish the day after i married her i knew it was a mistake this has nothing to do with florence i was expecting to be happy i really believed we could be happy he shook his head you cant make love happen when there are lies to start with hamish said it willna do any guid hes made up his mind rutledge silently acknowledged that im just leaving mrs greeley will be glad to offer you my room im sure cobb looked sharply at rutledge you arent coming back what about her killer im going to take the killer into custody i wont be needing the room again cobb thanked him and was about to turn away then he said what becomes of jake when youve made your arrest im offering to take him i can now he sometimes speaks with her voice it would be a comfort even when that voice says good night to her husband that doesnt matter to me its her voice close enough ill hear it again ill see what can be done rutledge promised thinking that frances would be delighted to hear that jake had a permanent home and with that lawrence cobb opened the door to mrs greeleys house as rutledge turned the bonnet of his motorcar toward the south chapter on his way into london rutledge made a detour to chelsea but the channing house was quiet the drapes still pulled across the windows as they had been for days the long golden rays of the setting sun touched them with brightness but it was only a shallow reflection not the lamplight he had hoped to see he couldnt bring himself to walk up to the door she was in good hands wherever she was he could only wish her a speedy recovery and time would see to that he could still remember the shock of recognition as she lay there injured in the broken and twisted wreckage of her carriage hed been too busy then to deal with the image that was burned into his memory seeing her whole again would change that aye hamish said but she isna coming back to london straightaway she was already leaving it ye ken analyzing his own feelings he realized that the uppermost emotion that day had been fear fear that she was terribly injured not pity or compassion or anger at the waste of a life he had been in love once and it hadnt worked out just as lawrence cobb had said hed seen the look on jeans face when she finally visited him in hospital and realized what hed become he had done the only thing he could do in that single appalling moment hed released her from her promise to marry him so that he wouldnt have to face her rejection the relief on her face as he spoke the words had stayed with him long after her first horrified view of him sitting there a broken man had begun to fade once was enough he said as much to hamish his voice sounding overly loud in the cacophony of traffic as he turned toward the yard gibson greeted him with the news that billy had killed again theres been another murder of the same ilk and this time billy has cut his throat the victim was on the bridge walking minding his own business and he was robbed how can you be sure its our friend billy the past week weve had constables in street clothes walking over the bridge and along the river late at night and weve been watching them with field glasses but nothing happened he paused none of them looked like you from a distance they were a different shape different height and nothing happened to them and then this poor sod was attacked billy was elsewhere or recognized them for policemen gibson said we dont think so his victims are usually near the bridge and out late at night they could have passed for you walking off a mood you do that you know rutledge hadnt realized that he was so predictable all right go on you nearly caught him hes afraid of you and he wants you dead for luck it wasnt unheard of he wont come back tonight not with the police everywhere looking for evidence no sir i suggest you get a good nights sleep tomorrow night youll be on that bridge and well be watching you whose idea was this rutledge asked curious inspector mickelson sir gibson replied his voice neutral but we have to catch him sir theres no other way yes i understand all right but only tomorrow night gibson i must drive to essex on monday morning unless captain teller returns to london sooner i hope youll be taking someone into custody soon old bowels is getting impatient bowles isnt going to like it when we do peter teller walter tellers elder brother seems to be our man my dear lord gibson whistled softly i hope your evidence is rock solid or none of us will have any peace rutledge left intending to visit his sister if jake hadnt said anything of importanceand he was not anticipating hearing that he hadthen he would carry the bird back to lancashire and give it to lawrence cobb he caught frances just returning from dinner with friends and hailed her as she was going inside she turned and smiled at him ian come in ive had a lovely evening what brings you here dont tell me its jake ill be jealous he laughed i expected to find the lights on jake on the loose and myself in bad odor for bringing him to you hes been a dear ive tried to write down everything he says but its mostly wishing her husband peter a good night or something ordinary he says my dearest wife in her voice but i know its a letter he must have heard a hundred times and shall we have tea my dear he always answers that with what will jake have hardly useful in a courtroom im afraid i didnt expect an enlightening conversation with a murderer he said as frances turned on the light in the small breakfast room and then lifted the covering from jakes cage he was asleep head tucked beneath his wing but he looked at them blinking the second lid on his eye and said shall we have tea my dear its not teatime jake in the morning he began to swing and frances said i can see that he must have been wonderful company for a woman alone but my maid is terrified of him and wont come near him he squawks at her as if shes an interloper its either jake or nell and i must choose nell theres someone who wants him if it works out it will be the right choice for him you look tired much on my mind im sure well go home ian and let me go to bed he wished her a good night and left sunday morning was misty and gray as rutledge returned to the yard early there was a report to write and then preparations to be made for the nights promenade along the river he had debated asking for a weapon to even the odds and then thought better of it sitting in his office staring out the window and listening to big ben chime the hour mickelsons plan seemed workable but billy was becoming an accomplished killer now and in the dark many things could happen what had driven the boy to this point in his life not that it mattered he had crossed the boundary he was going to hang when caught rutledge was just turning around to begin his report when sergeant gibson burst into the small office with only a cursory knock i think youd better know sir weve just had a telephone call from essex sir theres been a death at witch hazel farm the teller house what happened rutledge asked getting to his feet when someone fell down the stairs just before breakfast chief superintendent bowles isnt in nor is inspector mickelson i think if you hurry you can be on your way before they arrive its still your inquiry after all rutledge reached for his hat it will take no more than fifteen minutes to pack a valise he was down the passage and in the stairwell when he remembered the rendezvous with billy mickelson could deal with it sunday morning traffic was light and he made good time going directly to the house at witch hazel farm the drive was crowded with vehicles and he could see that the police from waddington were there already taking over from the constable in repton dr fielding the tellers essex physician was standing by the door in the watery sunlight an unlit pipe in his hands he saw rutledge pull up and hailed him inspector good youve come ive had no briefing he told fielding there wasnt time its captain teller he tripped coming down the stairs this morning gentle god rutledge said blankly and then what can you tell me it was a family weekend mrs jenny tellers birthday there was a party on friday and my wife and i were invited rather a nice party actually i did notice that captain teller was drinking a little more than usual but he carried it well there was no disturbance my wife and i left just before eleven and thats all i can tell you until the summons came this morning amy teller called to say there had been an accident and to hurry but by the time i got here captain teller was dead amy teller was the first to reach him she said he was alive then he spoke her name she distinctly heard him say mee as she bent over him considering his injuries was that possible i should think so ive examined him as best i can on the floor at the foot of the stairs ill know more when ive got him in the surgery if you want my best opinion at this time id say his bad leg gave way pitching him down the stairs according to his brother edwin peter has been avoiding using his cane of late he may just have paid for his stubbornness with his life rutledge thanked him and walked into the house captain teller lay where hed fallen his body sprawled at the foot of the stairs his bad leg still on the first step behind him just coming down the passage was a man of slender build with a pockmarked face good morning who let you in there should have been a constable on the door my name is rutledge scotland yard i believe someone sent for me since i was just involved in walter tellers disappearance inspector jessup waddington they shook hands disappearance when was this i wasnt told about it you wouldnt have been it happened in london and teller returned unharmed after giving his wife a hellish four days of worry indeed well this onecaptain peter tellerfell down the stairs as you can see hes quite lame im told and wasnt using his cane as he should have done straightforward accidental death a waste of the yards time rutledge said nothing kneeling by the dead man close enough now to smell the stale whisky on his skin and in his hair he was drinking last night i should think it wouldnt have helped him manage the stairs he commented straightening up what does the family have to say theyre in the breakfast room i havent interviewed them mrs susannah teller the victims wife insisted that we touch nothing until youd arrived rutledge could tell that jessup wasnt especially happy to be secondguessed by the yard not in what he clearly believed was an accidental death on his patch and rutledge would have agreed with him if it werent for the other case in lancashire a fall down the stairs was easier to face than the hangman and teller had been drinking enough of late to indicate something was troubling him id like to speak to mrs susannah teller in the study do you think that could be arranged id like to know why she sent for me inspector jessup said id like to be present not immediately if you dont mind rutledge said keeping to the formalities of refusal she may speak more freely to me he stood there looking down at tellers body thinking that constable satterthwaite would be disappointed and lawrence cobb jubilant then he nodded to jessup the body could be taken away jessup went outside to find his men and rutledge waited until the door had closed behind him then he squatted by the body and lifted the legs of tellers trousers but there was no mark that he could see to indicate that teller had been tripped and so accidentor suicide just as rutledge was stepping back fielding came in preparatory to the removal he said looking at teller as rutledge had done a tragedy this the leg he fought so hard to save betrayed him in the end he might have been better off if hed allowed them to take it rutledge said in a way youre right but i think knowing captain teller as i did id venture to say hed have wanted it that way even so as a blanket was spread over the body before lifting it onto the stretcher fielding said unless i find evidence to the contrary gentlemen ill consider this an accidental death jessup said id agree with that finding and then peter teller was carried out into the gray morning leaving only a small spot of blood to mark his passage rutledge thinking about monday mornings expected arrest was of two minds when he closed this case there would be very little justice for florence teller now in some fashion it might be for the best it would save the teller family endless publicity and sorrow chief superintendent bowles would be pleased about that when the house door closed behind the dead man rutledge walked down the passage and into the study where once hed spoken to walter teller about his brother five minutes later the study door opened and susannah teller was ushered in her face pale with shock and grief her eyes red from crying she had tried very hard to protect her husband even knowing what he had done she looked rutledge straight in the face and said as the door swung shut behind her youre to treat this as a murder investigation do you hear me they killed him with their unspoken accusations their fingerpointing when jenny wasnt in the room their snubs he told them he hadnt killed florence teller he tried to explain but the evidence was against him and he drank himself into oblivion friday night and last night i told him we shouldnt have come but he said he must do it for jennys sake its always for jennys sake isnt it the innocent victim jenny teller well im having them pay for my losing peter do you understand me she ended fiercely mrs teller no dont tell me it was just a horrible accident because hed been drinking and couldnt find his cane and dont try to tell me he killed himself out of a guilty conscience he didnt murder that woman in lancashire if you want to know the truth it was either walter or edwin take your pick because when peter was there when peter just wanted to speak to her he could hear walter in the house somewhere out of sight or edwin i dont know i dont care they both sound very much alike have you noticed one of them was there and after peter left whichever one it was seized the opportunity to kill her and let peter take the blame she turned on her heel and walked out of the room slamming the door behind her but she didnt go up the stairs he heard the front door slam as well and when he went to look out the window she was running across the lawn to the rose garden as if trying to flee her own thoughts susannah teller had tried to throw him off the scent once before hamish said she loved him verra much yes he took a deep breath and went out to find the rest of the family they were a grim and silent lot when rutledge walked into the dining room walter teller was standing at the window his back to his family leticia was also standing staring down at the cold hearth amy and edwin sat together at one end of the table and at the other mary brittingham was trying to calm her weeping sister mary said has he been taken away yes just now then if you will allow it ill take my sister to her room and sit with her its been frightful for her i must begin by asking each of you where you were when captain teller fell miss teller i was just coming down the passage id been in the kitchen helping mollie i generally do when all of us are here its a great deal of work and finding suitable help from the village isnt always possible on a sunday morning thank you miss brittingham i was upstairs id overslept and was late coming down for breakfast could you see captain teller fall i was still in my room two minuteslesslater and id have been in the passage he turned to jenny i was outside id taken my tea outside this morning ii wanted to walk a little it was misting here raining a soft mist i dont mind that it was cooler after a string of warm days she broke down again rutledge turned to amy teller i was in the study looking for a book id finished the one id been reading last night i was the first to reach peter they may have told you he was still alive and he said my name and then he died it was awful i think i screamed for susannah where was she i believe shed already come down and was in the dining room she appeared from that direction anyway her husband looked up at rutledge his face grim his eyes red i was in my room like mary a few seconds more and id have been with him i might have saved him from falling i cant seem to get that out of my mind rutledge waited for walter teller to give his whereabouts he didnt turn finally he said his voice muffled i was in the drawing room i wanted to be by myself and so no one had been on the scene or at least no one admitted to it he nodded to mary brittingham and she rose saying to jenny come on love youll be better off lying down jenny shook her head i wont go up those stairs i dont think i ever shall again then well use the back stairs mary told her jenny said rising from her chair im to blame i told walter i wanted to have a party as i did last year with everyone here if i hadnt peter would still be in london this morning and not dead dont be silly her husband said roughly from the window accidents happen he could have fallen down his own stairs for that matter he was drunk enough last night she looked at him hurt clear in her face and then without answering him she turned and walked from the dining room mary followed her the covered dishes of the family breakfast were still on the sideboard rutledge could smell the bacon and see a dish of boiled eggs used plates had been set on the small table to one side by his account four of the family had already eaten their breakfast it fit with their statements when jenny was well out of hearing rutledge said your sisterinlaw has just told me that peter teller was shunned all weekend miss teller did either you or mary say anything to the family about the evidence against captain teller i told edwin you had already spoken to walter i imagine amy learned of it from edwin it was jennys birthday and we had agreed not to upset her shed been through enough and it would make for a very unpleasant party as it was we were all struggling to put up a good front in the end even jenny felt the tension and wanted to know what was wrong we all lied through our teeth it might have been better if wed told her the truth and been done with it peter was moody he could read between the lines walter hardly spoke to him edwin was not himself either he hadnt been since he came back from that womans funeral florence teller she had a name edwin said sharply use it leticia closed her mouth firmly and stared at him edwin said oh to hell with it inspector rutledge when can we leave it will be better for everyone if we just go home and stop pretending i dont know well need statements from all of you telling me where you were and what if anything was said what your reading was of captain tellers state of mind amy said you arent suggesting it was suicide she broke off dont be ridiculous walter said from the window i dont think peter had that much sense rutledge cut across amy tellers retort it might interest you to know that the captains wifewidowhas just told me that she feels he was murdered there was a sharply indrawn breath from the people looking up at him a collective reaction to his suggestion shes upset walter said edwin added i dont think she knows what shes talking about leticia said yes she does she doesnt see this as a blessing in disguise that peterand the rest of uswill be spared the nightmare of a trial it doesnt matter how it endsin full acquittal or a conviction the damage will have been done amy said thats an awful thing to say no one is rejoicing leticia crossed the room and poured herself another cup of tea its time we all faced some very unpleasant facts and one of them is that jenny will have to face them as well we cant go on lying to her its not fair to peter or his wife oh do shut up leticia walter teller told her ill deal with jenny in my own way if we could have thrashed this business out amongst ourselves on friday none of this might have happened leticia retorted and what about harry what is harry to be told there was a strained silence harry walter began oh my god weve forgotten harry hes all right amy said hes gone to the church services at repton he asked if he could i told him yes i thought it would be a good idea and so he wasnt here whenwhen it happened surely not alone walter demanded you must have taken leave of your senses he went with the rector and his family amy said curtly i went over and asked politely they were delighted to have him theres some sort of blessing of the animals today he likes that and hes staying for lunch id forgot walter said jenny was to take him when peter fell everything else went out of my mind theres gran to be thought of what are we to tell her why wasnt she invited to the birthday celebration rutledge asked its distressing for her to travel its confusing edwin said but she had traveled to visit her dead sisters grandchildren rutledge waited until they had finished dealing with the unforeseen problems brought on by a death and when there was a lull in the conversation he said now that thats settled to your satisfaction theres something i should like very much to know they turned to face him wary their eyes waiting for the blow to fall rutledge said into the tense silence what did susannah teller mean when she told me that it wasnt peter who had killed florence teller that one of you was in the house when peter came there and used the opportunity hed given you to kill her chapter it was as if collectively they had lost their tongues she was upset leticia said finally and imagining things all the blame for whatever happened to that woman in lancashire had fallen on peters head she was trying to clear his name to give him dignity in his death i think she believes that he must have fallen deliberately because everyone had seemed to turn against him people do lash out in grief she ended ive seen it myself and so must you have mr rutledge he had but hed heard the pain and anger in susannahs voice and hed almost believed her he turned to walter and said what was the real reason for not calling off the party ive told you we didnt for jennys sake she was looking forward to it it meant more to her than we realized a family healing if you will after my disastrous disappearance i think rutledge said you went ahead with the party to gauge just how much of my evidence was true to shame your brother into telling you what happened in hobson that day he hadnt had he hed been tormented by his own knowledgeeven i could see that hed begun to drink heavily and once id outlined my own evidence you knew he was very likely to be taken into custody very soon and you wanted to make him tell you before the police came so that you could band together to protect him only he didnt quite see it that way i think he felt youd abandoned him in which case he might well have chosen to fall down the stairs his only way to punish you for what youd done to him they stared at him nothing in their gazes telling him whether his guesses were right or not i cant force any of you to confess but id give a great deal to know why peter teller suddenly felt compelled to rectify the situation in hobson in regard to florence teller after all these years i want to know for her sake where all of this began amy teller said you cant expect us to answer that when we were left not knowing the truth ourselves was it suicide edwin teller asked do you believe he killed himself theres not sufficient evidence either way rutledge said it will depend on what the police and the inquest have to say about his state of mind there will be an inquest make no mistake about that dear god edwin said under his breath will it have to come out that my brother was suspected of murder all the essential facts will have to be presented it was a fall leticia said i know my brother he would no more kill himself than walter here would have done its not in the nature of our family to run away from anything oh do shut up leticia edwin said this is not the time to be pompous of course peter didnt kill himself walter no then there you are inspector the family who knew peter teller better than anyone else have given you their considered opinion there was nothing on his conscience your socalled evidence was entirely circumstantial your witness can hardly identify a dead man there is no case there never was theres still a dead woman in lancashire what about her i have no idea i leave such matters to the police there was a knock at the door come rutledge said expecting to see inspector jessup walk into the room but it was mollie she said beg pardon sir scotland yard is on the telephone they want to speak with you its urgent they said thank you tell the yard ill be there directly rutledge told her he looked around the room seeing relief in the eyes of his captive audience you will all remain here at the farm until further notice while your brothers death is being investigated when inspector jessup is willing to release the body you may proceed with burial arrangements ill arrange for the inquest as soon as possible you wont find it pleasant enduring one anothers company for a few more days but there it is theres gran edwin said we need to go to london and what about harry walter said what are we to tell him the truth leticia said that his uncle met with a terrible accident and we must all grieve for him rutledge said im sorry i must go theres another case in london that is demanding my attention he turned and walked out of the room mollie was waiting in the passage and took him to the room where the telephone had been put in rutledge had expected to hear sergeant gibsons voice on the telephone he had expected a summons to london to carry out inspector mickelsons plan once the chief superintendent was set upon a course of action there was really no good way to deflect him he thanked mollie picked up the receiver and waited until she was out of earshot then he said rutledge and waited for gibson to speak the voice traveling down the line was gibsons he said without preamble its lancashire sir youre to go there at once if you need someone in essex to deal with the situation there the chief superintendent will send someone else from the yard its stable at the moment rutledge answered unwilling to turn the inquiry into peter tellers death over to anyone else at this stage there were secrets here that he would have to get to the bottom of before the final verdict on peter tellers fall was handed down and he wasnt prepared for anyone else to muddy the waters thats good news sir youll be leaving from there as soon as i speak to inspector jessup the local man to be sure gibson agreed a very wise decision if i may say so sir rutledge swiftly translated that to mean that avoiding london at the moment was a good thing and mr rutledge sir gibson was saying his voice lowered and barely audible yes what is it gibson inspector mickelson has just informed the chief superintendent that he feels the trap cannot be sprung by anyone else just a friendly warning sir chapter sunday evening had been nearly insupportable leticia complaining of a headache had excused herself early and gone up to bed but not to sleep she lay awake her windows open the cries of an owl in the distance loud in her ears she had always disliked owls their haunting calls spoke to her of grief and sadness and something to be feared as a child shed run to her nannys bed and flung herself under the covers to shut out the sound her mother had always maintained that leticia must have overheard one of the servants claiming that owls were omens of ill fortune leticia herself didnt know if it was true or not she just knew she had always felt that way and of course with peter only newly dead the cries of the owl were particularly appropriate she got up once to close the windows but the room still held the heavy closeness of the day and she could hardly breathe in the resulting stuffiness she couldnt stop herself from thinking about her brothers they had always been a close family edwins illness had brought them all together in a pact to keep him safe when their parents died it had fallen to her lot to watch over edwin while peter went off to the army and walter had gone into the mission field now peter was accused of coldblooded murder walter had been different ever since his mysterious disappearance never satisfactorily explaining it to anyone except perhaps to jenny and edwin was withdrawing even from her she turned to one side trying to shut out the sounds from the wood in the distance it was odd that now there was still a conspiracy to protect jenny the mother of the heir the youngest of them they hadnt told her about florence teller it had seemed the right thing to do but it would all come out at the inquest anyway someone would have to tell her before the questions of the police aroused her suspicions before she found herself hearing in public what peter had been accused of and why and there was susannah as well something would have to be done about her her distress and anger were understandablenatural but she couldnt be allowed to upset everyone by involving the yard and trying to clear peters name shed stood by him even when leticia had told her what the man from london had said about the evidence all the same leticia had had the sneaking suspicion that susannah was already worried about peter something in her eyes she sighed and turned over again and finally got up to walk to the window defying the owls she was the eldest it was up to her to straighten out this tangle damn edwin for going to the funeral damn peter for losing his head damn susannah for not keeping her mouth shut so that all this could be smoothed away and damn jenny for being naive and for walking into rooms at just the wrong moment never mind that it was her house every time the rest of them had tried to confront peter he was either drunk or he was protected unwittingly by jennys presence she had another thought if it hadnt been for jenny peter might not have died they could have cleared the air got through to whatever it was that was tormenting him and come up with a solution her hands over her face she pressed cold fingers against her closed eyelids what could she do what should she do what would her father who was never at a loss about anything have done about an accusation of murder against one of his sons she could almost hear her fathers answer protect harry keep the family intact preserve the teller name at any price she took a deep breath pulling in the cooler night air until her lungs hurt it was too bad susannah hadnt fallen down the stairs instead of peter it would have made her task easier but there it was and if jennys innocence had to be sacrificed so be it walter would just have to live with her decision after a while she went back to bed the owls had stopped but she still couldnt sleep chapter rutledge drove to lancashire without stopping save for petrol the misting rain kept him company the windscreen wipers almost hypnotic in their sweep clearing his vision and then blurring the landscape what was the truth about peter tellers death he asked himself coming out of st albans accident suicide murder in spite of susannah tellers angry claims he could see no conceivable motive for murdering the man to keep the familys name from being dragged through a courtroom drama that would have london agog a very poor reason for murdering ones own flesh and blood suicide then to spare his family the onus of a convicted murderer turned over to the hangman or just a simple horrible unbelievable accident because the mans leg was weak and his cane lay in the boot of rutledges car why did he no buy anither one hamish asked rutledge answered it would have drawn attention to the missing one if it had a special head that would have to be ordered time wasnt on his side there was no immediate solution to the problem of captain tellers death he decided finally it could wait until he returned from hobson he had a fairly decent idea of why satterthwaite had summoned him in such haste a simpler solution that the head of the cane had been in the gardens after all he hadnt looked long enough or cobb had stumbled on it satterthwaite was waiting in the station for him late as it was he could just see the glow of lamplight through the window he walked in pulling off his driving gloves the single lamp on the constables desk guided rutledge through the outer office and down the dark passage a thermos of tea stood on the desk in front of satterthwaite and in the lamps flickering glow he appeared to be bone tired as if he hadnt slept the deep hollows and bony ridges of his face stark as he looked up to greet rutledge his own fatigue forgotten rutledge studied the man he was under great strain im sorry sir for the abrupt summons satterthwaite began but i didnt know what else to do given the circumstances what circumstances i thought it best you didnt take peter teller into custody tomorrow and i wasnt ready to tell the world and his uncle what i believed you ought to hear first he gestured to the thermos theres a clean cup just behind you on that shelf its likely to be a long night rutledge found the cup and filled it with the steaming liquid he drank half of it to clear the rest of the cobwebs out of his head and then set it aside all right wheres the canes head satterthwaite smiled you do take all the wind out of a mans sails he said grimly but he reached into his drawer and pulled out a round object wrapped in a clean handkerchief he passed it to rutledge with distaste handkerchief and all as if he couldnt bear to touch it rutledge glanced at him then looked down unwrapping the linen to reveal a gold knob that caught the light and flashed dully in his hand it was indeed the head of a cane broken off the malaccan stick with one finger he rolled the knob toward the light and sat there for a moment absorbing what it represented satterthwaite said nothing watching him damning was the best word for it small wonder walter teller had lied telling rutledge the cane was of ivory embedded in the heavy gold head was an enameled button or plaque a black scum obscured part of the design but even so rutledge knew what it was he glanced at satterthwaite captain peter tellers regimental badge he said it leaves us in no doubt very likely a gift from his father or his wife such things often are we can find the makerthere should be a record of such an expensive item the knob winked as he turned it again in the light and theres still a little blood pooled at the edge of the enamel yes satterthwaite stirred i didnt like to look at it put it away he took a deep breath then said its what you wanted i wouldnt have given any odds that it would ever turn up rutledge rewrapped it and set it aside then finished his tea i should be heading back to london theres a small problem peter teller fell down the stairs early this morning at his brothers house and died on the spot well never know now why he came north or why he killed her accident or suicide satterthwaite asked watching rutledges face closely hard to say yes well in that case perhaps you ought to hear where this came from rutledge realized that with his mind already on peter teller and the problems he faced resolving the issues of the mans guilt and the cause of his death hed accepted this last bit of evidence without the enthusiasm it deserved good police work on satterthwaites part even though the canes head was almost moot now still there must be an inquest into florence tellers death and her killer must be identified she deserved that he dragged his thoughts back to the present well done finding this he couldnt put his finger on what was bothering satterthwaitethe blood on the canes knob or something else he thrust the handkerchief holding the knob into his pocket out of sight as he did his gaze locked with the constables he didnt need hamishs soft warning fully alert now he waited satterthwaite spun the cap back onto the neck of the thermos and set it aside first to give you a little news i dont think you were here when it happened all right after an altercation with a cooking pan lawrence cobb walked out on his wife betsy and took your old room at mrs greeleys for the time being yes i met him coming into town just as i was leaving that day i tried to persuade him to rethink his decision to see if the marriage could be saved i dont think florence teller would have liked being the root cause of the breakup although having seen betsy cobb i could understand the battle ahead she appears to be as domineering as her mother worse from all reports she likes her way well lawrence cobb would have done better to listen to you rutledge saw that the conversation wasnt taking the direction hed expected what happened betsy cobb came in to see me very early this morning she couldnt sleep after their quarrel on friday she said so she began clearing out her husbands belongings putting them in a pile in the passagetools clothes watch everything she could lay hand to that hed not had time to snatch up in his haste to go this morning before first light she even went out into the barn where hed been working and she tossed the contents of the tool chest into a wooden crate she said the chest had belonged to her father rutledge knew now where this was heading he waited for satterthwaites strained voice to finish the account to make a long story short as she was sorting through to make sure he got only his things she shifted a pair of working gloves and this knob fell to the barn floor she didnt know what it was at first and then she realized it was gold and that lawrence had purposely hidden it where she wouldnt find it so to make trouble for him she brought it in to me she was still furious with him you could see it in her face what did you do i told her id look into it and after she left for the farm i went to mrs greeleys rousted lawrence cobb out of his bed and confronted him he swore he knew nothing about the knob but you could read in his eyes that he knew how it had been used hes not slow is cobb i told him to dress and come with me to the station he argued but i wouldnt take no for an answer some of betsys anger had rubbed off on me i was looking for an opening so to speak he started to get up as if he needed to walk then he sank back into his chair defeated by this time betsy cobb had gone straight to her mother youll recall mrs blaine had found florence lying there in the doorway she came into the station looking like the wrath of god telling me i must take cobb into custody to protect her daughter that hed do her a harm for telling the truth and she swore hed been working there at florence tellers house that day i thought cobb was going to strike her he called her a liar and there was a shouting match you wouldnt believe mrs blaine reached for the paperweight and i had to push cobb back to the only cell and slam the door rutledge could picture the scene i came back to speak to the two women while cobb was shouting something at them and at me mrs blaine claimed hed read too much in mrs teller letting him help her about the gardens he must have said something to her and mrs teller told him he was a married man and she wanted nothing to do with him satterthwaite paused so he killed her he examined the thermos as if it had just appeared on his desk and hed never seen it before avoiding rutledges eyes id have liked five minutes alone with him it would have been worth it then he looked up i could never understand peter teller walking away from her at the wars end thats if he wasnt dead she was sure he was we all believed it so it made sense that hed come back finally to make his peace and tell her his reasons his lame leg for one and she sent him away with a flea in his ear because she had a pride of her own did florence teller he set the thermos aside and moved a little in his chair she must have told cobb when he came to do a little work what had happened between herself and teller and he killed her then because he knew that whatever she was saying now in the heat of anger and hurt in the end florence would go back to her husband looking away at the square of window seeing the darkness no longer pitchblack he went on i didnt want her killer to be one of us i wanted it to be teller but it wasnt thats a very good reconstruction rutledge said after a moment it makes a strong case for lawrence cobb as the murderer but it doesnt explain the cane that must have been what cobb saw as he came up the walk how he knew teller had been there where teller had dropped it when she cast him off and she must have left it there in the event teller came back for it she wouldnt have to see him again and what does cobb have to say to this does he still deny he killed her or has he admitted what hed done by the time his wife and her mother had left he was in a state he demanded i send for you but i told him it was no use the evidence was there and we had to go forward the truth was i couldnt bear the sight of him i wanted him out of hobson where i couldnt lay hands to him i think he must have seen that in my face because when i told him he was going to thielwald he came quietly and gave me no trouble a silence fell rutledge was trying to test the information that satterthwaite had given him had all the evidence pointing to peter teller been circumstantial the man was on the scene hed been spotted by an independent witness his cane had been used as the murder weapon but there was an equally strong case now against lawrence cobb furthermore it fit the factsthat teller had indeed come to hobson and spoken to florence teller his cane had been missing since then and hed left in a hurry according to the witness benjamin larkin it also explained why lawrence cobb had possession of the canes knob he knew the decision that chief superintendent bowles would come to charge cobb and leave the tellers out of ittheyd suffered enough and peter teller was now out of reach of the law guilty or not if a jury found cobb guilty then he was but florence teller deserved to have her killer punished and not a surrogate rutledge took a deep breath somehow hed been very sure of cobbs innocence as if the constable had heard his thoughts he said remember larkin heard no shouting no one crying out when the teller motorcar was there because by the time larkin came down the hill she was already dead i never could understand why teller broke up that cane satterthwaite went on if hed taken it with him wed been none the wiser two minutes under a pump or dangled in a stream and it would have been clean but i can see cobb killing her and then destroying the cane afterward the cane was tellers and hed have liked to break it over the man himself but he couldnt so he took his frustration and anger out on tellers possession and cobb is strong enough he could have snapped off that knob and that was the irrefutable fact as hamish was pointing out even if teller had hated himself for what hed done even if hed broken his own cane out of selfloathing hed surely have had the sense to take the head of the cane with him even the drunken peter teller was far from stupid ye said yoursel its damning hamish told him he should have been satisfied but he wasnt why did cobb leave the rest of the cane for us to find to protect himself if suspicion fell on him satterthwaite stood up collecting his own cup intending to wash up ive had hours to think waiting for you to come back hours fighting a rearguard action rutledge said and the box of letters satterthwaite replied cobb said he never touched them he had no reason to do it and he couldnt have taken them home with him teller must have put them in the boot well have to ask larkin if he could see the boot of the motorcar from where he was no said rutledge if shed been alive she would never have allowed that not her letters shed have fought him every step of the way even if she was disillusioned satterthwaite scowled then it was cobb bound to have been to hurt her more or maybe he wanted to read them who knows you said cobb was in thielwald i told you i didnt want him here hes safer there and so am i i want to see him i know how much time youve given to this inquiry i know how well youd put together the case against teller i know how id said all along that no one here in hobson would touch her we were both wrong rutledge kept his cup reached for the thermos uncapped it and poured himself more tea then he said all right i still must speak to cobb i want to judge him for myself lets go now at this hour of the night satterthwaite demanded as rutledge drained his cup and handed back it to him i have to be back in london as quickly as i can theres tellers death they drove to thielwald in an uncomfortable silence satterthwaite had said what he knew he must say and rutledge could think of no way to prove him wrong hamish a third in the motorcar his voice at rutledges ear was trying to make himself heard but rutledge shut him out concentrating on the dark winding road ahead rutledge tried to find holes in satterthwaites arguments weighing teller against cobb hed liked cobb hed believed the man when he said that he couldnt have killed florence teller but then teller himself had denied touching his wife and that had rung true as well the sky was just brightening as the rain clouds scudded away already thinning enough to offer the promise of sun to take their place satterthwaite broke the silence a fair day and then his voice trailed off as rutledge brought the motorcar to a halt in front of thielwalds police station i was thinking he went on as they got out if cobb hadnt walked out on her i wonder if betsy would have come to me even if shed found a dozen bloody canes lying about in the barn i think shed have kept her mouth shut and lived with a murderer if it meant she could keep cobb after all hed rid her of her rival whatever the reason behind it still in the end hed have been brought under her thumb with the threat of exposure thats in her nature to want to rule the roost and he might have killed her then to escape the only surprise is the fact that she didnt wait longer than she did on the off chance that he might come back now hes out of reach for good rutledge went to the boot and took out the pieces of cane wrapped in an oiled cloth changing his mind he left them there and led the way to the door the sleepy constable on duty picked up the lamp on his desk and showed them to the cell where cobb was sitting on the edge of his cot his head in his hands from the drained empty look in his eyes as the door swung open and he saw rutledge standing there it was evident hed not slept since hed been arrested he got slowly to his feet and in the light from the constables lamp cobbs eyes gleamed like those of a trapped animal rutledge had seen that look beforenearly as often in the innocent as in the guilty that fear of things getting out of hand of wanting to fight back when flight was no longer an option and that blindingly helpless feeling of knowing the odds are set against you because the evidence is overwhelming he was prepared for argument for cobb appealing to him over satterthwaites head expecting the man from london wouldnt know hobson or its people as well as the constable did instead cobb said am i to be taken to london then the words came out more harshly than the man intended rutledge said that hasnt been decided youll have to find another home for jake you know he went on striving to conceal the anxiety that had kept him awake he seems to prefer women there was no one else in the house with them year after year its not surprising id have had to win his trust or not but id have kept him he added wistfully then with a spark of his old self he didnt get along all that well with my motherinlaw my motherinlaw heard him speaking once and swore i was in that house somewhere florence told me that a thought struck rutledge peter would have known the difference between jakes voice and his brothers what do you have to say for yourself cobb you swore to me you hadnt killed her you told me you wanted to get your hands on the man who did i never expected betsy to turn against me he said not that i blamed her but it was a stab in the back all the same you walked away from her and your marriage after great provocation it was that or strike her back all i can do is wonder how long shed have kept that canes head hidden if id stayed or begged to come home again it was what rutledge himself had wondered why did you keep the head of the cane i didnt if id found it id have come to the police then how did it wind up among your tools your wife has sworn in her statement that shed found it there i dont think it bothered her to swear to a falsehood she was that angry at a guess the knob came from mrs blaine betsys mother she found the body if shed seen the cane and realized that the head was gold shed have taken it shes like a magpie always had an eye for herself or anything to her advantage shell offer to buy florences land see if she doesnt i hope teller tells her to go whistle up the wind all the same it was interfering with the scene of a murder he paused peter teller is dead what how by his own hand we dont know yet early days my god cobb shook his head in disbelief shed have been a widow after all as for the cane i wouldnt have kept it gold or not theres blood on it constable satterthwaite made certain to point it out wed like to ask you one last thing what became of the rosewood box with mrs tellers letters in it i wouldnt have taken them what good were they to me but they meant a lot to her it would be like taking timmys photograph a cruelty what else was in that box the deed to the house how do i know i never saw the contents only her reading a letter to jake he frowned even my motherinlaw saw her reading them she thought it was a love letter from me and didnt i get a flea in my ear but i could look her in the face and tell her it wasnt true the only time id ever written florence teller was when timmy died to tell her how sorry i was over his loss i doubt she kept it into the brief silence he said to rutledge you havent asked me if i killed her only what i had to say for myself did you kill florence teller beside him he could feel satterthwaite stir and then be still again i did not if i hang i will tell the hangman i never touched her then who did teller he must have done rutledge turned away the constable holding the lamp said will that be all then he shifted it to his other hand preparing to close and lock the cells door no not yet rutledge walked away through the gloom of the station and out into the cool morning air satterthwaites silent accusation as if rutledge had betrayed him kept him from thinking and the beaten spirit of lawrence cobb feeling his own sense of betrayal clouded the issues and what were they a dead woman a broken cane with blood on the knob a missing box of letters those were the facts irrefutable and the evidence must encompass them or it was faulty it was also a fact that telleror someonehad driven away around the same time florence teller was murdered and larkin a walker was a witness to that the cane was a witness as well to peter tellers presence if hed been chary with information about his regiment while living here in hobson hed never have left that at sunrise cottage in his absences it hadnt been there for the killer to find ready to hand until teller himself brought it telleror cobb where did the truth lie he walked on up the street shops still closed the milk van making its rounds the sound of clinking bottles off in the distance a crow calling from the church tower down another street and wheels somewhere clattering over cobbles a dog trotted up behind him sniffed in his direction and trotted on looking for company a cat in a house window silently meowed at him as he passed go back to the evidence hamish said it hasna changed and that was true it hadnt altered going back over it was fruitless rutledge swore he needed a nights sleep to clear his mind but there wasnt one in the offing hamish was right the evidence was the same what was new the canes head had been found peter tellers regimental crest on it showed that peter had been in hobson at sunrise cottage on the day of the murder but that was all it showed it couldnt speak and identify who had used it cobbs words came back to him she found the body if shed seen the cane and realized that the head was gold shed have taken it shes like a magpie and satterthwaites voice mrs blaine reached for the paperweight and i had to push cobb back to the only cell after that his own what else was in that box the deed to the house cobb again shell offer to buy florences land see if she doesnt he could hear mrs blaine threatening to wring jakes neck because he didnt talk he only made a terrible racket hamish said aye it wasna the letters rutledge turned on his heel and walked briskly back to the police station he found that satterthwaite had brought chairs to the cell door and he and cobb were staring at each other like mastiffs circling each other looking for a weakness rutledge said to the thielwald constable handcuff him i want to take him with us back to hobson the constable said where satterthwaite demanded just do it rutledge told them ill be in the motorcar and he walked away his mind was on hamish cobb in front satterthwaite in the back and then both of them could watch cobb the two constables emerged from the station with cobb between them this is most irregular sir the constable was saying its all right hell be back within the hour front cobb sit just behind him satterthwaite they did as they were told one look at rutledges face and none of them was willing to risk argument they drove in silence out of thielwald to the road for hobson and then took the turning for sunrise cottage were going back to the house satterthwaite asked rutledge didnt answer his mind on what was to come when he drove past the cottage and turned into the rutted lane to the blaine farm satterthwaite said here you cant call on her at this hour she keeps a dairy farm she was up milking at four drawing up at the front of the house he said cobb stay here and keep watch he strode up to the door and knocked let me do the talking he told satterthwaite if youll just tell me sir but the door was swinging open and mrs blaine was standing there a basket of eggs under her arm she stared at them suspiciously inspector constable i was just about to candle the eggs then she saw cobb in the motorcar and said angrily whats he doing here hes a dangerous man if hes smart hes doing precisely what i told him to do rutledge said may we come in she was still blocking the door but she said now ill tell you flat out i found it hard to believe he was a killer just shows you doesnt it that you cant be sure about people however well you think you know them and so i shall say at the inquest this isnt about cobb ive come to tell you that the parrot does talk her eyes widened but she said only we heard it it said good night to lieutenant teller she stepped aside youd better come in then thank you they followed her through to the kitchen where she set the basket of eggs to one side of the sink then turned to face them theres a witness who heard the bird exclaim no no no in some distress weve come to believe that this was the moment when mrs teller turned from her assailant and tried to escape a witness mrs blaine asked warily the person who is presently caring for the bird did it mention a name she waited her eyes on rutledges face it would know cobb he was always there couldnt stay away you found the body is that correct i told youi was off to market and i often asked if theres anything mrs teller needed thats why i saw her in the doorway after shed been dead for what two days its you and the constable there who said two days i couldnt tell you brought jake here to keep him safe is that correct she was more comfortable now yes poor thing someone had to have mercy on him but you were prepared to wring his neck when you discovered he couldnt name her killer iwho said he could name him it was you wanting to take him to london with you you found the body youd taken jake without telling the police what else was there did you see that the cane had a heavy gold head and did you think the rosewood box might hold more than letters that the deed to the house might be in there as well after all there were no heirs here she exclaimed you cant prove any of that except that i took the parrot out of pity for it theres no one else who would have taken the box she was alive when peter teller saw her and she would never have given the letters up peterbut i was told he was dead but he was there that day it was his cane you picked up and he owns the house with the red door now that his wife is dead her face flushed if it was teller who came back why didnt he stay why did he leave i dont believe you i dont know the answer to that still he must have spoken to florence she must have turned him out perhaps she decided that she preferred lawrence cobb after all she did betsy she stopped betsy asked her i was about to say mrs blaine was it you or your daughter who murdered florence teller satterthwaites breath came out in a hiss but he said nothing murdered her it was that husband of hers i tell you youve seen the proof i dont think it was cobb teller came to see his wife and she sent him away or he said what hed come to say and left well never know and someone came along just after that was mrs teller sitting on her step crying or standing at the door looking as if shed seen a ghost someone stopped a woman and misunderstanding what was said when florence was asked what was wrong one of you suggested she go back inside and as she turned one of you picked up the cane her husband had dropped in his own shock and grief and struck mrs teller with it then panicked and left her there theres not a word of truth and then he went on inexorably when no one found her you had to be the one to call the police you couldnt wait any longer its cobb cobb didnt have the box of letters teller didnt have them that left you which means you went inside that house stepping over the body to see if cobb was in the back weeding and because he wasnt you helped yourself to the bird to the box where you knew mrs teller had kept her personal papers and then the head of the cane which was gold putting it all together i can see now that it was betsy who killed her and you went there as soon as she told you to make sure there was no evidence against her mrs blaine fighting for control said ill tell them in the courtroom that youre a filthy liar that you came here from london and couldnt see your nose in front of your face ill tell them that because i did a good deed you want to blame me to cover up your incompetence they wont like you when ive finished with them and they wont believe a word you say betsy thought it was cobb didnt she who had brought florence teller to tears she didnt wait to hear all of it she acted in a fury mrs blaine moved away from the sink youll not hang my daughter shes the victim here betrayed by her own husband watching that woman suck him dry of any feeling for her and not satisfied with that he turned my daughter out of her own house the constable will tell you he saw cobb coming into hobson with the mark on his face where my daughter had to defend herself from his brutality he said straight out that hed kill her if she touched florence teller do you think shed dare cobb walked out he didnt turn her out hes a murderer hed have come back in the night and stabbed her in her sleep that bit of cane was found in his things not hers the parrot the head of the cane the box of letters rutledge said again you took them all shall i bring the parrot back to hobson i thought i was protecting her it turned out i was protecting her worthless husband and who will listen to a bird if youd believed it was cobb you wouldnt have needed the parrot or the box and youd have left the cane where it was didnt it bother you that she lay there two days while you hoped someone else would find her two daysi call that inhuman she whirled her hands closing over the heavy whetstone that was used to sharpen knives and she flung it at rutledge with deadly aim but he was expecting it and she narrowly missed him with a cry of fury she turned and was on her way out the door just as her daughter came into the kitchen from the yard mrs blaine burst into tears im a mother i had to protect my daughter i killed her not betsy it was never betsy betsy barging into her mother spun her out of the way i heard all of it she said her face flushed and her eyes bright with her fury i heard what you were saying well id do it again if i had the chance id do it again you dont have any idea how much i hated her chapter it took some time to arrange matters the two women were shut up in the pantry by the kitchen door where the windows were too small to allow either of them to escape satterthwaite was left to guard them while cobb and rutledge went back to thielwald to bring back help on the way cobb said how did you know betsy wouldnt throw a handful of earth on the coffin you left her a rose you knew then cobb asked in disbelief no but it occurred to me on the way to the blaine farm you said yourself mrs blaine was like a magpie the gold knob for a rainy day the letter box in the event a deed was in there as well jake in the event he could name her daughter if betsy had been glad someone else had killed florence teller shed have wished her to rest in peace and to leave you in peace id told her id kill her if she hurt florence she was in a fury that day she must have thought you and mrs teller had had words that youd come to the front door of the house like a suitor and mrs teller had taken her husbands cane to you if shed turned me out why would betsy kill her for fear i think that youd go on begging mrs teller and one day she might be lonely enough to relent and let you live with her or sleep with her my god cobb took a deep breath i thought id hang i thought that the evidence was so strong i was going to be convicted satterthwaite was damned good in his reasoning and he would do his best to see me hang as well i think there was some jealousy there im sure there was but he tried to be fair as well but cobb was silent as if he disagreed they were coming down into thielwald when cobb spoke again im not sorry to hear teller is dead if it was by his own hand do you think it was because florence told him to go away and not come back rutledge thought no such thing but he said only i dont suppose well ever know it was late afternoon when rutledge had finished his last duty in hobson satterthwaite bought him a drink in thielwald and said i couldnt see the forest for the trees neither could i what was it about florence teller that attracted men like cobband meto her and yet she couldnt keep her own husband i think you felt a little of it too it was her strength i suppose rutledge said considering it and her loneliness i wanted her murderer caught as much as you and cobb did satterthwaite nodded cobbs going to live with his uncle for now did he tell you i think theyll deal well together sighing satterthwaite said well i for one could use a nights sleep ive to deal with the teller family and then theres a pressing inquiry in london was it accident or suicide tellers death rutledge didnt answer for a time and then he said quietly i wish to god i knew he should have slept he knew that but he circled around after leaving hobson and went back to the house with the red door letting himself in he walked through the empty rooms standing by the chair where florence teller had sat so many days and nights waiting he wondered if she was at peace now the police from thielwald had searched the blaine farmhouse and failed to find the rosewood letter box nor had they found either a deed or any other private papers belonging to mrs teller he walked on looking out at the garden behind the kitchen at the flowers that had been so important to the lonely woman and then turned and went up the stairs there was no way to know what the teller family would do with this house now something surely he had a feeling cobb wouldnt go back to the farm hed shared with his wife but he might end here he had the money to buy sunrise cottage if he chose and keep it as florence tellers shrine all the small painfully important memories of a womans lifetime would be lost otherwise already the house felt as if she was no longer there even in spirit in the bedrooms there was already a light film of dust collecting on the tops of tables and the windowsills he walked into her room there was timmys photograph where she could see it every night waiting for her to come up to bed he crossed to the table and picked it up looking at it again it shouldnt stay here to be lost with the rest of florence tellers life it belonged with the family that had never acknowledged the little boy who would have been their heir if hed lived shall i he asked the silence around him and then after a moment he put it in his pocket he would take it home himself a last gift to a woman hed never seen except in death and then he left the cottage shut the red door firmly behind him and then the gate if he drove through the night as long as he could count on staying awake he could be in essex in the morning as it happened he stopped at st albans out of necessity for petrol and he realized that he couldnt go any farther without endangering himself and anyone who got in his way there was a room available in the inn inside the cathedral close the sleepy clerk welcoming him and asking when he wished to have his breakfast rutledge laughed when im awake he said and went up the stairs like a drugged man to fall into the bed by the windows overlooking the river and after that he could remember nothing until he awoke two hours later it was still dark outside but he got up shaved and dressed and went to find a telephone in the town clouds had come in during the night and now intermittent showers were cropping up he ran through one on his way to a hotel near the railway station and dashed in he was shown to the telephone closet where he put a call in to the yard gibson answered and rutledge gave him a brief summary of what had transpired in hobson im going now to essex ill be back in london as soon as may be gibson said you were supposed to be on the bridge last night yes well a different murder took precedent and then he paused no one else was killed they sent the constables out again in your place and nothing happened the chief superintendent was not best pleased i dont suppose he was and then he was driving through the last of the darkness toward witch hazel farm chased the last five miles by a shower as he came down the wet drive and his headlamps swept the front of the house splintering into fragments of light against the mullioned windows he had a premonition that all was not well he couldnt have said why except that hamish in the back of his mind was as moody as the weather his voice as depressing as the rain as he stepped out of the car he realized that the rain had brought a chill with it he splashed to the door as the shower grew heavier he lifted the knocker and let it fall even though it had been draped in black crepe to mark a house of mourning its sound echoed through the silence startling birds taking shelter in the greenery below the windows no one came and then the door was flung open and a frantic walter teller cried come quickly for gods sake he broke off staring at rutledge in bewilderment how did you get here so soon the doctor isnt even here then looking over rutledges shoulder he exclaimed here he is now let him in will you i must go and he ran back into the house leaving the door standing wide the doctors motorcar was barreling down the drive pulling up smartly behind rutledges this way rutledge said and fielding nodded preceding rutledge into the house and taking the stairs two at a time rutledge followed on the first floor the passage ran to the right and to the left the doctor turned right entered a room two doors down and disappeared from view rutledge could hear someone crying he reached the doorway and the first thing to meet his eyes was the great fourposter bed from another era its bedclothes scattered and some falling onto the polished floorboards in a wild tangle jenny teller lay on the bed in her nightdress her fair hair tumbled and uncombed her feet bare walter teller was stepping aside to let the doctor work with her fielding bent over the bed his hands quick and sure but after only a matter of minutes he straightened and said theres nothing i can do shes gone im so sorry walter but she was alive when you got here he exclaimed i could tell i dont think she was and if she had been it was too late far too late the laudanum had done its work she must have been dying when you found her she cant have been i wont believe it he leaned over his wife touching her face calling her name begging her to wake up the doctor watched him for a time then caught his shoulder and pulled him away theres nothing more you can do man let me make her decent she shouldnt be left like this it took some time to convince teller to go out of the room he reached the doorway his face wet with tears his mouth open in a silent cry of grief then stumbled into the passage going as far as the stairs where he sat down on the top step his head in his hands shutting the door rutledge began searching the room from where he stood his eyes roving from the armoire to the tall dresser to the smaller chest of drawers on the far side of the bed a desk by the windows and a long mirror there was a glass verra like that one in lancashire hamish said and so there was very like it even to the carved roses at the top of the oval frame it must have come from the same manufacturer to be so alike odd that both women owned the same mirror he wouldnt have accused either of them of vanity he brought himself up sharply and continued to search for anything out of the ordinary finishing his inspection of the room he waited without speaking what are you doing here at this hour the doctor demanded as he turned to see rutledge still by the door i got here not five minutes before you i was called away before i could finish that business of captain tellers fall fielding nodded i thought he might have called you walter i mean he gestured to the woman on the bed well since youre here help me lay her out the beds in a state wheres mollie the maid i dont think teller summoned her he crossed the room and helped the doctor with his work smoothing out the bedclothes laying the dead woman back into the center of the bed and pulling a sheet up to her chin he worked impersonally and when the body had been made presentable he could say with certainty that there was nothing unusual here no signs of violence he said when their work was done what happened an accidental overdose of laudanum at a guess i prescribed it some time ago i cant tell you why she was taking it now worry over that business with her husband or the boy going away to school i know she took it very hard when captain teller fell here she said something to me sunday evening about not knowing how she was to sleep she kept seeing him lying there at the bottom of the stairs and you prescribed nothing then no she wasnt asking for medical advice i just asked how she was bearing up id come back because i was worried about her and the captains widow susannah teller she was quite distraught she should have been allowed to go back to london straightaway but she said you refused to hear of it then the police from waddington came back and they told everyone they were free to go edwin teller and his wife took susannah back to london they were concerned about his grandmother and how to break the news to her and the sisters miss brittingham and miss teller they left as well miss brittingham asked the rector to keep harry for the night thinking it for the best miss teller was very upset and had words with her brother walter then she left rutledge said the tellers didnt share a room the master bedchamber is just through that door this room is where jenny stayed for her lyingin with harry it was where she always slept when her husband was away if walter teller had been sleeping in there would he have heard anything i doubt there was anything to hear certainly no violent death throes if thats what you mean fielding stood there looking down at jenny teller i can tell you i wouldnt have been surprised to be summoned because walter teller was dead of an overdose in his case deliberate he shook his head hes been under a terrible strain theyd warned me at the clinic that this might be a consequence of his illness and when i was here sunday to pronounce the captain dead i was stunned to see the change in teller the attending doctors at the clinic felt that his recovery would depend on finding a solution to his distress i thought hed decided not to return to the field that he was going to tell them that he had done enough yes well he might have been vacillating fielding said i didnt know the senior teller very well walters father but he was a martinet you know planning his childrens lives without a thought to what they might like or might choose to do with themselves walter is a stickler for doing whats right and it may have been more difficult than he imagined to step away from the path hed been intended to follow all his life how do i view this death rutledge asked i expect like the captains a tragedy that shouldnt have happened rutledge nodded and yet he wasnt satisfied not yet and he heard hamish saying in his ear she doesna look as peaceful as the other lass fielding turned to the door ill let teller come back then ill see to it that he has something to carry him on theres his brothers funeral and now this i understand hes not delivering the eulogy for his brother susannah teller was adamant that it be the eldest brother edwin now we must concentrate on the living the husband the child someone ought to notify the family i dont think teller is up to it ill see to the family rutledge followed the doctor to the door and then went back into the room to look down on the woman lying on her pillow her face pale and already losing that quality that made people real there was a glass on the bedside table milk he thought and a bottle that had come from a doctors dispensary there was no label on it he walked to the only other door in the room and opened it a dressing room and then on the other side as dr fielding had said the door into what must be the master bedroom he crossed to open it then looked back into the room where jenny teller lay why was she sleeping in there tonight but hamish had no answer for him walter tellers bedchamber was highceilinged and spacious handsomely furnished and with a newer bed more modern in style than the fourposter and a low bookcase beneath the double windows that faced the front of the house a part of the original building it had the wider floorboards and a priedieu against one wall that looked very old a vestige of the catholic owners before the reformation someone had kept it for its beautiful lines and decorations and it was well suited to the room walking back to where jenny lay he closed the dressing room door and at almost the same moment fielding returned with walter teller teller crossed the room looked down at his wife and collapsed to his knees beside the bed taking one of her hands in his and burying his face in it fielding gestured for rutledge to leave him there and they walked out into the passage together rutledge asked did walter teller ever tell his wife where he was when he disappeared im not sure she brought harry in to visit the dentist on thursday and i was just coming out i asked her how her husband was if i should stop in and see him perhaps keep him under observation for a while and she told me he had fully recovered i asked if hed said anything to her about where hed been while he was missing i was curious and it was important as well to add that to his file in the event it happened again she replied that he hadnt confided in her i could see she was unhappy about that i suggested that she should give him a little space that perhaps he himself was in need of time to understand his behavior harry had gone to speak to the vicars son who was coming down the street with his mother mrs teller watched him for a moment and then said that she wondered if her husbands family knew more about what had happened than she did that theyd left her and gone in search of him as if they knew something she didnt i tried to make her understand that staying occupied was one of the best ways to weather a worrying time that if they were at all like their brother they couldnt have sat still and just waited as she had done that seemed to relieve her mind a little could that explain sleepless nights women worry about their familiesif they are ill or hungry or frightened or hurt its their nature to care i doubt it it could be as simple as still not forgiving her husband for sending harry away so soon or her guilt over her brotherinlaws fall after all he came down for her birthday celebration yes i see that her death is consistent with overdose there were no signs of struggle only the disarrangement of the sheets while teller strove to revive her she drank her milkif thats where she put the sedativeof her own free will no marks on the lips to indicate that she was forced to swallow it rutledge let it go he went to rouse the maid snoring deeply in her room in the attic and asked her to prepare food for what was to come she burst into tears when he told her that her mistress was dead and he left her to grieve as she dressed his next duty was plainto summon the police from waddington and finally to put in a call to edwin tellers london residence he got through there and as he told an incredulous edwin that his sisterinlaw was dead he could hear amys voice in the background saying edwin my dear what is it whats wrong and edwin shushing her as he listened to rutledges voice leticia said after rutledge explained his calling her dont disturb susannah shes been through enough ill deal with her later his call to mary brittinghams number rang and rang the operator warned him that no one was at home and then a very sleepy voice answered do you know what time it is leticia what could you possibly want at this hour rutledge said its scotland yard miss brittingham i think you ought to come to witch hazel farm straightaway her voice was now crisp and alert is it harry is walter all right its your sister im afraid shes dead the silence went on so long that he thought shed hung up then she said she cant be dead i was just there today yesterday she was all right then is this inspector rutledge where are you in london im at the farm im sorry to break such news over the telephone but i dont have time to come to you its more important that you come here he could hear a hiccuped breath as if she were fighting tears yes all right and then she was gone in the study where hed gone to wait until the police arrived rutledge discovered walter teller already sitting there with a brandy in his hand doctors orders its supposed to give me the strength to cope teller said he looked at his glass holding it up to the light i doubt it will i doubt anything can he studied rutledge for a moment and then asked how did you know to come was it fielding i was here before i knew there was anything wrong rutledge said ive just come from hobson its too late to tell your brother what happened there but you should know we found mrs tellers murderer it wasnt your brother it was mrs blaines daughter betsy a neighbor teller repeated the name betsy why jealousy she thought her husband would leave her for florence teller its a long story and this isnt the time for it but i felt you ought to know that your brothers name has been cleared too late for him teller said but thank you when your elder brother arrives ill need to speak to him about disposal of the house in hobson i dont know that he wishes to leave that to peters solicitors i dont know if they are even aware of the property leave it to me ill see to it its what peter would have wished i think edwin will have enough on his plate with peter dead im told our grandmother took the news very hard and now theres he cleared his throat well rutledge gave him time to recover then said i must do my duty however unpleasant it may be for me and for the family at such a time the inquest will want to consider your wifes state of mind her state of mind my god i havent even told my brother or sisteri havent spoken to marymuch less found words to tell my son his mother is deadand youre talking about the inquest damn it man have you no decency it isnt a question of decency have i your permission to look into your wifes state of mind do whatever you need to do just leave me alone he got up to refill his glass looked at the amber liquid and put it down again with distaste rutledge could see that he was remembering his brother peters drunkenness rutledge said did your brother always drink as much as he did in the short time i knew him the change of subject brought an irritated frown ithe level of pain he hashadto endure must have been unimaginable but no he was more careful what difference does it make now would you say he drank in excess after he came back from hobson look hes dead you cant arrest a dead man what difference do his drinking habits make now he was the catalyst for florence tellers death some of this will have to come out at the inquest into her murder id like to know why he went to see his wife after such a long silence and what she said to him when he was there that made him rush off in such a hurry that he left his cane behind it became the murder weapon it was clear walter teller hadnt considered an inquest in hobson or what it might reveal dear god will it never be finished get out rutledge do you hear me ive lost my brother and my wife just leave me the hell alone rutledge left him there and went in search of mollie she was in the kitchen and as he came down the passage he heard her singing hymns in a low tearful voice as she rattled the pots and pans preparing breakfast he made a fuss over opening the door into the kitchen to give her time to recover she turned quickly then said i thought it was mr teller i dont know what to say to him first the captain and now mrs jenny i dont see how the poor man will survive this blow and what will master harry make of it all poor lamb he adored his mother its such a tender age have you sent for his aunt miss brittingham shell have to stay awhile hell need her she should have stayed after the captains fall mrs jenny needed her then why did she leave they were all at sixes and sevens quarreling and slamming doors this was after youd left miss brittingham said shed had enough and went home mrs jenny went to bed with a headache so she said but i think it was an excuse to leave them to it what rooms did mrs teller most often use for her own purposes she liked the bedchamber where master harry was born its bright and cozy she said and sometimes when mr teller wasnt here shed sleep in that room and of course the nursery she spent a good bit of her time there when the nanny left two years ago and master harry went to the local school she would sit with him there and help him with his studies the nannys old room she made into her sitting room with her desk and things about her she could rest there and hear harry playing or working or listen to him sleep she said she found that the most peaceful sound in the world a childs soft breathing mollie had been working as she talked her hands busy preparing tea and boiling eggs making toast she looked up now and said nobody has told me how she died rutledge said an overdose of laudanum apparently in a glass of milk ah that explains it then explains what there was a little milk spilled last night someone was warming it id just wondered she must have been having trouble sleeping it just seemed odd that shed leave the milk and the pan for me to clear away shesshe was so tidy about things like that she liked a gleaming kitchen she said it made her feel good that what harry ate was prepared in clean surroundings she bit back another round of tears would you care for a cup of tea sir it has steeped long enough he thanked her and left unwilling to intrude on her grief going back to the bedchamber where jenny teller lay he looked again at the room itself and he could see what mollie meant that there was a warmth here that a woman might want to draw around her in times of great emotional need a comfort that the master bedroom in its masculine formality lacked he went next to the nursery opening doors here and there until he found what he was after it was a large bright room filled with childhood from a cradle to a rocking horse a little wooden train that could be drawn about on wheels that clacked as they rolled and a yacht that must have come from harrys uncle edwin who designed such things it would float wonderfully rutledge thought on a pond the keel deep and the superstructure well balanced for it harry was a neat child most of his possessions in good condition and not thrown about wildly an only child rutledge remembered who neednt worry that someone would snatch away his favorite toy the next room was his bedroom with the narrow cot against one wall and a chair that rocked and a footstool for the one that didnt the armoire was full of clothes but not excessively so for a boy still growing there were no photographs here and he realized there had been none in jennys bedroom but when he opened the next door normally the nannys room in the nursery suite he found them all the dark blue and rose carpet was strewn with more toysa small stuffed giraffe with green glass eyes a sled with a toy dog sitting on it waiting to be pulled through the snow of the carpet and a green ball a desk stood under the window in the french provincial style with a matching chair but what interested him was the round table beside it covered with a long skirted brocade and adorned with a forest of silver frames he crossed the room to look at them he could identify many of them jenny and her sister mary as children at the seaside and again at the tower of london a couple who appeared to be jennys parents the three teller sons stair stepped beside their seated sister shyly staring into the camera peter and walter at university edwin with his wife just leaving the church after their wedding their parents with the three teller sons and daughter sitting in front of a christmas tree in the hall of this house and more than a dozen photographs of a little boy marking the various milestones of his life a baby in his mothers arms eyes closed long christening gown draped across her lap just walking and holding his mothers hand riding his rocking horse playing on the lawns with the green ball rutledge had just seen a record of a happy family though seldom including the busy father reaching for the teller family grouping he studied the senior teller he was tall handsome perfectly groomed not the sort to be found on a sunday afternoon with rolledup sleeves pruning the roses or racing his sons across the lawns in an impromptu game his face was strong rather more like walters rutledge thought than edwins or peters and more than a little stiff as if smiling for a camera was an unpleasant duty to be borne with the best grace possible his wife her face upturned to his was also surprisingly strong as if she shared her husbands views and reinforced them he could see where leticia got her own strength of character gran standing at her husbands shoulder was tall and elegant with a whimsical smile the only one in the group who appeared to be genuine he had borrowed a small photograph of walter teller from jenny and hed made a promise to return it because it was one she cherished rutledge took it from his pocket and set it among the other frames where it belonged he was glad hed remembered what struck him about this collection of family photographs wasnt their number nor the stages of a small childs life that theyd captured but the similarity of this boy to the one in the single photograph that had stood by florence tellers bedside in lancashire timothy was undoubtedly his fathers son and he belonged here as he set the small frame down in the midst of the family groupings he felt an overwhelming compassion for florence marshall teller hamish said as he was about to turn away to examine the contents of the desk look again rutledge did frowning at first there seemed to be nothing to see hed been comparing timmy to his cousin harry but now a photograph of the teller sons taken with their sister caught his eye in it walter the youngest was about the same age timmy was when he died almost harrys age now and the likeness as rutledge held them side by side was so striking he wondered he hadnt seen it before harry had his mothers gentleness to soften his teller features but timmy was the image of walter at six or seven looking into the camera with the same expression that mixture of shyness and warmth the same set of the eyes the same way of tilting the head there was a family likeness to his uncles but anyone comparing the two photographs would think that timmy was walter tellers son rutledge pulled out the chair at jennys desk and sat down it wasnt a trick of the light it was there he thought holding the frames closer to the window so that even the dreary raindamp natural light could reach them walter teller no longer looked like the child in the photograph with his brothers edwin still resembled his youthful self but peter too had changed war and mission work had etched new lines where there had been none and honed down the soft fullness of a childs face to the harsher bone structure of maturity edwin sheltered of necessity had changed the least the resemblance didnt make walter teller timmys father but it opened avenues of thought that gave rutledge a different perspective on what he thought hed understood unequivocally after a time he put the frames back where hed found them and searched cursorily through jenny tellers desk there was little of interest to him a few letters stationery and envelopes stamps and a clipped packet of paid household accounts for may satisfied he went downstairs to the study walter wasnt there rutledge locked the door crossed to the desk and methodically went through it nothing there to shed light on what he was asking himself and then he found among folders of mission travel records and other related material a single folder marked simply wills he took that out opened it and scanned jenny tellers last will and testament it was as he would have expected very straightforward money inherited from her family was to be held in trust for her son her jewelry for his wife on their wedding day and a sum for servants past and present another for the church in repton the remainder of her estate went to her husband rutledge set that aside and looked at walter tellers will though he had no right to do so it too was straightforward the greater part of his estate went to his son with a sum set aside for his wife until she remarried or her death bequests to servants to the repton church to the alcock society and for the upkeep of the rose garden at witch hazel farm in memory of his wife but no mention of a woman in lancashire or st bartholomews churchyard where she and her son lay buried rutledge read the last bequest again for the perpetual upkeep of the rose garden at witch hazel farm in memory of my wife and in his mind he could hear the parrot jake pleased with his new if temporary quarters in frances rutledges breakfast room overlooking the garden roses he put the folder back where he found it shut the desk and unlocked the door not a moment too soon mollie was there telling him that breakfast was set out in the dining room if he cared for any he walked with her into the passage there are lovely roses blooming by the drive im surprised not to see them in arrangements indoors in fact now that he was aware of it there were no cut flowers in the house at all none of the displays that country houses could produce in abundance from their own gardens mr teller wasnt fond of cut flowers indoors he said it reminded him of flowers for a funeral hed seen enough of them crowding the pulpits in churches where he preached and mrs teller was she fond of roses i dont know sir she never said she did sometimes walk up to the garden by the drive but for the most part she left the gardening to the gardener he thanked her and let her go and then he opened the drive door and looked out even in the rain the heavy dewwet scent wafting on the slight breeze was pleasant closing the door again he walked into the dining room but teller wasnt there a plate and silverware set to one side indicated that hed come in and eaten a little but the dishes were hardly touched rutledge put food on a plate without thinking about what he had chosen he was remembering captain teller when rutledge asked about walter tellers will during his disappearance saying that it would be time enough to read it when they knew his brother was dead and rutledge had never pursued the question because walter turned up alive and well he went to the telephone and gave instructions to the constable at the yard who answered he had just put up the telephone when there was the sound of a vehicle coming down the drive he waited outside for it to reach the steps leticia pulled up the hand brake turned off the motor and stepped out you seem to bring trouble in your wake i see dr fielding is still here where is my brother i havent seen him this past half hour hell be with jenny then she said decisively and went briskly past him and up the stairs fielding came down shortly afterward and said i asked if hed like to speak to the rector he said hed prefer my company he wont let me give him anything he said that god was punishing him and he couldnt escape that theres breakfast in the dining room thank you its been a long morning for all of us i could use some tea he nodded and disappeared down the passage rutledge was standing very close to where peter teller had been found at the foot of the stairs he looked at the spot remembering the sprawled body and the family in distress it had seemed to be genuine distress amy first to reach peter had said he had tried to speak her name mee rousing himself rutledge was about to walk back to the study when he heard another vehicle on the drive it was the local police inspector jessup said as rutledge opened the door dr fielding asked us to wait before coming whos here now i see the other motor miss teller walter tellers sister jessup nodded was she here last night i telephoned her earlier she arrived not five minutes before you rutledge led the way into the study it appears to be a straightforward case of accidental overdose he told jessup what he had seen and about the spilled milk in the kitchen at this stage i cant see a case for suicide or murder not at this stage rutledge repeated jessup said sometimes people arent careful enough counting out their drops are you comfortable with accidental death at the moment ill listen to what other family members have to say there seems to have been a rash of them in this house i hope this is the last bad things come in threes teller and his sister are upstairs to your right second door or the master bedroom farther along the passage any marks on the body none that fielding or i saw hell know more later jessup nodded and went up the stairs two at a time another motorcar came rapidly down the drive and rutledge opened the door to find a constable already standing there on duty his cape wet with rain morning sir good morning constable i think thats the deceaseds sister just arriving let her come in thank you sir rutledge went back inside and into the study leaving the door ajar he could hear mary brittingham speaking to the constable then hurrying up the stairs a moment or two later he heard a muffled cry as she must have reached her sisters room it was sometime later that walter teller came down the stairs alone he walked into the study nearly turned about as soon as he saw rutledge there then went to the window the women are doing women things i cant think about what shes to wear i cant face putting her into the ground tomorrow it may be easier jessup seems to be satisfied hes in the kitchen questioning mollie something about milk spilled in the night where did your wife keep her laudanum he sat down took a deep breath and said oddly enough on a shelf in the kitchen she was terrified that harry might find it i told her hed have better sense but she wouldnt hear of keeping it anywhere else did she take it often she only took it once before when shed hurt her back and couldnt sleep im surprised it hadnt dried up long since it made sense fumbling with the pan spilling the milk then miscounting her drops rutledge said after a moment why did she need them last night i expect it was peter the sound he made as he fell she said she could still hear it it was a shock for all of us i dont know how amy held up she watched him die rutledge let another silence fall then he said do you think your brothers death might have been intentional rather than facing trial and the publicity that will come in its wake affecting the whole family he couldnt have foreseen hed have been exonerated if peter had wanted to escape anything he would have gone somewhere quiet and private and shot himself there are enough grounds here at witch hazel farm for him to do that a good point who was florence teller in truth that brought walter teller out of his chair now that mary is here we must break the news to my son if you will excuse me and he was gone jessup came to say that he was ready for the body to be taken away but leticia teller had asked him to wait until her brother and his wife arrived pulling out his pocket watch he stood there considering time and distance another hour at best ive told dr fielding that he can leave yes thank you jessup said youre sure theres not something more i ought to know rutledge answered there was an inquiry in lancashire as it happened captain teller was an unwitting witness he called on someone there and shortly afterward she was murdered the woman who killed her is now in custody we shant have his evidence at the trial but i dont think well have any worries about a conviction two policemen heard the murderer confess i didnt know he was recently in lancashire it was during the time when his brother was ill im beginning to think theres much i havent been told walter tellers disappearance was a london matter the murder took place in lancashire and ive got two deaths here so you have fielding said something about tellers illness worrying his wife as well as her husbands disappearance what was the nature of his illness was there any diagnosis worry rutledge said succinctly his mission society would like to see him back in the field im sure they would good publicity for them with walter teller back in harness perhaps another book in the offing what does teller think you must ask him he may be needed here now with a motherless son true enough im not one for traveling in places where im not wanted ive never seen the good in telling other people how to live and how to believe still i admire those who can do such things jessup was fishing rutledge thought and knew his business his role in the lancashire affair didnt prey on captain tellers mind did it its more likely that a bad leg and his refusal to use a cane killed him rather than events in lancashire there was the sound of new arrivals outside the study rutledge said edwin teller and his wife jessup stood lets be clear is this my inquiry or the yards rutledge smiled grimly at this stage its yours ill give your people a statement i was here just before the doctor came so far im a witness but i know this family better than you do and youll find me useful as long as we understand each other they went out into the passage in time to see edwin and amy walk in and then climb the flight of stairs behind then was the elder mrs teller grans face was drawn as if it had aged too fast who is that asked jessup rutledge explained adding shes a little vague but i wouldnt discount her information if i were you it was not long before amy brought a weeping gran down the stairs and took her into the dining room dont fuss amy she was saying when rutledge walked in im quite able to put milk into my cup on my own looking up she said its that handsome young man who walked by my window i didnt know you were invited for the weekend as well he came to take her hand im sorry to meet you again in such sad circumstances yes theres peter dying and now jenny i dont know what to make of it her face puckered again two funerals i thought the next might be my own youve many years ahead of you he assured her amy said quietly go away let her drink her tea and cry a little if thats what she needs to do then i might persuade her to lie down for a bit he ignored her to gran he said you must be prepared to work with harry he will need your support and your care to be sure she told him impatiently what i dont understand for the life of me is why jenny took laudanum captain tellers death unsettled her oh my dear i could hardly bring myself to walk up those stairs i cant think what jenny must have felt but there are the arrangements for peter the flowers the food airing the beds who is to see to them now she demanded fretfully why didnt susannah come with us but i expect leticia will know what to do why would jenny not have taken laudanum to sleep he pursued it must have seemed to her the sensible thing to do so that shed be rested but they gave her laudanum before gran said and she didnt like it it made her so deathly ill amy started to speak but one look from rutledge and she held her tongue when when i was here of course shed hurt her back and i came to stay she found it hard to wake up she felt all muzzy she didnt like it because of the baby amy said but harry was away last night gran took another slice of cold toast is there any of that nice jam left dear the one i like so much amy brought her the pot of strawberry jam thank you my dear she spread it across half a slice of toast has anyone told susannah were here i dont understand why she didnt come down with us mary is here youve always liked mary amy pointed out no i havent just because shes jennys sister she thinks shes invited everywhere i much prefer jenny frowning she began to cry again its so sad you know first peter and now jenny its very trying rutledge prepared to go mrs teller he said to amy id like to speak with you privately if i may if its about jenny and the laudanum no with a glance at gran happily spreading jam on another slice of toast amy rose he led her out of the dining room but leticia was in the study sitting at the desk making a list and at the top of the stairs he could hear walter speaking earnestly to mary as she answered him rutledge caught the words your fault walter you must accept that rutledge said will you find your coat theres no privacy here its raining if you havent noticed it your coat she came back with it and said edwin wants to know if ill be long nothing will happen while were gone irritably she handed him her coat to hold for her and then together they walked out past the constable and into the rain rutledge opened the door of his motorcar for her and then turned the crank reversing the vehicle he drove past the rainladen roses amy said ive just driven from london edwin wasnt feeling well enough to take the wheel im not in the mood for a tour of essex they had reached the gate just out of sight of the house there rutledge stopped without preamble he said florence teller wasnt married to captain teller was she amy opened her mouth then closed it smartly what i need to know is why walter used his brothers name i have no idea what youre talking about she said looking at the trees that overhung the road look ive seen his will that rose garden the one we just passed is to be a memorial to his wifes memory and interestingly enough the will doesnt specify jenny teller theres been a conspiracy of silence from the start youve known the truth all along havent you and helped to cover it up he accused her she had turned to look at him again jenny loved roses no she didnt but florence teller did do you remember the rose that lawrence cobb dropped into the grave was that his name yes i remember i remember that day very well peter didnt kill her someone else did lawrence cobbs wife but i rather think im to blame for walter believing he did and its possible that in revenge he killed his brother you mean peters fallno thats ridiculous what i dont know is how much he loved his wife or if he cared anything for his dead son and i need to know or my judgment will be flawed its pathetic she said angrily you hounded peter to his death with threats of taking him into custody and so he drank too much that meant he wasnt steady on his feet and with that leg its not surprising he fell if theres any blame in his death it lies at your door all youre trying to do is shift it to walter well i wont let you rutledge had both hands on the wheel between them in the far distance over the tops of trees he could just see the tower of reptons church floating like an island in the sweeping curtains of rain hamish was there too the scots voice loud in his ears rutledge turned to look at amy teller you arent protecting walter i dont think youre even fond of him and you let peter take the blame without compunction well jenny is dead nothing can hurt her now its the boy its young harry it was always harry he turned to look at her as long as peter shouldered the blame for marrying two women harry was safe even susannah his wife was willing to say nothing for harrys sake she refused to answer him why did walter teller use his brothers name instead of his own neither of them had married in and still she sat stubbornly silent but rutledge could see tears bright in her eyes tears of anger frustration and helplessness how long have you known at a guess not very long was it during walters illness did something happen then he waited giving her a chance finally he said peter teller died trying to preserve that lie when you got to him he said it was me and instead so that it wouldnt arouse any suspicion you told everyone that he had spoken your name he thought for a moment she would fling open the motorcars door and run down the drive in the rain to get away from him and leticia you and your husband along with mary tried to pry the truth from walter on sunday after id gone north did jenny overhear you is that why she took an overdose of laudanum she broke down then her face in her hands it had mostly been conjecture on his part putting together what he knew with what he suspected and holding the two together with a tissue of guessing he added as he prepared to let in the clutch and start down the drive peter didnt kill florence tellerbut i tell you again its possible walter thought he had and killed him thats why i need to know how he felt about florence teller and if he would avenge her when the chance presented itself he handed amy teller his handkerchief adding i think you can see my dilemma inspector jessup is already suspicious if i walk away and dont do my duty someone else will and it will be worse ill do my best to protect harry but i will need help chapter amy was out of the motorcar almost before rutledge had come to a stop he watched her dash through the rain into the house as the constable opened the door for her he sat where he was feeling distaste for what he had just done but amy teller was the only one he thought might eventually tell him the whole truth ye may be wrong hamish warned him the study door was shut and rutledge opened it expecting to find most of the family gathered there but walter teller was sitting alone if youre looking for the others theyre in the drawing room i dont know whether theyre leaving me alone to grieve or if they cant bear my company his voice was dispassionate as if he had shut off his own feelings rutledge said theyre still trying to come to terms with your brothers death and now this he was interrupted by a knock at the door teller said tell them im not seeing anyone but it was the rector mr stedley who stuck his head around the door walter they told me you were in here he was tall and robust with a deep voice i thought i should come mary is with harry theres nothing i can do in that quarter at the moment walter rising said ah stedley thank you for your care of harry its very kind of you and mrs stedley to take him in its been very difficult for all of us and it will be hardest for him the question is what can i do for you would you like me to go to jenny and say a prayer iyes if you would im sure she would have wanted that shes in the room where harry was born as the rector went up the stairs walter said its beginning the flood of mourners and each time i speak to them her death becomes a little more real you must have seen death many times in your work abroad walter laughed without humor my first posting i buried twelve people on my first day a cholera epidemic it was only the beginning i should be accustomed to death and then the war i lost count of the number of men who died in my arms inside and outside the medical tents sometimes kneeling in the mud sometimes watching shells scream over my head sometimes by a cot with bloody sheets or in an ambulance before the stretcher could even be lifted out i was quite good at giving a dying man the comfort necessary to make the end easier and all the while i knew i was lying to them and to myself i will say one thing for the king james version of the bible the words are sonorous and speak for themselves all i had to do was remember my lines rutledge thought about the curate reading from the psalms for florence tellers service he had seemed to speak from the heart if those men were comforted then it didnt matter what you felt i wish i could believe that there must have been rewarding moments in your mission work that too was a sham he answered tersely but you spoke eloquently about fieldwork in your book so im told that was worse than a sham it was a fraud but it bought me time and thats all that mattered time for what rutledge asked but teller ignored him you have no conception of what africa is like there was a tribe on the far side of the river which was hardly more than a stream that fed into the niger still it kept them from our throats we only had to guard the crossing but then their crops failed in the rain my god id never seen so much rain and then it was gone the soil baked nearly to brick in days id been frugalthrifty so they came for our crops pitiful as they were and i abandoned my flock i stood in the pulpit and exhorted them to put their faith in a merciful and compassionate god knowing all the while theyd be slaughtered and id be dead with them if i stayedthe foreign priest who had lured them away from the old worship i can still see their eyes you knowlooking up at me believing me putting their trust their lives in my promise and the next morning i was packed and walking out before first light i dream of their eyes sometimes not the poor slaughtered bodies rutledge said nothing as if driven walter went on and then there was zanzibar wed had a disagreement with the bishop and we thought we knew better how to deal with the arabs better than he surely and instead we found ourselves charged with insubordination zanzibar is an islandhave you ever been to a spice island my god pepper and mace and allspice cloves and vanilla and nutmegyou ride down a hot sunny stretch of road where theyre drying the cloves on bright cloths spread almost to your feet small brown spikes thousands of them like a carpet that moves with the wind and vanilla podsor tiny green seeds of pepper mace that thin coating of a nutmeg is worth its weight in gold amazing place and the sea so blue it hurts your eyes to look out across it but the smell of slaves is there in the town as well misery and grief and pain and helpless anger thats zanzibar as well hamish said you mustna let him finish but rutledge refused to halt the flow of this mans confession he could see how the soul of the man had been scoured to the bone in china we used the opium traders they carried messages where no one else would and sometimes were the only protection a traveling man of god had from bandits we found on the road so we lived with the devilquietly mind youwhile we preached that opium was evil and led to madness and death double standards rutledge we preached and didnt live a word that came out of our mouths sanctimonious selfrighteous prigs thats what we were and i was ashamed of all of us in the end do you think you were the only missionary who felt that way i hoped i was he laughed harshly i wasnt like the rest of them i had no calling you see i became what my father told me to become and peter hated the army as much as i hated my own work id have liked being a soldier i think but who knows i might have hated that too which hamish was remarking to rutledge explained why he had told florence marshall that he was a soldier living a lie because it made him feel better about his lack of choice in the matter made him appear to be dashing and romantic in the eyes of a young woman who had never seen the world beyond where she lived and yet cowardly enough that he used his brothers name for fear his father would somehow learn of his rebellion they could hear mr stedley the vicar coming down the stairs teller shook himself as if awakening from a reverie as if hed been talking more to himself than rutledge shes very peaceful mr stedley said coming into the room yes is there any comfort i could offer you walter thank you rector for coming you might wish to speak to the rest of the family weve been overwhelmed by events ill be in touch about the service i think jenny would have liked you to conduct it yes of course he looked from teller to rutledge and back again if you need me youve only to send for me and he was gone walter teller sighed next it will be the police cornering me asking questions and then mary will be at me again or leticia and then my brother id like to lock the door and pretend im not here rutledge rose ive brought timmys photograph from the cottage walter teller was very still then he said perhaps his mother would have preferred to have it buried with her he lost his temper what did timmy do fail his father by dying when it wasnt convenient to come home and pray for him tellers face went so white rutledge thought for an instant his heart had stopped and then catching his breath almost on a gasp he said only peter would be grateful to you rutledge went outside to walk off his anger the rain had moved on black clouds toward the east the sky overhead still roiling as the weather fought for stability he went to the other side of the house unwilling to pass the roses and instead crossed the lawn toward the little stream swollen with rain and threatening to overflow into the grassy water meadows on either side he could feel the soles of his boots sinking into the soft earth and moved a little above the soaked banks jenny teller was well out of it he told himself and then he found himself thinking that she would have managed as she had done in london whatever she had discovered about her husbands past she could have been married again to regularize her union and she would have said nothing that would endanger her sons future whether she could bear to live with walter teller again was another matter he might have had to accept the alcock societys next posting to the field until he and his wife could come to terms with the ghost of florence teller and her son timmy hamish said perhaps thats why she had to die dont be a fool rutledge told him harshly yere looking at black and white its a mans way of thinking no a womans in the distance he could hear someone calling his name looking up he realized that leticia teller was trying to attract his attention he turned back toward the house and she waited by the french doors for him when he was within hearing she said there have been two telephone calls for you one appears to be urgent scotland yard he thanked her and took the message she was holding out to him inside he looked at the first from inspector jessup in waddington it read mrs susannah teller wishes to know when her husbands body can be released for burial he called the police station and left a message for jessup at your earliest convenience murder accident or suicideit didnt matter the police had no reason to hold peter tellers remains any longer next he put in a call to the yard when sergeant gibson came to the telephone rutledge could hear the tension in his voice sir there have been developments in the inquiry concerning billy bowles was growing restive go on inspector cummins took your place last night i thought you told me that the constables had tried again with no luck thats true yes sir but inspector cummins decided hed try his chances without notifying the yard he gave as good as he got the inspector did but hes in hospital and theyre stitching him up and billy got away sir there was no one posted on either end of the bridge to stop him rutledge swore under his breath all right what does the chief superintendent want you on the bridge tonight he said to tell you that unless what youre doing is a matter of life and death youre to be here no later than nine this evening ill be there im coming from essex yes sir rutledge put up the receiver then stood there for a moment thinking he asked himself how he would have viewed the death of peter teller and the death of jenny teller if he hadnt known the background of events in hobson if hed come here as inspector jessup had done with nothing to color his perspective but a man with a bad leg whod had too much to drink and simply fallen down the stairs or a woman distressed by a death almost literally on her doorstep and very tired but unable to sleep miscounting the drops from a bottle of medicine that she expected to give her some relief hamish said but ye ken it isna sae simple rutledge went to find leticia ill have to leave for london later in the afternoon theres a cold luncheon in the dining room i need to speak to you he followed her there and as she filled a plate and handed it to him she asked what did you say to walter what is it you think i said he asked she shook her head irritably hes gone up to his room and locked himself in the dressing room door as well theyve come to collect jennys body shall i tell them to wait she began putting food on her own plate with scarcely a glance at what she was choosing let them go ahead what about harry mary has decided it would be too upsetting for him to see his mothers body shes staying with him at the rectory if his father finds that acceptable the police will have no objection it wouldnt matter if you did he smiled what do you really want me to say miss teller very well the inquiry is closed in hobson with the arrest of florence tellers killer it was someone who knew her and while the evidence was unequivocally pointing to your brothercaptain tellerhe was not the cause of her death he could hear the hiss of breath as she released it then peter was never guilty even though he died expecting to be arrested at any moment dear god that breaks my heart he couldnt see how events unfolded after hed driven away until we tried to account for certain missing items nor could we but we might have reached our conclusions earlier if there hadnt been so many lies to cover up who florence teller really was but i thought you knew she said forcefully she was peters wife the foolish mistake of a young man whose father refused to allow him to marry his cousin im sure florence teller would be happy to hear she was only a foolish mistake leticia had the grace to flush i wasnt referring yes you were shes been a thorn in the side of this family since you first learned of her did you believe your brother walter left the belvedere clinic to travel to hobson is that why you sent peter there to find out what he could peter didnt discuss his private affairs with us come now i was told that hed gone to cambridge with edwin and that was a lie he was in hobson susannah told me about lieutenant burrows and that was a lie she knew the truth and was trying to help conceal it but jenny knew nothing he considered her for a moment what did you do go through his papers looking for some clue to why walter was ill and not responding at a guess you found something that set off alarm bells and you havent put it back have you because i saw the file this morning and it held only a will he could read the answer in her eyes that was precisely what someone had done was it your brother edwin and his wife the head of the family with his strong sense of duty yes im sure it was the truth must have come as a shock and so peterthe real peter tellerwas dispatched to lancashire to see who this woman was what she might want and whether walter was leaving jenny for her she picked up her plate and put it on the tray for mollie to collect ill leave you to enjoy your lunch inspector im afraid i have much to do leticia walked out without looking back rutledge said to the empty room with florence teller dead and peter and jenny the past is wiped out except for harry hamish answered him theres the captains wife susannah who refused to set foot in this house again but shes loyal to the family was loyal it was a very good point could she be trusted to keep the secret he went to the telephone and put in a call to the yard sergeant gibson listened to rutledges request then said its going to be difficult getting it past the chief superintendent but ill see that a watch is set you dont care to explain why its needed rutledge said early days and let it go at that edwin teller met him in the passage and said i should think the yard would have no further business with the family im told youve found your murderer im glad a pity peter couldnt hear that as well indeed rutledge agreed im leaving this afternoon for london theres something there i must do ill be back by tomorrow morning i dont know why you should return at all there are loose ends he was about to walk on when edwin said do you mean susannah peters wifewidow im not sure i understand what youre asking look im just concerned i wanted to know if youre expecting to speak to susannah shes grieving and in great distress this was such anno one can prepare for these things can they peter should have lived to a great age like my grandmother give her time to come to grips with her loss are you afraid she might decide finally to tell the truth to clear her husbands name she hasnt been told that hes no longer under suspicion i tried to telephone her just now and iris says shes not taking calls for gods sake let her alone ill take that under advisement shall i leticia came out of the study has anyone asked walter if hed like a tray edwin try to persuade gran to eat something she says she doesnt care for mollies cooking that jenny knew what she liked ill try edwin excused himself and walked off leticia said ill see to walter then he ought to have something rutledge looking after her as she went up the stairs decided to start out for london he could hear her now knocking on tellers door and calling to him turning away he found his hat and left the house the constable nodded to him i have to return to london ill be back as soon as possible tell inspector jessup ill give him a clear answer then the constable came forward to crank the motorcar for him and then he was on the road clearing his mind of everything else he concentrated on billy and what might be waiting for him on westminster bridge chapter rutledge made good time to london and went to his sisters house before reporting to the yard she was surprised to see him saying as he walked through the door are you coming for jake not yet how is he i dont want him to grow more attached to me than he is she said he likes to sit on my shoulder and walk around the house i dare not take him outside for fear hell fly away but he wants to go to every window and look out then he searches for roses his owner grew them bring a few inside that might cheer him up a very good idea any news of meredith channing i havent seen her since she returned to london but im told shes back and feeling much better oh speaking of injuries and recoveries did you hear that chief inspector cummins was viciously attacked last night i ran into his sister coming from the hotel in marin street she was sent for he was badly hurt loss of blood stitches i hope they find whoever did such a vile thing im sure the yard has every possible man searching what brought you here if it wasnt jake she asked he smiled no further word from scotland alls well ian had his pick of the pups hes excited because fiona is allowing him to sleep with it i dont think theres any lasting harm from the horror of the train crash the resilience of youth leaving he trolled the streets toward st pauls looking for charlie hood but there was no sign of the man another loop he thought and then six blocks from the cathedral he spotted hood this time rutledge caught up with him and called hood the man turned recognized rutledge and started toward an alley where the motorcar couldnt follow and then he thought better of it and came forward slowly stopping about five feet from the vehicle people were swarming around them at this hour of the day weaving in and out and making any sort of conversation nearly impossible what do you want hood asked and rutledge read his lips rather than heard his words in the noisy intersection a drink a few words rutledge said to him i dont have the time hood replied then coming nearer he asked you havent caught your murderer have you not yet he came close to killing another man last night hood nodded word gets about on the street he made to go rutledge said have you ever had trouble with the police hood laughed harshly not since i was twelve and learned my lesson still trying to make a connection with that other man that inquiry was successfully concluded im glad to hear it and he was off moving briskly through the late afternoon crowds then crossing the street and disappearing into a shop rutledge watched him go ill have you yet my friend he said under his breath then turned back toward the yard instead he went to bolingbroke street and asked to speak to susannah teller to his surprise she agreed to see him the shades were drawn in the sitting room but even in the dim light rutledge could see that her eyes were redrimmed from crying and lack of sleep yet he thought she seemed to have found some inner strength to carry her through hamish said unexpectedly anger rutledge thought that was very true for she kept him standing like a servant i wanted you to know that weve released your husbands body thank you i had a call from inspector jessup i have arranged for the service to be held tomorrow afternoon that was very quick but he said only he didnt kill anyone mrs teller hes been completely absolved how nice to know that the rector neednt mention in his eulogy that peter was nearly arrested for murder she said sardonically if id had the whole truth from the start he told her it might have been different all i know is you made his last days a hell on earth i hope this knowledge will give you nights as sleepless as his were i expect there are worse burdens on my conscience than this one who did kill that woman in lancashire she asked him unable to stop herself he told her and she said jealousy is a powerful thing but you werent jealous of florence teller after all there was no need she wasnt peters wife it never troubled me she said still keeping up the lie from the time i found out we had a happy marriage peter and i whether you believe that or not have you asked your solicitor what your rights are if you persist in this charade whether you are in fact the legitimately surviving spouse mrs teller is dead of course the captain must have made proper provisions for you in his will that visibly shook her but she said our solicitors will sort it out or perhaps they werent informed of the necessity for provisions unless your husband changed his will in the last ten days youre unbelievably cruel inspector my husband is dead and so is the woman in hobson he cant be prosecuted for bigamy and you will only bring public shame on me if you pursue this shaming you isnt my intent mrs teller but when people break the lawand there is a law against bigamy i remind youthere are often repercussions that hurt the innocent your husband for instance whose name was used by walter teller and jenny teller whoif the truth had come to lightwas about to discover that she was no ones wife and her child illegitimate it was convenient for both of them to die when they did accidentally very likely but if not i want you to realize that you may also stand in some danger youre very angry just now about your husbands death understandably he bore the brunt of his brothers misdeeds and he kept his head and fought me every step of the way i recognize why now all of you are very fond of harry and youre protecting him not his father but when you find yourself being denied your rights as the captains widow you might well see matters very differently and if you are forced to tell the truth to protect yourself you will break this wall of silence he could see she hadnt thought that far ahead she hadnt considered the legal repercussions or the danger she might stand in she replied slowly as if still thinking through what hed said but youve just told me that peters death and jennys were accidents at this stage we have to consider them accidental we havent been able to find any proof to the contrary but they wereprovidential you must see that she shook her head my murder would bring to light everything that the family has fought so hard to protect he let it go and told her instead as for the voices your husband heard in the cottage when he was speaking to florence teller it might well have been the parrot jake that her husband brought her it speaks sometimes mimics may be a better word iparrot yes hes here in london you can see him for yourself no youre saying i have no grounds to believe walter or edwin were already there in the house peter was so sure i think edwin can prove he was in cambridge and walter was aware youd discovered his secret he never left london or is this a trick to see to it i withdraw my charge of murder she asked suspiciously i dont trust you either rutledge smiled i dont ask you to trust me just consider what ive said he turned to go as he reached the door she stopped him what youre telling me is that you arent finished with walter and you want me to leave him to you he turned ill do my best to protect harry for his mothers sake and i owe it to the captain to protect you as well at the same time i have a duty to the law until i am satisfied neither your husbands death or jenny tellers will be closed he left her then and she didnt call him back rutledge was returning to the yard when he saw meredith channing just coming out of westminster abbey she still wore a sling on her arm but moved without pain as far as he could tell he slowed the motorcar and when she came within speaking distance he called to her she looked up recognized him and paused as if uncertain whether to greet him or not and then she crossed to the motorcar i see youve recovered he said and you found the people you were searching for were they all right yes thank god i came back to look for you i was told youd already been moved but no one seemed to know where a very kind woman took in several of us it was a relief to get away from such an horrific scene and then friends came for me i stayed a few days with them she paused ian ive decided to travel for a while i think it would be good for me there was traffic behind him he said are you going home just now yes i sometimes come here to think its very lovely and very quiet ill take you then and he lied when he saw her hesitation im going in that direction all right yes thank you as they pulled away from the pavement and headed for trafalgar square he asked how long do you expect to be away for the summer im not sure a year or two perhaps i havent looked ahead after a moment she added ivebecome fond of someone and im not sure that its wise he couldnt see her face she was looking at the passing scene as if she had never traveled this way before he wasnt sure she was seeing it now something has upset you i think the train crash upset everyone who was there she said evasively she turned to look at him then looked away again he remembered that no one had sent him word about the name of the passenger who had died was he on the train the man youve become fond of surprise flitted across her face as she turned back to him on the train no i was traveling alone what made you think there was a man in your compartment he didnt survive oh i didnt know im glad i didnt he was very nice wed chatted for a time she bit her lip hed been to visit his son her eyes filled with tears and she blinked to hold them back well you see im still very emotional about the crash its not unusual god knows he stopped like my shoulder that will heal too she said trying for a lighter tone with time he said nothing weaving his way through traffic giving her space to recover the tension in his mind brought the voice of hamish to the forefront so loud it seemed to fill the motorcar they had reached chelsea her house was just three streets away he was searching for words now unable to think for the other voice realizing that time was slipping away two streets now he didnt know what he wanted to say he had steeled himself against any feelings and the wall was high insurmountable one street running he said finally is no solution she sighed no but i dont know what else to do they had reached her house he slowed the motorcar stopped was getting out to open her door and the moment was lost at least she said smiling brightly it isnt raining this time thank you ian this was very kind of you and she strode up the walk opening her door disappearing inside he stood there hamish hammering at him and then turned and got in his motorcar afterward he wasnt sure how he got as far as windsor without knowing it he had to turn around and drive back to london chief superintendent bowles had given some thought to the trap he intended to lay for the murderer they knew only as billy he said as rutledge reported to him good youre early how is cummins out of the woods but not thanks to billy he came damned close to severing an artery weve got to stop this maniac and youre to be the bait at least thats the current thinkingthat its you hes after i dont think hes a maniac stands to reason that he is hunting people like an animal then taking his knife to them rutledge let it go instead he asked bowles was there any information on that man hood who is our witness for bynums killing the address he gave us was false a stationers shop like many of his kind he doesnt want to be found so rutledge thought little more than hed known already have you spoken to gibson or one of the older sergeants the man may have a past ive seen him before or dealt with him somewhere it doesnt matter we shant need him until the trial heres the plan youll drive over to the police station in lambeth and speak to the sergeant on duty its a routine question about one of the men billy robbed earlier on i want you to be seen and then return here at nine oclock i want you to dine with mickelson walking with him to that pub on the far side of st martininthefields then youll return alone on foot as darkness falls and walk along the embankment failing any sighting of our friend billy youll walk to the bridge and stand where you did before hes not going to fall easily into a trap rutledge warned hes seen your men he knows he sent cummins to hospital heres a better choice and he outlined what he had in mind bowles was willing to compromise and at eight oclock mickelson and rutledge left the yard on foot for their meal it was a stilted dinner neither man feeling much like opening a conversation the animosity between them making even a request for a saltcellar sound like a declaration of war their dislike of each other went back to an inquiry in westmorland where mickelson misjudged a volatile situation and nearly got an innocent bystander killed rather than acknowledge his mistake hed rushed to london and laid full blame at rutledges door circumstances had cleared rutledge but bowles had not been swift to act on the information and still favored mickelson rutledge finished first and went on foot back to the yard he felt like dozens of eyes watched his progress but from street level he could see no one he went into the yard a quarter of an hour later constable miller dressed as a sweep was drunkenly making a nuisance of himself in front of the house of commons a single constable was dispatched to deal with him but the noise level didnt abate rutledge with another constable in tow strode down to commons and reasoned with the drunken man miller young and excited nearly overplayed his role but in the end the two constables marched him back to the yard protesting every step of the way at the top of his considerable lungs a small crowd gathered to watch laughing at the spectacle and miller played to his audience offering to kiss the pretty girls and bring them a sweeps luck he dropped one of his brushes bent over to retrieve it and fell on his face the two constables one on either side brought him to his feet and kept the bundle by this time miller appeared to be turning a little green and the onlookers moved away as he knelt and was sick in the gutter the constables waiting impatiently urged the last two or three people who were lingering to see how the situation turned out to be about their business a decidedly uncomfortable miller holding his stomach and complaining that hed meant no harm shambled between his captors and was soon hauled through the door at the yard rutledge inside commons walked out talking to a welldressed man who could have been as important as he looked they stood together for a good five minutes as the last of the light was fading from the sky sped on by a heavy bank of clouds in the west the man with rutledge finally took his leave and walked back to the commons and disappeared through the door rutledge stood there looking after him for a moment then walked back toward the yard halfway there one of the constables came out to meet him passed on a message and went back the way hed come rutledge went down toward the water studying the clouds that were already blotting out the western stars and moving downriver a flash of lightning in the darkest part of the clouds lit them from within and a cool breeze picked up to herald the storm a roll of thunder followed theres no much time before the rain comes hamish said in the distance somewhere near trafalgar square a motorcars horn blew sharply rutledge started back toward the bridge and paused to watch a river skiff expertly run the gantlet of the stone arches and voices carried to him across the water three men as far as he could tell and young enough to like the excitement of danger he had come to the bridge and stood there as if debating what to do next another roll of thunder reached him and the flashes of lightning were brighter and more often taking off his coat and slinging it over his shoulder he turned and walked back in the direction of the yard he never knew where billy came from there was more thunder a hiss of warning from hamish and suddenly the boy was there arm round rutledges neck jerking his head back rutledge fought then with every skill at his command the boy was strong and driven by obsession rutledge had his hands full and where he wondered in a corner of his mind was mickelson with a half dozen constables ware hamish yelled the knife flashed and rutledge caught the arm wielding it twisted and brought his weight down on it the boy screamed letting rutledge go and then kicked out viciously with all his strength grazing rutledges kneecap as he leapt back there was more thunder and rutledge could hear the german guns his attention on the boy looking for an opening to bring him down once and for all rutledge felt arms flung around his shoulders hauling him back he thought it was one of his own people and relaxed his guard billy hit him then with locked fists across the face behind rutledge someone said will for gods sake no ill kill him and you as well his face was green in the lightning listen to me will ill help you i swear to god i will i dont want your help billy lunged with the knife straight at rutledges exposed chest but the man behind him shoved rutledge to one side with such force that both went down and the knife plunged into the mans left side rebounding rutledge was already on his feet and before billy could react to what hed done he had the boy in a grip that brought him to his knees billy yelped in pain the man lying on the pavement looked up and cried dont hurt him rutledge said through clenched teeth id like to throttle him but he was referring to mickelson for the sound of boots pounding belatedly in his direction was none too soon the first constable to reach the three men held a torch in the face of the fallen man and rutledge nearly lost his grip on billy as he recognized charlie hood are you all right sir that was a very foolhardy thing to do the constable chided him bending over hood and very brave i must say he was shoving something against the heavily bleeding wound as two more men came up and took billy roughly from rutledges hold rutledge knelt by hood what the hell are you doing here he demanded but mickelson had just reached them out of breath saying whos this other man thunder cut across the rest of his words good samaritan the constable retorted as he worked well need help straightaway sir this looks bad billy said nothing standing there pale in the torch beams looking down at hood then he burst out with what did you want to go and do that for now look at whats happened hood cleared his throat and they could all see flecks of blood like black freckles on his lips i didnt expect to see you again quite so soon he said to rutledge what were you doing here rutledge asked again my son man this is my son hood replied haltingly they looked nothing alike as rutledge glanced from hoods face to billys he could find no resemblance at all and then in a quirk of the light as billy turned to him fright replacing his belligerence he caught a similarity in expression around the eyes hed seen billy only once before and then only fleetingly yet he had managed to register that expression as billy had tried to plead his innocence to another constable and it had stayed with him and charlie hood had triggered that memory hood was leaning back in the constables arms now his face pale his mouth a tight line of pain its my fault he whispered smiling with an effort i should have been in time long before this they were trying to lead billy away but he was fighting to stay with the man on the ground a flash of lightning illuminated all their faces briefly in a shock of white light and then they were blinded in the aftermath of blackness thunder rolled and the breeze had become a wind tearing at their clothing and pulling at their hair someone had come with a motorcar and there was an effort to get hood in the back before the rain fell already the first heavy drops accompanied the thunder just overhead and big ben striking the quarter hour sounded muffled mickelson said out of the darkness we couldnt see there was a third person and so we werent sure rutledge ignored him he went to the motorcar as the rain fell and leaned in to speak to hood the man was breathing with some difficulty and pain had set in his clenched fist beat against the seat in rhythm with the throbbing why were you hunting him rutledge asked urgently bending over hood his mother and i separated years ago i didnt know he was in trouble id been working in the north when i heard i started looking i nearly caught up with him the day bynum was killed too late to save him he needed a fathers hand i wasnt there the men she lived with were bad for him i didnt know criminal records why did he want to kill me i thinkyou got in his way he never liked being thwarted he tried to kill me once when he was twelve i made him return a stolen bicycle sir a constable said and rutledge pulled away the motorcar gathered speed as it turned back the way it had come billy too was gone in custody a constable had stayed with rutledge rain cascading off his helmet and onto his cape sir he said again yes very well and rutledge turned with him toward the yard he realized he was wet to the skin and cold mickelson had disappeared the constable said are you all right sir im fine he said shortly and the constable was wise enough not to say more in truth he was not fine tired hurting and angry enough to take on mickelson and billy at the same time he set the pace stride for stride with the constable when they reached the yard the constablehe realized in the light above the door that it was millersaid he held us back sir he said he couldnt see who was with you the other man confused him he said it doesnt matter rutledge told him i think it does sir but rutledge refused to be led into answering he went to his office and sat there for some time in the dark watching the storm move downriver thinking about billy and the man who had called him will after an hour had passed and then most of another rutledge stood up and walked to the door chief superintendent bowles had not come to find him not to apologize for inspector mickelsons disregard for orders or to congratulate rutledge on his role in capturing the killer the newspapers had begun to call the bridge murderer he drove to his flat bathed and changed to dry clothes then slept for two hours when he woke his face on one side was bruised his knee ached but on the whole no damage had been done he stopped at the yard to ask the night duty sergeant for news of hood and was told that the hospital reported he was holding his own and theres a message as well from inspector cummins sir he handed it to rutledge the single word thanks was written in a bold script he recognized nodding to the sergeant he left and drove to essex it was very early the storm over london hadnt cleared the air here the clouds were heavy the rain dismal and he had had no breakfast hamish said it willna improve your mood he waited in a layby until eight oclock and then drove the short distance to witch hazel farm he found edwin standing in the doorway looking out at the weather it doesnt appear that this rain will stop edwin called as rutledge got out of the motorcar good god man what happened to your face an altercation with a belligerent prisoner rutledge said peters funeral is today did you know i spoke to mrs teller yesterday in london she told me they walked indoors and edwin said what about jenny can we go ahead there as well i think its not in walters best interests to go on brooding weve hardly clapped eyes on him he stays in his room leticia has been taking up his meals i see no reason not to release the body rutledge said ive decided to agree with inspector jessup for now that these were accidents i have found no evidence that they werent i dont see how anyone would gain by their deaths financially or otherwise rutledge said it has nothing to do with money what concerned me was the fact that your brother is no longer alive to deny he was married to florence marshall and jenny teller is no longer alive to be hurt should the legitimacy of her marriage be questioned i dont think no im sure none of you did when first you embarked on this venture edwin said as i was about to say i dont think justice would be served by pursuing this rutledge entered the study to find the family collected there save for walter they looked tired dispirited and isolated in their own thoughts mary said the funeral is at two oclock this afternoon did edwin tell you he thanked her and asked after harry hes bearing up well enough the rectors son gave him a puppy i dont know what walter will say to thathe never cared for petsbut it has taken harrys mind off death rutledge was reminded of another small boy rewarded by a puppy from the litter in the barn leticia said did you speak to susannah inspector is she coming i expect to see her he said she started out of the room ill see that her bed is made up rutledge had the feeling that his very presence dampened the conversation he followed leticia out into the passage i dont believe shell stay here he told her well her choice of course he went to the nannys room that had been jennys sanctuary and sat there until it was time to come down for the service it was a quiet room serene and seemingly distant from the tense atmosphere of the study and from its windows rutledge could count the motorcars and carriages arriving for the funeral he made a point of attending the church was larger by far than the one in hobson he watched the mourners gather and listened to a wellmeant eulogy by mr stedley extolling the captains bravery his sense of duty to god and country and his love for his family and then peter teller was buried in rain that pattered softly on the cluster of umbrellas struggling vainly to keep the mourners as dry as possible but the earth that was to be sprinkled into the grave struck the coffin in muddy clumps and he saw susannah teller wince at the sound she had held up remarkably well greeting the guests with quiet dignity her face nearly invisible behind the long silk veil of mourning her feelings hidden as well but he heard her voice tremble once or twice afterward the guests returned to witch hazel farm for the funeral repast mollie and her cohorts had done their best and the family stood about in the drawing room and the dining room making the right remarks and responding to questions that must have galled them rutledge watched susannah teller with edwin at her side as she greeted each guest and thanked them for coming when the last of the mourners had left edwin went straight to the drinks table in the study pouring himself a whisky he held it out to his wife but amy shook her head asking for a sherry he brought her a glass then turned to rutledge nothing thanks edwin sat on the small settee and said god he looked tired and drained it was a nice service amy said everything considered a few gawkers there out of curiosity three fellow officers and their wives came someone whod known peter in school three women who were widows of men who served under him in the war one of them had the handsomest boy with her thirteen at a guess she said he was the image of his father and you could hear the grief of his loss still there in her voice i cant remember who else ohsomeone who had served in the field with walter he must have been close to eighty but was spry as a man ten years younger i think that pleased walter at least he seemed happy to see the man a good number of people from the village as youd expect most of them remembered peter as a boy i think susannah was quite touched where is she edwin asked she left fifteen minutes ago leticia told me she stood up very well didnt she amy went on women generally do its expected of them not to make a fuss i remember walter telling us that somewhere he was sent the women beat their breasts and tore at their hair while making the most haunting noise an ululation he called it he said it made him shiver did inspector jessup come no his wife was there she said hed been called away leticia came in mr rutledge there is tea in the dining room and sandwiches please help yourself he thanked her and went to find mary sitting at the table crumbling bits of bread from her sandwich into little pills on her plate he poured himself a cup of tea then took sandwiches from the platters set out on the buffet may i join you he asked before sitting down yes please do she answered whether she was pleased to see him there or not mrs teller felt that the service went well yes im glad and theres still jennys funeral to get through today i wished myself anywhere but there still one has to support the family as theyve supported me she got up and set her plate on the small table already piled with used dishes ill come in later and help mollie with these she said then after hesitating as if of two minds what to do she came back and sat down have you seen walter he was here for a bit and then i looked for him and he was gone i thought he might have retreated to the study i was there i havent seen him then hes in his room she said nodding did he kill jenny surprised rutledge countered theres no real proof why should he wish to see her dead well thats what weve all been waiting for isnt it these past few days she said bitterly proof one way or the other about walters illness about peter about that death in lancashire then about peter again and now about jenny the other shoe dropping she turned away do you have any idea what the tension has been like since walter first took ill i went through his study trying to find out who to contact in the alcock society i thought someone might come and speak to walter at the belvedere i was foolish enough to believe he was worried about going back into the field and they might set his mind at rest imagine my shock when i learned about his other life and all the timeit was edwin who suggested that florence teller might have been here in london and walter happened to see her but of course she wasnt as it turned out so we will never know will we why he was ill rutledge said it doesnt matter now what made him ill yes it does because he still has to come to terms with it and choose i think it has to do with harry with walters insistence that the boy be sent away to school it was as if he didnt want him anymore i couldnt for the life of me understand why and then he recanted on harrow telling jenny it would be all right to wait a few years but now this morning he told me he thought it would be best for harry to go after all because hes motherless id already promised to take him and look after him for a bit but walter is adamant harrow it is to be i knew walter long before jenny met him as a brotherinlaw he was kind and thoughtful and always willing to help me with the house where jenny and i grew up i couldnt have asked for better and i could share harry with themthey were always asking if id take him for a night or for a few days i really care for the boy id do anything to protect him but ive begun to realize that walter uses people not wittingly purposely but most certainly conveniently ive even begun to wonder if he married jenny to have a son again to replace that dead one hes capable of it you know her bluntness was almost brutal and he found himself thinking that mary had understood what was behind the two marriages better than anyone else because she was so alone herself i dont know miss brittingham what to say but you may be right as to what he intends to do theres no impediment walter teller can do as he pleases ive every intention of closing the inquiries here and asking the inquests to bring in a verdict of accidental death in both cases before she could answer amy came to the door inspector inspector jessup is here he wants to speak to you urgently she turned to mary have you seen walter and whats become of gran he must be in his room mary said i dont have the energy to go and see mr rutledge tells me he wasnt in the study your grandmother is lying down leticia settled her half an hour ago thanks ill go and look for him amy closed the door again mary rose and said needs must i ought to join the others whether i feel like it or not im a guest now that jennys gone and so i must fit in with the wishes of others she went out of the room and rutledge followed her in search of jessup he was pacing the hall when rutledge came down the passage he turned and said theres been an accident can you come at once rutledge followed him out to the waiting motorcar what is it whats happened its mrs teller captain tellers widow she left here im told with the last of the mourners intending to drive to london shes had an accident is she dead he asked remembering the warning hed given her no badly bruised and she wants to see you she wont let us fetch a doctor to her until she does they drove on in silence through the gray evening and shortly after the intersection where the repton road and the one to waddington met the trunk road to london they found captain tellers black rolls touring car with the bonnet having run up into an ancient hedgerow topped by a wooden fence that lead into a pasture he was out of the inspectors vehicle before it had come to a halt and was striding to where susannah teller was sitting in the rain the veil she had pulled to the back of her black hat drooping her coat sparkled with raindrops in the light of her motorcars headlamps he came and sat down beside her then put his arm around her shoulders she cried out in pain then began to weep in earnest jessup was saying bruising where the wheel struck her scraped knees he broke off as rutledge silently shook his head to stop him and he moved away to speak to his men what happened i didnt know youd left was the motorcar tampered with i couldnt stand being thereevery time i went past the stairs or saw someone stepping on the place where he was lying it was more than i could bear i wanted the garden doors open instead but mary told me that with the rain the lawns were too wet i went to walter but he wouldnt open his door and help me i left as soon as i could did you tell anyone you were leaving only gran you dont know how much i miss peter its been worse than anything i could have imagined coming here the funeral and i feel so alone how did this happen i was crying i couldnt see where i was going i did to myself what you were afraid someone else might do are you sure there was no problem with the motorcarthe steering or the brakes she shook her head he sat with her a little longer and then she agreed to let inspector jessup take her to dr fielding he said to jessup go over this motorcar if there is any reason for that crash other than her emotional state i want to know jessup looked at him are you saying someone would like to kill that woman i told her that if there was an attempt at a third accident we would know that the other deaths were murder and she thought she was frightened but it was the only way i could make her watch for trouble she was angry with the family she blamed them for her husbands fall i dont understand how she could rutledge was walking around the motorcar but in the rainy darkness he could see nothing it doesnt matter the fact is she did all right let me know what you find he asked one of the constables to drive him back to witch hazel farm and with a nod from jessup one stepped forward and said this way sir hamish was saying something but rutledge wasnt listening he went to find amy as soon as he reached the house your sisterinlaw ran off the road in the rain dr fielding is seeing her in his surgery oh dear i ought to go to her she should never have been allowed to drive to london alone are you sure shes all right she clicked her tongue i dont know whats to become of us its a little frightening shes all right but i think she might prefer not to be alone of course not buttheres another problem weve looked everywhere and walter isnt here no one has seen him since the funeral service i telephoned the rectorhe told me he hadnt seen walter since we left the church you dont think hes vanished again it would be too horrible to contemplate did you look in the nursery rutledge asked yes before i called the rectory she glanced uneasily toward the door you dont suppose he went for a walk not tonight is his motorcar here im sure it is she began doubtfully then said would you look its in the small barn just beyond the kitchen garden rutledge went around to the shed where the motorcar was kept it was still there rutledge laid a hand on the bonnet it was almost completely cool after driving to the service when he found amy teller and told her she said i dont remember exactly when i saw him last but then i didnt realize susannah had left either there was such a number of motorcars and carriages and people at the end amy turned toward the stairs let me fetch my coat she said after a moment she was back adding perhaps we ought to go to the church ill feel better when we know hes all right she bit her lip we let him stay to himself too much but we were all angry still and upset about peter and then jenny we let him bear the brunt of our feelings the church rutledge asked all right well have a look he drove with her to the church but it was dark and empty with no sign of walter they encountered mr stedley just coming to return the church umbrellas and asked him again if hed seen walter im afraid not he looked across the churchyard to the raw mound of earth that marked peter tellers grave do you have a torch inspector he found the one in his motorcar but although he flashed it across the stones and beneath the yew trees there was no sign of teller stedley standing in the porch shivering said its grown quite chilly i hope hes not wandered far rutledge drove amy teller back to witch hazel farm and with her searched the house again then the outbuildings but teller had gone he might have decided to spend a little time with jenny amy said doubtfully she called dr fieldings house but mrs fielding told her that they had not seen teller since the service for his brother edwin coming down from his bedchamber where hed been resting said i should think hes all right he might have just walked around trying to clear his head but it was like whistling in the dark his voice betrayed his concern mary said from her corner by the fire theyd built in the hearth against the chill of the rain you dont suppose he went to my house or leticias or he may have gone back to london with susannah were all staying the night here he may have wanted a little peace and quiet leticia who joined them said on foot the motorcar is here no he must have begged a lift from someone edwin said we may be worrying prematurely lets give him another hour its foolish to panic like this he wouldnt justvanish again would he mary asked rutledge but he could offer her only cold comfort i dont know call the belvedere clinic amy mary suggested he couldnt have reached london this soon amy protested mollie came in to ask if anyone would care for tea and they asked her again if she knew where teller might be but mollie hadnt seen him since the first mourners had departed hamish said yere worrying about the lass its possible you were fearing for the wrong person chapter it took them some time to discover how teller had vanished so quickly amy brought rutledge the list of attendees it took half the night to track them down he and jessup dealt with the local names while gibson at the yard ran the others to ground the former missionary had been the hardest to locate for he was traveling about england raising funds for various charities that helped support mission work and had no particular itinerary he told the constable who had tracked him down in the middle of hampshire yes walter asked if i was coming to london i told him i was and he asked for a lift there was a meeting he had to attend in the morning he didnt want to put the family out although edwin had volunteered to take him and i was happy to oblige it was company on the road the constable asked where the missionary had dropped teller by scotland yard the constable told them it was all a lie edwin said angry you were here why should he go to the yard hes going back to the field leticia told them leaving us to deal as best we can with the problems he left behind hamish said lancashire through sergeant gibson rutledge had already sent a telegram to hobson asking constable satterthwaite to keep a watch on the house but would teller go there as penance for what hed done to florence teller or to escape from his family he could live as a recluse there as easily as he could in africa mary brittingham said he might have gone to my house theres no one there id given the staff a few days off but jenny still had her key he could have taken it ill have a look at least it was nearly dawn by that time rutledge said you should rest first mary her eyes sunken with worry laughed without humor i doubt id sleep at all someone ought to look and see if peters revolver is here i cant sit still let me drive home and look he may have turned back to confuse us ill stop at leticias too ill bring him back if i find him if i dont ill take your advice and rest she held up a thermos mollie has given me tea to keep me awake on the road ill be all right there was a light breakfast in the dining room but no one felt like eating rutledge said i have a feeling hes not in london he could have taken a train anywhere amy who had gone looking for the revolver said it isnt there he might well have shot himself this time he was so depressed about jenny although youd think he would have a care for harry he may have thought susannah had reached her house he could be there he went to put in yet another telephone call tiresome man leticia said hes thinking only of himself i for one am going up to my bed she turned on her heel to leave the storm had gone with the night a pale sunlight touched the windows amy said shouldnt someone go to portsmouth leticia said as i learned the last time no one can simply arrive at a mission and announce his return there are arrangements to maketravel for one supplies money and so on details like how long hell be expected to remain there what comforts he can expector not whether bibles have been translated into that particular dialect what his expenses are and who will sponsor him enthusiasm isnt enough which is why hamish suggested he went with yon auld man it was a strong possibility except that hed left the missionary in london rutledge said if theres any news at the yard ill make certain you hear it right away meanwhile i need to return to london i can coordinate a search from there no you arent amy said youre going along to hobson arent you it was true hed thought hamish might be right and in the silences of the house with the red door teller might use his brothers revolver who would hear the shot even mrs blaine was gone but he hadnt wanted to alarm them but on his way he detoured to speak to inspector jessup the teller motorcar had been moved from the scene of the accident and it was now sitting in the small paved area to one side of the police station inspector jessup had gone home to bed rutledge was turned over to one of his constables who gave him the report on the accident nothing anyone did caused mrs teller to run off the road he said but someone had tried to tamper with the brakes and failed he went out to have a look for himself and saw that jessup had been right any report on mrs teller dr fielding gave her something to calm her and kept her overnight but he thinks she will be fine bruised and shaken he said but nothing time wont heal it was late when rutledge finally arrived in hobson and he was tired he debated knocking on mrs greeleys door and asking if his room was available but he was afraid that cobb might still be staying there and the last thing he wanted tonight was to talk to anyone instead he found his way in the dark to sunrise cottage and well before he reached the house he stopped and stared up at it there were no lights the house looked just as it had done when hed left it the last time you wouldnt see a change hes asleep hamish said quietly if he was even inside there was a rug behind his seat of the motorcar it was tempting to reach for it and sleep for half an hour neither his wits nor his reflexes were at their best when he didnt immediately open the door hamish said it isna wise to stay here on the road hes not likely to slip up on me aye true enough but ye must move the motorcar walter teller might well be twenty paces from where rutledge sat asleep in his wifes bed he didnt want to risk more noise there was no way of knowing what the mans state of mind was or even if hed come this far walter teller was a man who kept his emotions close whose feelings had been lost in a welter of events from the day he left for africa or possibly even from the day he was ordained was he a killer he hadnt murdered his first wife the odds then discounted his murdering the second hamish said why did ye no feel for the second wife what you felt for the first the lass here caught off guard rutledge said because no one else did aye i cant help but wonder if it would have made any difference if florences son had been brought up in london not here he might have had better medical care that might have occurred to walter teller as well but hamish had no answer for that we may never explain walter teller satisfactorily tidily and with ribbons he had only to open his door to find out that is if walter was indeed in sunrise cottageand still alive yere no thinking straight hamish said rutledge could feel the darkness coming down the sound of big guns in the distance and closer to hand the rattle of a vickers gun no that was at the front when hamish was still living and breathing before hed had to shoot him for disobeying orders his mind felt as if it were stuffed with cotton wool but hed come this far pulling his motorcar out of sight on the far side of the hedge he listened but nothing stirred opening the motorcar door as quietly as he could rutledge stepped out into the night there were stars overhead and the looming shape of the house rising behind the hedge the whiteness of it almost ghostly in the ambient light he could still hear the guns in france distantly echoing in his mind closer than they ought to be shaking off the encroaching darkness he turned toward the gate then stopped he could have sworn another motorcar was coming up the rise moving deeper into the shadows cast by the hedge he listened the road was empty still he hadnt imagined the motorcar footsteps were approaching the house on the unmade road someone trying to walk quietly there was a slight creak as the gate opened and closed rutledge stayed where he was in the deep shadow of the hedge a shaft of lightning lit the sky like a searchlight peering through the hedge he was nearly certain someone was standing on the step by the red door teller arriving what had kept him or cobb coming to the house because he couldnt stay away hamish said he hated teller it wouldnt do for the two of them to meet both of them tense and under a great strain either it was his imagination or someone had opened the door now and stepped inside the front step was empty the silence lengthened rutledge shut his eyes to hear better but the only sound was his own breathing and the beating of his heart something fell over in the house rutledge moved quietly through the gate hamish said someones in yon parlor yes and then a light bloomed in the bedroom window a candle flame he was sure of it rutledge returned to his motorcar and collected the torch then crouching low so that he couldnt be seen from the windows he made his way to the rear of the house he stumbled realized that hed tripped over one of the tiny headstones and froze but no one came to the windows or the door aware that hed failed to gauge his approach properly he realigned his direction to avoid the flower beds by the kitchen door ducking under the kitchen windows he glimpsed a flash of light as if whoever was holding the candle was moving down the stairs time was of the essence he reached the door counting to twentyfive before putting his hand on the latch lifting it gently he waited in the doorway no one spoke and he stepped inside the candle was in the parlor he couldnt see who was holding it only the faint glow as it was raised to allow someone to survey the room it moved on to the sitting room rutledge was well inside the kitchen now letting his eyes grow accustomed to the darkness within the house then there was an intake of breath and a curse as the candle went out my god what are you doing here it was teller speaking and then the scrape of a match and the candle bloomed into life again rutledge could see tellers shadow thrown against the far wall black and formidable but knew he himself was invisible teller raised his voice i asked you what you were doing here a womans low voice said the police said you werent here but i knew you were do you think you can make amends to her or is this sackcloth and ashes too late rutledge strained his ears was it susannah hamish disagreed sanctuary of a sort thats all men like rutledge dont walk away hell find you here well ill think of somewhere else to go ive lived rougher than this at least the roof is sound and i have a bed though i couldnt sleep in it i made myself a pallet on the floor next to timmys bed i slept there many a night when he had croup or a heavy cold it was familiar did you love him more than harry i didnt know harry even though i was there with him as he grew timmy kept getting in my way id see his smile in the way harrys lips quirked the shrug of a shoulderthe way hed kick a football even the way he sometimes talked with his mouth full and the way a lick of hair stood up straight after a nap god how i tried and jenny did you love her as much as you loved florence or are you unable to love anyone but yourself what difference does it make to you yes i thought i was in love with florencei was young i wanted the world and she thought i was everything i wanted to be i could see myself in her eyes better than my fathers surely there was a silence and he said jenny knew nothing about timmy it was a relief to talk to herto pretend this part of my past didnt exist and then i couldnt bear not to come here and remember you saw through me you always have known the kind of man i was it was like looking into my mirror when i was with you yes well it all came crashing down you brought it down you know wittingly or unwittingly you havent told me why did you come he asked i brought you something thats peters revolver i thought you might like to die as peter teller this peter teller i wont hang and i wont shoot myself i disappeared before and i can do it again you heard granwhat she said will still be enough to hang me about the laudanum i was angry enough with you to want to see you hang she said i could have told them it was nonsense about the laudanum she could tolerate it perfectly well mixed with warmed milk i dont know why she was ill that other time she might have had a miscarriage for all i knew why the hell didnt you speak up and tell jessup what you knew why should i make life easier for you it would be best really if you just went away but the police will find you in the end harry will do very well with amy and edwin to care for him put the barrel in your mouth and simply pull the trigger like this youre wrong about me i didnt kill anyone of course you didnt i did it for you even from where he was standing rutledge could hear the hiss of walter tellers indrawn breath it sorted out everything very nicely jenny died knowing she was safe and loved peter was the last connection with lancashire you of all people should appreciate the logic of that after all everything pointed to him and it left harry as the teller heir and that was all everyone cared about if youre honest youll agree with me were you that jealous i wasnt aware of it thats because youre selfish and selfabsorbed so do the decent thing and get it over with i loved you oncesinglemindedly blindlybut i was misled like everyone else and now ive come to my senses no i wont touch that gun in the morning im going back to essex theres nothing left for me here are you so afraid to die she asked pityingly well then ill take care of that for you as well my last gift and before rutledge could move the revolver fired through the echo rutledge heard a slight cough then the sound of a body hitting the floor he reached the dining room in time to see mary brittingham standing over walter teller the revolver down by her side tears on her face shining in the light of the candle put down the weapon and step away from him rutledge said his voice sharp she looked up startled so intent on the man lying at her feet that she hadnt heard rutledge coming toward her why are you here she asked id have left him for them to find theyd never have realized he hadnt killed himself reaching teller he went down on one knee feeling for a pulse it was faint fluttering rutledge swore silently he shoved his handkerchief into the wound in tellers chest pressing against the warm flow of blood willing it to stop as the handkerchief was soaked he flung out his other hand trying to find something else to add to it and mary reached for the tables cloth and was down beside him frantically adding the pressure of her hands to his they worked for several minutes but walter tellers breathing slowed caught then stopped altogether rutledge rocked back on his heels easing his shoulders nodont stop mary cried hes dead rutledge told her but she wouldnt hear of it begging him to find something else she could use and when he wouldnt she screamed at him her voice a shriek that sounded like jakes wordless and primeval and then over her scream he heard the faint choking sound that preceded a long indrawn breath and teller was breathing again mary collapsed over tellers body telling him that she hadnt meant for him to die begging his forgiveness rutledge picked up the revolver and put it in his pocket he felt drained but his mind was already setting out what had to be done next he found sheets in the bedroom and tore them into strips rough bandaging of a sort and working swiftly he moved the woman aside leaving her huddled in a corner crying as he ripped the buttons from tellers shirt and set about keeping the man alive the sun was just showing over the horizon when mary brittingham got to her feet the first rays struck the front of sunrise cottage and illuminated the faded red door she looked down at teller still unconscious but alive turning to rutledge she said will you give me the revolver ill write anything you wish me to write but i dont want to hang youve killed two people it was nearly three a court will have to set this to rights i can only do my duty and if you let me be tried harry will be branded a bastard everyone will know thats worse we can end this here quietly a lovers quarrel people will wonder at it then forget us susannah teller will want to see you hang if you killed peter and tried to kill her ive got to take you to constable satterthwaite and bring a doctor back here with me its been a long night dont make it any longer all right she seemed resigned to her fate her face lined with fatigue and grief and despair will you at least let me make a cup of tea i dont think i can endure the rest of this without it no did you have a coat i left it in the parlor i think she looked down at walter teller i wish id never come but i didnt want him to go to the gallows in my place at least cover him with something a blanket from one of the beds upstairs rutledge stooped to retrieve the bloody cloth from the table to spread it over teller and at the same instant mary brittingham made a lunge for the revolver in his pocket it was well out of her reach he had seen to that but she was driven by something stronger than muscle and bone her will carried her across the distance and her hand gripped the metal just as his clamped down over it there was a struggle she was unbelievably strong and it took every bit of his own strength to turn the weapon toward the wall as she managed to pull the trigger the second shot went into the ceiling before he could force the revolver out of her hands and shove her hard as far away as he could she hit the wall with a force that knocked the wind out of her and for an instant she stared at him with such venom he took a step backward before she could recover hed emptied the chamber and pocketed the bullets taking her arm he led her out of the house and to his motorcar the seats were wet after the rain but she let him put her into the passenger door he turned the crank got behind the wheel and happened to see a long shaft of sunlight touch the roofline of the house where mrs blaine had lived there would be another woman for the hangman now hamish said as rutledge backed into the road theres her motorcar down the road ware rutledge saw it and pressed hard on the accelerator it didnt deter her just in time he caught mary brittinghams arm as she tried to open the passengers door and throw herself out of his vehicle as it gained speed not this time he said pulling her back he kept a firm grip on her arm i will succeed she told him through clenched teeth in the end i will cheat the hangman and he had a feeling that she would but not on his watch chapter it was a miracle that teller lived dr blake who was brought out to attend him said as much lost blood the internal damage hell not be up and about for weeks his family is in essex they could be on the moon for all i care the doctor snapped the hospital here in thielwald will do very well but who rutledge thought would come to sit by his side not susannah nor would amy leave edwin leticia perhaps he sent telegrams to the yard and to inspector jessup and five days later he left lancashire and pointed the bonnet of the motorcar south at last there had been a great deal of time on his hands during those five days he had sat by walter tellers bed or walked the streets of thielwald and spent an hour or two with lawrence cobb one afternoon but when he was free to leave at last he knew what he was going to do and despite the fury that was hamish in his mind he grimly kept his eyes on the road there were times when he thought about florence teller driving all night he came into london in a light rain mist hanging heavy over the thames as he turned toward his destination hamish said yere no fit to do this it was true he was unshaven his clothing wrinkled and stained with walter tellers blood mrs greeley had done her best with a damp cloth and an iron but it was still there even if he couldnt see it he could feel the stiffness along the edges of his cuffs but there was no time to worry about that he was nearly certain he was already too late pulling up in front of the house in chelsea where meredith channing lived he sat for five minutes in the motorcar searching for some sign of life proof that this hadnt been a wildgoose chase and then he got out feeling the cramps in his muscles determined to know he had knocked at the door before he realized how early it was how foolishly early but to his surprise meredith channing opened the door herself he only had time to notice that she was dressed for travel before she said ian whats wrong he could think of nothing to say and then ive just returned from a case in the north he managed finally i must finish my packing she said looking up at him her eyes filled with an emotion he was too tired to read my train leaves in an hour dont go was all he said then she shut the door without answering him as he walked back to the motorcar he could feel her gaze on him from the window of her parlor he didnt turn he had said what hed come to say the decision must be hers a cognizant
