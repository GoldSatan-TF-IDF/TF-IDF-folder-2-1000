lois mcmaster bujold the sharing knife beguilement chapter fawn came to the wellhouse a little before noon more than a farmstead less than an inn it sat close to the straight road shed been trudging down for two days the farmyard lay open to travelers bounded by a semicircle of old log outbuildings with the promised covered well in the middle to resolve all doubt somebody had nailed a sign picturing the well itself to one of the support posts and below the painting a long list of goods the farm might sell with the prices each painstakingly printed line had a little picture below it and colored circles of coins lined up in rows beyond for those who could not read the words and numbers themselves fawn could and keep accounts as well skills her mother had taught her along with a hundred other household tasks she frowned at the unbidden thought so if im so clever what am i doing in this fix she set her teeth and felt in her skirt pocket for her coin purse it was not heavy but she might certainly buy some bread bread would be bland the dried mutton from her pack that shed tried to eat this morning had made her sick again but she needed something to fight the horrible fatigue that slowed her steps to a plod or shed never make it to glassforge she glanced around the unpeopled yard and at the iron bell hung from the post with a pull cord dangling invitingly then lifted her eyes to the rolling fields beyond the buildings on a distant sunlit slope a dozen or so people were haying uncertainly she went around to the farmhouses kitchen door and knocked a striped cat perching on the step eyed her without getting up the cats plump calm reassured fawn together with the good repair of the houses faded shingles and fieldstone foundation so that when a comfortably middleaged farmwife opened the door fawns heart was hardly pounding at all yes child said the woman im not a child im just short fawn bit back given the crinkles at the corners of the womans friendly eyes maybe fawns basket of years would still seem scant to her you sell bread the farmwifes glance around took in her aloneness aye step in a broad hearth at one end of the room heated it beyond summer and was crowded with pots hanging from iron hooks delectable smells of ham and beans corn and bread and cooking fruit mingled in the moist air noon meal in the making for the gang of hay cutters the farmwife folded back a cloth from a lumpy row on a side table fresh loaves from a workday that had doubtless started before dawn despite her nausea fawns mouth watered and she picked out a loaf that the woman told her was rolled inside with crystal honey and hickory nuts fawn fished out a coin wrapped the loaf in her kerchief and took it back outside the woman walked along with her the waters clean and free but you have to draw it yourself the woman told her as fawn tore off a corner of the loaf and nibbled ladles on the hook which way were you heading child to glassforge by yourself the woman frowned do you have people there yes fawn lied shame on them then word is theres a pack of robbers on the road near glassforge they shouldnt have sent you out by yourself south or north of town asked fawn in worry a ways south i heard but theres no saying theyll stay put im only going as far south as glassforge fawn set the bread on the bench beside her pack freed the latch for the crank and let the bucket fall till a splash echoed back up the wells cool stone sides then began turning robbers did not sound good still they were a frank hazard any fool would know enough not to go near them when fawn had started on this miserable journey six days ago she had cadged rides from wagons at every chance as soon as shed walked far enough from home not to risk encountering someone who knew her which had been fine until that one fellow whod said stupid things that made her very uncomfortable and followed up with a grab and a grope fawn had managed to break away and the man had not been willing to abandon his rig and restive team to chase her down but she might have been less lucky after that shed hidden discreetly in the verge from the occasional passing carts until she was sure there was a woman or a family aboard the few bites of bread were helping settle her stomach already she hoisted the bucket onto the bench and took the wooden dipper the woman handed down to her the water tasted of iron and old eggs but was clear and cold better she would rest a while on this bench in the shade and perhaps this afternoon she would make better time from the road to the north hoofbeats and a jingle of harness sounded no creak or rattle of wheels but quite a lot of hooves the farmwife glanced up her eyes narrowing and her hand rose to the cord on the bell clapper child she said see those old apple trees at the side of the yard why dont you just go skin up one and stay quiet till we see what this is eh fawn thought of several responses but settled on yesm she started across the yard turned back and grabbed her loaf then trotted to the small grove the closest tree had a set of boards nailed to the side like a ladder and she scrambled up quickly through branches thick with leaves and hard little green apples her dress was dyed dull blue her jacket brown she would blend with the shadows here as well as she had on the road verge likely she braced herself along a branch tucked in her pale hands and lowered her face shook her head and peered out through the cascade of black curls falling over her forehead the mob of riders turned into the yard and the farmwife came off her tense toes shoulders relaxing she released the bell cord there must have been a dozen and a half horses of many colors but all rangy and longlegged the riders wore mostly dark clothing had saddlebags and bedrolls tied behind their cantles andfawns breath caughtlong knives and swords hanging from their belts many also bore bows unstrung athwart their backs and quivers full of arrows no not all men a woman rode out of the pack slid from her horse and nodded to the farmwife she was dressed much as the rest in riding trousers and boots and a long leather vest and had irongray hair braided and tied in a tight knot at her nape the men wore their hair long too some braided back or tied in queues with decorations of glass beads or bright metal or colored threads twisted in some knotted tight and plain like the womans lakewalkers a whole patrol of them apparently fawn had seen their kind only once before when shed come with her parents and brothers to lumpton market to buy special seed glass jars rock oil and wax and dyes not a patrol that time but a clan of traders from the wilderness up around the dead lake who had brought fine furs and leathers and odd woodland produce and clever metalwork and more secret items medicines or maybe subtle poisons the lakewalkers were rumored to practice black sorcery other less unlikely rumors abounded lakewalker kinfolk did not settle in one place but moved about from camp to camp depending on the needs of the season no man among them owned his own land carefully parceling it out amongst his heirs but considered the vast wild tracts to be held in common by all his kin a man owned only the clothes he stood in his weapons and the catches of his hunts when they married a woman did not become mistress of her husbands house obliged to the care of his aging parents instead a man moved into the tents of his brides mother and became as a son to her family there were also whispers of strange bed customs among them which maddeningly no one would confide to fawn on one thing the folks were clear if you suffered an incursion by a blight bogle you called in the lakewalkers and you did not cheat them of their pay once they had removed the menace fawn was not entirely sure she believed in blight bogles for all the tall tales she had never encountered one in her life no nor known anyone else who had either they seemed like ghost stories got up to thrill the shrewd listeners and frighten the gullible ones she had been gulled by her snickering older brothers far too many times to rise readily to the bait anymore she froze again when she realized that one of the patrollers was walking toward her tree he looked different than the others and it took her a moment to realize that his dark hair was not long and neatly braided but cut short to an untidy tousle he was alarmingly tall though and very lean he yawned and stretched and something glinted on his left hand at first fawn thought it was a knife then realized with a slight chill that the man had no left hand the glint was from some sort of hook or clamp but how it was fastened to his wrist beneath his long sleeve she could not see to her dismay he ambled into the shade directly below her there to lower his long body prop his back comfortably against her tree trunk and close his eyes fawn jerked and nearly fell out of the tree when the farmwife reached up and rang her bell after all two loud clanks and three repeated evidently a signal or call not an alarm for she was talking all the time in an animated way with the patroller woman now that fawns eyes had time to sort them out in their strange garb she could see three or four more women among the men a couple of men busied themselves at the well hauling up the bucket to slosh the water into the wooden trough on the side opposite the bench others led their horses in turn to drink a boy loped around the outbuildings in answer to the bell and the farm wife sent him with several more of the patrollers into the barn two of the younger women followed the farmwife into her house and came out in a while with packets wrapped in clothmore of the good farm food obviously the others emerged from the barn lugging sacks of what fawn supposed must be grain for their horses they all met again by the well where a brief vigorous conversation ensued between the farmwife and the grayhaired patroller woman it ended with a counting over of sacks and packets in return for coins and some small items from the patroller saddlebags that fawn could not make out to the apparent satisfaction of both sides the patrol broke up into small groups to seek shade around the yard and share food the patrol leader walked over to fawns tree and sat down crosslegged beside the tall man you have the right idea dag a grunt if the man opened his eyes fawn could not tell her leafobstructed view was now of two ovals one smooth and gray the other ruffled and dark and a lot of booted leg stretched out so what did your old friend have to say asked the man his low voice sounded tired or maybe it was just naturally raspy malice confirmed or not rumors of bandits only so far but a lot of disappearances around glassforge with no bodies found mm here eat she handed him something ham wrapped in bread judging by the enticing aroma that rose to fawn the woman lowered her voice you feel anything yet you have better groundsense than i do he mumbled around a mouthful if you dont i surely wont experience dag ive been in on maybe nine kills in my life youve done whatfifteen twenty more but the rest were just little ones lucky finds lucky ha and little ones count just the same theyd have been big ones by the next year she took a bite of her own food chewed and sighed the children are excited noticed theyre going to start setting each other off if they get wound up much tighter a snort presumably of agreement the raspy voice grew suddenly urgent if we do find the malices lair put the youngsters to the back cant they need the experience just as we did a mutter some experiences no one needs the woman ignored this and said i thought id pair saun with you spare me unless im pulling camp guard duty again not this time the glassforge folk are offering a passel of men to help ah spare us all clumsy farmers worse than the children its their folk being lost theyve a right doubt they could even take out real bandits he added after a moment or they would have by now and after another if they are real bandits thought id stick the glassforgers with holding the horses mostly if it is a malice and if its grown as big as chato fears well need every pair of our hands to the front a short silence poor word choice mari buckets over there soak your head dag you know what i meant the right hand waved yeah yeah with an oof the woman rose to her feet eat thats an order if you like im not nervy nothe woman sighedno you are not that she strode off the man settled back again go away you fawn thought down at him resentfully i have to pee but in a few minutes just before she was driven by her bodys needs into entirely unwelcome bravery the man got up and wandered after the patrol leader his steps were unhurried but long and he was across the yard before the leader gave a vague wave of her hand and a side glance fawn could not see how it could be an order yet somehow everyone in the patrol was suddenly up and in motion saddlebags repacked girths tightened the whole lot of them were mounted and on their way in five minutes fawn slipped down the tree trunk and peered around it the onehanded manriding rear guardwas looking back over his shoulder she ducked out of sight again till the hoofbeats faded then unclutched the apple tree and went to seek the farmwife her pack she was relieved to see in passing lay untouched on the bench dag glanced back wondering anew about the little farm girl whod been hiding shyly up the apple tree there nowdown she slid but he still gained no clear look at her not that a few leaves and branches could hide a lifespark so bright from his groundsense at that range his minds eye sketched a picture of her tidy farm raided by a malices mudmen all its cheerful routine turned to ash and blood and charnel smoke or worseand not imagination but memory supplied the visiona ruination like the western levels beyond the gray river not six hundred miles west of here not so far away to him who had ridden or walked the distance a dozen times yet altogether beyond these local peoples horizons endless miles of open flat so devastated that even rocks could not hold their shape and slumped into gray dust to cross that vast blight leached the ground from ones body as a desert parched the mouth and it was just as potentially lethal to linger there a thousand years of sparse rains had only begun to sculpt the levels into something resembling a landscape again to see this farm girls green rolling lands laid low like that not if i can help it little spark he doubted they would meet again or that she would ever know what hermothersstrange customers today sought to do on her behalf and their own still he could not begrudge her his weariness in this endless task the country people who gained even a partial understanding of the methods called it black necromancy and sidled away from patrollers in the street but they accepted their gift of safety all the same so yet again one more time anew we will buy the death of this malice with one of our own but not more than one not if he could make it so dag clapped his heels to his horses sides and cantered after his patrol the farmwife watched thoughtfully as fawn packed up her bedroll straightened the straps and hitched it over her shoulder once more its near a days ride to glassforge from here she remarked longer walking youre like to be benighted on the road its all right said fawn ive not had trouble finding a place to sleep which was true enough it was easy to find a cranny to curl up in out of sight of the road and bedtime was a simple routine when all you did was spread a blanket and lie down unwashed and unbrushed in your clothes the only pests that had found her in the dark were the mosquitoes and ticks you could sleep in the barn start off early tomorrow shading her eyes the woman stared down the road where the patrollers had vanished a while ago id not charge you for it child her honest concern for fawns safety stood clear in her face fawn was torn between unjust anger and a desire to burst into tears equally uncomfortable lumps in her stomach and throat im not twelve woman she thought of saying so and more she had to start practicing it sooner or later im twenty im a widow the phrases did not rise readily to her lips as yet still the farmwifes offer beguiled her mind stay a day do a chore or two or six and show how useful she could be stay another day and another farms always needed more hands and fawn knew how to keep hers busy her first planned act when she reached glassforge was to look for work plenty of work right herefamiliar tasks not scary and strange but glassforge had been the goal of her imagination for weeks now it seemed like quitting to stop short and wouldnt a town offer better privacy not necessarily she realized with a sigh wherever she went folks would get to know her sooner or later maybe it was all the same no new horizons anywhere really she mustered her flagging determination thanks but im expected folkll worry if im late the woman gave a little headshake a combination of conceding the argument and farewell take care then she turned back to her house and her own onslaught of tasks duties that probably kept her running from before dawn to after dark a life i would have taken up except for sunny sawman fawn thought gloomily climbing back up to the straight road once more id have taken it up for the sake of sunny sawman and never thought of another well ive thought of another now and im not going to go and unthink it lets go see glassforge one more time she called up her wearied fury with sunny the low stupid nasty stupid fool and let it stiffen her spine nice to know he had a use after all of a sort she faced south and began marching chapter last years leaves were damp and black with rot underfoot and as dag climbed the steep slope in the dark his boot slid instantly a strong and anxious hand grasped his right arm do that again said dag in a level whisper and ill beat you senseless quit trying to protect me saun sorry saun whispered back releasing the death clutch after a momentary pause he added mari says she wont pair you with the girls anymore because youre overprotective dag swallowed a curse well that does not apply to you senseless and bloody he could feel sauns grin flash in the shadows of the woods they heaved themselves upward a few more yards finding handgrips among the rocks and roots and saplings stop dag breathed a nearly soundless query from his right well be up on them over this rise what you can see can see you and if theres anything over there with groundsense youll look like a torch in the trees stop it down boy a grunt of frustration but i cant see razi and utau i can barely see you youre like an ember under a handful of ash i can track razi and utau mari holds us all in her head you dont have to you only have to track me he slipped behind the youth and gripped his right shoulder massaging he wished he could do both sides together but this touch seemed to be enough the flaring tension started to go out of saun both body and mind down down thats right better and after a moment youre going to do just fine dag had no idea whether saun was going to do well or disastrously but saun evidently believed him with appalling earnestness the bright anxiety decreased still further besides dag added its not raining cant have a debacle without rain its obligatory in my experience so were good the humor was weak but under the circumstances worked well enough saun chuckled he released the youth and they continued their climb is the malice there muttered saun dag stopped again bending in the shadows to hook up a plant leftsided he held it under sauns nose see this sauns head jerked backward its poison ivy get it out of my face if we were this close to a malices lair not even the poison ivy would still be alive though i admit it would be among the last to go this isnt the lair then why are we here behind them dag could hear the men from glassforge topping the ridge and starting down into the ravine out of which he and the patrol were climbing second wave even saun didnt manage to make that much noise mari had better land her punches before their helpers closed the gap or there would be no surprise left chato thinks this robber troop has been infiltrated or worse suborned catch us a mudman itll lead us to its maker quick enough do mudmen have groundsense some malice ever catches one of us it takes everything groundsense methods and weapon skills locations of our camps likely the first human this one caught was a road robber trying to hide out in the hills which is why its doing what it is none of us have been reported missing so we still may have the edge a patroller doesnt let a malice take him alive if he can help it or his partner enough lessons for one night climb on the ridgetop they crouched low smoothly saun strung his bow less smoothly but just as quickly dag unshipped and strung his shorter adapted one then swapped out the hook screwed into the wooden cuff strapped to the stump of his left wrist and swapped in the bowrest he seated it good and tight clamped the lock and dropped the hook into the pouch on his belt undid the guard strap on his sheath and made sure the big knife would draw smoothly it was all scarcely more awkward than carrying the bow in his hand had once been and at least he couldnt drop it at the bottom of the dell dag could see the clearing through the trees three or four campfires burning low tents and an old cabin with half its roof tumbled in lumps of sleeping men in bedrolls like scratchy burrs touching his groundsense the faint flares of a guard awake in the woods beyond and someone stumbling back from the slit trenches the sleepy smudges of a few horses tethered beyond words of the bodys senses for something his eyes did not see nor hand touch maybe twentyfive men altogether against the patrols sixteen and the score or so of volunteers from glassforge he began to sort through the lifeprickles looking for things shaped like men that werent the night sounds of the woods carried on the croak of tree frogs the chirp of crickets the sawing of less identifiable insects an occasional tiny rustle in the weeds anything bigger might have been either scared off by the noise of the camp below or depending on how the robbers buried their scraps attracted dag felt around with his groundsense beyond the tightening perimeter of the patrol but found no nervous scavengers then too soon a startled yell from his far right partway around the patroller circle grunts cries the ring of metal on metal the camp stirred thats it in we go closer snapped dag to saun and led a slide downslope to shorten their range by the time hed closed the distance to a bare twenty paces and found a gap in the trees through which to shoot the targets were obligingly rising to their feet from even farther to his right a flaming arrow arced high and came down on a tent in a few minutes he might even be able to see what he was shooting at dag let both fear and hope fade from his mind together with worries about the inner nature of what they faced it was just targets one at a time that one and that one and in that confusion of flickering shadows dag loosed another shaft and was rewarded by a distant yelp he had no idea what hed hit or where but it would be moving slower now he paused to observe and was satisfied when sauns next shaft also vanished into the black dark beyond the cabin and returned a meaty thunk they could hear all the way up here all around in the woods the patrol was igniting with excitement his head would be as full of them as maris was in a moment if they didnt all get a grip on themselves the advantage of twenty paces was that it was a nice short snappy range to shoot from the disadvantage was how little time it took your targets to run up on your position dag cursed as three or four large shapes came crashing through the dark at them he let his bow arm pivot down and yanked out his knife glancing right he saw saun pull his long sword swing and make the discovery that a blade length that gave great advantage from horseback was awkwardly constrained in a closegrown woods you cant lop heads here dag yelled over his shoulder go to thrusts he grunted as he folded in his bowarm and shoved his left shoulder into the nearest attacker knocking the man back down the hillside he caught a blade that came out of seemingnowhere on the brass of his hilt and with a shuddering scrape closed in along it for a wellplaced knee to a target groin these men might have fancied themselves bandits but they still fought like farmers saun raised a leg and booted his blade free of a target the mans cry choked in his throat and the withdrawing steel made an ugly sucking noise saun followed dag at a run toward the bandit camp razi and utau to their right and left paced them closing in tight as they all descended stooping like hawks in the clearing saun devolved to his favorite powerful swings again which worked spectacularly bloodily when they connected and left him wide open when they didnt a target succeeded in ducking then came up swinging a longhandled ironheaded sledgehammer the breakingpumpkin sound when it hit sauns chest made dags stomach heave dag leaped inside the targets lethal radius clutched him tightly around the back with his bowarm and brought his knife up hard wet horrors spilled over his hand and he twisted the knife and shoved the target off it saun lay on his back writhing his face darkening utau cover us dag yelled utau gasping for breath nodded and took up a protective stance blade ready dag slid down to sauns side snapped off his bow lock and dropped it and raised sauns head to his lap letting his right hand slide over the strike zone broken ribs and shattered breathing heart shocked still dag let his groundsense nearly extinguished so as to block his targets agony come up fully then flow into the boy the pain was immense heart first he concentrated himself there a dangerous unity if the yoked organs both chose to stop instead of start a burning lumping sensation in his own chest mirrored the boys come on saun dance with me a flutter a stutter a bruised limping stronger now the lungs one breath two three and the chest rose again then again and finally steadied in synchrony good yes heart and lungs would continue on their own the stunning reverberation of sauns targets ill fates still sloshed through the boys system insufficiently blocked mari would have some work there later i hate fighting humans regretfully dag let the pain flow back to its source the boy would be walking bent over for a month but he would live the world returned to his senses around the clearing bandits were starting to surrender as the yelling glassforge men arrived and broke from the woods dag grabbed up his bow and rose to his feet looking around beyond the burning tent he spotted mari dag her mouth moved but the cry was lost in the noise she raised two fingers pointed beyond the clearing on the opposite side and snapped them down against her armguard dags head swiveled two bandits had dodged through the perimeter and were running away dag waved his bow in acknowledgment and cried to his left linker utau take saun utau signaled his receipt of dags injured partner dag turned to give chase trying to reaffix the bow to its clamp as he ran by the time hed succeeded he was well beyond the light from the fires closer the horse nearly ran him down he leaped away barely before he could be knocked aside the fugitives were riding double a big man in front and a huge one behind no that second one wasnt a man dizzied with excitement the chase and the aftershock of sauns injury dag bent a moment gasping for control of his own breathing his hand rose to check the twin knife sheath hung under his shirt a reassuring lump against his chest dark warm mortal hum mudman we have you you and your maker are ours he despised tracking from horseback but he wasnt going to catch them on foot not even with that dual burden he calmed himself again down down ours down curse it and summoned his horse it would take copperhead several minutes to blunder through the woods from the patrols hidden assembly point he knelt and removed his bow again unstrung and stored it and fumbled out the most useful of his hand replacements a simple hook with a flat tongue of springy steel set against its outside curve to act as a sometimespincer tapping out a resinsoaked stick from the tin case in his vest pocket he set it in the pinch of the spring and persuaded it to ignite as the flare burned down to its end he shuffled back and forth studying the hoofprints when he was sure he could recognize them again he pushed to his feet his quarry had nearly passed the limit of his groundsense by the time his mount arrived snorting and dag swung aboard where one horse went another could follow right he kicked copperhead after them at a speed that would have had mari swearing at him for risking his fool neck in the dark mine fawn plodded now that she was finally coming out of the flats into the southeastern hills the straight road was not as level as it had run since lumpton nor as straight its gentle slopes and curves were interspersed with odd climbs up through narrow choked ravines that slashed through the rock or down to timber bridges replacing shattered stone spans that lay like old bones between one impossible jumpingoff point and another the track dodged awkwardly around old rockfalls or wet its feet and hers in fords fawn wondered when she would finally reach glassforge it couldnt be too much farther for all that she had made a slow start this dawn the last of the good bread had stayed down at least the day threatened to grow hot and sticky later here the road was pleasantly shaded with woods crowding up to both sides so far this morning she had passed a farm cart a pack train of mules and a small flock of sheep all going the other way shed encountered nothing else for nearly an hour now she raised her head to see a horse coming toward her down the road a piece also going the wrong way unfortunately as it neared she stepped aside not only headed north but also already doubleloaded bareback the animal was plodding almost as wearily as fawn its unbrushed dun hair smeared with salty crusts of dried sweat burrs matting its black mane and tail the riders seemed as tired and ill kept as the horse a big fellow looking not much older than her actual age rode in front all rumpled jacket and stubbled chin behind him his bigger companion clung on the second man had lumpy features and long untrimmed nails so crusted with dirt as to look black and a blank expression his toosmall clothes seemed an afterthought a ragged shirt hanging open with sleeves rolled up trousers that did not reach his boot tops his age was hard to guess fawn wondered if he was a simpleton they both looked as though they were making their way home from a night of drinking or worse the young man bore a big hunting knife though the other seemed weaponless fawn marched past with the briefest nod making no greeting to them though out of the corner of her eye she could see both their heads turn she walked on not looking back the receding rhythm of hoofbeats stopped she dared a glance over her shoulder the two men seemed to be arguing in voices too hushed and rumbling for her to make out the words except a reiterated master want in rising urgent tones from the simpleton and a sharp aggravated why from the other she lowered her face and walked faster the hoofbeats started again but instead of fading into the distance grew louder the animal loomed alongside morning the younger man called down in a wouldbe cheerful tone fawn glanced up he tugged his dirty blond hair at her politely but his smile did not reach his eyes the simpleton just stared tensely at her fawn combined a civil nod with a repelling frown starting to think please let there be a cart cows other riders anything i dont care which direction going to glassforge he inquired im expected fawn returned shortly go away just turn around and go away family there yes she considered inventing some large glassforge brothers and uncles or just relocating the real ones the plague of her life she almost wished for them now the simpleton thumped his friend on the shoulder scowling no talk just take his voice came out smeared as though his mouth was the wrong shape inside a manure wagon would he just lovely one with a lot of people on board preferably you do it then snapped the young man the simpleton shrugged braced his hands and slid himself off right over the horses rump he landed more neatly than fawn would have expected she lengthened her stride then as he came around the horse toward her she broke into a dead run looking around frantically the trees were no help anything she could climb he could too to get out of sight long enough to hide in the woods she had to outpace her pursuer by an impossible margin might she stay ahead until a miracle occurred such as someone riding around that long curve up ahead he moved faster than she would have guessed for a man that size too before her third breath or step huge hands clamped around her upper arms and lifted her right off her pumping feet at this range she could see that their nails were not just dirty but utterly black like claws they bit through her jacket as he swung her around she yelled as loud as she could let go of me let go followed up with throatsearing screams she kicked and struggled with all her strength it was like fighting an oak tree for all the result she got well now youve got her all riled up said the young man in disgust he too slid off the horse stared a moment and pulled off the rope holding up his trousers well have to tie her hands unless you want your eyes clawed out good idea fawn tried useless the simpletons hands remained clamped on her wrists yanked high over her head she writhed around and bit a bare hairy arm the huge mans skin had a most peculiar smell and taste like cat fur not as foul as she would have expected her satisfaction at drawing blood was shortlived as he spun her around and still without visible emotion fetched her an openhanded slap across the face that snapped her head back and dropped her to the road blackandpurple shadows boiling up in her vision her ears were still ringing when she was jerked upright and tied then lifted the simpleton handed her up to the young man now back aboard his horse he shoved at her skirts and set her upright in front of him both hands clamped around her waist the horses sweaty barrel was warm under her legs the simpleton took the reins to lead them and started walking once more faster there thats better said the man who held her his sour breath wafting past her ear sorry he hit you but you shouldnt have run from him come on along youll have more fun with me one hand wandered up and squeezed her breast huh riper than i thought fawn gasping for air and still shuddering with shock licked at a wet trickle from her nose was it tears or blood or both she pulled surreptitiously at the rope around her wrists uncomfortably binding her hands the knots seemed very tight she considered more screaming no they might hit her again or gag her better to pretend to be stunned and then if they passed anyone within shouting distance shed still have command of her voice and her legs this hopeful plan lasted all of ten minutes when before anyone else hove into sight they turned right off the road onto a hidden path the young mans clutch had turned into an almost lazy embrace and his hands wandered up and down her torso as they started up a slope he hitched forward as she slid backward shoved her bedroll out of the way and held her backside more tightly against his front letting the horses movement rub them together as much as this flagrant interest frightened her she wasnt sure but what the simpletons indifference frightened her more the young man was being nasty in predictable ways the other she had no idea what he was thinking if anything well if this is going where it looks at least they cant make me pregnant thank you stupid sunny sawman as bright sides went that one stank like a cesspit but she had to allow the point she hated her bodys trembling signaling her fear to her captor but she could not stop it the simpleton led them deeper into the woods dag stood in his stirrups when the distant yelling echoed through the trees from the broad ravine so high and fierce that he could barely distinguish words let go he kicked his horse into a trot ignoring the branches that swiped and scratched them both the strange marks hed read in the road a couple of miles back suddenly grew a lot more worrisome hed been trailing his quarry at the outermost edge of his groundsense for hours now while the nights exhaustion crept up on his body and wits hoping that they were leading him to the malices lair his suspicion that a new concern had been added to his pack chilled his belly as the outraged cries continued he popped over a rise and took a fast shortcut down an erosion gully with his horse nearly sliding on its haunches his quarry came into sight at last in a small clearing what he snapped his jaw shut and cantered forward heedless of his own noise how pulled up at ten paces flung himself off let his hand go through the steps of stringing and mounting and locking his bow without conscious thought it was abundantly clear that he wasnt interrupting someones tryst the kneeling mudman blankfaced was holding down the shoulders of a struggling figure who was obscured by his comrade the other man was trying simultaneously to pull down his trousers and part the legs of the captive who was kicking valiantly at him he cursed as a small foot connected hold her no time to stop grumbled the mudman need to go on no time for this it wont take long if you just hold her still he finally managed to shove his hips inside the angle of the kicks absent gods was that a child they were pinning to the dirt dags groundsense threatened to boil over distracted or no the mudman must notice him soon even if the other had his backside turned the middle figure surged upward briefly face flushed and black curls flying dress pulled halfdown as well as shoved halfup a flash of sweet breasts like apples smote dags eyes oh that short rounded form was no child after all but outweighed like one nonetheless dag quelled his fury and drew those heaving mooncolored buttocks had to be the most righteous target ever presented to his aim and for once in his accursed life it seemed he was not too late he considered this marvel for the whole moment it took to adjust his tension to be sure the arrow would not go through and into the girl woman whatever she was release he was reaching for another shaft before the first found its mark the perfection of the thunk square in the middle of the left cheek was even more satisfying than the surprised scream that followed the bandit bucked and rolled off the girl howling and trying to reach around himself twisting from side to side now the danger was not halved but doubled the mudman stood abruptly seeing dag at last and dragged the girl up in front of his torso as a shield his height and her shortness thwarted his intent dag sent his next shaft toward the creatures calf it was a glancing hit but stung the mudman leaped did this one have enough wits to threaten his prisoner in order to stop dag dag didnt wait to find out lips drawn back in a fierce grin he drew his war knife and pelted forward death was in his stride the mudman saw it fear flashed in that sullen lumpy face with a panicked heave he tossed the crying girl toward dag turned and fled bow still encumbering his left arm the knife in his right hand dag had no way to catch her the best he could do was fling his arms wide so that she wasnt stabbed or battered he lost his skidding balance on her impact and they both went down in a tangle for a moment she was on top of him her breath knocked out her bodys softness squashed onto his she inhaled made a strained squeaking noise yanked herself up and began clawing at his face he tried to get out words to calm her but she wouldnt let him finally he was forced to let go of his weapon and just fling her off with two live enemies still on the ground he would have to deal with her next he rolled away snatched up his knife again and surged to his feet the mudman had scrambled back up on the bandits horse he yanked the beasts head around and tried to ride dag down dag dodged started to flip his knife around for a throw thought better of it dropped it again reached back to his nowtwistedaround quiver and drew one of his few remaining arrows nocked aimed no let the creature keep running back to the lair dag could pick up those tracks again if he had to one wounded prisoner would test the limits of what he could handle right now a prisoner who was most definitely going to be made to talk the horse vanished up the faint trail leading out of the clearing that paralleled the course of a nearby creek dag lowered the bow and looked around the human bandit too had disappeared but for once tracking was not going to be any trouble dag pointed to the girl now standing up a few yards away and struggling to readjust her torn blue dress stay there he followed the blood trail past a screen of saplings and brush lining the clearing the splashes grew heavier by the boulders of the creek a figure lay prone and silent in a red puddle trousers about his knees dags arrow clutched in his hand too still dag set his teeth the man had evidently tried to drag the maddening shaft out of his flesh by main force and must have ripped open an artery doing so that wasnt a killing shot blight it wasnt supposed to be good intentions where have we met before dag balanced himself and shoved the body over with one foot the pale unshaven face looked terribly young in death even shadowed as it was by dirt no answers now to be squeezed from this one he had reached the last of all betrayals absent gods more children is there no end to them dag muttered he looked up to see the womanchild standing a few paces back along the blood trail staring at them both her eyes were huge and brown like a terrified deers at least she wasnt screaming anymore she frowned down at her late assailant and an unvoiced oh ghosted from her tender bitten lips a livid bruise was starting up one side of her face scored with four parallel red gouges hes dead unfortunately and unnecessarily if hed just lain still and waited for help id have taken him prisoner she looked him up and up and down fearfully the top of her dark head were they standing closer would come just about to the middle of his chest dag judged selfconsciously he tucked his bowhand down by his side half out of sight around his thigh and sheathed his knife i know who you are she said suddenly youre that lakewalker patroller i saw at the wellhouse dag blinked and blinked again and let his groundsense shielded from the shock of this death come up again she blazed in his perceptions little spark what are you doing so far from your farm chapter the tall patroller was staring at fawn as though he recognized her she wrinkled her nose in confusion not following his words from this angle and distance she could at last see the color of his eyes which were an unexpected metallic gold they seemed very bright in his bony face against weathered skin tanned to a dark coppery sheen on his face and hand several sets of scratches scored his cheeks and forehead and jaw most just red but some bleeding i did that oh dear beyond the body of her wouldbe ravisher lay on the smoothed stones of the creek bank some of his stillwet blood trickled into the creek to swirl away in the clear water in faint red threads dissipating to pink and then gone he had been so hotly heavily frighteningly alive just minutes ago when she had wished him dead now she had her wish she was not so sure i it she began waving an uncertain hand at well everything then blurted im sorry i scratched you up i didnt understand what was coming at me then added you scared me i think ive lost my wits a hesitant smile turned the patrollers lips making him look for a moment like someone altogether else not so looming i was trying to scare the other fellow it worked she allowed and the smile firmed briefly before fleeing again he felt his face glanced at the red smears on his fingertips as if surprised then shrugged and looked back at her the weight of his attention was startling to her as though no one in her life had ever looked at her before really looked in her present shaky state it was not a comfortable sensation are you all right otherwise he asked gravely his right hand made an inquiring jerk the other he still held down by his side the short powerfullooking bow cocked at an angle out of the way by his leg aside from your face my face her quivering fingertips probed where the simpleton had struck her still a little numb but starting to ache does it show he nodded oh those gouges dont look so good i have some things in my saddlebags to clean them up come away here come sit down um away from that she eyed the corpse and swallowed all right and added im all right ill stop shaking in a minute sure stupid of me with his open hand not coming within three feet of her he herded her back toward the clearing like someone shooing ducks he pointed to a big fallen log a way apart from the scuffed spot of her recent struggle and walked to his horse a rangy chestnut calmly browsing in the weeds trailing its reins she plunked down heavily and sat bent over arms wrapped around herself rocking a little her throat was raw her stomach hurt and though she wasnt gasping anymore it still felt as though she couldnt get her breath back or that it had returned badly out of rhythm the patroller carefully turned his back to fawn did something to dismantle his bow and rummaged in his saddlebag more adjustments of some sort he turned again shrugging the strap of a water bottle over one shoulder and with a couple of clothwrapped packets tucked under his left arm fawn blinked because he seemed to have suddenly regained a left hand stiffly curved in a leather glove he lowered himself beside her with a tiredsounding grunt and arranged those legs at this range he smelled not altogether unpleasantly of dried sweat woodsmoke horse and fatigue he laid out the packets and handed her the bottle drink first she nodded the water was flat and tepid but seemed clean eat he held out a piece of bread fished from the one cloth i couldnt no really itll give your body something to do besides shake very distractible that way bodies try it doubtfully she took it and nibbled it was very good bread if a little dry by now and she thought she recognized its source she had to take another sip of water to force it down but her uncontrolled trembling grew less she peeked at his stiff left hand as he opened the second cloth and decided it must be carved of wood for show he wetted a bit of cloth with something from a small bottlelakewalker medicineand raised his right hand to her aching left cheek she flinched although the cool liquid did not sting sorry dont want to leave those dirty no yes i mean right its all right i think the simpleton clawed me when he hit me claws those had been claws not nails what kind of monstrous birth his lips thinned but his touch remained firm im sorry i didnt come up on you sooner miss i could see something had happened back on the road there id been trailing those two all night my patrol seized their gangs camp a couple of hours after midnight up in the hills on the other side of glassforge im afraid i flushed them right into you she shook her head not in denial i was walking down the road they just picked me up like youd pick up a lost thing and claim it was yours her frown deepened no not just they argued first strange the one who was um the one you shot he didnt want to take me along at first it was the other one who insisted but he wasnt interested in me at all later whenjust before you came and added under her breath not expecting an answer what was he raccoon is my best guess said the patroller he turned the cloth hiding browning blood and wet it again moving down her cheek to the next gash this bizarre answer seemed so entirely unrelated to her question that she decided he must not have heard her aright no i mean the big fellow who hit me the one who ran away from you he didnt seem right in the head truer than you guess miss ive been hunting those creatures all my life you get so you can tell he was a made thing confirms that a maliceyour folk would call it a blight boglehas emerged near here the malice makes slaves of human shape for itself to fight or do its dirty work other shapes too sometimes mudmen we call them but the malice cant make them up out of nothing so it catches animals and reshapes them crudely at first till it grows stronger and smarter cant make life at all really only death its slaves dont last too long but it hardly cares was he gulling her like her brothers seeing how much a silly little farm girl could be made to swallow down whole he seemed perfectly serious but maybe he was just especially good at tall tales are you saying that blight bogles are real it was his turn to look surprised where are you from miss he asked in renewed caution she started to name the village nearest her familys farm but changed it to lumpton market it was a bigger town more anonymous she straightened trying to marshal the casual phrase im a widow and push it past her bruised lips whats your name fawn saw field she added and flinched shed wanted neither sunnys name nor her own familys and now shed stuck herself with some of both fawn apt said the patroller with a sideways tilt of his head you must have had those eyes from birth it was that uncomfortable weighty attention again she tried shoving back whats yours though she thought she already knew i answer to dag she waited a moment isnt there any more he shrugged i have a tent name a camp name and a hinterland name but dag is easier to shout the smile glimmered by again short is better in the field dag duck see if it were any longer it might be too late ah thats better she realized shed smiled back she didnt know if it was his talk or his bread or just the sitting down quietly but her stomach had finally stopped shuddering she was left hot and tired and drained he restoppered his bottle shouldnt you use that too she asked oh yeah cursorily he turned the cloth again and swiped it over his face he missed about half the marks why did you call me little spark when you were hiding above me in that apple tree yesterday thats how i thought of you i didnt think you could see me you never looked up you didnt act as though to wanted to be seen it only seemed polite he added i thought that pretty farm was your home it was pretty wasnt it but i only stopped there for water i was walking to glassforge from lumpton and points north yes he at least did not say anything about its a long way for such short legs he did say inevitably family there she almost said yes then realized he might possibly intend to take her there which could prove awkward no i was going there to look for work she straightened her spine im a grass widow a slow blink his face went blank for a rather long moment he finally said in an oddly cautious tone pardon missus but do you know what grass widow means a new widow she replied promptly then hesitated there was a woman came up from glassforge to our village once she took in sewing and made cord and netting she had the most beautiful little boy my uncles called her a grass widow another tooquiet pause thats right isnt it he scratched his rats nest of dark hair well yes and no its a farmer term for a woman pregnant or with a child in tow with no husband in sight anywhere its more polite than um less polite terms but its not altogether kind fawn flushed he said even more apologetically i didnt mean to embarrass you it just seemed i ought to check she swallowed thank you it seems i told the truth despite myself then and your little girl he said what said fawn sharply he motioned at her the one you bear now flat panic stopped her breath i dont show how can he know and how could he know in any case if the fruit of that really really illconsidered and now deeply regretted frantic fumble with sunny sawman at his sisters spring wedding party was going to be a boy or a girl anyhow he seemed to realize hed made some mistake but to be uncertain what it was his gesture wavered turning to openhanded earnestness it was what attracted the mudman your present state it was almost certainly why they grabbed you if the other assault seemed an afterthought it likely was how can youwhatwhy his lips parted for a moment then visibly he changed whatever hed been about to say to nothings going to happen to you now he packed up his cloths anyone else might have tied the corners together but he whipped a bit of cord around them that he somehow managed to wind into a pullknot onehanded he put his right hand on the log and shoved himself to his feet i either need to put that body up a tree or pile some rocks on it so the scavengers dont get to it before someone can pick it up he might have people he looked around vaguely then decide what to do with you put me back on the road or just point me to it i can find it he shook his head those might not be the only fugitives not all the bandits might have been in the camp we took or they might have had more than one hideout and the malice is still out there unless my patrol has got ahead of me which i dont think is possible my people were combing the hills to the south of glassforge and now i think the lairs northeast this is no good time or place for you especially to be wandering about on your own he bit his lip and went on almost as if talking to himself body can wait got to put you somewhere safe pick up the track again find the lair get back to my patrol quick as i can absent gods im tired mistake to sit down can you ride behind me do you think she almost missed the question in his mumble im tired too on your horse yes but good he went to his mount and caught up the reins but instead of coming back to her led it to the creek she trailed along again partly curious partly not wanting to let him out of her sight he evidently decided a tree would be faster for stowing his prey he tossed a rope up over the crotch of a big sycamore that overhung the creek using his horse to haul the body up it he climbed up to be sure the corpse was securely wedged and to retrieve his rope he moved so efficiently fawn could scarcely spot the extra motions and accommodations he made for his onehanded state dag pressed his tired horse over the last ridge and was rewarded on the other side by finding a doublerutted track bumping along the creek bottom ah good he said aloud its been a while since i patrolled down this way but i recall a goodsized farm tucked up at the head of this valley the girl clinging behind his cantle remained too quiet the same wary silence shed maintained since hed discussed her pregnant state his groundsense extended to utmost sensitivity in search for hidden threats was battered by her nearby churning emotions but the thoughts that drove them remained as ever opaque he had maybe been too indiscreet farmers who found out much about lakewalker groundsense tended to call it the evil eye or black magic and accuse patrollers of mind reading cheating in trade or worse it was always trouble if he found enough people at this farm he would leave her in their care with strong warnings about the halfhunthalfwar presently going on in their hills if there werent enough he must try to persuade them to light out for glassforge or some other spot where they might find safety in numbers till this malice was taught mortality if he knew farmers they wouldnt want to go and he sighed in anticipation of a dreary and thankless argument but the mere thought of a pregnant woman of any height or age wandering about in blithe ignorance anywhere near a malices lair gave him gruesome horrors no wonder shed shone so brightly in his groundsense with so much life happening in her although he suspected fawn would have been scarcely less vivid even before this conception but she would attract a malices attention the way a fire drew moths by the time theyd straightened out the definition of grass widow he had been fairly sure he had no need to offer her condolences farmer bed customs made very little sense sometimes unless one believed maris theories about their childbearing being all mixed up with their pretense of owning land she had some very tart remarks on farmer womens lack of control of their own fertility as well generally in conjunction with lectures to young patrollers of both sexes about the need to keep their trousers buttoned while in farmer territory old patrollers too details of a dead husband had been conspicuously absent in fawns speech dag could understand grief robbing someone of words but grief too seemed missing in her anger fear tense determination yes shock from the recent terrifying attack upon her loneliness and homesickness but not the anguish of a soul ripped in half strangely lacking too was the profound satisfaction such lifegiving usually engendered among lakewalker women hed known farmers feh dag knew why his own people were all a little crazed but what excuse did farmers have he was roused from his weary brooding as they passed out of the woods and the valley farm came into sight he was instantly ill at ease the lack of cows and horses and goats and sheep struck him first then the brokendown places in the splitrail fence lining the pasture then the absence of farm dogs who should have been barking annoyingly around his horse by now he stood in his stirrups as they plodded up the lane house and barn both built of weathered gray planks were standingand standing openbut smoke rose in a thin trickle from the char and ashes of an outbuilding what is it asked fawn the first words shed spoken for an hour trouble i think he added after a moment trouble past nothing human flared in the range of dags perceptionsnor anything nonhuman either the place is completely deserted he pulled up his horse in front of the house swung his leg over its neck and jumped down move up take the reins he told fawn dont get down yet she scrambled forward from her perch on his saddlebags staring around wideeyed what about you going to scout around he made a quick pass through the house a rambling twostory structure with additions built on to additions the place seemed stripped of small objects of any value items too big to carrybeds clothes chestswere frequently knocked over or split every glass window was broken out senselessly dag had an idea how hard those improvements had been to come by carefully saved for by some hopeful farmwife packed in straw up from glassforge over the rutted lanes the kitchen pantry was stripped of food the barn was empty of animals hay was left some grain might be gone behind the barn on the manure pile he at last found the bodies of three farm dogs slashed and hacked about he eyed the smoldering outbuilding in passing charred timbers sticking out of the ash like black bones someone would need to look through it for other bones later he returned to his horse fawn was gazing around warily as she took in the disturbing details dag leaned against copperheads warm shoulder and swiped his hand through his hair the place was raided by the banditsor someoneabout three days ago i judge he told her no bodies thats goodyes she said dark eyes growing unsure at whatever expression was leaking onto his features he couldnt think that it was anything but exhaustion maybe but if the people had run away or been run off news of this should have reached glassforge by now my patrol had no such word as of yesterday evening where did they all go then she asked taken im afraid if this malice is trying to take farmer slaves already its growing fast whatslaves for what not sure the malice even knows yet its a sort of instinct with malices itll figure it out fast enough though im running out of time he was growing dizzy with fatigue was he also growing stupid with fatigue he continued id give almost anything for two hours of sleep right now except two hours of light i need to get back to the trail while i still have daylight to see it i think his voice slowed i think this place is as safe as any and safer than most theyve hit it once its already stripped of everything valuablethey wont be back too soon im thinking maybe i could leave you here anyway if anyone comes you can tell themno first if anyone comes hide till you are sure theyre allright folks then come out and tell them dag has a message for his patrol he thinks the malice is holed up northeast of town not south if patrollers come do you think you could show them to where the tracks led off and that boysbanditsbody he added in afterthought she squinted at the wooded hills im not sure i could find my way back to it the route you took theres an easier way this lanehe waved at the track theyd ridden upgoes back to the straight road in about four miles turn left and i think the path your mudman took east from it is about three miles on oh she said more eagerly i could find that sure good then she had no fear blast and blight it he could change that so did he want her to be terrified out of her mind frozen witless she was already sliding down off the horse looking pleased to have a task within her capacity whats so dangerous about the mudmen she asked as he gathered his reins and prepared to mount once more he hesitated a long moment theyll eat you he said at last after everything else is all over that is oh subdued and impressed and more important believing him well it hadnt been a lie maybe it would make her just cautious enough he found his stirrup and pushed up trying not to dwell on the contrast between this hard saddle and a feather bed there had been one unslashed feather mattress left inside the farmhouse hed noticed it particularly while shoving aside a little fantasy about falling into it facefirst he swung his horse around dag he turned at once to look over his shoulder big brown eyes stared up at him from a face like a bruised flower dont let them eat you either involuntarily his lips turned up she smiled brightly back through her darkening contusions it gave him an odd feeling in his stomach which he prudently did not attempt to name heartened despite all he raised his carved hand in salute and cantered back down the lane feeling bereft fawn watched the patroller vanish into the tunnel of trees at the edge of the fields the silence of this homestead stripped of animals and people was eerie and oppressive once she noticed it she squinted upward the sun had not even topped the arch of the sky for noon it seemed years since dawn she sighed and ventured into the house she walked all around it footsteps echoing feeling as though she intruded on some strangers grief the senseless mess the raiders had left in their wake seemed overwhelming taken in all at once she came back to the kitchen and stood there shivering a little well if the house was too much what about one room i could fix one room yes she braced herself and started by turning back upright anything that would still stand shelf and table and a couple of chairs what was broken beyond mending she hauled outside starting a pile at one end of the porch then she swept the floor clear of broken plates and glass and spilled flour and drying food she swept the porch too while she was at it beneath a worn old rag rug ignored by the invaders she found a trapdoor with a rope handle she shook the rug over the porch rail returned and stared worriedly at the trap i dont think dag saw this she bit her lip then took a bucket with a broken handle outside and collected a few live coals from the stillsmoldering whateverithadbeen and started a little fire in the kitchen hearth from it she lit a candle stub found in the back of a drawer she pulled up the trapdoor by its rope wincing at the groaning of its hinges swallowed and stared at the ladder into the dark hole could there be anyone still hiding down there big spiders bodies she took a deep breath and descended when she turned and held up the candle her lips parted in astonishment the cellar was lined with shelves and on them untouched were row upon row of glass jars many sealed with hot rock wax and covered with cloth bound with twine food storage for a farm full of hungry people a year of labor lined upfawn knew exactly how much work too as preserving boiled foodstuffs under wax seals had been one of her most satisfying tasks back home none of the jars were labeled but her eye had no trouble picking out and identifying the contents fruit preserves vinegar pickles corn relish stew meat a barrel in the corner proved to hold several sacks of flour another held last years apples packed in straw terribly wrinkly and by now only suitable for cooking but not rotted she was stirred to enthusiasm and action most of the jars were big meant for a crowd but she found three smaller ones of dark purple fruit corn relish and what she trusted was stew meat and hauled them up into the light a kerchief full of flour as well a single iron pan which she found kicked into a corner under a fallen shelf was all that was left of the tools of this workplace but with a little ingenuity she soon had flatbread cooking in it over her fire the jar of meat proved to be probably pork cooked to flinders with onions and herbs which she heated up after shed freed the pan of her bread circles she caught up on days of scant rations then replete set aside portions made up for dag when he returned clearly judging from his lady patrol leader and his general build he was the sort of fellow you had to capture hogtie and make remember to eat was he just a goer or did he live too much inside his own head to notice his bodys needs and what all else was that head furnished with he seemed driven considering the almost casual physical courage hed displayed so far it was unsettling to consider what he might fear that pushed him along so unceasingly well if i were as tall as a tree maybe id be brave too a skinny tree upon consideration she wrapped the meat and the preserves in rolls of flatbread so that he might eat while riding because when he came back it was likely hed be in a hurry still if he came back he hadnt actually said the thought made a disappointed cold spot in her belly now youre being stupid stop it the cure for bad sad thoughts was busyness right enough but she was getting dreadfully tired in one of the other rooms she found an abandoned sewing basket also overlooked by the raiders probably because the mending that topped it looked like rags theyd entirely missed the valuable tools inside sharp scissors and good thimbles and a collection of fine iron needles were the blight boglesmalicesmudmen all men then did it make any mudwomen it seemed not she decided she would sew up some of the slashed feather ticks in payment for the food so it wouldnt feel so stolen sewing was not her best skill but straight seams would be simple enough and it would put an end to the messy desolate feather wrack drifting about the place she hauled the ticks out onto the porch for the light and so she could watch down the lane for a tallfor whoever needle and thread and fine repetitive work made a soothing rhythm under her hands in the quiet her mind circled back to this mornings terror dwelling on it started to make her feel sick and shaky again as an alternative she wrenched her thoughts to lakewalkers farmer to a lakewalker didnt mean someone who grew crops it meant anyone who wasnt a lakewalker townsmen rivermen miners millersbanditsevidently they were all farmers in dags eyes she wondered at the implications shed heard a story about a girl from over to coshoton who had been seduced by a passing lakewalker a trading man it was said she had run away north three times to lakewalker country after him and been brought back by his people then hanged herself in the woods a cautionary tale that fawn wondered what lesson you were supposed to draw from it well girls should stay away from lakewalkers was the one obviously intended but maybe the real one was if something doesnt work once dont just repeat it twice more try something else or dont give up so soon or stay out of the woods the nameless girl had died for thwarted love it was whispered but fawn wondered if it hadnt been for thwarted rage instead she had she admitted to herself had some such thoughts after that awful talk with stupid sunny but it wasnt that shed wanted to die it was that shed wanted to make him feel as bad as hed made her feel and it had been rather flattening to reflect that shed not be alive to properly enjoy her revenge and even more flattening to suspect hed get over any guilt pretty quick long before shed get over being dead in any case and shed done nothing that night after all and by the next day shed had other ideas so maybe the real lesson was wait till morning after breakfast she wondered if the hanged girl had been pregnant too then she wondered anew how the tall man had known seemingly just by looking at her with those eyes their shimmering gold by sudden turns cold as metal or warm as summer sorcerers huh dag didnt look like a sorcerer and what did sorcerers look like anyhow he looked like a very tired hunter who had been too long away from home hunting things that hunted him back a girl baby maybe he was just guessing fifty percent odds werent halfbad for appearing right later still it was an encouraging thought girls she knew a little boy however innocent might have reminded her too much of sunny she hadnt meant to be a mother so soon in her life at all but if she was going to be stuck with it she would very well try to be a good one she rubbed absently at her belly i will not betray you a bold promise how was she to keep a child safe when she couldnt even save herself also from now on i will be more careful anyone could make a mistake the trick was not to make the same one twice she eventually ran out of ripped fabric patience to brood and the will to stay awake her bruised face was throbbing she hauled the repaired ticks back inside and piled them four deep in a corner of the kitchen because the next room was still a disheartening mess and she hadnt the energy left to tackle it she fell gratefully onto the pile she had barely time to register the musty scent of them and reflect that they were overdue for an airing anyhow when her leaden eyes closed fawn woke to the sound of steps on the wooden porch dag back already it was still light how long had she slept blearily she pushed up eager to show him the overlooked treasures in the cellar and to hear what hed found only then did it register that there were too many heavy steps out there she should have been overlooked in the cellari could have thrown a couple of those mattresses down thereshe had just time to think what good is it to not to make the same mistakes twice when your new onesll kill you all the same before the three mudmen burst open the door chapter when the faint path he was following up into the hills turned into something more resembling a beaten trail dag decided it was time to get off it groundsense or common sense or sheer nerves he could not tell but he dismounted and led his horse aside into the woods to a small glade well out of sight and hearing of the track he hardly needed to lay on suggestions of notwanderingaway even copperhead with his rawhide endurance and his temper was so tired as to be stumbling but then so was dag feeling guilty he tied the reins up out of the way of front hooves but left the saddle on he hated to leave his mount so ill tended but if he came back in a tearing hurry there might be no time to fool with gear or to hesitate to ride the beast to death if needs drove hard enough tomorrow or the day after we shall all take a better rest one way or another he did not return to the trail itself but shadowed the track a dozen paces off in the undergrowth it was slow work ghosting like a deer each footfall carefully laid constantly alert not a mile farther on he was glad of his prudence freezing in a tangle of deadfall and wild grapevines as two figures came thumping openly along the path mudmen a fox and a rabbit at a guess and he hardly needed his inner senses to tell they were crude perhaps early efforts and marks of their animal origin still showed on their hides their ears their misshapen faces and noses it was highly tempting to try to do something with that combination awaken them to their true selves and let nature take its course but the attempt would cost him his cover perhaps open him to their master beyond this was no time for games regretfully he let them pass by grateful that their clumsy new forms included human limitations on their sense of smell in trade for human advantages of hands and speech he first knew he was drawing close to the lair by the absence of birds this is a day for absences he drew his groundsense in even more tightly as the first yellowing dying weeds began to rustle underfoot i wasnt expecting this till miles farther in the lair was much closer to the straight road than hed thought it could possibly be it was shockingly clever in a malice sosupposedlyyoung for it to send its first human gulls to take prey so far from its initial bastion how did we overlook this he knew how we are too few with too much ground to cover and never time enough widen the teeth of the sweeps speed the search and risk clues slipping past unobserved go slow and close and risk not getting to all the critical places in time well we found this one this is a success not a failure maybe by the time he reached a vantage he was crawling like a snail nearly on his belly scarcely daring to breathe every herb and weed around him was dead and brittle the soil beneath his knees was achingly sterile and his tightly furled groundsense shivered in the dry shock of the malices draining aura indeed its here at the bottom of a rocky ravine a creek wound from his right ran straight below him and curled away on his left not one living plant graced the cleft for as far as he could see in either direction although the dead bones of a few trees still stood up like sentinels a camp of sorts lay along the creek side three or four black campfire pits currently cold piles of stolen supplies scattered haphazardly about on the far side of the creek a couple of uneasy horses stood tied to dead trees real natural horses as far as dag could tell ill kept of course the space below might accommodate twentyfive or fifty men but it was nearly deserted at the moment exactly one mudman was asleep on a pile of rags like a nest dag wondered if any of the absent company might be men his patrol had captured last night which implied that the patrol might well arrive on its own at any time pleasant thought he did not allow himself to dwell on the hope partway up the other side of the ravine a shelf of overhanging rock created a cave perhaps sixty feet long and shielded in front by a smooth gray outcrop of stone pushing up almost to meet the overhang no telling from here how far back in it went paths ran out either end down to the creek and up over the rise behind the malice was inside at the moment so was it mobile yet or still sessile and if mobile had it undergone its first molt and if it hadnt how frantic would it be to gather the necessary human materials to achieve that a malices initial hatching body was even clumsier and cruder than a mudmans which generally seemed to irritate it dag opened his shirt and felt for his sharing knives he pulled the strap over his head and stared a moment at the twin sheaths the stitched leather was slick with wear and dark with old sweat he ran one finger over the threadwound hilts one blue one green drew and contemplated six inches of polished bone blade touched it to his lips it hummed with old mortality is this the day your death is redeemed kauneo my love i have borne it around my neck for so long as you willed so i do this was a vicious malice big and getting bigger fast it would nearly be worthy of her dag thought nearly he drew the second empty bone blade and laid the two back to back they come in pairs oh yes one for you and one for me he slipped them away again mari too bore sharing knives and so did utau and chato gifts of mortality from patrollers before them maris current set was a legacy from one of her sons he knew and as dear to her as these to dag the patrol was well supplied who used theirs on a malice was not normally a matter of drawing straws or heroics or honor whoever first could did any way they could as efficiently as possible it wasnt as though there wouldnt be another chance later dags ground was quivering at the drain from the malices presence an effect that would bleed over into his body if he lingered here much longer sensitive young patrollers were often so disturbed by their first encounter with a malices aura it took them weeks to recover dag had been one such once now go back to the horse and gallop like a madman to the rendezvous point yet there were so few creatures in the camp the opportunity beckoned for a so to speak singlehanded attempt down the ravine side fly across the creek up into that cave it could all be over in minutes in the time it took to bring the patrol up the malice too might draw in its reinforcements and where were they now doing what mischief turning the attack into a potentially costly fight just to regain a proximity he had right now dag thought of saun had he lived the night but with his groundsense thwarted dag couldnt see how many men or mudmen might be hidden in the cave with the malice if he went charging in there only to present his head to the enemy the difficulties his patrol must then face would grow vastly worse also i would be dead in a way he was glad that last prospect still had the power to disturb him at least some he lowered his face fought for control of his hastened breathing and prepared to withdraw his lips twisted mari will be so proud of me he started to push back from the edge of the ravine but then froze again down a path on the other side three mudmen appeared was that first one awhere had this malice found a wolf in these parts dag had thought the farmers had reduced wolf numbers in this region but then this range of rugged unplowable hills was a reservoir for all sorts of things as we see his eyes widened as he recognized the second in line the escaped raccoonman from this morning the third huger still must once have been a black bear a flash of familiar dull blue fabric over the giant bearmans shoulder stopped his breath little spark they found little spark how a more or less straight line over the hills to the valley farm from here was the short leg of a triangle he realized he had run two long legs to get from the farm back to where hed first lost the raccoonmans traces then work his way here they found her because they went looking i bet it accounted for the rest of this malices absent company like the two hed passed on the trail they had doubtless all been dispatched to comb the hills for the escaped prize and the malice and its mudmen already knew about the valley farm if theyd recently raided it must have known for a long time his respect for this ones wits notched up yet again for it to leave such a nearby tempting target alone unmolested and unalarmed for so long how much strength had it gained to dare to move openly now or had the arrival of chatos patrol stampeded it the blueclad figure hanging head down twitched and struggled beat the back of her captor with hard little fists to no visible effect except that the bearman shrugged her hips higher over his shoulder and took a firmer grip on her thighs she was alive conscious undoubtedly terrified not terrified enough but dag could make it up for her his mouth opened to silence his own speeding breathing and his heart hammered now the malice had just what it needed for its next molt dag had only to deliver to it a lakewalker patrollerand one so experienced toofor its dessert and its powers would be complete he wasnt sure if he was shivering with indecision or just fear fear he decided yes he could run back to the patrol and bring them on in force by the tested rules be sure because the lakewalkers had to win every time but fawn might be dead by the time they got back or in minutes the three mudmen vanished behind the occluding rock wall so at least three in there of there could be ten to get in and out of that cave no he only had to get in he didnt know why his brain was still madly trying to calculate risks because his hand was already moving dropping bow and quiver and excess gear positioning his sharingknife sheaths swapping out the springhook on his wooden wrist cap for the steel knife testing the draw of his war knife he rose and dropped down over the side of the ravine sliding from rock to rill as silently as a serpent it had all happened so fast fawn hung head down dizzy and nauseated she wondered if the blow shed taken on the other side of her face would bruise to match the first the mudmans broad shoulder seemed to punch her stomach as it jogged along endlessly without stopping even when shed been violently sick down its back twice when dag came back to the valley farmif dag came back to the valley farmwould he be able to read the events from the mess her fight had left in the kitchen he was a tracker surely hed have to notice the footprints in plum jam she had forced her captors to smear across the floor as theyd lunged after her but it seemed far too much to expect the man to rescue her twice in one day downright embarrassing even imagining the indignity she tried one more time to break from the huge mudmans clutch beating its back with her fists she might have been pounding sand for all the difference it made she should save her strength for a better chance what strength what chance the hot level sunlight of the summer evening gave way abruptly to gray shadow and the cool smell of dirt and rock as her captor swung her down and upright she had a giddy impression of a cave or hollow halffilled with piles of trash or war supplies it was hard to tell she fought back the black shadows that swarmed over her vision and stood upright blinking two more of the animalmen rose as if to greet her three escorts she wondered if they were all about to fall on her and tear her up like a pack of dogs devouring a rabbit although she wasnt entirely sure but what that shorter one on the end might have been a rabbit once the voice said bring her here the words were more clearly spoken than the mudmens mumblings but the undertones made her bones feel as though they were melting she suddenly could not force her trembling face to turn toward the source of that appalling sound it seemed to flay the wits right out of her mind please let me go please let me go let me go letmego the bearman clutched her shoulders and half dragged half lifted her to the back of the cave a long shallow gouge in the hillside and turned her facetoface with the source of the voice it might have been a mudman if bigger taller broader its shape was human enough a head with two eyes nose mouth earsbroad torso two arms two legs but its skin was not even like an animals let alone a humans it made her think of lizards and insects and rock dust plastered together with bird lime it was hairless the naked skull was faintly crested it was quite unclothed and seemingly unconscious of the fact the strange lumps at its crotch didnt look like a mans genitals or a womans either it didnt move right as though it were a childs bad clay sculpture given motion and not a breathing creature of bone and sinew and muscle the mudmen had animal eyes in human faces and seemed unspeakably dangerous this had human eyes in the face of a nightmare no no nightmare she had ever dreamed or imaginedone of dags maybe trapped tormented and yet for all its pain as devoid of mercy as a stone or a rockslide it clutched her shirt lifted her up to its face and stared at her for a long long moment she was crying now in fear beyond shame she would deal with dags rescue yes or anybodys at all she would trade back for her banditravisher she would deal with any god listening make any promise letmegoletmego with a slow deliberate motion the malice lifted her skirt with its other hand twitched her drawers down to her hips and drew its claws up her belly the pain was so intense fawn thought for a moment that she had been gutted her knees came up in an involuntary spasm and she screamed the sound came so tightly out of her raw throat that it turned into near silence a rasping hiss she lowered her face expecting to see blood spewing her insides coming out only four faint red lines marked the pale unbroken skin of her belly drop her a hoarse voice roared from her right the malices face turned its eyes blinking slowly fawn turned too the sudden release of pressure from her shirt took her utterly by surprise and she fell to the cave floor dirt and stones scraping her palms then scrambled up dag was in the shadows struggling with three no all five of the mudmen one reeled backward with a slashed throat and another closed in dag nearly disappeared under the grunting pile of creatures a shuffle a rip dags yell and a mess of straps and wood and a flash of metal thudded violently against the cave wall a mudman had just torn off his arm contraption the mudman twisted the arm around behind dags back as though trying to rip it off too he met her eyes shoved his big steel knife into the nearest mudman as though wedging it into a tree for safekeeping and ripped a leather pouch from around his neck its strap snapping spark watch this she kept her eyes on it as it sailed toward her and to her own immense surprise caught it out of the air she had never in her life caught another mudman jumped on dag stick it in he bellowed going down again stick it in the malice knives the pouch had two knives she pulled one out it was made of bone magic knives which she cried frantically sharp end first anywhere the malice was starting to move toward dag feeling as though her head was floating three feet above her body fawn thrust the bone knife deeply into the things thigh the malice turned back toward her howling in surprise the sound split her skull the malice caught her by the neck this time and lifted her up its hideous face contorting no no screamed dag the other one her one hand still clutched the pouch the other was free she had maybe one second before the malice shook her till her neck snapped like a kitchen boy killing a chicken she yanked the spare bone blade out of its sheath and jammed it forward it skittered over something maybe a rib then caught and went in but only a couple of inches the blade shattered oh no she was falling falling as if from a great height the ground struck her a stunning blow she shoved herself up once more everything spinning around her before her eyes the malice was slumping bits and pieces sloughed off it like ice blowing from a roof its awful keening voice went up and up and higher still fading out yet leaving shooting pains in her ears and gone in front of her feet was a pile of soursmelling yellow dirt the first knife the one with the blue haft that hadnt worked lay before it in her ears was silence unless shed just gone deaf no for a scuffle began again to her right she whirled thinking to snatch up the knife and try to help its magic might have failed but it still had an edge and a point but the three mudmen still on their feet had stopped trying to tear the patroller apart and instead were scrambling away yowling one bowled her over in its frantic flight apparently without any destructive intent this time she stayed on her hands and knees gasping she had thought her body must run out of shakes in sheer exhaustion but the supply seemed endless she had to clench her teeth to keep them from chattering like someone freezing to death her belly cramped dag was sitting on the ground ten feet away with a staggered look on his face legs every which way mouth open gasping for air just as hard as she was his left sleeve was ripped off and his handless arm was bleeding from long scratches he must have taken a blow to his face for one eye was already tearing and swelling fawn scrabbled around till her hand encountered the other knife hilt the green one that had splintered in the malice where was the malice im sorry im sorry i broke it she was sniveling now tears and snot running down her lip from her nose im sorry what dag looked up dazedly and began to crawl toward her onehanded in strange slow hops his left arm curled up protectively to his chest fawn pointed a trembling finger i broke your magic knife dag stared down at the greenwrapped hilt with a disoriented look on his face as if he was seeing it for the first time no its all right theyre supposed to do that they break like that when they work when they teach the malice how to die what malices are immortal they cannot die if you tore that body into a hundred bits the malices self would just flee away to another hole and reassemble itself still knowing everything it had learned in this incarnation and so twice as dangerous they cannot die on their own so you have to share a death with them i dont understand ill explain more he wheezed later he rolled over on his back hair sweaty and wild dilated eyes the color of sassafras tea in the shadows looking blankly upwards absent gods we did it its done you did it what a mess mari will kill me kiss me first though i bet kiss us both fawn sat on her knees bent over her cramps why didnt the first knife work what was wrong with it it wasnt primed im sorry i didnt think in a hurry a patroller would have known which was which by touch of course you couldnt tell he rolled over on his left side and reached for the bluehiked knife that ones mine for me someday his hand touched it and jerked back what the his lips parted eyes going suddenly intent and he reached again gingerly he drew his hand back more slowly this time the lunatic exhilaration draining from his face thats strange thats very strange what snapped fawn pain and bewilderment making her sharp her body was beaten her neck felt halftwistedoff and her belly kept on knotting in aching waves you dont tell me anything that makes sense and then i go and do stupid things and its not my fault oh i think this one is thats the rule credit goes to the one who does however scrambled the method congratulations little spark you have just saved the world my patrol will be so pleased she would have thought him ragging her mercilessly but while his words seemed wild his level tone was perfectly serious and his eyes were warm on her without a hint of malice maybe youre just crazy she said gruffly and thats why nothing you say makes sense no surprise by now if i am he said agreeably with a grunting effort he rolled over and up onto his knees hand propping him upright he opened his jaw as if to stretch his face as though it had gone numb and blinked owlishly i have to get off this dead dirt its fouling up my groundsense something fierce your what ill explain that laterhe sighedtoo ill explain anything you want youre owed little spark youre owed the world he added after a reflective moment many people are doesnt change the matter he started to reach for the unbroken knife again then paused his expression growing inward would you do me a favor pick that up and carry it along for me the hilt and the bits of the other too it needs proper burying later on fawn tried not to look at his stump which was pink and lumpy and appeared sore of course of course did they break your hand thing she spotted the pouch a few feet away and crawled to get it she wasnt sure she could stand up yet either she collected the broken bits in his tornoff sleeve and slid the intact knife back into its sheath he rubbed his left arm afraid so it isnt meant to come off that way by a long shot dirla will fix it shes good with leather it wont be the first time is your arm all right he grinned briefly it isnt meant to come off that way either though that bearfellow sure tried nothings broken itll get better with rest he shoved to his feet and stood with legs braced apart swaying until he seemed sure he wouldnt just fall down again he limped slowly around the cave collecting first his ruined arm contraption which he wrapped over his shoulder by its leather straps then fallen farther away his big knife he swiped it on his filthy shirt and resheathed it he rolled his shoulders and squinted around for a moment apparently saw nothing else he wanted and walked back to fawn her sharpening cramps almost doubled her over when she tried to rise he gave her a hand up she stuffed the pouch and rolled sleeve in her shirt leaning on each other they staggered for the light what about the mudmen wont they jump us again asked fawn fearfully as they came out on the path overlooking the dead ravine no its all over for them when their malice dies they go back to their animal mindstrapped in those madeup human bodies they usually panic and run they dont do too well after we kill them for mercy when we can otherwise they die on their own pretty quick horrible really oh the men whose minds the malice has seized its fog lifts from them too they revert a malice enslaves men too when its powers grow more advanced i think this one might have for all it was still in its first molt and theyll be freed wherever they may be sometimes freed sometimes go mad depends on what on what theyve been doing betimes they remember dyou see fawn wasnt entirely sure she did or wished to the air was warm but the sun was setting through bare branches as though winter had become untimely mixed with summer this day has been ten years long dag sighed got to get me off this bad ground my horse is too far away to summon think well take those he pointed to two horses tied to trees near the creek and led her down the zigzag path toward them i dont see any gear can you ride bareback usually but right now i feel pretty sick fawn admitted she was still shaking and she felt cold and clammy her breath drew in as another violent cramp passed through her that is not good that is something very wrong she had thought herself fresh out of fear a years supply used up but now she was not so sure huh think youd be all right if i held you in front of me the unpleasant memory of her ride with the bandit this morninghad it only been this morning dag was right this day was a decadeflashed through her mind dont be stupid dag is different dag on the whole was different from any other person shed ever met in her life she gulped yeah i yeah probably they arrived at the horses fawn stumbling a little dag ran his hand over them humming to himself in a tuneless way and turned one loose after first filching its rope shooing it off it trotted away as if glad to be gone the other was a neat bay mare with black socks and a white star he fastened the rope to her halter to make reins and led her to a fallen log he kept trying to use his left limb to assist wincing then remembering which among all fawns other hurts made her heart ache strangely can you get yourself up or do you need a boost fawn stood whitely dag she said in a small scared voice his head snapped around at her tone and tilted attentively what im bleeding he walked back to her where did they cut you i didnt see fawn swallowed hard thinking that her face would be scarlet if only it had not been green in an even smaller voice she choked out between between my legs the loopy glee that had underlain his expression ever since the killing of the malice was wiped away as if with a rag oh and he did not seem to require a single further word of explanation which was a good thing as well as being amazing in a man because fawn was out of everything words courage ideas he took a deep breath we still have to get off this ground deathly place have to get you get you someplace else away from here well just go a little faster is all youre going to have to help me with this help each other it took two tries and considerable awkwardness but they both managed to get aboard the bay mare at last thankfully a placid beast fawn sat not astride but sideways across dags lap legs pressed together head to his left shoulder arm around his neck leaving his right hand free for the reins he chirped to the horse and started them off at a brisk walk stay with me now he murmured into her hair do not let go you hear the world was spinning but under her ear she could hear a steady heartbeat she nodded dolefully chapter by the time they arrived at the deserted valley farm both the back of fawns skirt and the front of dags trousers were soaked in toobright blood oh said fawn in a mortified voice when hed swung her down from the horse and slid after her oh im sorry dag raised what he hoped was an admirably calm eyebrow what its just blood little spark ive dealt with more blood in my time than you have in your whole bitty body which was where this red tide should be blast and blight it i will not panic he wanted to swing her up in his arms and carry her inside but he did not trust his strength he had to keep moving or his own battered body would start to stiffen he wrapped his right arm around her shoulders instead and leaving the horse to fend for itself aimed her up the porch steps why is this happening she said so low and breathy and plaintive he wasnt sure if it was to him or herself he hesitated yes she was young but surelydont you know she glanced up at him the bruise masking the left side of her face was darkening to purple the gouges scabbing over yes she whispered she steadied her voice by sheer force of will he thought but you seem to know so much i was hoping you might have a different answer stupid of me the malice did something to you tried to courage failing he looked away from her gaze to say it stole your babys ground it would have used it in its next molt but we killed it first and i was too late to stop it five blighted minutes if he had only been five blighted minutes quicker yes and if hed only been five blighted seconds quicker once hed still have a left hand and hed been down that road and back up it enough times to be thoroughly tired of the scenery peace if he had arrived at the lair very much sooner he might have missed her entirely but what had happened to his spare sharing knife in that terrible scramble it had been empty but now he would swear it was primed and that should not have happened take on your disasters one at a time old patroller or youll lose your trail the knife could wait fawn could not then then its too late to save anything its never too late to save something he said sternly might not be what you wanted is all which was certainly something he needed to hear every day but was not exactly pertinent to her present need now was it he tried again because he did not think his heart or hers could bear confusion on this point shes gone youre not your next job is to survive this night get better after that well see the twilight was failing as they stepped into the gloomy shadows of the farmhouse kitchen but dag could see it was a different mess than before this way fawn said dont step in the jam ah right theres some candle stubs around up over the hearth theres some more oh no i cant lie there ill stain the ticks looks flat enough to me little spark i do know you should be lying down im real sure of that her breathing was too rapid and shallow her skin far too clammy and her ground had a bad gray tinge that went hand in hand with grave damage in his unpleasant experience well well find something then for in between now was not definitely not the time to argue with female irrationality right he poked up the faint remains of the fire fed it with some wood chips and lit two wax stubs one of which he left on the hearth for her the other he took with him for a quick exploration a couple of those chests and wardrobes upstairs had still had things in them he dimly recalled a patroller should be resourceful what did the girl most need a miscarriage was a natural enough process even if this one was most unnaturally triggered women survived them all the time he was fairly sure he just wished they had discussed them more or that he had listened more closely lie flat check theyd got that far make her comfortable cruel joke peace he supposed shed be more comfortable cleaned up than filthy at any rate hed always been grateful for that when recovering from a serious injury what you cant fix the real problem so youll fix something else instead and which of you is this supposed to aid peace and a bucket and an unfouled well with luck it took more time than hed have liked during which to his swallowed aggravation she insisted on lying on the blighted kitchen floor but he eventually assembled a clean gownlike garment rather too large for her some old mended sheets an assortment of rags for pads actual soap and water in a moment of ruthless inspiration he broke through her reticence by persuading her to wash his hand first as though he needed help she still had the shakes which she seemed to take for residual fear but which he recognized as one with the chilled skin and grayness in her ground and which he treated by piling on whatever blanketlike cloths he could find and building up the fire the last time hed seen a woman coiled around her belly that hard a blade had penetrated almost to her spine he heated a stone wrapped it in cloth and gave it to fawn to clutch to herself which to his relief seemed finally to help the shakes faded and her ground lightened eventually she was arranged all tidy and sweet and patientlike her curl around the stone relaxing as she warmed blinking up at him in the candlelight as he sat crosslegged beside the tick did you find any clothes you could use she asked though i suppose youd be lucky to find a fit havent looked yet got spares in my saddlebags which are on my horse somewhere if im lucky my patrol will find him and bring him along sometime they had better be looking for me by now if you could find something else to wear i bet i could wash those tomorrow im sorry that little spark he leaned forward his ragged voice cracking do not apologize to me for this she recoiled he regained control because dont you see a crying patroller is a very embarrassing sight m face gets all snivelly and snotty combine that with this blue eye ive got starting and itd be like to turn your stomach and then thered just be another mess to clean up and we dont want that now do we he tweaked her nose which was on the whole an insane thing to do to a woman whod just saved the world but it worked to break her bleak mood she smiled wanly all right were making great progress here you know food what about food i dont think i could yet you go ahead drink then and no arguments with me about that one i know you need to drink when youve lost blood are losing blood still too much too fast how long was it supposed to go on candlelight explorations in the rather astonishing cellar yielded a box of dried sassafras uncertain of the unknown well water he boiled some up for tea and dosed them both he was thirstier than hed thought and set fawn an example which she followed as docilely as a naive young patroller why why do they do whatever you tell them like that except when they didnt of course he sat against the wall facing her legs stretched out and sipped some more there would be more i could do for you on the inside patroller tricks with my groundsense if only groundsense she uncurled a little more and regarded him gravely you said youd tell me about that he blew out his breath wondering how to explain it to a farmer girl in a way she wouldnt take wrong groundsense its a sense of everything around us whats alive where it is how its doing and not just whats alive though thats brightest no one quite knows if the world makes ground or ground makes the world but ground is what a malice sucks out to sustain itself the loss of which kills everything around its air in the middle of a really bad patch of blight not only is everything once alive now dead even rocks dont hold their form grounds what groundsense senses magic she said doubtfully he shook his head not the way farmers use the term its not like getting something for nothing its just the way the world is deep down he forged on against her frankly blank look we use words from sight and touch and the other senses to describe it but it isnt like any of those things really its like how you know close your eyes she raised her brows at him in puzzlement but did so now which way is down point her thumb rotated toward the floor and the big brown eyes opened again still puzzled so how did you know you didnt see down i she hesitated i felt it with my whole body groundsense is something more like that so he sipped more tea the warm spice soothed his throat people are the most complicated brightest things groundsense sees we see each other unless we close it down to block the distraction like shutting your eyes or wrapping a lantern up in a cloak you canlakewalkers canmatch our bodys ground to someone elses bodys ground if you get the match up really close almost like slipping inside each other you can lend strength rhythm help with wounds slow bleeding help with when a hurt body starts to go all wrong down into that cold gray place lead the other back to balance did something like that for a patroller boy lastye gods last night saun i have to stop thinking of him as saun the sheep its going to slip out my mouth someday and hell never forgive me but anyway bandit whaled him in the chest with a sledgehammer during the fight broke ribs stunned his heart and lungs i whacked my ground into a match with his right quick persuaded his to dance with mine it was all a bit brutal but i was in a hurry would he have died but for you i maybe if he thinks so im not going to argue might finally get him to give up those overblown sword moves of his while hes still impressed with me dag grinned briefly but the grin faded again more tea trouble is blight out of tea youve taken a wound to your womb i can sense it in you like a rip in your ground but i cant match it to lend you anything helpful through our grounds because well i havent got one a womb that is not part of my body or its ground if mari or one of the girls were here they could maybe help but i dont want to leave you alone for eight or twelve hours or however long it would take to find one and bring her back no dont do that her hand clutched at his leg then drew back shyly as she coiled more tightly on her side how much pain was she in plenty right so that means we have to ride this thing out the farmer way what do farmer women do do you know go to bed i think didnt your mother or sisters ever say dont have any sisters and my brothers are all older than me my mother shes taught me a lot but she doesnt do midwifery shes always so busy with well everything mostly i think the body just cleans itself out like a bad monthly though some women seem to get poorly after i think its all right if you bleed some but bad if you bleed a lot well tell me which youre doing all right all right she said doubtfully her expression was so very reserved and inward as though painfully trying to listen to the marred song of her own body with a groundsense blighted deaf or futilely looking for that other light within her so bright and busy just this morning now dark and dead in all dag thought fawn had been much too quiet ever since theyd left the lair it made him feel unsettled and desperate he wondered if he ought to invent a few sisters for himself to bolster his authority in the matter look i am a very experienced patroller he blathered on into that fraught silence i delivered a baby singlehandedly on the great lake road once wait was this a good tale to tell now perhaps not but it was too late to stop well not singlehandedly i had two hands then but they were both pretty clumsy fortunately it was the womans fourth and she could tell me how to go on which she did pretty tartly she was not best pleased to be stuck with me for a midwife she called me such names i stored em up to treasurethey came in right useful later on when i was dealing with feckless young patrollers twentytwo i was and so proud of myself after youd think i did all the work let me tell you next bandit i faced after that didnt look nearly so scary this won a watery chuckle as hed hoped good because if hed gone with the fictional sisters she might have asked their names and he didnt think his invention would last so far his eyelids felt as if someone had attached lead weights to them when he wasnt looking the room was beginning to waver unpleasantly she was one straightforward lady set me an example i never forgot i can see that murmured fawn and after a quiet moment added thank you oh youre an easy patient i wont have to shave you in the morning and you wont throw your boots at my head because youre cranky and hurting bored cranky patrollers who hurt worlds worst company trust me do they really throw boots yes i did a yawn cracked his face his bruises and strains were reporting for duty right enough reminded of his boots existence he slowly drew up his feet and began to undo his laces hed had those boots on for twono four days because hed slept in them night before last would you feel more comfortable if i went out to sleep on the porch he asked fawn eyed him over her sheets now pulled up nearly to her lips pink those lips if much paler than he would have liked to see them but not gray or bluish good no she said in a curiously distant tone i dont think i would good another yawn split the word and others crowded after because i dont think i could crawl through all that sticky jam right now softer here you can have the inside ill take the outside he flopped forward facedown in the tick he really should turn his head so he could breathe he supposed he turned toward fawn that being the better view and eyed what he could see of her over the hillock of stuffed cloth dark curls skin petalfair where it was not bruised smelling infinitely better than him a surprised brown eye mama he muttered the sheep are safe tonight sheep she said after a moment patroller joke about farmers come to think he wasnt going to tell it to her ever fortunately he was growing too bludgeoned by his fatigue to talk he roused himself just enough to stretch over pinch out the candle and flop again i dont get it good night his rueful consciousness of that short curving body separated from his by only a couple of layers of fabric was intense but very brief fawn woke in the dark of night on her right side facing the kitchen wall with a weight across her chest and a long lumpy bolster seemingly wrapped around her in back the weight was dags left arm she realized and he must be dead asleep indeed to have flung it there because he always seemed to carry it subtly out of the way out of sight when he was awake his chin was scratching the back of her neck his nose was buried in her hair and she could feel her curls flutter with his slow breath he lay very solidly between her and the door and whatever might come through the door scary things out there bandits mudmen blight bogles and yet wasnt the tall patroller the scariest of all because at the end of the day bandits mudmen and bogles all lay strewn in his path and he was still walking limping anyhow how could someone scarier than anything make her feel safer a riddle that if not precisely trapped by his menace she did find herself pinned by his exhaustion her attempt to slip out without waking him failed there followed disjointed mumbled arguments in the dark about a trudge to the privy versus a chamber pot he won the change and care of bloodsoaked dressings he won again and where he would go to sleep next hard to tell who won that one but he did end up on the tick between her and the door as before despite a new hot stone her gnawing cramps ordained that he was asleep again before her but the unlikely comfort of that bony body wrapped like a fort wall around her hurting assured that it wasnt so very much before when next she awoke it was broad day outside and she was alone yesterdays agony in her belly was reduced to a knotting ache but her dressings were soaked again before she had time to panic boot steps sounded on the porch accompanied by a tuneless chirping whistle she had never heard dag whistle but it could be no one else he ducked in through the door and smiled at her gold eyes bright from the light he must have been out bathing by the well for his hair was wet and his damp skin free of blood and grime leaving all his scratches looking tidier and less alarming also he smelled quite nice last nights reekalthough it had been reassuring to know exactly where he was even from several feet away in the darkreplaced with the clean sharpness of the lost farmwifes homemade soap rough brown stuff that she had nonetheless scented with lavender and mint he was shirtless wearing a pair of unbloodied gray trousers clearly not his own cinched around his waist with a stray bit of rope she suspected they came about a foot short lengthwise but with the ends tucked into his boots no one could tell he had an uneven tan his coppery skin paler where his shirt usually fell although not nearly as pale as hers he favored long sleeves even in summer it seemed his collection of bruises was almost as impressive as her own but he was not so bony underneath as shed feared his long strappy muscles moved easily under his skin morning spark he said cheerily the first order of business was the repellent medical necessities which he took on with such straightforward briskness that he left her almost feeling that blood clots were an achievement rather than a horror clots are good red spurting blood is bad thought wed agreed on that one spark whatever the malice ripped up inside you is starting to mend that says to me good work keep lying down she lay dozily as he wandered in and out things happened a ragged white shirt appeared on his back too tight across the shoulders and with the sleeves rolled up more tea happened and food the remains of the pan bread she made yesterday rolled around some meat stew from the cellar he had to coax her to eat but miraculously it stayed down and she could feel strength starting to return to her body almost immediately because of it her hot stones were swapped out regularly after a second longish expedition outside he returned with a cloth full of strawberries from the farm womans kitchen garden and sat himself down on the floor beside her sharing them out in mock exactitude she woke from a longer doze to see him sitting at the kitchen table mulling glumly over his hand contraption laid out atop it can you fix it she asked muzzily afraid not not a onehand job even if i had the tools here stitchings all ripped and the wrist cap is cracked this is beyond dirla when we get to glassforge ill have to find a harnessmaker and maybe a woodturner to put it right again glassforge was she still going to glassforge when the reason for her flight had been so abruptly removed her life had been turned upside down one too many times lately too fast for her to be sure of much just now she turned to the wall and clutched her stoneby the heat hed renewed it again while shed slepttighter to her aching emptying womb in the past weeks she had experienced her child as fear desperation shame exhaustion and vomiting she had not yet felt the fabled quickening although she had gone to sleep nightly waiting intently for that sign it was disquieting to think that this chancemet man with his strange lakewalker senses had gained a more direct perception of the brief life of her child than she had the thought hurt but pressing the ragwrapped stone to her forehead didnt help she rolled back over and her eye fell on dags knife pouch set aside last night near the head of her feather mattress the intact knife with the blue hilt was still in its sheath where shed shoved it the othergreen hilt and bone fragmentsseemed to have been rewrapped in a bit of scavenged cloth ends tied in one of dags clumsy onehanded knots the fine linen though wrinkled and ripped and probably from the mending basket had embroidery on it oncetreasured guestday work she looked up to see him watching her examine them his face gone expressionless again you said youd tell me about these too she said i dont guess it was just any bit of bone that killed an immortal malice no indeed the sharing knives are by far the most complex of our tools hard and costly to make i suppose youll tell me they arent really magic again he sighed rose came over and sat down crosslegged beside her he took the pouch thoughtfully in his hand theyre human bone arent they she added more quietly watching him yes he said a little distantly his gaze swung back to her understand patrollers have had trouble with farmers before over sharing knives misunderstandings weve learned not to discuss them you have earned there are reasons you must be told i can only ask that you dont talk about it with anyone after anyone at all she puzzled he made a little jerk of his fingers lakewalkers all know i mean outsiders farmers although in this case well well get to that roundaboutly it seemed she frowned at this uncharacteristic loss of straightforwardness on his part all right he took a breath straightening his spine a trifle not just any human bones our own lakewalker bones not farmer bones and most especially not kidnapped farmer childrens bones all right adult have to be for the length and strength youd think people wouldwell thighbones usually and sometimes upper arms it makes our funeral practices something outsiders are not invited to some of the most aggravating rumors have been started around stray glimpses we are not cannibals rest assured i actually hadnt heard that one you might if youre around long enough she had seen hogs and cows butchered she could imagine her mind leaped ahead to picture dags long legsno some mess is unavoidable but its all done respectfully with ceremony because we all know it could be our turn later not everyone donates their bones it would be more than needed and some arent suitable too old or young too thin or fragile i mean to give mine if i die young enough the thought made an odd knot in her belly that had nothing to do with her cramping oh but thats just the body of the knife the first half of the making the other half the thing that makes it possible to share death with a malice is the priming the quick wouldbereassuring smile with this did not reach his eyes we prime it with a death a donated death one of our own in the making the knife is bonded matched to the intended primer so they are very personal dyou see fawn pushed herself up increasingly riveted and increasingly disturbed go on when youre a lakewalker who means to give your death to a knife and youre close to dyingwounded in the field beyond hope of recovery or dying at home of natural causes youor more often your comrade or kintake the sharing knife and insert it into your heart fawns lips parted but yes it kills us thats the whole point are you saying peoples souls go into those knives not souls ah knew youd ask that he swiped his hand through his hair thats another farmer rumor makes so much trouble even our groundsense doesnt tell us where peoples souls go after their deaths but i promise you its not into the knives just their dying ground their mortality he started to add lakewalker godstories say the gods have well never mind that now now there was a rumor she had heard people say you dont believe in the gods no little spark somewhat the reverse but that doesnt enter into this that knifehe pointed to the blue hiltis my own grounded to me i had it made special the bone for it was willed to me by a woman named kauneo who was slain in a bad malice war up northwest of the dead lake twenty years ago we were way late spotting it and it had grown very powerful the malice hadnt found many people to use out in that wilderness but it had found wolves and well the other knife which you used yesterday that was her primed knife grounded to her her hearts death was in it the bone of it was from an uncle of hersi never met him but he was a legendary patroller up that way in his day fellow named kaunear you probably didnt have time to notice it but his name and his curse on malices were burned on the blade fawn shook her head curse his choice what to have written on his bone you can order the makers to put any personal message you want that will fit some people write love notes to their knifeheirs or really bad jokes sometimes up to them two notes actually one side for the donor of the bone the other for the donor of the hearts death which is put on after the knife is primed if theres a chance fawn imagined that bone blade shed held being slowly shoved into a dying patroller womans heart maybe someone like mari by who had done it dag twenty years seemed terribly long agocould he really be as old as say forty the deaths we share with the malices said dag quietly are our own and no others why whispered fawn shaken because thats what works how it works because we can and no one else can because it is our legacy because if a malice every malice is not killed when it emerges it just keeps growing and growing and getting stronger and smarter and harder to get at and if there is ever one we cant get it will grow till the whole world is gray dust and then it too will die when i said youd saved the world yesterday spark i was not joking that malice could have been the one fawn lay back clutching her sheets to her breast taking this in it was a lot to take in if she had not seen the malice up closethe rockdust scent of its foul breath still seemed to linger in her nostrilsshe was not sure she could have understood fully i still dont understand but oh i do believe we just have to hope dag sighed that we run out of malices before we run out of lakewalkers he held the sheathpouch down on his thigh with his stump and pulled out the bluehilted knife he cradled it thoughtfully for a moment then with a look of concentration touched it to his lips closing his eyes his face set in disturbed lines he laid the knife down exactly between himself and fawn and drew back his hand this brings us to yesterday i jabbed that knife into the malices thigh said fawn but nothing happened no something happened because this knife was not primed and now it is fawns face screwed up did it suck out the malices mortality then or immortality no that makes no sense no what i thinkhe looked up from under wary browsmind you im not sure yet i need to talk with some folksbut what i think is the malice had just stolen your babys ground and the knife stole it back not soul dont you go imagining trapped souls againjust her mortality he added under his breath a death without a birth very strange fawns lips moved but no sound came out so here we sit he went on the body of this knife belongs to me because kauneo willed me her bones but by our rules the priming in this knife its mortality belongs to you because you are its next of kin because your unborn child of course could not will it herself here things get really get even more mixed up because usually no one is allowed to will and give their priming till they are adult enough to have their groundsense come in fully about fourteen or fifteen and older is stronger and anyway this was a farmer child yet no death but mine should have been able to prime this knife this is a this is a right mess is what it is actually though still shaken by her sudden miscarriage fawn had thought all decisions about her personal disaster were behind her and had been wearily grateful that no more were to be faced it was a kind of relief curled within the grief not so it seemed could you use it to kill another malice some redemption in all this chain of sorrows i would want to take it to my camps best maker first see what he has to say im just a patroller i am out of my experience and reckoning here its a strange knife could do something unknown maybe unwanted or not work at all and as you have seen to get right up to a malice and then have your tools fail makes a bit of a problem what should we do what can we do he gave a rough nod on the one hand we could destroy it but wont that waste two sacrifices yes it wouldnt be my first pick but if you speak it spark i will break it now in front of you and it will be over he laid his hand over the hilt his face a mask but his eyes searching hers her breath caught nono dont do that yet anyhow and on the other hand there is no other hand she wondered if his sense of humor was gruesome enough to have had exactly that thought as well she suspected so she gulped and continued but your peoplewill they care what some farmer girl thinks in this matter yes he rolled his shoulders as though they ached if its all right with you then ill speak of this first with mari my patrol leader see what notions she has after that well think again of course she said faintly he means it that i should have a say in this i would take it kindly if you would take charge of it till then of course he nodded and handed her the leather pouch leaving her to resheathe the knife the linen bag however he picked up to put with his arm contraption his joints crackled and popped as he stood up and stretched and he winced fawn sank back down on the tick and stole a closer look at the bone blade the faint flowing lines burned brown into the bones pale surface read dag my heart walks with yours till the end kauneo the lakewalker woman must have written this directive some time before she died fawn realized fawn imagined her sitting in a lakewalker tent tall and graceful like the other patroller women shed glimpsed writing tablet balanced on the very thigh that she must have known would come to bear the words if things went ill had she pictured this knife made from her marrow pictured dag using it someday to drink his own hearts blood in turn but she could not ever fawn thought have pictured a feckless young farmer girl fumbling it into this strange confusion a lifetimeat any rate fawns lifetimelater brow furrowed fawn slipped the sharing knife out of sight again in its sheath chapter to dags approval fawn dozed off again after lunch good let her sleep and make up her blood loss hed had enough practice to translate the gore on the dressings to a guess as to the amount when he mentally doubled the volume to make up for the fact that she was about half the size of most men hed nursed he was very thankful that the bleeding had plainly slowed he came in from checking on the bay mare now idling about in the front pasture hed repaired by pulling rails from the fence opposite to find fawn awake and sitting up against the back kitchen wall her face was drawn and quiet and she pulled bored fingers through her curls which were abundant if tangled she peered up at him do you own a comb he ran his hand through his hair does it look that bad her smile was too ghostly for his taste though the quip was worth no more not for you for me i usually keep my hair tied up or it gets in an awful mess like now i have one in my saddlebag he offered wryly i think it sifts to the bottom havent seen it in about a month that i do believe her eyes crinkled just a little then sobered again why dont you wear your hair fancy like the other patrollers he shrugged there are a lot of things i can do onehanded braiding hair isnt one of them couldnt someone do it for you he twitched doesnt work if no ones there besides i need enough other favors she looked puzzled is the supply so limited he blinked at the thought was it shrewd question he wondered if his passion for proving himself capable and without need of aid so earnestly undertaken after his maiming was something a man might outgrow old habits die hard maybe not ill look around upstairs see what i can find he added over his shoulder lie flat you she slid back down obediently though she made a face he returned with a wooden comb found behind an upended chest it was gaptoothed as an old man but it served he found by experiment she was sitting up again the clothwrapped hot stone laid aside another promising sign here spark catch he tossed the comb to her and studied her as she jerked up her hand in surprise and had it bounce off her fingers she looked up at him in sudden curiosity why did you call watch when you threw the knife pouch at me quick she is old patroller training trick for the girlsand some otherswho come in claiming they cant catch things its usually because theyre trying too hard the hand follows the eye if the mind doesnt trip it if i yell at them to catch the ball or whatever they fumble because thats the picture they have in their heads if i yell at them to count the spins it goes right to their hand while theyre not attending and they think im a marvel he grinned and she smiled shyly back i didnt know if you had played throwing games with those brothers of yours or not so i took the safe bet in case it was the only one we got her smile became a grimace just the throwing game where they tossed me into the pond which wasnt so funny in winter she eyed the comb curiously then started in on the end of one tangle her hair was springy and silky and the color of midnight and dag couldnt help thinking how soft it would feel to his touch another reason to wish for two hands the smell of it so close last night returned to his memory and perhaps he had better go check on that horse again in the late afternoon fawn complained for the first time of being hot which dag seemed to take as a good sign he claimed he was sweltering set up a padded seat out on the shaded porch floor and permitted her up just long enough to walk out to it she settled down with her back against the house wall staring out into the bright summer light the green fields and the darker greens of the woods seemed deceptively peaceful the horse grazed at the far end of the pasture the burned outbuilding had stopped smoldering clothing hers and his from yesterday lay damply over the fence rail in the sun and fawn wondered when dag had laundered it dag lowered himself to her left stretched out his legs leaned his head back and sighed as the faint breeze caressed them i dont know whats keeping my patrol he remarked after a time opening his eyes again to stare down the lane its not like mari to get lost in the woods if they dont show soon ill have to try and bury those poor dogs myself theyre getting pretty ripe dogs he made an apologetic gesture the farm dogs found em out behind the barn yesterday the only animals that werent carried off seemingly i think they died defending their people figured they ought to be buried nice maybe up in the woods where its shady dogs ought to like that fawn bit her lip wondering why this made her suddenly want to burst into tears when she had not cried for her own child he glanced down at her his expression growing diffident among lakewalker women a loss like yours would be a private grief but she would not be so alone shed maybe have her man closest friends or kin around her instead youre stuck with me if youhe ducked his head nervouslyneed to weep be sure that i wouldnt mistake it for any lack of strength or courage on your part fawn shook her head lips tight and miserable should i weep dont know i dont know farmer women its not about being a farmer she held out her hand which clenched its about being stupid after a moment he said in a very neutral tone you use that word a lot makes me wonder who used to whip you with it lots of people because i was she lowered her gaze to her lap where her hands now twisted the loose fabric of her gown its funny i can tell you this i suppose its because i never saw you before or will again the man was carrying out her revolting blood clots after all before yesterday the very thought would have slain her with embarrassment she remembered the fight in the cave the bearman the deathly breath of the malice what was a mere stupid story compared to that his silence this time took on an easy listening quality unhurried she felt she might fill it in her own good time out in the fields a few earlysummer insects sang in the weeds in a lower voice she said i didnt mean to have a child i wanted wanted something else and then i was so scared and mad seeming to feel his way as cautiously as a hunter in the woods he said farmer customs arent like ours we hear pretty lurid songs and tales about them your familydid they cast you out he scowled fawn was not sure why she shook her head harder no theyd have taken care of me and the child if theyd been put to it i didnt tell them i ran away he glanced at her in surprise from a place of safety i dont understand well i didnt think the road would be this dangerous that woman from glassforge made it after all it seemed like an even trade me for her he pursed his lips and stared off down the lane to ask even more quietly were you forced no she blew out her breath i can clear stupid sunny of that at least i wantedto tell the truth i asked him his brows went up a little although a tension eased out of his shoulders is there a problem with this among farmers it seems quite the thing to me the woman invites the man to her tent except i suppose you dont have tents i could have wished for a tent a bed something it was at his sisters wedding and we ended up out in the field behind the barn in the dark hiding in the new wheat which i thought could have stood to be taller i hoped it might be romantic and wild instead it was all mosquitoes and hurry and dodging his drunken friends it hurt which i expected but not unbearably id just thought there would be more to it i got what i asked for but not what i wanted he rubbed his lips thoughtfully what did you want she took a breath thinking as opposed to flailing which was maybe what she had been doing back home i think i wanted to know itwhat a man and a woman dowas like some kind of wall between me and being a grownup woman even though i was plenty old how old is plenty old he cocked his head curiously at her twenty she said defiantly oh he said and though he managed to keep the amusement out of his voice his gold eyes glinted a bit she would have been annoyed but the glint was too pretty to complain about and then there were the crowsfeet which framed the glint so perfectly she waved her hands in defeat and went on it was like a big secret everyone knew but me i was tired of being the youngest and littlest and always the child she sighed we were a bit drunk too she added after a morose silence he did say a girl couldnt be got with child the first time dags eyebrows climbed higher and you believed this a country girl i said i was stupid about it i thought maybe people were different than heifers i thought maybe sunny knew more than me he could hardly know less its not as if anyone talked about it to me i mean she added after a moment and id had such a hard time nerving myself up to it i didnt want to stop he scratched his head well among my people we try not to be crude in front of the young ones but we have to instruct and be instructed because of the hazards of tangling our grounds which young couples still do theres nothing so embarrassing as having to be rescued from an unintended groundlock by your friends or worse her kin at fawns baffled look he added its a bit like a trance you get wound up in each other and forget to get up go eat report for duty after a couple of hoursor daysthe bodys needs break you out but thats pretty uncomfortable dangerous in an unsafe place to be so unaware of your surroundings for that long too it was her turn to say oh rather blankly she glanced up at him did you ever once when i was very young his lips twitched around twenty its not something most people let happen twice we look out for each other try not to let the first learning kill anyone a couple of days i think i had a couple of minutes she shook her head not sure if she believed this tale or understood it for that matter well thatwhat sunny said thenwasnt what made me so mad maybe he didnt know either even getting with child didnt make me mad just scared so i went to sunny because i reckoned he had a right to know besides i thought he liked me or maybe even loved me dag started to say something but then at her last statement stopped himself looking taken aback and just waved her to continue this has to have happened to other farmer women what do your folk usually do fawn shrugged usually people get married in kind of a hurry her folks and his folks get together and put a good face on it and things just go on i mean if no one is married already if hes already married or if she is i guess things get uglier but i didnt think i mean i had nerved myself up for the one i figured i could nerve myself up for the other but when i told sunny it wasnt what id expected i didnt necessarily think hed be delighted but i did expect him to follow through after all i had to butshe took a deeper breathit seems he had other arrangements his parents had made him a betrothal with the daughter of a man whose land bordered theirs did i say sunnys folks have a big place and hes the only son and she was the only child and it had been understood for years and i said why didnt he tell me earlier and he said everyone knew and why should he have if i was giving myself away for free and i said thats fine but theres this baby now and it was all going to have to come out and both our parents would make us stand up together anyhow and he said no his wouldnt i was portionless and he would get three of his friends to say theyd had me that night too and hed get out of it she finished this last in a rush her face hot she stole a glance at dag who was sitting looking down the lane with a curiously blank face but with his teeth pressed into his lower lip and at that point i decided i didnt care if i was pregnant with twins i wouldnt have stupid sunny for my husband on a bet she jerked up her chin in defiance good said dag startling her she stared at him he added id been wondering what to make of stupid sunny in all this tale now i think maybe a drum skin would be good ive never tanned a human skin mind you but how hard could it be he blinked cheerfully at her a spontaneous laugh puffed from her lips thank you wait i havent done it yet no i mean thank you for saying it it had been a joke offer hadnt it she remembered the bodies strewn in his wake yesterday and was suddenly less sure lakewalkers after all dont really do it somebody should he rubbed his chin which was stubbled and maybe itchy and she wondered if shaving was something he didnt do onehanded either or if it was just that his razor was in the bottom of his lost saddlebags along with his comb its different for us he went on you cant lie about such things for one it shows in your ground which is not to say my people dont get tangled up and unhappy in other ways he hesitated i can see why his family might choose to believe his lie but would yours have is that why you ran off she pressed her lips together but managed a shrug likely not it wasnt that exactly but id have been lessened forever i would always be the one who who had been so stupid and if i got any smaller in their eyes i was afraid id just disappear i dont suppose this makes any sense to you well he said slowly no or maybe yes if i broaden the notion from just having babies to living altogether i am put in mind of a certain notsoyoung patroller who once moved the world to get back on patrol for all that there were plenty of onehanded tasks needing doing back in the camps his motives werent too sensible at the time either hm she eyed him sideways i figured i could learn to deal with a baby if had to it was dealing with stupid sunny and my family that seemed impossible in the exact same distant tone that hed inquired about sunny and rape he asked was your family um cruel to you she stared a moment in some bewilderment trying to figure out what he was picturing beatings with whips being locked up on nothing but bread and water the fancy seemed as slanderous of her poor overworked parents and dear aunt nattie as what sunny had threatened to say of her she sat up in mortified indignation no after a reflective moment she revised this to well my brothers can be a plague when they notice me at all that is justice served but it brought her back to the depressing notion that it was all something wrong with her well maybe it was brothers can be that he conceded he added cautiously so could you go home now there no longer being ahis gesture finished baby but his mouth managedan obstacle i suppose she said dully his brows drew down wait did you leave some word or did you just vanish vanished more or less i mean i didnt write anything but i would think they could see id taken some things if they looked closely wont your family be frantic they could think you were hurt or dead or taken by bandits or who knows whatdrowned caught in a snare wont stusunny confess and turn out to help search fawns nose wrinkled in doubt its not what id pictured not of sunny anyway now relieved of the driving panic of her pregnancy she thought anew of the baffling scene shed likely left behind her at west blue and gulped guilt they have to be looking for you spark i sure would be if i were yourhe bit off the last word whatever it was abruptly chewed and swallowed it too as if uncertain of the taste she said uneasily i dont know maybe if i went back now stupid sunny would think i had been lying to trap him for his stupid farm do you care what he thinks compared to your kin anyway her shoulders hunched once i cared a lot he seemed he seemed splendid to me handsome in retrospect sunnys face was round and bland and his eyes far too dull tall actually short she decided he was as tall as her brothers true who would come up maybe to dags chin he had a good horse well so it had appeared until shed seen the longlegged beasts the patrollers all rode sunny had shown off his horse making it sidle and step high making out that it was a restive handful only an expert might dare bestride patrollers rode with such quiet efficiency you didnt even notice how they were doing it you know its odd the farther away i get from him the more he seems to shrink dag smiled quietly hes not shrinking youre growing spark ive seen such spurts in young patrollers they grow fast sometimes in the crush when they have to get strong or go under takes some adjusting after be warnedlike when you put on eight inches of height in a year and nothing fits anymore an example not she suspected pulled out of the air that was what i wanted to be grownup to be real to matter worked he said reflectively roundaboutly yes she whispered and then somehow finally the dam cracked and it all came loose hurts yes he said simply and put his arm around her shoulders and snugged her in tight to him because she had not cried all that night or day but she was crying now dag studied the top of fawns head all he could see as she pressed her face into his chest and wept even now she choked her sobs half to silence shuddering with their suppression his certainty that she needed to release the strain in her ground was confirmed if hed been forced to put it into words for her he might have said that the fissures running through her seemed to grow less impossibly dark as her sorrow was disgorged but he wasnt sure if that would make sense to her sorrow and rage there was more erosion of spirit here going back further than the malices destruction of her child his instinct was to let her weep the grief out but after a time his worry roused anew as she clutched her belly once more a sign of physical pain returning sh he whispered hugging her onearmed sh dont be making yourself sick now would you like your hot stone again her clutch transferred to his sleeve and tightened no she muttered she briefly raised her face mottled white and flushed where it was not dark with bruises m too hot now all right she ducked back down gaining control of her breathing but the tight stress in her body didnt ease he wondered if her abandonment of her family without a word was as appallingly ruthless as it seemed or if there was more to the tale but then he came from a group that watched out for each other systematically from partnered pairs through linkers to patrols to companies and right on up in a tested web i sure would be looking for you spark if i were yourand then his tongue had tangled between two choices each differently disturbing father or lover leave it alone you are neither old patroller but he was the only thing she had for a partner here so he lowered his lips toward her ear nestled in the black curls and murmured think of something beautifully useless her face came up and she sniffed in confusion what there are a lot of senseless things in the world but not all of them are sorrows sometimesi findit helps to remember the other kind everybody knows some light even if they forget when theyre down in the dark somethinghe groped for a term that would work for hereveryone else thinks is stupid but you know is wonderful she lay still against him for a long time and he started to muster another explanation or perhaps abandon the attempt as well stupid but then she said milkweed mm he gave her another encouraging hug lest she mistake his query for objection milkweed its a just a weed we have to go around and tear it out of the garden and the crops but i think the smell of its flowers is prettier than my aunts climbing roses that she works on and babies all the time sweeter than lilacs nobody else thinks the flower heads are pretty but they are if you look at them closely enough pink and complicated like wild carrot lace gone plump and shy like a handful of bitty stars and the smell i could breathe it in she uncurled a little more unlocking from her pain pursuing the vision in the fall it grows pods all wrinkled and ugly but if you tear them open beautiful silk flies out the milkweed bugs make houses and pantries of them milkweed bugs now they arent pests they dont bite they dont eat anything else bright burntorange wings with black bands and shiny black legs and feet they just tickle when they crawl on your hand i kept some in a box for a while gathered them milkweed seeds and let them drink out of a bit of wet cloth her lips which had softened tightened again till one of my brothers upset the box and mama made me throw them out it was winter by then mm well that had worked till shed reached the tailpiece but nonetheless her body was relaxing the lingering shudders tamping out unexpectedly she said your turn uh she poked his chest with a suddenly determined finger i told you my useless thing now you have to tell me one well that seems fair he had to allow but i cant think of and then he did oh he was silent for a little i havent thought of this in years theres a place we wentstill goevery summer and fall a gathering camp at a place called hickory lake maybe a hundred and fifty miles northwest of here hickory nuts elderberries and a kind of water lily root which is a staple of oursharvesting and planting in one operation lakewalkers farm too in our way spark a lot of wet work but fun if youre a child who likes to swim maybe can show anyway i was oh maybe eight or nine and id been sent out in a poleboat to collect elderberries in the margins around behind the islands forget why i was by myself that day hickory lake sits on clay soil and tends to be muddy and brown most of the time but in the undisturbed back channels the water is wonderfully clear i could see right to the bottom bright as glassforge crystal the water weeds wound down and around each other like waving green feathers and floating on the top were these flat lily padsnot the ones whose roots we eat not planted not useful they just grew there probably from before there ever were lakewalkers deep green with red edges and thin red lines running down the stems in the water and their lily flowers had just opened up floating there like sunbursts white as as nothing i had ever seen these translucent petals veined like milky dragonfly wings glowing in the light reflecting off the water with luminous powdery gold centers seeming flowers within flowers spiraling in forever i should have been gathering but i just hung over the edge of the boat staring at them must have been an hour watching the light and the water dance around them in celebration i could not look away he gulped a suddenly difficult breath later in some very dry places the memory of that hour was enough to go on with a hesitant hand reached up and touched his face in something like awe one warm finger traced a cool smear of wet over his cheekbone why are you crying responses ran though his mind im not crying or im just picking up reverberations from your ground or i must be more tired than i thought two of which were somewhat true instead his tongue found the truth entire because i had forgotten water lilies he dropped his lips to the top of her head letting the scent of her fill his nose his mouth and you just made me remember does it hurt in a way spark but its a good way she cuddled down thoughtfully her ear pressed to his chest hm the smell of her hair reminded him of mown hay and new bread without being quite either mingled now with the fragrance of her soft warm body a faint mist of sweat shimmered on her upper lip in the afternoons heat the notion of lapping it off followed up with a lingering exploration of the taste of her mouth flashed through his mind he was suddenly keenly aware of how full his arm was of round young woman and how the heat of the hour seemed to be collecting in his groin if youve a brain left in your head old patroller let her go now this was not the time or the place or the partner he had let his groundsense grow far too open to her ground very dangerous in fact to list everything wrong with the impulse he would have to sit here wrapped around her for another hour which would be a mistake grievous grievous mistake he took a deep breath and reluctantly unwound his arm from her shoulders his arm protested its cooling emptiness she emitted a disappointed mew and sat up blinking sleepily its getting hotter he said best id see to those dogs her hand trailed over his shirt falling back as he creaked to his feet youll be all right resting here a while no dont get up bring me that mending basket then and your shirt and sleeve off that fence if theyre dry enough im not used to sitting around doing nothing with my hands its not your mending its not my house food water or bedding either she raked her curls out of her eyes they owe you for the malice spark this farm and everything in it she wriggled her fingers and looked stern at him and he melted all right basket but no bouncing around while my back is turned you hear the bleedings really slowed she offered maybe after that first rush itll tail off quick same way hope so he gave her an encouraging nod and went inside to retrieve the basket fawn watched dag trudge off around the barn then bent to his rippedup shirt after that she sorted through the mending basket for other simple tasks that she could not spoil it was hazardous to mess with another womans system but the more worn and tattered garments seemed safe to attempt this stained childs dress for example she wondered how many people had lived here and where they had got off to it was unsettling to think that she might be mending clothes for someone no longer alive in about an hour dag reappeared he stopped by the well to strip off his illfitting scavenged shirt and wash again with the slice of brown soap by which she concluded that the burial must have been a hot ugly and smelly job she could not picture how he had managed a shovel onehanded except slowly apparently he was pretty smooth at getting the bucket cranked up from the well and poured out into the trough though he ended by sticking his whole head in the bucket then shaking his hair out like a dog he had no linens to dry himself with but likely the wetness beading on his skin felt cooling and welcome she imagined herself drying his back fingers tracing down those long muscles speaking of keeping ones hands busy he hadnt seemed to mind her washing his hand last night but that had been by way of medical preparation shed liked the shape of his hand longfingered bluntnailed and strong he sat on the edge of the porch accepted his own shirt from her with a smile of thanks rolled up the sleeves and pulled it back on once more the sun was angling toward the treetops west where the lane vanished into the woods he stretched hungry spark you should eat a little she set the mending aside so should you maybe she could sit at the kitchen table and at least help fix the dinner this time he sat up straight suddenly staring down the lane after a minute the horse at the far end of the pasture raised its head too ears pricking in another minute a motley parade appeared from the trees four men one riding a plow horse and the others afoot some cows in a reluctant string half a dozen bleating sheep held in a bunch by desultory threats from a tall boy with a stick think someones made it home said dag his eyes narrowed but no more figures came out of the woods no patrollers though blight it wordlessly still eyeing the men and animals in the distance he rolled down his left sleeve and let it hang over his stump but not the right sleeve fawn noticed with a pinch of breath all the lively amusement faded out of his bony face leaving it closed and watchful once more chapter the farm folk spotted the pair on the porch about the time they exited the lane fawn guessed by the way they paused and stared taking stock the stringy old man on the horse stayed back under his eye the boy made himself busy taking down some rails and urging the sheep and cows into the pasture once the first few animals spread out in a lumbering burst of bawled complaint quickly converted to hungry grazing the rest followed willingly the three adult men advanced cautiously toward the house gripping tools like weapons a pitchfork a mattock a big skinning knife if those fellows are from here theyve just had some very bad days by all the signs dag said whether in a tone of warning or mere observation fawn was not certain stay calm and quiet till theyre sure im no threat how could they think that said fawn indignantly she straightened her spine against the house wall twitching the white folds of her overabundant gown tighter about her and frowned well theres a bit of history there some bandits have claimed to be patrollers in the past usually we leave bandits to their farmerbrethren but those we string up good if we catch em at it farmers cant always tell i expect thesell be all right once they get over being jumpy dag stayed seated on the porch edge as the men neared though he too sat up straighter he raised his right hand to his temple in what might have been a salute of greeting or just scratching his head but in either case conveyed no threat evenin he rasped the men sidled forward looking ready either to pounce or bolt at the slightest provocation the oldest a thickset fellow with a bit of gray in his hair and the pitchfork in his grip stepped in front his glance at fawn was bewildered she smiled back and waved her fingers provisionally polite the thickset man returned a how de he grounded the butt of his pitchfork and continued more sternly and who might you be and what are you doing here dag gave a nod im from mari redwings lakewalker patrol we were called down from the north a couple of days ago to help deal with your blight bogle this heres miss sawfield she was kidnapped off the road yesterday by the bogle i was hunting and injured id hoped to find folks here to help her but you were all gone not willingly by the signs hed left out an awful lot of important complications fawn thought only one was hers alone to speak to bluefield she corrected m names fawn bluefield dag glanced over his shoulder eyebrows rising ah right fawn tried to lighten the frowns of the farmers by saying brightly this your place ayup said the man glad you made it back is everyone all right a look of thankfulness in the midst of adversity came over the faces of all the men ayup the spokesman said again in a huff of blownout breath praise be we didnt suffer no one getting killed by those those things it was a near chance muttered a brownhaired fellow who looked to be a brother or cousin of the thickset man a younger man with bright chestnut hair and freckles slid around to dags left staring at his empty shirt cuff dag feigned not to notice the stare but fawn thought she detected a slight stiffening of his shoulders the man burst out heyyou wouldnt be that fellow dag all those other patrollers are looking for would you they said you couldnt hardly be mistooktall drink of water with his hair cropped short bright goldy eyes and missing his left hand he nodded in certainty taking inventory of the man on the porch dags voice was suddenly unguarded and eager youve seen my patrol where are they are they all right id expected them to find me before now the redhaired fellow made a wry face and said spread out between glassforge and that big hole back in the hills those crazy fellows were trying to make us dig i guess looking for you when you hadnt turned up in glassforge by this morning that scary old lady carried on like she was afraid you were dead in a ditch somewheres i had four different patrollers buttonhole me with your particulars before we got out of town dags lips lifted at that apt description of what fawn guessed must be his patrol leader mari the boy and the skinny graybeard on the horse once the fence rails were replaced drifted up to the edge of the group watch and listen the thickset man gripped his pitchfork haft tighter again although not in threat them other patrollers all said you must have killed the bogle they said that had to be what made all them monsters mudmen they calls em run off like that yesterday night more or less said dag a twitch of his hand dismissedor concealedthe details youre right to travel cautious there might still be a few bandits abroadthatll be for the glassforge folks to deal with any mudmen who escaped my patrol or chatos will be running mindless through the woods for a while till they die off i put down two yesterday but at least four i know of got away into the brush they wont attack you now but theyre still dangerous to surprise or corner like any sick wild animal the malicesbogleslair was up in the hills not eight miles due east of here you all were lucky to escape its attentions before this you two look like you collected some attentions yourselves said the thickset man frowning at their visible bruises and scrapes he turned to the lanky boy here tadgo fetch your mama the boy nodded eagerly and pelted back down the lane toward the woods what happened here dag asked in turn this released a spate of increasingly eager taletelling one man interrupting another with corroboration or argument some twenty or possibly thirty mudmen had erupted out of the surrounding woods four days ago brutalizing and terrifying the farm folk then driving them off in a twentymile march southeast into the hills the mudmen had kept the crowd under control by the simple expedient of carrying the three youngest children and threatening to dash out their brains against the nearest tree if anyone resisted a detail that made fawn gasp but dag merely look more expressionless than ever they had arrived at length at a crude campsite containing a couple dozen other prisoners mostly victims of road banditry some had been held for many weeks there the mudmen uneasily supervised by a few human bandits seemed intent on making their new slaves excavate a mysterious hole in the ground i dont understand that hole said the thickset man eldest son of the graybeard and apparent leader of the farm folk whose family name was horseford the stringy old grandfather seemed querulous and addledtraits that seemed to predate the malice attack fawn judged from the practiced but notunkind way everyone fielded his complaints the malicethe blight boglewas probably starting to try to mine said dag thoughtfully it was growing fast yes but the hole wasnt right for a mine either put in the redhaired man sassa hed turned out to be a brotherinlaw of the house present that day to help with some loghauling he seemed less deeply shaken than the rest possibly because his wife and baby had been safely back in glassforge and had missed the horrific misadventure altogether they didnt have enough tools for one thing till those mudmen brought in the ones they stole from here they had folks digging with their hands and hauling dirt in bags made out of their clothes it was an awful mess would be at first till the bogle caught someone with the knowhow to do it right said dag later when its safe again you folks should get some real miners to come in and explore the site there must be something of value under there the malice would not have been mistaken about that this part of the country id guess an iron or coal seam maybe with a forge planned to follow but it might be anything id wondered if they were digging up another bogle said sassa theyre supposed to come out of the ground they say dags brows twitched up and he eyed the man with new appraisal interesting idea when two bogles chance to emerge nearby which happily doesnt occur too often they usually attack each other first thing that would save you lakewalkers some trouble wouldnt it no unfortunately because the winning bogle ends up stronger easier to take them down piecemeal fawn tried to imagine something stronger and more frightening than the creature she had faced yesterday when you were already as terrified as your body could bear what difference could it make if something was even worse she wondered if that explained anything about dag movement at the end of the lane caught her eye another plow horse came out of the woods and trotted ponderously up to the farmyard a middleaged woman riding with the lanky boy up behind they paused on the other side of the well the woman staring down hard at something then came up to join the others the redhaired sassa either more garrulous or more observant than his inlaws was finishing his account of yesterdays inexplicable uproar at the digging camp the sudden loss of wits and mad flight of their captor mudmen followed not half an hour later by the arrival from the sunset woods of a very offbalance patrol of lakewalkers the lakewalkers had been trailed in turn by a mob of frantic friends and relatives of the captives from in and around glassforge leaving the local people to each others care the patrollers had withdrawn to their own lake walkerish concerns which seemed mainly to revolve around slaying all the mudmen they could catch and looking for their mysterious missing man dag who they seemed to think somehow responsible for the bizarre turn of events dag rubbed his stubbled chin huh i suppose mari or chato must have thought this mining camp might be the lair following up traces from that bandit hideout we raided night before last i expect that explains where they were all day yesterday and well into the night sounds like oh aye said the thickset man folks was still trailing into glassforge all night and into this morning yours and ours the farmwife slid down off the horse and stood listening to this her eyes searching her house dag and especially fawn fawn guessed from the farm mens talk that she must be the woman theyd called petti judging by the faint gray in her hair she was of an age with her husband and as lean as he was thick tough and strappy if tiredlooking now she stepped forward what blood is all that in the tub out by the well dag gave her a polite duck of his head miss sbluefields mostly maam my apologies for filching your linens ive been throwing another bucket of water on them each time i go by ill try to get them cleaned up better before we leave we not i some quick part of fawns mind noted at once with a catch of relief mostly the farmwife cocked her head at him squinting howd she get hurt that would be her tale to tell maam her face went still for an instant her eye flicked up to fawn and then back to take in his empty cuff you really kill that bogle that did all this he hesitated only briefly before replying precisely but unexpansively we did she inhaled and gave a little snort dont you be troubling about my laundry the idea she turned back to or upon her menfolk here what are you all doing standing about gabbing and gawking like a pack of ninnies theres work to do before dark horse see to milking those poor cows if they aint been frightened dry sassa fetch in the firewood if those thieves left any in the stack and if they didnt make some more jay put away and put right what can be what needs fixin start on what needs tomorrows tools set aside tad help your grandpa with the horses and then come and start picking up inside hop to it while theres light left they scattered at her bidding fawn said helpfully pushing up the mudmen didnt find your storage cellar and then her head seemed to drain throbbing unpleasantly the world did not go black but patterned shadows swarmed around her and she was only dimly aware of abrupt movement a strong hand and truncated arm catching her and halfwalking halfcarrying her inside she blinked her eyes clear to find herself on the feather pallet once more two faces looming over her the farmwifes concerned and wary dags concerned and tender the thought jolted her and she blinked some more trying to swim back to reason flat spark he was saying flat was working he brushed a sweatdampened curl out of her eyes what happened to you girl demanded petti m not a girl fawn mumbled m twenty the mudmen knocked her around hard yesterday dags intent gaze on her seemed to be asking permission to continue and she shrugged assent she miscarried of a twomonths child bled pretty fierce but it seems to have slowed now wish one of my patrol women were here you do much midwifery maam a little keeping her lying down is right if shes been bleeding much how do you know if she if a woman is going to be all right after that if the bleeding tails off to nothing within five days its a pretty sure bet things are coming back around all right inside if theres no fever ten days at the most a twomonths child well thats as chance will happen much more than three months now that gets more dangerous five days he repeated as if memorizing the number right were still all right then fever he shook his head and rose to his feet wincing as he rubbed his left arm and followed the farmwifes gaze around her kitchen with an apologetic nod he removed his arm contraption from her table bundled it up and set it down at the end of the tick and what knocked you around asked petti this and that over the years he answered vaguely if my patrol doesnt find us by tomorrow id like to take miss bluefield to glassforge i have to report in will there be a wagon the farmwife nodded later on the girls should bring it tomorrow when they come the other women and children of the horseford family were staying in town with sassas wife it seemed sorting out recovered goods and waiting for their men to report the farm safe again will they be making another trip after might depends she scrubbed the back of her neck staring around as if a hundred things cried for her attention and she only had room in her head for ten which fawn guessed was just about the case what can i do for you maam dag inquired she stared at him as if taken by surprise by the offer dont know yet everythings been knocked all awhirl just just wait here she marched off to take a look around her smashedup house fawn whispered to dag shes not going to get settled in her mind till she has her things back in order i sensed that he bent over and took up the knife pouch lying by the head of the pallet only then did fawn realize how careful hed been not to glance at it while the farmwife was present can you put this somewhere out of sight fawn nodded and sat upslowlyto flip open her bedroll laid at the pallets foot her spare skirt and shirt and underdrawers lay atop the one good dress shed packed along to go look for work in that hasty night shed fled home she tucked the knife pouch well away and rolled up the blanket once more he nodded approval and thanks best not to mention the knife to these folks i think bothersome that one worse than most and under his breath wish mari would get here they could hear the farmwifes quick footsteps on the wooden floors overhead and occasional wails of dismay mostly my poor windows i noticed you left a lot out of your story said fawn yes id appreciate it if you would too i promised didnt i i sure dont want to talk about that knife to just anyone either if they ask too many questions or too close of ones just ask them about their troubles in turn itll usually divert them when they have so much to tell as now ah so thats what you were doing out there in retrospect she could spot how dag had turned the talk so that they had learned so much of the horsefords woes but the horsefords had received so little news in return another old patroller trick one corner of his mouth twitched up more or less the farmwife came back downstairs about the time her son tad came in from the barn and after a moments thought she sent the boy and dag off together to clean up broken glass and rubble around the house she surveyed her kitchen and climbed down into her storage cellar from which she emerged with a few jars for supper seeming much reassured after setting the jars in a row on the tablefawn could almost see her counting stomachs and planning the upcoming meal in her headshe turned back and frowned down at fawn well have to get you into a proper bed birdys room i think once tad gets the glass out it wasnt too bad otherwise and then after a pause in a much lower voice that patroller fellow tell the straight story on you yes maam said fawn the womans face pinched in suspicion cause he didnt get those scratches on his face from no mudman ill warrant fawn looked back blankly then said oh those scratches i mean yes that was me but it was an accident i mistook him for another bandit at first we got that one straightened out right quick lakewalkers is strange folk black magicians they say fawn struggled up on one elbow to say hotly you should be grateful if they are because blight bogles are blacker ones i saw one yesterday closer than you are to me now anything patrollers have to do to put them down is all right by me pettis thoughts seemed to darken was that whatdid the blight bogle blight you make me miscarry aye because girls dont usually miscarry just from being knocked around or falling down stairs or the like though ive seen some try for it they just end up being bruised mothers usually yes said fawn shortly scrunching back down it was the bogle were these tooclose questions not yet she decided even dag had offered some explanations just enough to satisfy without begging more questions it was ugly uglier than the mudmen even bogles kill everything they touch seemingly you should go look at its lair later the woods are all dead for a mile around i dont know how long it will take for them to grow back hm petti busied herself unsealing jars sniffing for wholesomeness and fishing out the broken wax to be rinsed and remelted later them mudmen was ugly enough the day before we was brought to the digging camp seems there was a woman had a sick child who went to them and insisted on being let go to get him help she tried carrying on weeping and wailing to force them instead they killed her little boy and ate him she was in a state by the time we got there everybody was even them bandits who i dont think was in their right minds either wasnt too easy about that one fawn shuddered dag said the mudmen ate folks i wasnt sure i believed him till after afterwards she hitched her shoulders lakewalkers hunt those things they go looking for them hm the woman frowned as she kept trying to assemble the meal by her normal routine and coming up short against missing tools and vessels but she improvised and went on much as fawn had she added from across the room after a while they say lakewalkers can beguile folks minds look you fawn lurched back up on her elbow scowling i say that lakewalker saved my life yesterday at least twice no three times because id have bled to death in the woods trying to walk out if hed died in the fight he fought off five of those mudmen he took care of me all last night when i couldnt move for the pain and carried out my bloody clouts with never a word of complaint and he cleaned up your kitchen and he fixed your fence and he buried your dogs nice in the shady woods and he didnt have to do any of that and his heart breaks for the memory of water lilies ive seen that man do more good with one hand in a day than ive seen any other man do with two in a week or ever if hes beguiled my mind he sure has done it the hard way the farmwife had both her hands raised as if to ward off this hot pelting defense halflaughing stop stop i surrender girl huh fawn flopped back again just dont you give me any more they says hm pettis smile dwindled to bleakness but whatever shadowed her thoughts now she did not confide to fawn fawn lay quietly on her pallet till dusk drove the men indoors at that point tad was made to carry off the feather tick and the space was used for a trestle table makeshift benchesboards placed across sawedoff logswere brought in to serve for the missing chairs petti allowed to dag as how she thought it all right for fawn to sit up long enough to take the meal with the family since the alternative appeared to be having petti bring her something in bed in some lonely nook of the house fawn agreed decisively to this the meal was abundant if makeshift and simple eaten by the limited light of candle stubs and the fire at the end of the long summer day everyone would be going to bed right after not just her fawn thought the room was hot and the conversation at first scant and practical all were exhausted their minds filled with the recent disruptions in their lives since everyone was mostly eating with their hands anyhow dags slight awkwardness did not stick out fawn observed with satisfaction you wouldnt think his missing hand bothered him a bit unless you noticed how he never raised his left wrist into sight above the table edge he spoke only to encourage fawn next to him to eat up though about that he was quite firm kind o you to help tad with all that busted glass the farmwife said to dag no trouble maam you should all be able to step safe now leastways sassa offered ill help you to get new windows in petti soon as things are settled a bit she gave her brotherinlaw a grateful look thankee sassa grandfather horseford grumbled oiled cloth stretched on the frames was good enough in my day to which his grayhaired son responded only have some more pan bread pa the land might still be the old mans in name at least but it was plain that the house was pettis inevitably fawn supposed the talk turned to picking over the past days disasters dag who looked to fawns eye as though he was growing tired and no wonder was not expansive she watched him successfully use his diversion trick of answering a question with a question four times running until sassa remarked to him sighing too bad your patrol didnt get there a day sooner they mightve saved that poor little boy who got et dag did not exactly wince it was merely a lowering of his eyelids a slight unargumentative tilt of his head a shift of his features from tired to expressionless and silence fawn sat up offended for him careful what you wish after if dags patrol had got there anytime before iwebefore the bogle died and the mudmen ran off thered have been a big fight lots of folks might have gotten killed and that little boy too sassa brow furrowed turned to her yes butet doesnt it bother you extra it sure bothers me its what mudmen do murmured dag sassa eyed him disconcerted used to it are you dag shrugged but it was a child everyones someones child petti whod been staring wearily at her plate looked up at that in a tone of cheery speculation jay said if theyd have been five days faster wed not have been raided and our cows and sheep and dogs would still be alive wish for that while youre at it why dont you with a grimace that failed to quite pass as a smile dag pushed himself up from the table he gave petti a nod scuse me maam he closed the kitchen door quietly behind him his booted steps sounded across the porch then faded into the night what bit him asked jay petti took a breath jay some days i think your mama must have dropped you on your head when you was a baby really i do he blinked in bewilderment at her scowl and said less in inquiry than protest what for the first time in hours fawn found herself chilled again chilled and shaking her wan droop did not escape the observant petti here girl you should be in bed horse help her horse mercifully was much quieter than his younger relations or perhaps his wife had given him some lowdown on their outlandish guests in private he propelled fawn through the darkening house the loss of light was not from her going woozy this time though her skull was throbbing again petti followed with a candle in a cup for a makeshift holder the ground floor of one of the addons consisted of two small bedrooms opposite each other horse steered fawn inside to where her feather tick had been laid across a wooden bed frame the slashed rope webbing had been reknotted sometime recently maybe by dag and tad a moist summer night breeze wafted through the small glassless windows fawn decided this must be a daughters bedchamber the girls would likely be arriving home tomorrow with the wagon as soon as the transport was safely accomplished petti shooed horse out awkwardly fawn swapped out her dressings halfhiding under a light blanket that she scarcely needed petti made no comment on them beyond a give over here and a there you go now a day ago fawn reflected she would have given anything to trade her strange man helper for a strange woman tonight the desire was oddly reversed horse n me have the room across said petti you can call out if you need anything in the night thank you said fawn trying to feel grateful she supposed it would not be understood if she asked for the kitchen floor back the floor and dag where would these graceless farmers try to put the patroller in the barn the thought made her glower long unmistakable footfalls sounded in the hall followed by a sharp double rap against the door come in dag fawn called before petti could say anything he eased inside a stack of dry garments lay over his left arm the laundry fawn had seen draped over the pasture fence earlier fawns blue dress and linen drawers underneath were his own trousers and drawers that had been so spectacularly bloodied yesterday he had her bedroll tucked under his armpit he laid the bedroll down in a swept corner of the room with her cleaned clothes atop there you go spark thank you dag she said simply his smile flickered across his face like light on water gone in the instant didnt anyone ever just say thank you to patrollers she was really beginning to wonder with a wary nod at the watching petti he stepped to fawns bedside and laid his palm on her brow warm he commented he traded the palm for the inside of his wrist fawn tried to feel his pulse through their skins as she had listened to his heartbeat without success but not feverish he added under his breath he stepped back a little his lips tightening fawn remembered those lips breathing in her hair last night and suddenly wanted nothing more than to kiss and be kissed good night by them was that so wrong somehow petris frowning presence made it so what did you find outside she asked instead not my patrol he sighed not for a mile in any direction leastways do you suppose theyre all still looking on the wrong side of glassforge could be it looks like its fixing to rain heat lightning off to the west if i really were stuck in a ditch i wouldnt be sorry but i hate to think of them running around in the woods in the dark and wet in fear for me when im snug inside and safe im going to hear about that later i expect oh dear dont worry spark another day it will be the other way around and then it will be my turn to be ah humorous his eyes glinted in a way that made her want to laugh will we really go to glassforge tomorrow well see see how youre doing in the morning for one im doing much better tonight bleedings no worse than a monthly now do you want your hot stone again really i dont think i need it anymore good sleep hard then you she smiled shyly ill try his hand made a little move toward her but then fell back to his side good night gnight dag you sleep hard too he gave her a last nod and withdrew the farmwife carried the candle out with her closing the door firmly behind a faint flash of the heat lightning dag had mentioned came through the window too far away even to hear the thunder but otherwise all was darkness and silence fawn rolled over and tried to obey dags parting admonishment hold up murmured the farmwife and since she carried the only light the stub melting down to a puddle in the clay cup dag did so she shouldered past and led him to the kitchen another candle and a last dying flicker from the fireplace showed the trestle table and benches taken down and stowed by the wall and the plates and vessels from dinner stacked on the drainboard by the sink along with the bucket of water refilled the farmwife looked around the shadows and sighed ill deal with the rest of this in the morning i guess belying her words she moved to cover and set aside the scant leftover food including a stack of pan bread she had apparently cooked up with breakfast in mind where do you want me to sleep maam dag inquired politely not with fawn obviously he tried not to remember the scent of her hair like summer in his mouth or the warmth of her breathing young body tucked under his arm you can have one of those ticks that little girl mended put it down where you will the porch maybe i can watch out for my people if any come out of the woods in the night and not wake the house i could pull it into the kitchen if it comes on to rain thatd be good said the farmwife dag peered through the empty window frame into the darkness letting his groundsense reach out the animals scattered in the pasture were calm some grazing some halfasleep that mare isnt actually mine we found it at the bogles lair and rode it out do you recognize it for anyones petti shook her head not ours anyways if i ride it to glassforge it would be nice to not be jumped for horse thieving before i can explain i thought you patrollers claimed a fee for killing a bogle you could claim it dag shrugged i already have a horse leastways i hope so if no one comes forward for this one i thought i might have it go to miss bluefield its sweettempered with easy paces which is part of what inclines me to think it wasnt a bandits horse or not for long petti paused staring down at her store of food nice girl that miss bluefield yes you wonder how she got in this fix not my tale maam aye i noticed that about you what that he told no tales accidents happen to the young she went on twenty eh so she says you aint twenty she moved to kneel by the fire and poke it back for the night no not for a long time now you could take that horse and ride back to your patrol tonight if youre that worried about them that girl would be all right here id take her in till shes mended that had been precisely his plan yesterday it seemed a very long time ago good of you to offer but i promised to see her safe to glassforge which was where she was bound also i want mari to look her over my patrol leadershell be able to tell if fawns healing all right aye figured youd say something like that i aint blind she sighed stood turned to face him with her arms crossed and then what pardon do you even know what youre doing to her standing there with them cheekbones up in the air no i dont suppose you do dag shifted from cautious to confused that the far m wife was shrewd and observant he had certainly noticed but he did not understand her underlying distress in this matter i mean her only good sure you do she frowned fiercely i had a cousin once dag tilted his head in faint encouragement torn between curiosity and an entirely unmagical premonition that wherever she was going with this tale he didnt want to go along real nice young fellow handsome too petti continued he got a job as a horse boy at that hotel in glassforge where your patrols always stay when theyre passing through these parts there was this patroller girl young one came there with her patrol very pretty very tall very nice very nice to him he thought patrol leaders try to discourage that sort of thing aye so i understood too bad they dont succeed didnt take too long for him to fall mad in love with the girl he spent the whole next year just waiting for her patrol to come back which it did and she was nice to him again dag waited not comfortably third year the patrol came again but she did not seems she was only visiting and had gone back to her own folks way west of here thats usual for training up young patrollers we send them to other camps for a season or two or more they learn other ways make friends if ever we have to combine forces in a hurry it makes everything easier if some patrollers already know each others routes and territories the ones training up to be leaders we send em around to all seven hinterlands they say of those that theyve walked around the lake she eyed him you ever walk around the lake twice he admitted hm she shook her head and went on he got the notion he would go after her volunteer to join with you lakewalkers ah said dag that would not work its not a matter of pride or ill will you understand we just have skills and methods that we cannot share you mean to say not pride or ill will alone i think said the woman her voice going flat dag shrugged not my tale let it go old patroller he did find her eventually as you say the lakewalkers wouldnt have him came back after about six months with his tail between his legs bleak and pining wouldnt look at no other girl drank it was like if he couldnt be in love with her hed be in love with death instead you dont have to be a farmer for that maam dag said coolly she spared him a sharp glance thats as may be he never settled after that he finally took a job with the keelboat men down on the grace river after a couple of seasons we heard hed fallen off his boat and drowned i dont think it was deliberate they said hed been drunk and had gone to piss over the side in the night just careless but a kind of careless that dont happen to other folks maybe that had been the trouble with his own schemes dag thought he had never been careless enough if dag had been twenty instead of thirtyfive when the darkness had overtaken him it might have all worked rather differently we never heard back from that patroller girl he was just a bit of passin fun to her i guess she was the end of the world to him though dag held his silence she inhaled and drove on so if you think its amusin to make that girl fall in love with you i say it wont seem so funny down the road i dont know whats in it for you but theres no future for her your people will see to that if hers wont you and i both know thatbut she dont maam youre seeing things very plausible things maybe given that she could not know the true matter of the sharing knife that bound dag and fawn so tightly to each other at least for now he wasnt about to try to explain the knife to this exhausted edgy woman i know what im seeing thank you kindly it aint the first time neither ive scarcely known the girl a day oh aye whatll it be after a week then the woodsll catch fire i guess she snorted derision all i know is in the long haul when folks tangle hearts with your folks they end up dead or wishing they was dag unclenched his jaw and gave her a short nod maam in the long haul all folks end up dead or wishing they were she just shook her head lips twisting good night he touched his hand to his temple and went to haul the tick stuffed into the next room out onto the porch if little spark was able to travel at all tomorrow he decided they would leave this place as soon as might be chapter to dags discontent no patrollers emerged from the woods that night either before or after the rain drove him inside he did not see fawn again till they met over the breakfast trestle they were both back in their own clothes dry and only faintly stained in the shabby blue dress she looked almost well except for a lingering paleness a check of the insides of her eyelids and of her fingernails showed them not as rosy as he thought they ought to be and she still grew dizzy if she attempted to stand too suddenly but his hand on her brow felt no fever good he was pressing her to eat more bread and drink more milk when the boy tad burst through the kitchen door wideeyed and gasping ma pa uncle sassa theres one of them mudmen in the pasture worrying the sheep dag exhaled wearily the three farm men around the table leaped up in a panic and scattered to find their toolweapons dag loosened his war knife in its belt sheath and stepped out onto the porch fawn and the farmwife followed peering fearfully around him petti clutching a formidable kitchen knife at the far end of the pasture a naked manform had pounced across the back of a bleating sheep face buried in its woolly neck the sheep bucked and threw the creature off the mudman fell badly as if its arms were numb and could not properly catch itself it rose shook itself and half loped half crawled after the intended prey the rest of the flock bewildered trotted a few yards away then turned to stare worried dag murmured to the women id say those sheep are downright appalled that mudman must have been made from a dog or a wolf see its trying to move like one but nothing works it cant use its hands like a man and it cant use its jaws like a wolf its trying to tear that silly sheeps throat out but all its getting is a mouthful of wool yech he shook his head in exasperation and pity stepped off the porch and strode toward the pasture behind him petti gasped and fawn muffled a squeak he jogged to the end of the lane to circle between the mudman and the woods then hopped up and swung his legs over the rail fence he stretched his shoulders and shook out his right arm trying to work out the soreness and knots and drew his knife the morning air was heavy with moisture gray on the ground lilac and pale pink rising to turquoise in the sky beyond the tree line the grass was wet from the rain beaded droplets glimmering like scattered silver and the saturated soil squelched under his boots he weaved around a few sodden cow flops and eased toward the mudman aptly namedthe creature was filthy smeared with dung hair matted and falling in its eyes and it whiffed of nascent rot its flesh was already starting to lose tone and color the skin mottled and yellowish its lips drew back as it snarled at dag and froze undecided between attack and flight jump me you clumsy suffering nightmare spare me the sweat of chasing you down come along dag crooned crouching a little and bringing his arms in end this ill get you out of there i promise the creatures hips wriggled as it leaned forward and dag braced himself as it sprang he almost missed his move as it stumbled on the lunge hands pawing the air neck twisting and straining in a vain attempt to bring its alltoohuman jaw to dags neck dag blocked one blackclawed hand with his left arm spun sideways and slashed hard he jumped back as hot blood spurted from the creatures neck trying to save himself more laundry duty the mudman managed three steps away yowling wordlessly before it fell to the mucky ground dag circled in cautiously but no further mercy cut was required the mudman shuddered and grew still eyes glazed and halfopen a tuft of dirty wool stuck to its lips stopped fluttering absent gods this is an ugly cleanup chore but neatly enough done this time he wiped his blade on the grass making plans to beg a dry rag from the farmwife in a moment he stood up and turned to see the farm men huddled in a terrified knot clutching their tools staring at him openmouthed tad came running from the fence and was caught around the waist by his father as he attempted to approach the corpse i told you to stay back its dead pa tad wriggled free and gazed up with a glowing face at dag he just walked right up to it and took it down slick as anything ah the last mudmen these folk had encountered had still been bound by the will of their maker intelligent and lethal not like this forsaken sick confused animal trapped in its awkward body dag didnt feel any overwhelming need to correct the farm mens misperceptions of his daring safer if they remained cautious of the mudmen anyway his lips curled up in grim amusement but he said only its my job you can have the burying of it though the farm men gathered around the corpse poking it at toolhandle distance dag strolled past them toward the house not looking back most of the animals had collected in the upper end of the pasture away from the disturbing intruder the bay mare raised her head and snuffled at him as he approached he paused wiped his knife dry on her warm side sheathed it and scratched her poll which made her flop her ears sideways droop her lip and sigh contentedly the farmwifes tart suggestion of last night that he take the mare and ride off surfaced in his memory tempting idea yes but not alone he climbed the fence crossed the yard and made his way up onto the porch fawn gazed up at him with nearly as worshipful an expression as tad only with keener understanding the farmwife had her arms crossed torn between gratitude and glowering dag was suddenly mortally tired of mistrustful strangers he missed his patrol for all their irritations he almost missed the irritations in their comfortable familiarity hey little spark i was going to wait for the wagon and take you to glassforge lying flat but i got to thinking we might double up and ride out the way we came in the other day and you wouldnt be jostled around any worse her face lit better i should think that lane would rattle your teeth in a wagon even taking it slowly and carefully we could reach town in about three hours time if you think it wouldnt overtire you leave now you mean ill pack my bedroll itll only take a moment she twirled about put my arm harness in it will you along with the other things arm harness knife pouch and the linen bag of shattered bone and dreamseverything else that hed arrived in he was wearing everything hed borrowed was put back she paused lips pursing as if following the same inventory then nodded vigorously right dont bounce dont scamper either gently he called after her the kitchen door shut on her trailing laugh he turned to find petti giving him a measuring look he raised his brows back at her she shrugged and said on a sigh not my business i suppose he bit back rude agreement converting the impulse to a more polite nod and turned to collect the mare by the time hed reaffixed the rope to the halter for reins and led the horse to the porch murmuring promises of grain and a nice stall in glassforge into the fuzzy flicking ears fawn was back out breathless with her bedroll slung over her shoulder pelting petti with goodbyes and thankyous the honest warmth of them drew an answering smile from the farmwife seemingly despite herself you be a lot more careful of yourself now girl petti admonished dag will look after me fawn assured her cheerily oh aye petti sighed after a momentary pause and dag wondered what comment shed just bit back thats plain from the mounting block of the porch dag slid readily aboard the mares bare back happily the horse had widesprung ribs and no bony back ridge and so was as comfortable to sit as a cushion he needed to beg neither saddle nor pads from the farm he stiffened his right ankle to make a stirrup of his foot for fawn and she scrambled up and sat across his lap as before wriggling into place she smoothed her skirts and slipped her right arm around him a little to his surprise petti shuffled forward and thrust a wrapped packet into fawns hands its only bread and jam but itll keep you on the road dag touched his temple thank you maam for everything his hand found the rope reins again she nodded stiffly you too and after a moment you just think about what i said patroller or just think anyways this seemed to call for either no answer at all or a long defensive argument dag prudently chose the first helped fawn tuck the packet in her bedroll nodded again and turned the horse away he extended his groundsense to its limit in one last check but nothing resembling an aggravated patroller beating through the bushes stirred for a mile in any direction nor more distraught dying mudmen either the bay mares hooves scythed through the wiry chicory its blossoms looking like bits of blue sky fallen and scattered along the ruts and the nodding daisies the farm men were dragging the mudmans corpse into the woods as they rode down the fence line they all waved and sassa trotted over to the end of the lane in time to say off to glassforge already ill be going in soon if you see any of our folks tell them were all right see you in town sure said fawn and maybe said dag he added if any of my people turn up here would you tell them were all right and that ill meet them in town too course sassa promised cheerily and then the track curved into the woods and the farm and all its folk fell out of sight behind dag breathed relief as the quiet of the humid summer morning closed in broken only by the gentle thump of the mares hooves the liquid trill of a redcrest and the rainrefreshed gurgle of the creek that the road followed a striped ground squirrel flickered across the track ahead of them disappearing with a faint rustle into the weeds fawn cuddled down her head resting on his chest and allowed herself to be rocked along not speaking for a while ambushed again by the deep fatigue of her blood loss after the dawns spate of excitement dag judged like other injured younglings hed known she seemed likely to overestimate her capacity swinging between imprudent activity and collapse he hoped her recovery would be as swift she made a warm and comfortable burden balanced on his lap the mares walk was certainly smoother than a wagon would have been in these muddy ruts and he had no intention of jostling either of them with a trot a few mosquitoes whined around them in the damp shade and he gently bumped them away from her fair skin with a flick of his ground against theirs the scent of her skin and hair the moving curve of her breasts as she breathed and the pressure of her thighs on his stimulated him but not nearly so much as the light the contentment and the flattering sense of safety swirling through her complex ground she was not herself aroused but her air of openness of sheer physical acceptance of his presence made him unreasonably happy in turn like a man warmed by a fire the deep red note of her inmost injury still lurked underneath and the violet shadings of her bruises clouded her ground as they did her flesh but the sharpedged glints of pain were much reduced she could not sense his ground in turn she was unaware of his lingering inspection a lakewalker woman would have felt his keen regard seeing just as deeply into him if he did not close himself off and keep closed trading blindness for privacy feeling guiltily perverse he indulged his inner senses upon fawn without excuse of needor fear of selfrevelation it was a little like watching water lilies rather more like smelling a dinner he was not allowed to eat was it possible to be starved for so long as to forget the taste of food for the pangs of hunger to burn out like ash it seemed so but both the pleasure and the pain were his hearts secret here he was put in mind suddenly of the soil at the edge of a recovering blight the weedy bedraggled look of it unlovely yet hopeful blight was a numb gray thing without sensation did the return of green life hurt odd thought she stirred opening her eyes to stare into the shadows of the woods here mostly beech elm and red oak with an occasional towering cottonwood or in more open areas around the stream stubby dogwood or redbud long past their blooming splashes of the climbing sun spangled the leaves of the upper branches sparking off lingering water drops how will you find your patrol in glassforge she asked theres this hotel patrols stay atwe make it our headquarters when were in this area nice change from sleeping on the ground itll also be our medicine tent im pretty sure that more patrollers than my partner saun took blows when we jumped those bandits the other night so thats where theyll be holed up theyre used to our ways there will you be there long not sure chatos patrol was on their way south over the grace river to trade for horses when they got waylaid by this trouble and my patrol was riding a pattern up northeast when we broke off to come here depends on the injured i suspect she said thoughtfully lakewalkers dont run the hotel do they its glassforge folks right right what all jobs do they do in a hotel he raised his brows chambermaid cook scullion horse boy handyman laundress lots of things i could do some of that maybe i could get work there dag tensed did petti tell you about her cousin cousin she peered up at him without guile evidently not nonever mind the couple that run the place have owned it for years its built on the site of an old inn i think which was his fathers before mari would know its brick three floors high very fine they burn brick as well as glass in glassforge you know she nodded i saw some houses in lumpton market once they say were built from glassforge brick must have been quite a job hauling it he shifted a little beneath her in any case therell be no work for you till you stop fainting when you jump up some days yet i expect if you eat up and rest i suppose she said doubtfully but i dont have much money my patrol will put you up he said firmly we owe you for a malice remember we owe you for your sacrifice yes all right but i need to look ahead now im on my own im glad i met all those horsefords nice folks maybe theyll introduce me around help get me a start would she not go home neither the picture of her dragging back to the realm of stupid sunny nor the notion of her as a glassforge chambermaid pleased him much best see what mari has to say about that knife before making plans mm her eyes darkened and she huddled down again the peace of the woodland descended again easing dags spirit the light and air and solitude the placid mare moving warmly beneath him and fawn curled against him with her ground slowly releasing its accumulation of anguish put him wholly in a present that required nothing more of him nor he of it released for a moment from an endless chain of duty and task tautly pulling him into a weary future not chosen merely accepted howre you doing he murmured into fawns hair pain no worse than when i was sitting up at breakfast anyhow better than last night this is all right good dag she hesitated mm what do lakewalker women do who get in a fix like mine the question baffled him which fix she gave a small snort i suppose i have been collecting troubles lately a baby and no husband was the one i was thinking of grass widowhood he could sense the grating of grief and guilt through her with that reminder it doesnt exactly work like that for us she frowned are young lakewalkers all really really um virtuous he laughed softly no if by virtuous you just mean keeping their trousers buttoned other virtues are more in demand but young is young farmer or lakewalker pretty much everyone goes through an awkward period of fumbling around finding things out you said a woman invites a man to her tent if hes a lucky man then how do she trailed off in confusion he finally figured out what she was asking oh its our grounds again the time of the month when a woman can conceive shows as a beautiful pattern in her ground if the time and place are wrong for a child she and her man just pleasure each other in ways that dont lead to children fawns silence following this extended for a quite a long time then she said what which what how do people people can do that how dag swallowed uneasily how much could this girl not know by the evidence so far quite a lot he reflected ruefully how far back did he need to begin wellhands for one hands touching each other till they trade release tongues and mouths and other things too she blinked release touch each other as youd touch yourself only with a better angle and company and well just better all around less lonely her face screwed up oh boys do that i know i guess girls could do it for them too do they like it um generally he said cautiously this unexpected turn of the conversation sped his mind and his body was following fast calm yourself old patroller fortunately she could not sense the heated ripple in him girls like it too in my experience another long digestive silence is this some lakewalker lady thing magic there are tricks you can do with your grounds to make it better but no lakewalker ladies and farmer girls are equally magical in this anyway farmers have grounds too they just cant sense them absent gods be thanked her expression now was intensely cogitative and a stuttering swirl of arousal had started in her as well it wasnt he realized suddenly just her hurts that blocked its flow something that halfblood woman at tripoint had once told him that hed scarcely believed came back to him now that some farmer women never learned how to pleasure themselves or to find release shed laughed at his expression come come dag boys practically trip over their own parts womens are all tucked neatly up inside they can be just as tricky for us as for the farmer boys to find manys the farmwife has me to thank for providing her man with the treasure map scandalized as shed be to learn it since hed had much to thank her for as well hed set about it dismissing the ineptness of farm boys from his mind and in a short time from hers that had been a long time ago what other things fawn said beg pardon besides hands and tongues and mouths just dont not never mind and now his arousal had grown to serious physical discomfort atop a horse of all things there were many things not to try on a horse even one as goodnatured as this mare he couldnt avoid remembering several of them which didnt help spark couldnt sense his ground he could stand in front of her rigid with mindnumbing lust and as long as he kept his trousers on she wouldnt know and considering all her recent disastrous experiences she oughtnt to know bad if she laughed no upon reflection good if she laughed bad if she was disgusted or horrified or frightened taking him for another lout like stupid sunny or that poor fool hed shot in the backside if it grew too excruciating he could slip off the horse and disappear into the woods for a spell pretending to be answering a call of nature which he would be no lie there stop it you did this to yourself suffer in silence think of something else you can control your body she cant tell she sighed rustled about and gazed up into his face your eyes change color with the light she observed in a tone of new interest in the sun theyre all bright gold like coins in the shade they go brown like clear spice tea in the night theyre black like deep pools she added after a moment theyre really dark right now mm said dag every breath brought her heady scent to his mouth to his mind he could not very well stop breathing a flash of motion at treetop height caught both their eyes look a redtailed hawk she cried isnt he beautiful her head and body turned to follow the pale cleancut shape ruddy translucent tail feathers almost glowing against the washed blue of the sky and her hot small hand came down to support herself directly on dags aching erection his startled recoil was so abrupt he fell off the horse he landed on his back with a breathstealing thump thankfully she landed atop him and not underneath her weight was soft upon him her breath accelerated by the shock her pupils were too wide for this light and as she twisted around and thrust out one hand to support herself her gaze grew fixed upon his mouth yes kiss me do his hand spasmed and he laid it out flat and stiff palm up upon the grass lest he lunge at her he moistened his lips the damp of the grass and the soil began soaking into the back of his shirt and trousers he could feel every curve of her body pressed into his and every curse of her ground absent gods he was halfway to groundlock all by himself are you all right she gasped terror shot through him wilting his arousal that the fall might have torn something loose inside her to start her bleeding again like the first day it would take the better part of hour to carry her back to the farm and in her current depleted state she might not survive another such draining she scrambled off him and plunked herself ungracefully on the ground panting are you all right he asked urgently in turn i guess so she winced a little but she rubbed her elbow not her belly he sat up and ran his hand through his hair fool fool blight you pay attention you might have killed her what happened she asked i thought i saw something out of the corner of my eye but it was just a trick of the light i didnt mean to shy like a horse which had to be the weakest excuse for an excuse hed ever uttered the mare in fact was less shaken than either of them she had sidestepped as theyd gone over but now stood peacefully a few yards off looking at them in mild astonishment no further excitement seeming forthcoming she put her head down and nibbled a weed yes well after that mudman this morning its no wonder youre jumpy fawn said kindly she stared around at the woods in renewed worry then balanced a hand on his shoulder pushed herself up and tried to brush the dirt off her sleeve dag took a few deep breaths letting his pounding heart slow then rose as well and went to recapture the mare a fallen tree a few steps into the woods looked like an adequate mounting block he led the horse up to it and fawn dutifully followed and if they started this all over again he feared he would disgrace himself before they ever got to glassforge to tell the truth dag lied my left arm was getting a bit tired do you think you could sit behind and hang on pillion style for a while oh im sorry i was so comfortable i didnt think it might be awkward for you she apologized earnestly you have no idea how awkward he grinned to hide his guilt and to reassure her but he was afraid it just came out looking demented up they climbed once more fawn settled herself with both dainty feet to one side and both dainty hands wrapped around his waist in a firm warm grip and all dags stern resolve melted in the unbidden thought lower lower he set his teeth and dug his heels into the blameless mares sides to urge her to a brisker walk fawn balanced herself wondering if she laid her head to dags back if she could hear his heartbeat again shed thought shed been recovering well this morning but the little accident reminded her of how tired she yet was how quickly the least exertion stole her breath dag was more tired than he looked too it seemed judging by his long silences she was embarrassed by how close shed come to trying to kiss him after their clumsy fall shed probably landed an elbow in his gut and hed been too kind to say anything hed even grinned at her helping her up his teeth were a trifle crooked but nothing to signify strong and sound with a fascinating little chip out of one of the front ones his smile was too fleeting but it was probably safer for her tattered dignity that his grin was even rarer if hed grinned at her so kissably while they were still flat on the grass instead of giving her that peculiar lookmaybe it had been suppressed painshed likely have disgraced herself altogether the nasty name that sunny had called her during their argument over the baby stuck in her craw with one mocking word sunny had somehow turned all her loveinintent her breathless curiosity her timid daring into something ugly and vile hed been happy enough to kiss her and fondle her in the wheatfield in the dark and call her his pretty thing the slur came later dubious therefore but still was it typical for men to despise the women who gave them the attention they claimed to want judging from some of the rude insults shed heard here and there maybe so she did not want dag to despise her to take her for something low but then she would never apply the word typical to him so was dag lonely or lucky he didnt seem the lucky sort somehow so how would you know her heart felt as if it knew him better than any man no any person shed ever met the feeling did not stand up to inspection he could be married for all hed said to the contrary he could have children he could have children almost as old as her or who knew what he hadnt said there was a lot he hadnt talked of when she thought about it it was just that what little hed talked about had seemed so important as though shed been dying of thirst and everyone else had wanted to give her piles of dry gimcrackery and hed offered her a cup of plain pure water straightforward welcome beyond desire or deserving unsettling the valley they were riding down opened out the creek ran away through broad fields and the farm lane gave onto the straight road at last dag turned the mare left and whatever opportunity she had just wasted was gone forever the straight road was busier today and grew more so as they neared the town either the removal of the bandit threat had brought more people out on the highway or it was market day or both fawn decided they passed sturdy brickwagons and goodswagons drawn by teams of big dray horses pulling hard going out and rode alongside ones returning not empty but loaded with firewood or hitchhiking county folk taking produce and handcrafts to sell she caught snatches of cheerful conversation the girls flirting with the teamsters when no elders rode with them farm carts and haywains and yes even that manure wagon shed wished for in vain the other day the scent of coal smoke and woodsmoke came to fawns nose even before they rounded the last curve and the town came into sight nothing about this arrival was like anything she had pictured when shed started out from home but at least shed got here something that shed begun finally finished it felt like breaking a curse glassforge at last chapter fawn leaned precariously around dags shoulder and gazed down the main street lined with older buildings of wood and stone or newer ones of brick plank sidewalks kept peoples feet out of the churned mud of the road a block farther on the mud gave way to cobblestones and beyond that brick a town so rich they paved the street with brick the road curved away to follow the bend in the river but she could just glimpse a town square busy with a day market most of the smokes that smudged the air seemed to be coming from farther downstream and downwind dag turned the mare into a side street jerking his chin at the brick building rising to their left blunt and blocky but softened by climbing ivy theres our hotel patrols always stay there for free it was written into the will of the owners father something about the last big malice we took out in these parts nigh on sixty years ago mustve been a scary one good thinking on someones part because it gets the area patrolled more often you looked for sixty years without finding another oh thereve been a couple in the interim i believe we just got them so small the farmers never knew like um pulling a weed instead of chopping down a tree better for us better for everyone except harder to convince folks to chip in some payment farsighted man that old innkeep they turned again under a wide brick archway and into the yard between the hotel and its stable a horse boy polishing harness on a bench glanced up and rose to come forward he did not reach for the mares makeshift bridle sorry mister miss his nod was polite but his look seemed to sum up the worth of the battered pair riding bareback and find it sadly short hotels full up youll have to find another place the twist of his lips turned slightly derisive if not altogether without sympathy doubt you could make the price of a room here anyways only fawns hand on dags back felt the faint rumble ofanger no amusement pass through him doubt i could too happily miss bluefield here has made the price of all of them the boys face went a little blank as he tried to work this out to anything that made sense to him his confusion was interrupted by a pair of lakewalkers hobbling out of the doorway into the yard staring hard at dag these two looked more like proper patrollers neat in leather vests with their long hair pulled back in decorated braids one had a face nearly as bruised as fawns with a strip of linen wrapped awkwardly around his head and under his jaw not quite hiding a line of bloody stitches he leaned on a stick the other had her left arm thickened with bandages supported in a sling both were darkhaired and tall though their eyes were an almost normal sort of clear bright brown dag redwing hickory said the woman cautiously dag swung his right leg over the mares neck and sat sideways a moment smiling faintly he touched his hand to his temple in a gesture of acknowledgment aye you all from chatos log hollow patrol both patrollers stood straighter despite their evident hurts yes sir said the man while the woman hissed at the hotel servant boy take the patrollers horse the boy jumped as though goosed and took the halter rope his stare growing wideeyed dag slid down and turned to help fawn who swung her legs over ah dont you dare jump he said sternly and she nodded and slid off into his arm collecting something pleasantly like a hug as he eased her feet to the ground she stifled her longing to lean her head into his chest and just stand there for oh say about a week he turned to the other patrollers but his left arm stayed behind her back a solid anchoring weight where is everyone dag asked the man grinned then winced his hand going to his jaw out looking for you mostly ah i was afraid of that yeah said the woman your patrol all kept swearing youd turn up like a cat and then went running out again anyway without hardly stopping to eat or sleep looks like the cat fanciers had the right of it theres a fellow upstairs name of sauns been fretting his heart out for you every time we go in he badgers for news dags lips pursed in a breath of relief on medicine tent duty are you yep said the man how many carryingwounded have we got just twoyour saun and our reela she got her leg broke when some mudmen spooked her horse over a drop bad not good but shell get to keep it dag nodded good enough then the man blinked in belated realization of dags stump but he added nothing more awkward i dont know how tired you are but it would be kindly done if you could step up and put sauns mind at ease first thing he really has been fretting something awful i think hed rest better for seeing you with his own eyes of course said dag ah said the woman looking at fawn and then inquiringly at dag this heres miss fawn bluefield said dag fawn dipped her knees how de do and she is said the man dubiously shes with me something distinctly firm in dags voice discouraged further questions and the two patrollers after civil if still curious nods at fawn led the way inside fawn had only a glimpse of the entry hall featuring a tall wooden counter and archways leading off to some big rooms before she followed the patrollers up a staircase with a timepolished banister cool and smooth under her hesitant fingertips one flight up they turned into a hallway lined with doors on either side and a glass window set in the end for light you partners mostly lucid today although he still keeps claiming you brought him back from the dead said the man over his shoulder he wasnt dead said dag the man shot a look at the woman told you his heart had stopped and hed quit breathing was all fawn blinked in bafflement and she was heartened to see she wasnt the only one er the man stopped outside a door with a brass number on it pardon sir id always been taught it was too risky to match grounds with someone mortally injured and unworkable to block the pain at speed likely dag shrugged i just skipped the extras and went in and out fast oh said the woman in a voice of enlightenment that fawn did not share the man blurted didnt it hurt dag gave him a long slow look fawn was very glad it wasnt her at the focus because that look could surely reduce people to grease spots on the floor dag gave the other patroller a moment more to meltprecisely timed she was suddenly certainthen nodded at the door the woman hastened to open it dag passed in if the two patrollers had been respectful before the look they now exchanged behind his back was downright daunted the woman glanced at fawn doubtfully but did not attempt to exclude her as she slipped through the door in dags wake the room had cutwork linen curtains pushed open and moving gently in the summer air and flanking the window two beds with feather ticks atop straw ticks one was empty though it had gear and saddlebags piled on the floor at its foot so did the other but in it lay aninevitablytall young man his hair was light brown unbraided and spread out upon his pillow a rumpled sheet was pulled up to his chest where his torso was wrapped around with bandages he stared listlessly at the ceiling his pale brow wrinkled when he turned his head at the sound of steps and recognized his visitor the pain in his face transformed to joy so fast it looked like a flash flood washing over him dag you made it he laughed coughed grimaced and moaned ow knew you would the patroller woman raised her eyebrows at this broad claim but grinned indulgently dag walked to the bedside and smiled down adopting a cheerful tone now i know you had six broken ribs at least i ask you is this the time for speeches only a short one wheezed the young man his hand found dags and grasped it thank you dags brows twitched but he didnt argue such sincere gratitude shone in the young mans eyes fawn warmed to him at once finally somebody seemed to be taking dag at his worth saun turned his head to peer somewhat blearily at her and she smiled at him with all her heart he blinked rapidly and smiled back looking a bit flummoxed dag gave the hand a little shake from side to side and asked more softly howre you doing saun it only hurts when i laugh oh dont let the patrol know that the dry light in dags eyes was mirth fawn realized saun sputtered and coughed ow blast you dag see what i mean he added more sternly they tell me you havent been sleeping i said couldnt bethis is the patroller we have to roll out of his blankets by force in camp in the morning feather beds too soft for you now shall i bring you a few rocks to make it more homelike saun held a hand to his bandaged chest and carefully refrained from chuckling naw all i want is your tale they saidhis face grew grave in memory and he moistened his lipsthey found your horse yesterday miles from the lair found the lair found half your gear and your bow abandoned in a pile your bow didnt think youd ever leave that on purpose two rotting mudmen and a pile of something mari swore was the dead malice and a trail of blood leading off to nothing what were we supposed to think i was rather hoping someone would think id found shelter at the nearest farm dag said ruefully i begin to suspect im not exciting enough for you all sauns eyes narrowed theres more than that he said positively quite a bit but its for maris ears first dag glanced at fawn saun slumped in apparent acceptance of this as long as i get more sometime sometime dag hesitated then added diffidently so did they also find the body id left in the tree three faces turned to stare evidently not yet dag murmured see what i told you see said saun to his companions in a voice of vindication he added to dag through slightly gritted teeth sometime soon all right as i can dag nodded at the two from the other patrol did mari say when shed be back they shook their heads she left at dawn the woman offered need anything more right now saun asked the patroller man you just brought me what i wanted most said saun take a break eh i think i will with a barely audible grunt of pain the patroller man sat down on the other bed evidently his own shed his boots and used his hands to swing the stiff leg inboard ah dag nodded in farewell sleep hard saun try and wake up smarter eh a faint snort and a muffled ow followed the three out dags face turning away softened like a man finding grace in an unexpected hour yeah hell be all right he muttered in satisfaction the patroller woman closed the door quietly behind them so was that saun the sheep asked fawn aye the very lamb said dag if he lives long enough to trade in some of that enthusiasm for brains hell be a good patroller hes made it to twenty so far must be luck his smile took a twist same as you little spark as they started down the hall a womans voice called weakly from a room with an open door thats reela said the patroller woman quickly do you have all you need sir if not ill find it dag gave a dismissing wave ive known this place for years then if youll excuse me ill go see what she wants she nodded and stepped away as they made their way down the stairs fawn heard dag mutter under his breath stop siring me you dreadful puppies he paused at the bottom his hand on the rail and looked back upward his face going distant now what are you thinking fawn asked softly im thinking that when our walking wounded are set to look after our carryingwounded its a sure sign were too shortrostered maris patrol is sixteen four by four it should be twentyfive five by five i wonder how many chatos patrol is down by ah well he vented a sigh lets rustle us up some food spark dag led her to a rather astonishing little commode chamber where she was able to swap out her dressings and wash up in the pretty painted tin basin provided when she emerged he escorted her in turn to one of the big downstairs rooms full of tables with benches or chairs but at this hour empty of other people in a few minutes a serving girl came out of the kitchen in back with a tray of ham cheese two kinds of bread creamandrhubarb pie and strawberries with a pitcher of beer and a jug of milk fresh the girl informed them from the hotels own cows kept out back fawn mentally added serving girl to her list of potential glassforge jobs as well as milkmaid and set to under dags benign eye more relaxed than shed ever seen him he plowed in heartily she noted with satisfaction they were contesting the last strawberry each trying to press it on the other when dags head came up and he said ah in a moment fawn could hear through the open windows the clatter of horses and echo of voices in the stable yard in another minute the door slammed open and booted footsteps rapped across the floorboards mari trailed by two other patrollers swept into the dining room halted by their table planted her fists on her hips and glowered at dag you she uttered and never had fawn heard one syllable carry so much freight deadpan dag topped up his beer glass and handed it to her not taking her exasperated eyes from him she raised it to her lips and gulped down half the other two patrollers were grinning broadly were you trying to give me the fright of my life boy she demanded plunking the glass back down almost hard enough to crack it no dag drawled rescuing the glass and filling it again i suspect that was just a bonus sit down and catch your breath aunt mari dont you aunt mari me till im done reaming you out she said but much more mildly one of the patrollers at her shoulder catching dags eye pulled out a chair for her and she sat anyhow by the time shed blown out her breath and stretched her back her posture had grown much less alarming except for the underlying exhaustion creeping to the surface dags brows drew down at that he reached across the table and gripped her hand sorry for any false scares saun told me about you finding my messes yesterday i kind of had my hand full though aye so i heard oh did you find the horsefords farm finally about two hours ago now there was a garbled tale and a half she glanced speculatively at fawn and her frown at dag deepened dag said mari may i present miss fawn bluefield spark this is my patrol leader mari redwing hickory maris her personal name redwing is our tent name and the hickory is for hickory lake camp which is our patrols home base fawn ducked her head politely mari returned an extremely provisional nod gesturing dag continued utau and razi also of hickory camp the two other patrollers made friendly salutes of greeting to her not unlike dags utau was older shorter and burlier and wore his thinning hair in a knot like maris razi was younger taller and gawkier his hair hung down his back in a single plait almost to his waist with dark red and green cords woven in the older one utau said congratulations on the malice dag the youngsters were all hopping mad that theyd missed their first kill though id suggested we have you take them all out to the lair and walk them through it for consolation and to show them how its done dag shook his head caught between a low laugh and a wince i dont think that would be all that useful to them really so just how much of a foulup was it mari inquired tartly the residue of amusement drained from dags eyes foul enough the short tale is miss bluefield here was kidnapped off the road by the pair id trailed from the bandit camp when i caught up with them all at the lair i was outmatched by the mudmen who got a good way into taking me apart but i noticed that the malice mudmen and all were making the interesting mistake of ignoring miss bluefield in the scuffle so i tossed my sharing knives to her and she got one into the malice took it down saved my life world too for the usual bonus she got that close to a malice asked razi in a voice somewhere between disbelief and amazement how for answer dag leaned over and after a glance at her for permission gently folded back the collar of her dress his finger traced over numb spots of flesh around her neck that fawn realized belatedly must be the bruises from the malices great hands and she shuddered involuntarily despite the summer warmth of the room closer than that razi the two patrollers lips parted mari leaned back in her chair her hand going to her mouth fawn had not seen a mirror for days whatever did the marks look like the malice misjudged her dag continued i trust you all will not but if you want to repeat those congratulations to the right person utau feel free under dags cool eye utau unscrewed his face and slowly brought his hand to his temple after groping a moment for his voice he managed miss bluefield aye razi seconded after a stunned moment wildly demonstrative bunch you know we patrollers dag murmured in fawns ear his dry amusement flickering again i can see that she murmured back making his lip twitch mari rubbed her forehead and the long tale dag do i even want to hear it the grim look he gave her locked all her attention yes he said as soon as may be but in private then miss bluefield needs to rest he turned to fawn or do you want to rest up first fawn shook her head talk first please mari braced her hands on her trousered knees and rolled her shoulders ah all right she peered around eyes narrowing my room that would do she pushed to her feet utau you were up all night youre now off duty razi get some food in you then ride out to tailors point and let them know dags been found or shown up anyway the patrollers nodded and turned away dag murmured to fawn bring your bedroll maris room proved to be on the third floor fawn found herself dizzy and shaky by the time shed climbed the second flight of stairs and she was grateful for dags supporting hand mari led them into a narrower room than sauns with only one bed though otherwise similar right down to the messy pile of gear and saddlebags at the foot dag gestured for fawn to lay her bedroll across the bed fawn untied the bindings and unrolled it the contents clinked maris brows rose she picked up dags ruptured hand harness and held it out like the sad carcass of some dead animal that took some doing i see now why you didnt bother to take your bow along you still got your arm just barely said dag i need to get that thing restitched with stronger thread this time id rethink that idea if i were you which do you want to have come apart first you or it dag paused a moment then said ah you have a point there maybe ill get it fixed just the same better mari set the harness back down and picked up the makeshift linen bag and let it drift through her hand feeling the contents shift within her expression grew sad almost remote kauneos hearts knife wasnt it dag nodded shortly i know how long youve kept it aside this fate was worthy dag shook his head theyre all the same really ive come to believe he took a breath and advanced to the bed motioning fawn to sit she perched crosslegged on the beds head smoothing her skirt over her knees and watched the two patrollers mari had gold eyes much like dags if a shade more bronze and she wondered if she really was his aunt and his use of the title not as shed first thought just a joke or a respectful endearment mari set the bag back down do you plan to send it up to be buried with the rest of her uncles bones or burn it here not sure yet it will keep with me it has so far dag drew a deeper breath staring down at the other knife now we come to the long story mari sat down at the beds foot and crossed her arms listening closely as dag began his tale again this time starting with the night raid on the bandit camp his descriptions of his actions were succinct but very exact fawn noticed as though certain details might matter more though she was not sure how he sorted which to leave in or out until he came to i believe the mudman lifted miss bluefield from the road because she was two months pregnant and came back and took her from the farm for the same reason maris lips moved involuntarily was then compressed go on dags voice stiffened as he described his risky raid on the malices cave i was just too late when i hit the entrance and the mudmen the malice was already taking her child mari leaned forward her brows drawing down separately so it seems huh mari leaned back shook her head and peered at fawn excuse me i am so sorry for your loss but this is new to me we knew malices took pregnant women but then they take anyone they can catch rarely the womens bodies are recovered i did not know the malice didnt always take both grounds together i dont think said fawn distantly it would have kept me around very long it was about to break my neck when i finally got the right knife into it mari blinked glanced down at the bluehilted bone knife lying on the bedroll and stared up again at dag what carefully dag explained fawns mixup with his knives he was very kind fawn thought to excuse her from any blame in the matter the knife had been unprimed you know what i was saving it for mari nodded but now its primed with the death of sparksof miss bluefields daughter i believe what i dont know is if thats all it drew from the malice or whether it will even work as a sharing knife or well i dont know much im afraid but with miss bluefields permission i thought you could examine it too dag im no more a maker than you are no but you are more you are less i could use another opinion mari glanced at fawn miss bluefield may i please i want to understand and and i dont really mari leaned over and picked up the bone knife she cradled it ran her hand along its smooth pale length and finally much as dag had held it to her lips with her eyes closed when she set it down again her mouth stayed tight for a moment wellshe took a breathits certainly primed that i could tell said dag it feels hm oddly pure its not that souls go into the knivesyou did explain that to her yes she demanded of dag yes shes clear on that part but different peoples hearts knives do have different feels to them some echo of the donor lingers though they all seem to work alike perhaps its that the lives are different but the deaths are all the same i dont know im a patroller not a loremaster i thinkshe tapped her lips with a forefingeryou had better take it to a maker the most experienced you can find miss bluefield and i said dag the knife is properly hers now this isnt any business for a farmer to be mixed up in dag scowled what would you have me do take it from her you explain please fawn said tightly everyone is talking past me again thats all right mostly im used to it but not for this show her your knives mari dag said a rasp of challenge in his voice for all that it was soft she looked at him then slowly unbuttoned her shirt partway down and drew out a dual knife pouch much like dags though of softer leather she pulled the strap over her head pushed the bedroll aside and laid out two bone knives side by side on the quilt they were nearly identical except for differentcolored dye daubed on the lightly carved hilts red and brown this time these are a true pair both bones from the same donor she said caressing the red one my youngest son as it happens it was his third year patrolling up sparford way and id just got to thinking he was getting over the riskiest part of the learning well she touched the brown one this one is primed his fathers aunt palai gave her death to it tough tough old womanabsent gods we loved her preferably from a safe distance but theres one like that in every family i think her hand drifted again to the red one this one is unprimed bonded to me i keep it by me in case so what would happen said dag dryly to anyone who tried to take them from you maris smile grew grim id outstrip the worst wrath of greataunt palai she sat up and slipped the knives away then nodded at fawn but i think its different for her its all strange to me fawn frowned staring at the bluehilted knife i have no happy memories about this to balance the sorrows but theyre my memories all the same id rather they werent wasted mari raised both hands in a gesture of frustrated neutrality so could i have leave from the patrol to travel on this matter asked dag mari grimaced you know how short we are but once this glassforge business is settled i cant very well refuse you have you ever drawn leave ever you dont even get sick dag thought a moment death of my father he said at last eleven years ago before my time eh ask again when were ready to decamp if theres no new trouble landed in our laps by then he nodded miss bluefields not fit to travel far yet anyway you can see by her eyelids and nails shes lost too much blood even without how her knees give way no fever yet though please mari i did all i could but could you look her over his hand touched his belly making his meaning clear mari sighed yes yes dag he stood expectantly for a moment she grimaced and sat up waving to a set of saddlebags leaning in the corner theres your gear by the by luckily your fool horse hadnt got round to scraping it off in the woods go on now but will you cant i i mean its not as though you have to undress her womens business she said firmly reluctantly he made for the door though he did scoop up his arm harness and recovered belongings ill see about getting you a room spark fawn smiled gratefully at him good said mari scat he bit his lip and nodded farewell his boot steps faded down the hall fawn tried not to be too unnerved by being left alone with mari scary old lady or not the patrol leader seemed to share some of dags straightforward quality she had fawn sit quietly on the bed while she ran her hands over her she then sat behind fawn and hugged her in close for several silent minutes her hands wrapped across fawns lower belly if she was doing something with her groundsense fawn could not feel it and wondered if this was what being deaf among hearing people was like when she released fawn her face was cool but not unkind youll do she said its clear you were ripped up unnatural which accounts for the suddenness of the bleeding but youre healing about as quick as could be expected for someone so depleted and your wombs not hot fevers a commoner killer in these things than bleeding though less showy youll have some blightscarring in there i guess slow to heal like the ones on your neck but not enough to stop you having other children so you be more careful in future miss bluefield oh fawn looking back through clouds of regret had not even thought ahead to her future fertility does that happen to some women after a miscarriage sometimes or after a bad birth delicate parts in there it amazes me the process works at all when i think about all the things ive seen can go wrong fawn nodded then reached to put away dags bluehilted knife still lying on her bedroll atop her spare clothes so said mari in a carefully bland tone whos the other half owner sides you of that knifes priming some farm lout fawns jaw set just me the lout made it very clear he was giving it all to me which was why i was out on the road in the first place farmers ill never understand em there are no lakewalker louts well maris long embarrassed drawl conceded the point fawn reread the faded brown lettering on the bone blade dag meant to drive this into his own heart someday didnt he this kauneo had intended that he should aye now he couldnt that was something at least you have one too someone has to prime not everyone but enough patrollers understand the need better was kauneo a patroller didnt dag say he said she was a woman whod died twenty years ago up northwest someplace thats a bit closemouthed even for him mari sighed its not my place to tell his tales but if you are to have the holding of that knife farmer girl youd better understand what it is and where it comes from yes said fawn firmly please im so tired of making stupid mistakes mari twitched aprovisionallyapproving eyebrow at this very well ill give you what dag would call the short tale her long inhalation suggested it wasnt going to be as short as all that and fawn sat crosslegged again intent kauneo was dags wife a tremor of shock ran through fawn shock but not surprise she realized i see she died at wolf ridge he hadnt mentioned any wolf ridge to me he just called it a bad malice war though there could be no such thing as a good malice war fawn suspected farmer girl dag doesnt talk about wolf ridge to anyone one of his several little quirks you have to get used to you have to understand luthlia is the biggest wildest hinterland of the seven with the thinnest population of lakewalkers to try to patrol it terrible patrollingcold swamps and trackless woods and killing winters the other hinterlands lend more young patrollers to luthlia than to anywhere but they still cant keep up kauneo came from a tent of famously fierce patrollers up that way she was very beautiful i guesscourted by everyone then this quiet unassuming young patrol leader from the east walking around the lake on his second training tour stole her heart right out from under all of them a hint of pride colored her voice and fawn thought yes shes really his aunt he made plans to stay they were stringboundyou farmers would say marriedand he got promoted to company captain dag wasnt always a patroller said fawn mari snorted that boy should have been a hinterland lieutenant by now if he hadnt agh anyway most of our patrols are more like hunts and most turn up nothing in fact its possible to patrol all your life and never be in on a malice kill by one chance or another dag has his ways of improving those odds for himself but when a malice gets entrenched when it goes to real war then were all making it up as we go along she rose stalked across the bedchamber to her washstand poured a glass of water and drank it down she fell to pacing as she continued big malice slipped through the patrol patterns it didnt have many people to enslave up that way no bandits like the malice you slew here there are no farmers in luthlia nor anywhere north of the dead lake save now and then some trapper or trader slips in that we escort out but the malice did find wolves it did things to wolves wolfmen manwolves dire wolves as big as ponies with manwits by the time the thing was found it had grown itself an army of wolves the luthlian patrollers sent out a callup for help from neighbor hinterlands but meanwhile they were on their own dags company fifty patrollers including kauneo and a couple of her brothers was sent to hold a ridge to cover the flank of another party trying to strike up the valley at the lair the scouts led them to expect an attack of maybe fifty dire wolves what they got was more like five hundred fawns breath drew in in one hour dag lost his hand his wife his company all but three and the ridge what he didnt lose was the war because in the hour theyd bought the other group made it all the way through to the lair when he woke up in the medicine tent his whole life was burned up like a pyre i guess he didnt take it well in due course his dead wifes tent folk despaired of him and sent him home where he didnt take it well some more then fairbolt crow bless his bonesour camp captain though he was just a company captain back thengot smart or desperate or furious and dragged him off to tripoint got some clever farmer artificer he knew there to make up the arm harness and they went round and round on it till they hit on devices that worked dag practiced with his new bow till his fingers bled pulled himself together to meet fairbolts terms and let me tell you fairbolt didnt cut him any slack and was let back on patrol where he has been ever since some ten or twelve sharing knives have passed through dags hand sincepeople keep giving them to him because theyre pretty sure to get usedbut he always kept that pair aside the only mementos of kauneo i know of that he didnt shove away like they scorched him so thats the knife now in your keeping farmer girl fawn held it up and drew it through her fingers youd think it would be heavier did i really want to know all this aye mari sighed fawn glanced curiously at maris gray head will you ever be a company captain you must have been patrolling for a long time ive had far less time in the field than dag actually for all im twenty years older i walked the womans path i spent four or five years training as a girlwe must train up the girls for all that fellows like dag disapprove because if ever our camps are attacked itll be us and the old men defending them i got stringbound got bloodboundhad my children that isand then went back to patrolling i expect to keep walking till my luck or my legs give out five more years or ten but i dont care to deal with anything more fractious than a patrol thank you then back to camp and play with my grandchildren and their children till its time to share it will do as a life fawns brow wrinkled did you ever imagine another or being thrown into another as fawn had been mari cocked her head cant say as i ever did though id have my boy back first if i were given wishes how many children did you have five mari replied with distinct maternal pride that sounded plenty farmerish to fawn for all she suspected mari would deny any such thing a rap on the door was followed by dags plaintive voice mari can i please come back in now mari rolled her eyes all right dag eased himself around the door how is she doing is she healing at all could you match grounds or do a little reinforcement even shes healing as well as could be expected i did nothing with my ground because time and rest will do the job every bit as well dag took this in seeming a bit disappointed but resigned i have you a room spark down one floor tired exhausted she realized she nodded well ill take you down and you can start in on the resting part leastways mari rubbed her lips and studied her nephew through narrowed eyes groundsense fawn wondered what the patrol leader had seen with hers that she wasnt saying did closed mouths run in the redwing family like golden eyes fawn rolled up her bedroll and let dag shoo her out dont let mari scare you dag said letting his left arm drift along at her back whether protectively or for subtle concealment fawn could not tell as they descended the stairs they turned into the adjoining corridor she didnt much i liked her fawn took a breath some secrets took up too much space to keep tiptoeing around she told me a little more about your wife and wolf ridge she thought i needed to know silence stretched for three long footfalls shes right and that evidently was all fawn was going to get for now fawns new room was narrow like maris except this one overlooked the main street instead of the stable yard a washstand with ewer already filled piecework curtains and a quilt in a matching pattern and rag rugs on the floor made it fine and homey to fawns eyes a door in the side wall apparently led into the next chamber dag swung the bar across and shoved it down into its brackets where is your room fawn asked dag gestured at the closed door through there oh good will you take a rest dont tell me you arent owed some healing too i saw your bruises he shook his head im going out to find a harnessmaker ill come back and take you down to dinner later if youd like id like that fine he smiled a little at that and backed himself out seems all i do in this place is tell folks to go to sleep yes but im actually going to do it he grinnedthat grin should be illegaland shut the door softly on the wall beside the washstand hung a shaving mirror fine flat glassforge glass reminded fawn slid up to it and turned down the collar of her blue dress the bruise masking most of the left side of her face was purple going greenish around the edges with four dark scabs from the mudmans claws mounting to her cheekbone still tender but not hot with infection the pattern of the malices hand on her neck four blots on one side and one on the other stood out in sharp contrast to her fair skin the marks had a peculiar black tint and an ugly raised texture unlike any other contusion fawn had ever seen well if there was any special trick to their healing dag would know it or might have experienced it himself if he had got close enough to as many malices as maris inventory of his past knives suggested fawn went to the window and just caught a glimpse of dags tall form passing below arm harness tossed over his shoulder striding up the street toward the town square she gazed out at glassforge after hed made his way out of sight along the boardwalk but not for long yawning uncontrollably she slipped off her dress and shoes and crawled into the bed chapter dag returned at dinnertime as promised fawn had put on her good dress the green cotton that her aunt nattie had spun and woven she followed him downstairs the raucous noises coming out of the room where theyd eaten their quiet lunch gave her pause seeing her hesitate dag smiled and bent his head to murmur patrollers can be a rowdy bunch when we all get together but youll be all right you dont have to answer any questions you dont want we can make out youre still too shaken by our fight with the malice and dont want to talk about it theyll accept that his hand drifted to her collar as if to arrange it more tidily and fawn realized he was not covering up the strange marks on her neck but rather making sure they showed i think we dont need to mention what happened with the second knife to anyone besides mari good said fawn relieved and allowed him to take her in his arm protective at her back the tables this evening were indeed full of tall alarming patrollers twentyfive or so variously layered with road dirt given dags warning fawn managed not to jump when their entrance was greeted with whoops cheers table pounding and flying jibes about dags threeday vanishing the roughness of some of the jests was undercut by the real joy in the voices and dag smiling crookedly gave back some trackers i swear you lot couldnt find a drink in a rain barrel beer barrel dag someone hooted in return whats wrong with you dag surveyed the room and guided fawn toward a square table on the far side where only two patrollers sat the utau and razi shed met earlier the two waved encouragement as they approached and razi shoved out a spare chair invitingly with his boot fawn was not sure which patrollers were maris and which were chatos the two patrols seemed to be mingled not quite at random any sorting seemed to be more by age as there was one table with half a dozen gray heads at it including mari also two other older women fawn had not seen at the wellhouse so presumably from the log hollow patrol the young woman with her arm in the sling was at a table with three young men all vying to cut her meat for her she was presently holding them off with jabs of her fork and laughing the men patrollers seemed all ages but the women were only young or much older fawn noticed and remembered maris account of her lifes course in the home camps would the proportions be reversed breathless serving maids and boys weaved among the tables lugging trays laden with platters and pitchers rapidly relieved by reaching hands the patrollers seemed more interested in speed and quantity than in decorum an attitude shared with farmhouse kitchens that made fawn feel nearly comfortable they sat and exchanged greetings with razi and utau razi leaped up and acquired more plates cutlery and glasses and both united to snag passing food and drink to fill them they did ply dag with questions about his adventures although with cautious glances spared fawn his answers were either unexcitingly factual vague or took the form that fawn recognized from the horsefords table of effectively diverting counterquestions they finally desisted and let dag catch up with his chewing utau glanced around the room and remarked everyones a lot happier tonight especially mari fortunately for all of us downstream of her razi said wistfully do you suppose she and chato will let us all have a bowdown before we go back out chato looks pretty cheerful said utau nodding across the room at another table of patrollers although which was the leader fawn could not tell we might get lucky whats a bowdown asked fawn razi smiled eagerly its a party patrollerstyle they happen sometimes to celebrate a kill or when two or more patrols chance to get together having another patrol to talk to is a treat not that we dont all love one anotherutau rolled his eyes at thisbut weeks on end of our own company can get pretty old a bowdown has music dancing beer if we can get it we could get lots of beer here utau observed distantly lingerrrring in dark corners razi trilled catching up the tail of his braid and twirling it enoughshe gets the idea said dag but he smiled fawn wondered if it was in memory could happen but i guarantee it wont be till mari thinks the cleanup is all done or as done as it ever gets his eye was caught by something over fawns shoulder i feel prophetic i predict chores before cheer dag youre such a morbid crow razi began well gentlemen said maris voice do your feet hurt fawn turned her head and smiled diffidently at the patrol leader who had drifted up to their table razi opened his mouth but dag cut in dont answer that razi its a trick question the safe response is i cant say mari but why do you ask maris lips twitched and she returned in a sugary voice im so glad you asked that question dag maybe not so safe murmured utau grinning hows the armharness repair coming mari continued to dag dag grimaced done tomorrow afternoon maybe i had to stop at two places before i found one that would do it for free or rather in exchange for us saving his life family town territory and everyone in it utau said dryly naturally you forgot to mention it was you personally who took their malice down dag shrugged this off in irritation firstly that wasnt so secondly none of us could do the job without the rest of us so all are owed i shouldnt none of us should have to beg it so happens said mari letting this slide by that i have a sittingdown job for a onehanded man tomorrow morning in the storeroom here is a trunkful of patrol logs and maps for this region that need a good goingover the usual i want someone with an eye for it to see if we can figure how this malice slipped through and stop up the crack in future also i want a listing of the nearby sectors that have been especially neglected were going to stay here a few extra days while the injured recover and to repair gear and furbish up utau and razi both brightened at this news well do some local searchpattern catchup at the same time mari continued and let the glassforge folk see us doing so she added with dour emphasis and a nod at dag give em a show dag snorted better we should offer them double their blight bogles back if theyre not happy with our work razi choked on the beer he was just swallowing and utau kindly if unhelpfully thumped his back oh how i wish we could razi wheezed when hed caught his breath again love to see the looks on their stupid farmer faces just once fawn congealed her beginning ease and enjoyment of the patrollers banter abruptly quenched dag stiffened mari cast them both an enigmatic look but moved off without comment and fawn remembered their exchange earlier on the universal nature of loutishness so razi burbled on obliviously patrolling out of glassforge is like a holiday sure you ride all day but when you come back there are real beds real baths food you dont have to fix not burned over a campfire little comforts to bargain for up in the town and yet farmers built this place fawn murmured and she was sure by his wince that dag heard clearly the missing stupid shed clipped out razi shrugged farmers plant crops but who planted farmers we did what fawn thought utau perhaps not quite as oblivious as his comrade glanced at her and countered you mean our ancestors did pretty broad claim of credit there why shouldnt we get the credit said razi and the blame as well said dag razi made a face i thought we did fairs fair dag smiled tightly drew a breath and pushed himself up well if im to spend tomorrow peering at a bunch of illpenned misspelled and undoubtedly incomplete patrol logs id better get my eyes some rest now if everyone else is as short on sleep as i am itll be a good quiet night for catching up find us lots of local patrols dag urged razi weeks worth ill see what i can do fawn rose too and dag shepherded her out he made no attempt to apologize for razi but an odd look darkened his eyes and fawn did not like her sense of his thoughts receding to someplace barred to her outside the latesummer dusk was closing in he bade her good night at her door with studied courtesy the next morning dag woke at dawn but fawn to his approval still slept he went quietly downstairs and nabbed two patrollers from their breakfast to lug the records trunk upstairs to his room in a short time he had logs maps and charts spread out on the rooms writing table bed and soon after the floor he heard the muffled creak of the bed and fawns footsteps through the adjoining wall as she finally arose and rattled around her room getting dressed at length she poked her head cautiously around the frame of his door open to the hall and he jumped up to escort her down to a breakfast much quieter than last nights dinner as a last few sleepy patrollers drifted out singly or in pairs after the meal she followed him back upstairs to stare with interest at the paper and parchment drifting across his room can i help he remembered her susceptibility to boredom and itchy hands but mostly he heard the underlying can i stay he obligingly set her to mending pens or fetching a paper or logbook from across the room from time to timemakework but it kept her quietly occupied and pleasantly near she grew fascinated with the maps charts and logs and fell to reading them or trying to it was not just the faded and often questionable handwriting that made this a slow process for her her claim to be able to read proved true but it was plain from her moving finger and lips and the tension in her body that she was not fluent probably due to never having had enough text to practice on but when he scratched out a grid on a fresh sheet to turn the muddled log entries into a record visible at a glance she followed the logic swiftly enough around noon mari appeared in the open doorway she raised an eyebrow at fawn perched on the bed poring over a contour map annotated with hand corrections but said only how goes it almost done said dag there is no point going back more than ten years i think quiet around here this morning what are folks up to mending cleaning gear gone uptown working with the horses we found a blacksmith whose sister was among those we rescued from the mine whos been very willing to help out in the stable she wandered in and peered over his shoulder then leaned back against the wall with her arms folded so how did this malice slip past us dag tapped his grid laid out on the table before him that section was last walked three years ago by a patrol from hope lake camp they were trying to run a sixteenman pattern with just thirteen three short because if theyd dropped it down to a twelvepattern theyd have had to make two more passes to clear the area and they were already three weeks behind schedule for the season even so theres no telling they missed anything that malice might well not have been hatched out yet im not looking to lay blame said mari mildly i know dag sighed now as for neglected sections his lips peeled back in a dry smile that was more revealing turns out all sections within a days ride of glassforge that can be patrolled from horseback are uptodate or as uptodate as anything meaning no more than a year overdue whats left are some swampy areas to the west and rocky ravines to the east that you cant take a horse through he added reflectively lazy whelps mari smiled sourly i see she scratched her nose chato and i figured hed lend me two men and wed both send out sixteengroups dividing up the neglected sections between us he and i are both going to be stuck here arguing with glassforgers about what were due for our recent work on their behalf so id thought to put you in charge of our patrol give you first pick of sections though youre so sweet mari waistdeep wading through smelly muck with leeches or sudden falls onto sharp rocks they both sound so charming i dont know how i can decide alternatively you can roll up your sleeves and come help me arm wrestle with glassforgers that works exceptionally well ive noticed fawn who had set down the map and was following the talk closely blinked at this dag grimaced in distaste in his list of personal joys parading their wounded to shame farmers into pitching in ranked well below frolicking with leeches and barely above lancing oozing saddle boils i swore the last time i put on that show for you it would be the last he added after a reflective moment and the time before you have no shame mari i have no resources she returned her face twisting in frustration fairbolt once figured it takes at least ten folks back in the camps not counting the children to support one patroller in the field every bit of help we fail to pull in from outside puts us that bit more behind then why dont we pull in more isnt that why farmers were planted in the first place the argument was an old one and dag still didnt know the right answer shall we become lords again said mari softly i think not whats the alternative let the world drift to destruction because were too ashamed to call for help keep the balance said mari firmly as we always have we cannot ever let ourselves become dependent upon outsiders her glance slid over fawn not us a little silence fell and dag finally said ill take swamps her nod was a bit too satisfied and dag wondered if hed just made a mistake he added after a moment but if you let us take along a few horse boys from the stables here to watch the mounts we wont have to leave a patroller with the horse lines while we slog mari frowned but said at last reluctantly all right makes sense for the daytrips anyway youll start tomorrow fawns brown eyes widened in mild alarm and dag realized the source of maris muffled triumph wait he said who will look after miss bluefield while im gone i can she wont be alone we have four other injured recovering here and chato and i will be in and out im sure ill be fine dag fawn offered although a faint doubt colored her voice but can you keep her from trying to overdo dag said gruffly what if she starts bleeding again or gets chilled and throws a fever even fawns brow wrinkled at that last one her lips moved on a voiceless protest but its midsummer then ill be better fit to deal with that than you would said mari watching him watching him flail he suspected glumly he drew back from making more of a show of himself than he already had hed had his groundsense closed down tight since theyd hit the outskirts of glassforge yesterday but mari clearly didnt need to read his ground to draw her own shrewd conclusions even without the way fawn glowed like a rockoil lamp in his presence he rolled up his chart and handed it to mari you can have that to tack on the wall downstairs and we can mark it off as we go for whatever amusement it will provide folks if you hint there could be a bowdown when we reach the end it might go more briskly she nodded affably and withdrew and dag put fawn to work helping him restack the contents of the trunk in rather better order than hed found it as she brought him an armload of stained and tattered logbooks she asked thats twice now youve talked about planting farmers what do you mean he sat back on his heels surprised dont you know where your family comes from sure i do its written down in the family book that goes with the farm accounts my greatgreatgreatgrandfathershe paused to check the generations on her fingers and noddedcame north to the river ridge from lumpton with his brother almost two hundred years ago to clear land a few years later greatgreatgreat got married and crossed the western river branch to start our place bluefields have been there ever since thats why the nearest village is named west blue and where were they before lumpton market she hesitated im not sure except that it was just lumpton back then because lumpton crossroads and upper lumpton werent around yet six hundred years ago said dag this whole region from the dead lake to nearly the southern seacoast was all unpeopled wilderness some lakewalkers from this hinterland went down to the coasts east and south where there were some enclaves of folksyour ancestorssurviving they persuaded several groups to come up here and carve out homes for themselves the idea was that this area south of a certain line had been cleared enough of malices to be safe again which proved to be not quite the case although it was still much better than it had once been promises were exchanged fortunately my people still remember what they were there were two more main plantations one east at tripoint and one west around farmers flats besides the one south of the grace at silver shoals that most folks around here eventually came from the homesteaders descendants have been slowly spreading out ever since there were two notions about this scheme among the lakewalkersstill are in fact one faction figured that the more eyes we had looking for malice outbreaks the better the other figured we were just setting out malice food ive seen malices develop in both peopled and unpeopled places and i dont see much to choose between the horrors so i dont get too excited about that argument anymore so lakewalkers were here before farmers said fawn slowly yes what was here before lakewalkers what you know nothing you dont have to sound so shocked she said obviously stung and he made a gesture of apology i know plenty i just dont know whats true and whats tall tales and bedtime stories once upon a time there was supposed to have been a chain of lakes not just the big dead one with a league of seven beautiful cities around them commanded by great sorcererlords and a sorcerer king and princesses and bold warriors and sailors and captains and who knows what all with tall towers and beautiful gardens and jeweled singing birds and magical animals and holy whatnot and the gods blessings flowing like the fountains and gods popping in and out of peoples lives in a way that i would find downright unnerving im pretty sure oh and ships on the lakes with silver sails i think maybe they were plain white cloth sails and just looked silver in the moonlight because it stands to reason that much metal would capsize a boat what i know is the tall tale is where they say some of the cities were five miles across which is impossible actuallydag cleared his throatthat part i know to be true the ruins of ogachi strand are only a few miles out from shore when i was a young patroller up that way some friends and i took an outrigger to look at them on a clear quiet day you can see down to the tops of stone wreckage along the old shoreline in places ogachi really was five miles across and more these were the people who built the straight roads after all which were thousands of miles long some of them before they got so broken up fawn stood up and dusted her skirt and sat on the edge of his bed her face tight with thought sowhered they all go those builders most died a remnant survived their descendants are still here where here in this room you and me she stared at him in real surprise then looked down at her hands in doubt me lakewalker tales say he paused sorting and suppressing that lakewalkers are descended from some of those sorcererlords who got away from the wreck of everything and farmers are descended from ordinary folks on the far edges of the hinterlands who somehow survived the original malice wars the first great one and the two that came after that killed the lakes and left the western levels also dubbed the dead levels by those whod skirted them and dag could understand why there was more than one war i never heard that she said he nodded in a sense or maybe theres always only been one the question you didnt ask is where do the malices come from out of the ground they always have onlyshe hesitated then went on in a rushi suppose youre going to say not always and tell me how they got into the ground in the first place right im actually a little vague on that myself what we do know is that all malices are descendants of the first great one except not descended like we are with marriage and birth and the passing of generations more like some monstrous insect that laid ten thousand eggs that hatch up out of the ground at intervals i saw that thing said fawn lowly i dont know what it was but it sure wasnt a bug he shrugged its just a way of trying to think about them ive seen a few dozen of them in my life so far i could as well say the first was like a mirror that shattered into ten thousand splinters to make ten thousand little mirrors malices arent material at all in their inner nature they just pull matter in from around them to make themselves a house a shell they seem to feed on ground itself really how did it shatter it lost the first war they say did the gods help dag snorted lakewalker legends say the gods abandoned the world when the first malice came and that they will return when the earth is entirely cleansed of its spawn if you believe in gods do you i believe they are not here yes its a faith of sorts huh she rolled up the last maps and tied their strings before handing them to him he settled them in place and closed the trunk he sat with his hand on the latch a moment whatever their part really was he said finally i dont think it was just the sorcererlords who built all those towers and laid those roads and sailed those ships your ancestors did too she blinked at this but what she was thinking he could not guess and the lords didnt come from nowhere or elsewhere either dag continued tenaciously one line of thought says there was just one people once and that the sorcerers rose out of them except that then they bred up for their skills and senses and then used their magic to make themselves more magical and lordly and powerful and so grew away from their kin which may have been the first mistake she tilted her head and her lips parted as if to speak but at that point a pair of footsteps echoed from the hall razi stuck his head through the doorframe ah dag there you are you should smell this he thrust out a small glass bottle and pulled off the leather stopper plugging its neck dirla found this medicine shop up in town that sells the stuff dirla smiled proudly over his shoulder what is it asked fawn leaning in and sniffing as the patroller waved the bottle past her oh pretty it smells like chamomile and clover flowers scented oil he answered they have seven or eight kinds what do you use it for fawn asked innocently dag mentally consigned his comrade to the middle of the dead levels sore muscles he said repressively well i suppose you could said razi thoughtfully scented back rubs breathed dirla in a warm voice mm nice idea how useful of you two to stop by dag overrode this before it could grow more interesting still either to himself who didnt hanker after a repeat of the discomforts of his ride from the horsefords or to fawn who would undoubtedly ask more questions happens i need this trunk taken back downstairs to the storeroom he stood up and pointed lug they grumbled if lightheartedly and lugged dag closed the door behind them shooed fawn to her own room and followed wondering if he dared ask just where that shop was located and if it might be on the way to the harnessmakers walking the patterns in the marshes west of glassforge took six days dag chose the closest section first and so was able to bring the patrol back to the hotels comforts that night and to check on fawn after an increasingly worried search of the premises he found her shelling peas in the kitchen and making friends with the cooks and scullions with some relief he gave over his vision of her as distressed and lonely among condescending lakewalker strangers although not his fear of her imprudently overtaxing her strength for the next section he chose the most distant of necessity a threeday outing to get it out of the way dag met the complaints of the younger patrollers with a few choice tales of swamp sweeps norm of farmers flats in late winter icily gruesome enough to silence all but the most determined grumblers the patrol was able to leave most of their gear with the horses but the need for skin protection meant that boots shirts and trousers took the brunt of the muck and mire when they draggled back to glassforge late the following night they were greeted by the attendants of the hotels pleasant bathhouse conveniently sited with its own well between the stable and the main building with a marked lack of joy the laundresses were growing downright surly at the sight of them this time dag found fawn waiting up for him filling the time and her hands by helping to mend hotel linens and coaxing stories from a pair of seamstresses he returned the next night to exchange tales with her over a late supper he held her fascinated with his account of a roughly circular and distinctively flat stretch of marsh some six miles across that he was certain was a former patch of blight recovering and again supporting lifemost of it noxious not to mention ravenous but without question thriving he thought the slaying of that malice must have predated the arrival of farmer settlers in this region by well over a century she entertained him in turn with a long involved account of her days adventures in the town sassa the horseford brotherinlaw now home again had stopped by and made good on his promise to show her his glassworks they had capped the tour with a visit to his brothers papermaking shop and for extras the back premises of the ink makers next door there are more kinds of work to do here than i ever dreamed she confided in a tone of thoughtful speculation she had also clearly overdone when he escorted her to her door she was drooping and yawning so hard she could scarcely say good night he spent a little time persuading her ground against an incipient cold then checked the healing flesh beneath the ugly malice scabs for necrosis or infection and made her promise to rest on the morrow the next days pattern walk was truncated for dag in the early afternoon when one patroller managed to trade up from mere muck and leeches to a willow root tangle water over his head and a nest of cottonmouths leaving the patrol to utau dag rode back to town supporting the very sick and shaken man in front of him dag was not happily called upon to do anything unadvised and perilous with their grounds on the way though he was grimly aware utau had urged the escort upon him against just that chance but the snakebit man survived not only the ride but also being dipped briskly in the bathhouse dried and carried up and slung into bed by that time chato and mari had been found allowing dag to turn the responsibility for further remedies over to them some news mari imparted sent dag in search of fawn even before a visit to the bathhouse on his own behalf the sound of fawns voice raised in what else a question tugged his ear as he was passing down the end stairs and he aboutfaced into the secondfloor corridor a door stood opensaunsand he paused outside it as sauns voice returned my first impression of him was as one of those grumpy old fellows who never talks except to criticize you you know the sort oh yes he rode or walked in the back and never spoke much the light began to dawn for me when mari set him at the capthats the patroller in the end or edge position of a grid with no one beyond we dont spread out to the limits of our vision dyou see but to the limits of our groundsenses if you and the patrollers to your sides can just sense each other you know you arent missing any malice sign between you mari sent him out a mile thats more than double the best range of my groundsense fawn made an encouraging noise saun suitably rewarded continued then i got to noticing that whenever mari wanted something done out of the ordinary way shed send him or that it was his idea he didnt tell tales often but when he did they were from all over i mean everywhere id start to add up all the people and places in my head and think how id thought he had no humor but finally figured out it was just maddeningdry he didnt seem like much at first but he sure accumulated and you different than yours ill say he just arrived all at once very definitely there i feel like ive been unpacking him ever since and am nowhere near the bottom yet huh hes like that on patrol in a way is he good its like hes more there than anyone no thats not right its like hes so nowhereelse if you see mm maybe how old is he really ive had trouble figuring that out suppressed ground or no someone was bound to notice the swamp reek wafting from the hall on the humid summer air pretty soon dag unquirked his lips knocked on the doorframe and stepped inside saun lay abed wearing above only his bandages the rest however clothed was covered by a sheet fawn in her blue dress sat leaning back in a chair with her bare feet up on the bed edge catching presumably with her wriggling toes whatever faint breeze might carry from the window for once her hands were empty but sauns brown hair showed signs of being recently combed and rebraided into two neat workmanlike plaits dag was greeted with broad smiles on two faces equally fresh with youth and pale with recent injury both hurt nearfatally on his watchnow there was a thought to cringe frombut their expressions showed only trust and affection he tried to muster a twinge of generational jealousy but their beauty just made him want to weep not good six days on patrol with nary a malice sign shouldnt leave him this tired and strange how de spark lookin for you hello saun howre the ribs better saun sat up eagerly his flinch belying his words they have me walking up and down the hall now fawn heres been keeping me company good said dag genially and what have you two found to talk about saun looked embarrassed oh this and that fawn returned more nimbly why were you looking for me i have something to show you in the stable so find your shoes all right she said agreeably and rose her bare feet thumped away up the hallway and he called after her slow down he did not consider himself a wit but this fetched her usual floating laugh in her natural state did she ever travel at any pace other than a scamper he studied saun wondering if any warningoff might be in order here that the broadshouldered youth was attractive to women hed had occasion to note if never before with concern but in sauns current bashed state he was no menace to curious farmer girls dag decided and cautions might draw counterquestions dag was ill equipped to answer such as what business is it of yours he settled on a friendly wave farewell and started to withdraw into the hall again oh dag called saun old patroller he grinned from his propping pillows yes blight it when had the boy picked up on that catchphrase saun must have paid closer attention to dags occasional mutters than he would have guessed no need for the fishy glower all your pet spark wants to hear are dag tales he settled back with a snicker no a snigger dag shook his head and retreated at least he managed to stop wincing before he exited the stairs dag arrived in the stable its stalls crowded with the horses of the two patrols barely before fawn did he led her to the straight stall housing the placid bay mare and pointed congratulations spark maris made it official you now own this nice horse your share of our pay from the glassforge town fathers i found you that saddle and bridle on the peg too should be about the right size for you not new but theyre in real good condition he saw no need to mention that the tack had been part of a private deal with the willing harnessmaker who had done such a fine job repairing his armharness fawns face lit with delight and she slid into the stall to run her hands over the horses neck and scratch her star and her ears which made the mare round her nostrils and drop her poll in pleasure oh dag shes wonderful butfawns nose wrinkled in suspicionare you sure this isnt your share of the pay i mean maris been nice to me and all but i didnt think shed promoted me to patroller a little too shrewd that if it had been left to me there would be a lot more spark fawn did not look entirely convinced but the horse nudged her for more scratches and she turned back to the task she needs a name she cant go on being that mare fawn bit her lip in thought ill name her grace after the river because its a pretty name and shes a pretty horse and because she carried us so smoothly do you want to be grace sweet lady hm she carried on with the petting and makingmuch the mare signified her acceptance of the affection the name or both by cocking her hips easing one hind hoof and blowing out her breath which made fawn laugh dag leaned on the stall partition and smiled at length fawns face sobered in some new thought she wandered back out of the stall and stood with her arms folded a moment except im not sure if ill be able to keep her on a milkmaids pay or whatever shes yours absolutely you could sell her dag said neutrally fawn shook her head but her expression did not lighten in any case dag continued its too early for you to be thinking of taking on work youre going to need this mare to ride first im feeling much better the bleeding stopped two days ago if i were going to get a fever i think i would have by now and i dont get dizzy anymore yes but mari has given me leave to take the sharing knife back to camp and have it looked at by a maker i know the best i was thinking since lumpton market and west blue are more or less on the way to hickory lake from here we ought to stop in at your farm on the way and put your folks out of their cruel suspense her eyes flashed up at him with an unreadable look i dont want to go back her voice wavered i dont want my whole stupid story to come out and firmed i dont want to be within a hundred miles of stupid sunny dag took a breath you dont have to stay well you cant stay your testimony will be needed on the matter of the knife once thats done the choice of where to go next is yours she sucked on her lower lip eyes downcast theyll try to make me stay i know them they wont believe i can be a grown her voice grew more urgent only if you promise to go with me promise not to leave me there his hand found its way to her shoulder in attempted reassurance of this odd distress and yet i might with your goodwill leave you here mm just trying to figure out if its the here or the there or the me leaving thats being objected to her eyes were wide and dark and her moist lips parted as her face rose at these words dag felt his head dipping his spine bending as his hand slipped around her back as if he were falling from some great height falling soft a throat cleared dryly behind him and he straightened abruptly there you are said mari thought i might find you here her voice was cordial but her eyes were narrowed oh mari said fawn a bit breathlessly thank you for getting me this nice horse i wasnt expecting it she made her little kneedip mari smiled at her managing to give dag an ironic eyebrowcock at the same time youve earned much more but it was what i could do i am not entirely without a sense of obligation this crushed conversation briefly mari continued blandly fawn would you excuse us for a while i have some patrol business to discuss with dag here oh of course fawn brightened ill go tell saun about grace and she was off again at a scamper flashing a grin over her shoulder at dag mari leaned against the end post of the stall and crossed her arms staring up at dag till fawn had vanished through the stable door and out of ear shot the aisle was cool and shady compared to the white afternoon outside redolent with horses quiet but for the occasional champing and shifting of the heatlazy animals and the faint humming of the flies dag raised his chin and clasped his hand and hand replacement behind his back winding his thumb around the hookwithspringclamp presently seated in the wooden cuff and waited not hopefully it wasnt long in coming what are you about boy mari growled any sort of response that came to whatever do you mean mari seemed a waste of time and breath dag lowered his eyelids and waited some more do i need to list everything thats wrong with this infatuation she said exasperation plain in her voice i daresay you could give the blighted lecture yourself i daresay you have a time or two he granted so what are you thinking or are you thinking he inhaled i know you want to tell me to back away from fawn but i cant not yet anyway the knife binds us till i get it up to camp were going to have to travel together for a time yet you cant argue with that its not the traveling that worries me its whats going to happen when you stop im not sleeping with her aye yet youve had your groundsense locked down tight in my presence ever since you got in well thats partly just youits such a habit with you you stay veiled in your sleep but thisyoure like a cat who thinks its hiding because its got its head stuck in a sack ah mental privacy now theres a farmer concept that could stand to catch on she snorted fine chance im taking her up to camp dag said mulishly thats a given in a sweetly cordial voice mari murmured going to show her off to your mother oh how lovely dags shoulders hunched well go by her farm first oh and youll meet her mother wonderful thatll be a success cant you two just hold hands and jump off a cliff together itd be faster and less painful his lips twitched at this involuntarily likely but it has to be done does it mari pushed off the post and stalked back and forth across the stable aisle now if you were a young patroller lout looking to dip his wick in the strange id just thump him on the side of the head and end this thing here and now i cant tell if youre trying to fool me or yourself dag set his teeth and went on saying nothing it seemed wisest she fetched up at her post again leaned back scuffed her boot and sighed look dag ive been watching you for a long time now out on patrol youd never neglect your gear or your food or your sleep or your feet not like the youngsters who get heroic delusions about their stamina till they crash into a rock wall you pace your body for the long haul dag tilted his head in acknowledgment not certain where she was going with this but though youd never starve your body to wasting and still expect to go on you starve your heart yet act as though you can still draw on it forever without the debt ever coming due if you fallwhen you fall youre going to fall like a starving man im standing here watching you start to topple now and i dont know if any words of mine are strong enough to catch you i dont know why blast and blight ither voice shifted in renewed aggravationyou havent let yourself get stringbound with any one of the nice widows that your motherwell all right not your motherthat one of your friends or other kin used to introduce you to till they gave up in despair if you had i daresay youd be immune to this foolishness now knife or no dag hunched tighter it would not have been fair to the woman i cant have what i had with kauneo over again not because of any lack on the womans part its me i cant give what i gave to kauneo used up emptied out dry nobody expected that except maybe you most people dont have what you had with kauneo if half of what ive heard is true yet they contrive to rub along tolerably well just the same shed die of thirst trying to draw from that well mari shook her head mouth flat with disapproval dramatic dag he shrugged dont push for answers you dont want to hear then she looked away pursed her lips stared up at the rafters stuck about with dusty cobwebs and wisps of hay and tried another tack now all things considered i cant object to your indulging yourself not you and after all this farmer girl has no relatives here to kick up a fuss for me dags eyes narrowed and a fools hope rose in his heart was mari about to say she wouldnt interfere surely not if you cant be turned or reasoned with well these things happen eh the sarcasm tingeing her voice quenched the hope but if you are so bound and determined to get in youd better have a plan for how youre going to get out and i want to hear it i dont want to get out i dont want an end unsettling realization and dag wasnt sure where to put it blight it he hadnt even begunanything this argument was moving too fast for him no doubt maris intent all the great plans i ever made for my life ended in horrible surprises mari i swore off plans sometime back she shook her head in scorn i halfway wish you were some lout i could just thump well no i dont but youre you if shes cut up at the endand i dont see how this can be anything other than a real short rideso will you be double disaster i can see it coming and so can you so what are you going to do dag said tightly what do you suggest seeress that theres no way you can end this well so dont start i havent started dag wanted to point out a truth on his lips and a lie in his ground perhaps endurance had been his last remaining virtue for a long long time now he hugged his patience to him and stood just stood in the face of his stubborn silence mari shifted her stance and her attack once more there are two great duties given to those born of our blood the first is to carry on the long war with resolute fortitude in living and in dying in hope or out of it in that duty you have not ever failed once not ever she contradicted this overwhelming defeat is not failure its just defeat it happens sometimes i never heard that you ran from that ridge dag no he admitted i didnt have the chance surrounded makes running away a bit of a puzzle which i did not get time to solve aye well but then theres the other great duty the second duty without which the first is futile dross and delusion the duty you have so far failed altogether his head came up stung and wary ive given blood and sweat and all the years of my life so far i still owe my bones and my hearts death which i mean to give which i will give in their due time if chance permits but suicide is a selfindulgence and a desertion of duty no one will ever accuse me of i decided that years ago so i dont know what else you want her lips compressed her gaze went intent with conviction the other duty is to create the next generation to hand on the war to because all we do the miles and years we walk all that we bleed and sweat and sacrifice will come to nothing if we do not also pass on our bodies legacy and thats a task on which you have turned your back for the past twenty years behind his back his right hand gripped the arm cuff till he could hear the wood creak and he forced his clench to loosen lest he break what had been so recently mended he tried clamping his teeth down just as tight on any response but one leaked out nonetheless borrow my mothers jawbone did you i expect i could do her whole speech by rote ive had to listen to her complaints often enough but no this is my own hardwon with my lifes blood look i know your mother pushed you too soon and too hard after kauneo and set your back up good and stiff i know you needed more time to get over it all but times gone by dag time and past time that little farmer girls the proof of it if you needed any and i dont want to be caught underneath when you come crashing down you wont be were leaving not good enough i want your word you cant have it and was that itself some decision he knew he wavered but had he already gone beyond some point of no return ana what would that point be he scarcely knew but his head was pounding with the heat and a bonedeep exhaustion gripped him his drying clothing itched and stank he longed for a cold bath if he held his head under for long enough would the pain stop ten or fifteen minutes ought to do it if i had died at wolf ridge i would be childless now just the same he snarled at mari and not even my kin could complain or leastways i wouldnt have to listen i have a plan why dont you just pretend that im dead he turned on his heel and marched out which would have made a grander exit if she hadnt shouted so furiously and so accurately after him oh certainlywhy not you do chapter dag thought hed had his groundsense strapped down tight but whatever of his vile mood still leaked through the cracks was enough to clear the bathhouse of the three convalescent patrollers idling there within five minutes of his entry still at length both his body and his wits cooled and he went off to find some useful task to occupy himself preferably away from his comrades he found it in taking a saddle with a broken tree uptown to the harnessmakers to trade in for a replacement and retrieving some other mended gear there which filled the time till dinner and the arrival of the anxious utau and the rest of his swampslimed patrol maris arguments were not any of them wrong exactly or at all dag admitted glumly to himself ashamed he dutifully set his mind to the upholding of a selfrestraint that had once been more routine than breathing which had somehow grown as heavy as a stone cairn upon his chest dead men dont need air eh at dinner that night he behaved toward fawn with meticulous courtesy no more her eyes watched him curiously wary but there were enough other patrollers at the table for her to pelt with her questions tonight mostly about how patrol patterns were arranged and walked that his silence passed unremarked never had rectitude seemed less rewarding the next day was officially devoted to rest and the preparations for the bowdown and dag allowed himself to be made mule to help carry in supplies from uptown gathered by the more eager he crossed paths with mari only long enough to volunteer for evening watch and door duty and be briskly refused i cant put the patroller who slew the malice onto guard duty during the celebration of his own deed she said shortly id have a revolt on my handsand rightly too she added after a reluctant moment stopping his protest make sure that little farmer girl knows shes invited too shortly after he ran into the enthusiast from log hollow who was nabbing the volunteer musicians from the combined patrols for practice a novelty in the experience of most involved and did not escape till almost time to collect fawn fawn peered at her hair in the shaving mirror and decided that the green ribbons loaned by reela of the broken leg matched her good dress very well reela had been teaching her how to do lakewalker hair braids which had turned out to have various meanings the knot at the nape fawn had found out was a sign of mourning except when it was a prudent arrangement for going into a fight knowing this made the mob of patrollers look different to fawns eyes and gave her a strange feeling as though the world had shifted under her feet if only a little and could never shift back in any case she could be certain that tonights style with her hair tied up high on the back of her head by a jaunty bow and allowed to swing like a horsetail curls bouncing didnt say anything she didnt intend in patroller dag came to her door seeming more relaxed this evening fawn wondered if mari had imparted some bad news to him in the stable yesterday to so depress his spirits last night but now his eyes were bright his simple white shirt made his coppery skin seem to glow yesterdays reek of swamp and horse and emergency was replaced with lavender soap and something warm underneath that was just dag his hair was clean and soft and already escaping whatever order a stern combing had imposed upon it looking very touchable if only she could reach that high tiptoes a stepladder something the atmosphere in the dining room was not too different from other nights ravenous and raucous except more crowded because for once everyone was there at the same time they were all notably cleaned up and many seemed to have obtained or shared scent water party clothes seemed to be everyones same clothes except laundered fawn supposed saddlebags didnt really have room for many changes the women were all still wearing trousers did they ever wear skirts hairstyles seemed more elaborate though some of the younger patrollers even wore bells in their braids food and drink especially drink overflowed through the entry hall into the next room where chairs were pushed to the walls and rugs rolled up to make a space to dance fawn found herself a seat with the rest of the convalescents saun and reela and the man from chatos patrol with the game knee and stitches in his jaw and that poor subdued fellow whod managed to get snakebit yesterday and was now goodnaturedly enduring some pretty merciless ribbing about it the teasers also distributed fresh beer to all the chairbound however and seemed dedicated to keeping it coming fawn sipped hers and smiled shy thanks dag had vanished briefly but now he returned screwing something into his wrist cap fawn blinked in astonishment to recognize a tambourine fitted with a wooden peg so he might hold it securely my goodness i didnt know you played anything he grinned at her giving the frame a last adjustment and drumming his fingers over the stretched skin the staccato sound made her sit up how clever what did you play before you lost your hand tambourine he replied cheerily i tried the flute but it tangled my fingers up even when i had twice as many and when i tackled the fiddle i was accused of tormenting cats with this i can never strike a wrong note besideshe lowered his voice conspiratoriallyit gets me off the hook for the dancing he winked at her and drifted up to the head of the room where some other patrollers were collecting their array of instruments seemed a bit random but mostly small as would fit in a spare corner of a saddlebag there were several flutes of wood clay or bone two fiddles and a makeshift collection of overturned tubs for thumping on obviously filched from around the hotel the room filled and quieted a grayhaired man with a bone flute stepped forward into the hush and began a melody fawn found haunting it made the hairs stir on her arms disturbed she studied that pale length of bone its surface burned about with writing and was suddenly certain it was someones relative because thighbones came in pairs but hearts came one by one so what did lakewalker makers do with the leftovers in all honor the tune was so elegiac it had be some prayer or hymn or memorial fawn could see a few peoples lips moving on words they obviously knew by heart a hush followed for a full minute with everyones eyes downcast a rattle like a snake from the tambourine and a sudden spatter of drumming broke the sorrow to bits as if trying to blow it out the windows the fiddlers and flute players and tubthumpers struck up a lively dance tune and patrollers swung out onto the floor they did not dance in couples but in groups weaving complex patterns around one another except for the shifting about of partners in blithe disregard of anyones sex it reminded fawn a lot of farmer barn dances although the patrollers seemed to do without a caller she wondered if they were doing something with their groundsenses to take the place of that outside coordination intensely complex as the patterns seemed the dancers seldom missed a step although when someone did it was greeted with much hooting and laughter as the whole bunch rearranged themselves picked up the pulse and started again the bells rang merrily dag stood at the back of the musicians keeping steady time punctuating his rhythms with wellplaced spurts of jingling watching it all and looking unusually happy he didnt talk or sing but he smiled a bit as the jokes flew by the younger patrollers appetites for fast dances seemed insatiable but at length the wheezing musicians traded out for a couple of singers outside the long summer sun had gone down and the room was hot with candles and lamps and sweaty bodies dag unscrewed his tambourine and came to sit at fawns feet catching up on his beerdrinking with the aid of what seemed a bucket brigade of wellwishers one song was new to fawn another to a known tune but with different words and a third shed heard her aunt nattie croon as she spun thread and she wondered if it had originated with farmers or lakewalkers the singers were a man and a woman from chatos patrol and their voices blended beguilingly hers pure and fair his low and resonant by this time fawn wasnt sure if the song about a lost patroller dancing in the woods with magical bears was fantasy or not the man with the bone flute joined them making a trio when he sent a preamble of notes into the air for the next song dag set his halffull glass rather abruptly on the floor his smile over his shoulder at fawn more resembled a grimace privy run beer eh he excused himself and levered to his feet three sets of eyes marked his movement in concern maris utaus and one other older comrades mari made a gesture of query should i to which dag returned a small headshake he trod out without looking back fifty folk walked out that day the song began and fawn quickly twigged to dags sudden retreat because it turned out to be a long involved ballad about the battle of wolf ridge it named no names in its weaving of poetry and tune of woe gallantry sacrifice and victory subtly inviting all to identify with its various heroes and under any other circumstances fawn would have found it thrilling most of the patrollers truly seemed variously thrilled or moved reela swiped away a tear and saun hung openmouthed in the intensity of his listening they do not know fawn realized saun who had patrolled with dag for a year and claimed to know him well did not know utau did listening with his hand over his mouth eyes dark mari of course did with her glances at the archway out which dag had quietly vanished and through which he did not return the song finished at last and another more cheerful one started when dag still did not return fawn slipped out herself someone else was exiting the commode chamber so she tried outside it was blessedly cooler out here the blue shadows relieved by yellow light from the cheery windows from the lanterns flanking the porch door and across the yard from above the stable doors dag was sitting on the bench outside the stable head back against the wall staring up at the summer stars she sat down beside him and just let the silence hang for a time for it was not uncomfortable cloaking them like the night the stars burned bright and seemingclose despite the lanterns the sky was cloudless you all right she asked at last oh yeah he ran his hand through his hair and added reflectively when i was a boy i used to just love all those heroic ballads i memorized dozens wonder if all those other old battle songs would have seemed as obscene to their survivors yet he claims not to sing unable to answer this fawn offered at least it helps people remember yes alas it wasnt a bad song in fact i thought it was awfully good as a song i mean i dont deny it not the fault of the songmakerwhoever it was did a fine job if it were less effective it wouldnt make me want to weep or rage so bad i suppose which was why i left the room my groundsense was a little open in aid of the musicmaking i didnt want to blight the mood pack thirtyeight tired battlenervy patrollers into one building for a week and moods start to get around fast do you often make music when youre out on patrol she tried to picture patroller song and dance around a campfire the weather likely didnt always cooperate only sometimes camps can be pretty busy in the evenings curing hides and meat preserving medicinal plants we pick up while patrolling keeping logs and maps up to date if its a mounted patrol a lot of horse care weapons training for the youngsters and practice for everyone mending of clothes and boots and gear cooking washing all simple tasks but they do go on his voice slowed in reminiscence patrols vary in sizein the north they send out companies of a hundred and fifty or two hundred for the great seasonal wilderness sweepsbut south of the lake patrols are usually smaller and shorter even so youre like to be in each others hair for weeks on end with no entertainment but each other after a while everyone knows all the songs so theres gossip and factions and jokes and practical jokes and revenge for practical jokes and fistfights over revenge for practical jokes and knife fights overwell you get the idea although if the emotions are allowed to melt down into that sour a soup you can bet the patrol leader will be having a very memorable talk with fairbolt crow about it later have you ever not about that although all talks with fairbolt tend to be memorable in the shadows he scratched his nose and smiled then leaned his head back and let his eyes rest on the mellow windows across the yard the singing had stopped and dance tunes had begun again feet thumping on the floor made the whole building pulse like a drum lets see what else on warm summer nights gathering firewood is always a popular activity fawn considered this and the amusement underlying his voice should think that would be wanted on cold nights more mm but you see on warm nights no one complains if folks are gone for two hours and come back having forgotten the firewood bathing in the river thats another good one in the dark said fawn doubtfully in the river is even more the question especially when the seasons turned frosty walks oh sure thats believable when everyones been out slogging since dawn scouting around toothat draws many selfless volunteers some dangerous squirrels out in those woods they could mount an attack at any time you cant be too prepared a rumbling chuckle escaped his chest oh said fawn finally understanding her lips curled up if only for the rare sight of the laugh lines at the corners of his eyes followed by the breakups and the makeups and the people not talking to each other or worse going over it all again till youre ready to stuff your head in your blanket and scream for the listening to it ah well he vented a tolerant sigh the older patrollers generally have things worked out smooth but the younger ones can be downright restive its not as though folks lives stop for patrol walking the patterns isnt some emergency where you can drop everything deal heroically and then go home for good and all it all starts again tomorrow at dawn and youll have to get up and walk your share just the same he stretched joints creaking a bit as if in contemplation of such an early start its not that were all mad you know although sometimes it seems like it he went on in a lower voice groundsense makes our moods very contagious not just by speech and gestures its like it gets in the air his hand traced an upward spiral now for instance once a certain number of people open their grounds to each other there starts to be leakage bowdowns are really good for that that building over theres downright awash right now all sorts of things can start to seem like a good idea absent gods be thanked for the beer the beer beer i have concludedhe held up an edifying finger and fawn began to realize that he was slightly drunk people had kept the musicians well supplied with encouraging refreshment earlierexists for the purpose of being blamed the next day very regrettable beverage beer farmers use it for that too fawn observed a universal need he blinked i think i need some more are you thirsty no he slumped down staring at her sidelong his eyes were dark pools in this light like night condensed the lanternlight made glimmering orange halos around his hair and slid across his faintly sweatsheened features like a caress just considering the potential of regret he leaned toward her and fawn froze in hope so strong it felt like terror did he mean to kiss her his breath was tinged with beer and exertion and dag hers stopped altogether stillness heartbeats no he sighed no mari was right he sat up again fawn nearly burst into unfathomable tears nearly reached for him no you cant darent hell think youre that that awful word sunny used it burned in her memory like an infected gash slut it was an ugly word that had somehow turned her into an ugly thing like a splash of ink or blood or poison discoloring water for dag i would be only beautiful and tall she wished herself taller if she were taller no one could call her names just for for wanting so much he sighed smiled rose gave her a hand up they went back inside in the entry hall dags head turned listening good someones using the tambourine they can get along without me for whats left of this truly the music coming through the archway seemed slower and sleepier he made for the staircase fawn found her voice you going up yeah it was good but its been enough for one night you im a little tired too she followed after him what had happened or not happened out on the bench felt a lot like that moment on the road some turn she had somehow missed as they exited the staircase on the second floor bumping and laughter echoed up behind them dirla and two young patrollers from chatos group burst out giggling saluted dag with cheerful hellos and swung down the adjoining hallway fawn stopped and stared as they paused at dirlas door for one fellow looped his arm around her neck and kissed her but she was still holding the others hand to her chest dirlatall dirlaextended one booted foot and pushed the door open and they all fell through it closed cutting off some jest dag fawn said hesitantly what was that he cocked an amused eyebrow at her what did it look like to you is dirla taking that i mean them is she going to bed with those fellows seems likely likely if his groundsense did half what he said he likely knew very well both of them well numbers are generally uneven out on patrol people make adjustments dirla is very um generous fawn swallowed oh she followed him up their hallway razi and utau were just unlocking the door to their room utau looked and smelled distinctly the worse for beer and razis hair escaping his long braid hung plastered in sweaty strands across his forehead from the dancing they both bade dag a civil good night and disappeared within well said fawn determined to be fair its too bad they werent lucky enough to find ladies too theyre too nice to be lonely she added after a suspicious glance upward dag why are you biting your wrist he cleared his throat sometime when i am either a lot more sober or a lot more drunk spark i shall attempt to explain the exceedingly complicated story of how those two came to both be married to the same accommodating woman back at hickory lake camp lets just say they look out for each other lakewalker ladies can marry more than one fellow at a time youre gulling me not normally and no im not i said it was complicated they fetched up before his door he gave her a slightly strained smile well i think dirla is greedy fawn decided or else those fellows are awfully pushy ah no among lakewalkers of the civil sort which you know we all are the woman invites the man accepts or not and let me tell you saying no gracefully without giving offense is a burden i guarantee whatever is going on back there was her idea among farmers that would be thought too forward only bad girls or or stupid foolish ones would well good girls wait to be asked and even then theyre supposed to say no unless he comes with land in hand he stretched his right arm out supporting himself on the wall half sheltering her he stared down at her after a long long thoughtful pause he breathed do they now he scraped his teeth over his lower lip the chip catching briefly his eyes were lakes of darkness to fall into going down for fathoms so um spark how many nights would you say we have wasted here she turned her face upward swallowed and said tremulously way too many they did not exactly fall into each others arms it was more of a mutual lunge he kicked his door open and kicked it closed again after them because his arms were too full of her her feet did not touch the floor but that was not the only reason she felt as though she was flying half his kisses missed her mouth but that was all right almost any part of his skin sliding beneath her lips was joy he set her down reached for the door bar and stopped himself wheezing slightly no dont stop now his voice recaptured seriousness if you mean this spark bar the door not taking her eyes from his dear bony faintly frenzied face she did so the oak board fell into place in its brackets with a solid satisfying clunk it seemed a sufficient compromise of customs his hand reluctantly slid from her shoulder and let her go just long enough for him to stride over and turn up the oil lamp on the table beside his bed dull orange glow became yellow flare within the glass chimney filling the room with light and shadow he sat rather abruptly on the edge of his bed as if his knees had given way and stared at her holding out his hand it was shaking she climbed up into the circle of his arm then folded her knees under her to raise her face to his again his kisses slowed as if tasting her lips then startlingly tasting in truth his tongue slipping inside her mouth odd but nice she decided and earnestly tried to do it back his hand wound in her hair undid her ribbon and let her curls fall down to her shoulders how did people get rid of their clothes at times like these sunny had merely lifted her skirts and shoved down her drawers so had the malice come to think sh now what dark thought went past just now dag chided be here with me how did you know what i thought she said trying not to be unnerved i dont i read grounds not minds spark sometimes all groundsense does is give you more to be confused about his hand hesitated on the top button of her dress may i please she said relieved of a procedural worry of course dag would know how to do this she had only to watch and copy he undid a few more fastenings gently pulled down one sleeve and kissed her bared shoulder she gathered her courage and went after the buttons of his shirt mutual confidence established things went faster after that cloth tumbling to the floor over the side of the bed the last thing he undid after a hesitation and a glance at her from under his lashes was his arm harness unbuckling the straps around his lower arm and above his elbow and setting it on the table his hand rubbed the red marks left by the leather for him she realized dimly it was a greater gesture of vulnerability and trust than removing his trousers had just been light dag muttered hesitating light farmers are supposed to like it dark ive heard leave it on fawn whispered and he smiled and lay back when all that height was laid out flat it stretched a long way his bed was not as narrow as hers in the next room but still he filled it from corner to corner she felt like an explorer facing a mountain range that crossed her whole horizon i want to look at you im no rose spark maybe not but you make my eyes happy the corners of his eyes crinkled up enchantingly at that and she had to stretch up and kiss them skin slid on skin for the length of her body his muscles were long and tapering and the skin of his torso was unevenly tanned where his shirts had been on or off paler still below his waist along his lean flank a faint dusting of dark hair across his chest narrowed and thickened going down in a vee below his belly her fingers twined in it brushing with and against the grain so with his odd lakewalker senses what more of her did he touch she swallowed and dared to say you said you could tell hm his hand spiraled around her breast and how could such a soft caress make it suddenly ache so sweetly the time of the month a woman can get a child you said you could tell or wait no was that only lakewalker ladies a beautiful pattern in her ground you said yes and shed believed sunny hadnt she on a piece of bed lore that if not a mean lie had turned out to be a costly untruth and sunnys tale had seemed a lot less unlikely than this a shiver of unease am i being stupid again was interrupted when dag propped himself up on his left elbow and looked at her with a serious smile his hand traced her belly crossing the malice marks there that had turned to thin black scabs youre not at risk tonight spark but i should be right terrified to try to make love to you that way so soon after your injuries youre so dainty and im um well there are other things id very much like to show you she risked a peek down but her eye caught on the parallel black lines beneath his beautiful hand and a flash of sorrow and guilt shook her would she ever be able to lie down with anyone without these cascades of unwelcome memory washing through her and then she wondered if dagwith it seemed so many more accumulated memorieshad a similar problem sh he soothed and his thumb crossed her lips though she had not spoken reach for lightness bright spark you do not betray your sorrow to set it aside for an hour itll be waiting patiently for you to pick it up again on the other side how long time wears grief smooth like a river stone the weight will always be there but itll stop scraping you raw at the slightest touch but you have to let the time flow by you cant rush it we wear our hair knotted for a year for our losses and it is not too long a while she reached up and ran her hand through his dark tousle petting and winding it through her fingers gratified fingers she gave a lock a little tug so what was this supposed to mean shaved for head lice he offered breaking the bleakness as she giggled no doubt his intent go on you did not either have head lice not lately theyre another story but i have better things to do with my lips right now he began kissing his way down her body and she wondered what magic was in his tongue not just for his kisses and how they seemed to lay trails of cool fire across her skin but for how with his words he seemed to lift stones from her heart her breath caught as his tongue reached the tip of her breast and did exhilarating things there sunny had merely pinched her through her dress and and blight sunny for haunting her head like this now dags hand drifted up his thumb caressing her forehead then he sat up roll over he murmured let give you a back rub think i can bring your body and ground into better tune do youif you want i wont say trust me i will say try me he whispered into her curls try me for a onehanded man he did this awfully well she thought muzzily a few minutes later her face pressed into the pillow memory seemed to melt out of her brain altogether the bed creaked as he moved off it briefly and she opened one eye dont let him get away but he returned in a moment a slight gurgle a cool splash pooling on the inward curve of her back the scent of chamomile and clover oh you got some of that nice oil she thought a moment when seven days ago she muffled a snicker hey a patroller should be prepared for any emergency is this an emergency just give me a bit more time spark and well see besides its good for my hand which tends to get rough you dont want hangnails catching in tender places trust me on that the oil did change the texture of his touch as he worked his way smoothly down to her toes turned her over and started back up hand soon supplemented with tongue in very tender and surprising places indeed his touch was like silk there there there ah she jerked in surprise but eased back so this was making love it was all very nice but it seemed a bit onesided shouldnt it be your turn she asked anxiously not yet he said rather muffled m pretty happy where i am and your ground is flowing almost right now let me let me just minutes flew something was swirling through her like some astonishingly sweet emergency his touch grew firmer swifter surer her eyes closed her breath came faster and her spine began to arch then her breath caught and she went rigid silent openmouthed as the sensation burst from her climbing up to white out her brain to rush like a tide to her fingers and toes and ebb her back eased and she lay shaking and amazed oh when she could she raised her head and stared down over her body strange new landscape that it had become dag was up on one elbow watching her in return eyes black and bright with a grin on his face bordering on smug better he inquired as if he didnt know was that some some lakewalker magic no wonder folks tried to follow these people to the ends of the world nope that was little spark magic all your own a hundred mysteries seemed to fly up and away like a flock of startled birds into the night no wonder people want to do this it all makes much more sense now indeed he crawled up the bed to kiss her again the taste of herself on his lips mixed with the scent of chamomile and clover was a little disturbing but she valiantly kissed him back then brushed her lips across his enthralling cheekbones his eyelids definite chin and back to his mouth as she giggled helplessly she could feel an answering rumble from deep in his chest as she lay across him she had brushed against him but she had not yet touched him it was surely his turn now hands should work two ways she sat up blinking against dizziness he stretched out straight and smiled up his crinkling eyes now resting inquiringly on her downright inviting in an unhurried sort of way he lay open to her to her gaze in a way that astonished her anew all but his mysterious ground of course that was beginning to seem an unfair advantage where to begin how to begin she recalled how he had started may i touch you too please he breathed it might be mere mimicry but it was a start and once started acquired its own momentum she kissed her way down and up his body and arrived back at the middle her first tentative touch made him jerk and catch his breath and she shied back no its all right go on he huffed im a little um sensitized just at the moment its good almost anything you can do is good sensitized is that what you call it her lips curled up im trying to be polite spark she tried various touches strokes and grips wondering if she was doing this right her hands felt clumsy and rather too small the occasional catches of his breath were not very informative she thought though once in a while his hand covered hers to squeeze some silent suggestion was that gasp pleasure or pain his apparent endurance for pain was a bit frightening when she thought about it can i try your oil on my hands certainly although this may be over rather quickly if you do she hesitated couldnt we do it again sometime oh yes im very renewable just not very fast nothe sighedas quick as when i was younger anyway though thats mostly been to my advantage tonight and mine his patience humbled her well then the oil made her hands slip and slide in ways that intrigued her and seemed to please him too she grew more daring that for example made him jerk no convulse much as hed done to her a while ago brave spark he gasped is that good yes figured if you thought it would please me it might be something that pleased you too clever girl he crooned his eyes closing again she chilled please dont make fun of me his eyes opened and his brows drew in he raised his head from the pillow and frowned down over his torso at her wasnt you have one of the hungriest minds its ever been my pleasure to meet you may have been starved of information but your wits are as sharp as a blade she caught her breath lest it escape as a sudden surprised sob his words could not be true but oh they sounded so nice to hear at her shocked look he added a little impatiently come child you cant be that bright and not know it papa said i must be a fool to ask so many questions all the time never that his head tilted and his eyes took on that uncanny inward look theres a deep dark place in your ground just there major fissure and blockage i its not going to be the work of an hour to find the bottom of that one im afraid she gulped then lets set it aside with the rest of the stones for now itll wait she bent her head im neglecting you i wont argue with that tongues she discovered worked like fingers on fellows quite as well if differently as they worked on ladies well then what would happen if she did this and also this and that at the same time she found out it was fascinating to watch even from the oblique angle of view down here she could see his expression grow so inward it might have been a trance for a moment she wondered if levitation were a lakewalker magical skill for he seemed about to rise off the bed are you all right she asked anxiously when his body stopped shuddering your forehead got all wrinkled up funny there for a minute when your um back curved up like that his hand waved while he regained his breath his eyes stayed squeezed shut but finally opened again sorry what sorry was waiting for all those white sparks on the insides of my eyelids to finish exploding that wasnt something to miss does that often happen no no indeed are you all right she repeated his grin lit his face like a streak of fire all right i think im downright astounding from an angle of attack that would seem to allow at best a wallow he lunged up and wrapped both arms around her and dragged her back down to his chest heedless of the mess theyd made it was his turn to kiss her face all over laughter turned to accidental touching to dag youre ticklish no im not or only in certain aiee when he got his breath back he added youre fiendish spark i like that in a woman gods i havent laughed this much in i cant remember i like how you giggle i was not giggling that would be undignified in a man of my years what was that noise then chortling yes definitely chortling well she decided it looks good on you everything looks good on you she sat up on her elbow and let her gaze travel the long route down his body and back nothing looks good on you too its most unfair oh as if you arent sitting there looking looking what she breathed sinking back into his grip naked edible beautiful like spring rain and star fire he drew her in again their kisses grew longer lazier sleepier he made a great effort and reached out and turned off the lamp soft summernight air stirred the curtains he flung the sheet up and let it settle over them she cuddled into his arm pressing her ear to his chest and closed her eyes to the ends of the world she thought melting into deeper darkness chapter dag spent the radiant summer dawn proving beyond doubt to fawn that her last nights firstinalifetime experience neednt be a onceinalifetime experience when they woke from the ensuing sated nap it was midmorning dag seriously considered the merits of lying low till the patrols had taken their planned departure but unexpectedly sharp hunger drove both him and fawn to rise wash dress and go see if breakfast was still to be had downstairs fawn entered the staircase ahead of dag and turned sideways to let utau clumping up to collect more gear to load pass her by dag smiled brightly at his sometimelinker utaus head cranked over his shoulder in astonishment and he walked into the far wall with a muffled thud righted himself and wheeled to stare prudently deciding to ignore that dag followed fawn before utau could speak dag suspected he needed to get better control of his stretching mouth as well as of his sparking ground a responsible mature respected patroller should not walk about grinning and glowing like some dementedly carved pumpkin it was like to frighten the horses maris patrol was slated to ride north and pick up their pattern again where it had been broken off almost two weeks ago by the call for aid with his patrols purse newly topped off by the glassforgers chato planned to continue on his mission to purchase horses from the limestone country south of the grace he would be slowed on the first leg by a wagon to carry saun and reela neither quite ready to ride yet the pair were to finish convalescing at a lakewalker camp that controlled a ferry crossing down on the river and be picked up again on the return journey both patrols had planned their removals for the crack of noon a merciful hour dag sensed chatos moderating influence at work mari was perfectly capable of ordering a dawn departure after a bowdown then concealing her evil hilarity behind a rodstraight face as her bleary troop stumbled out mari was far and away dags favorite relative but that was a pretty low fence to get over and he prayed to the absent gods that he might avoid her altogether this morning after breakfast dag helped lug the last of sauns gear to the wagon and turned to find his prayers as usual unanswered mari stood holding the reins of her horse staring at him in mute exasperation he let his eyebrows rise trying desperately not to smile or worse chortle what she drew a long breath but then just let it out besotted fool theres no more use trying to talk to you this morning than to those twittering wrens in that elm across the yard i said my piece ill see you back in camp in a few weeks maybe the novelty will have worn off by then and youll have your wits back i dont know you can do your own blighted explaining to fairbolt is all i can say dags back straightened that i will eh she turned to gather her reins but then turned back seriousness replacing the aggravation in her eyes be careful of yourself in farmer country dag he would have preferred a tart dressingdown to this true concern against which he had no defense im always careful not sos i ever noticed she said dryly silently dag offered her a leg up which she accepted with a nod settling in her saddle with a tired sigh she was growing thinner he thought these last couple of years he gave her a smile of farewell but it only made her lean on her pommel and lower her voice to him ive seen you in a score of moods including foul ive never before seen you so plain happy enough to make an old woman weep you are take care of that little girl too then i plan to huh do you now she shook her head and clucked her horse forward and dag belatedly recalled his last statement to her on the subject of plans but he could almost watch himself being displaced in her head with the hundred details a patrol leader on duty must trackas well he remembered her gaze turned to sweep over the rest of her charges checking their gear their horses their faces judging their readiness finding it enough to go on with this day again fawn had been helping reela apparently one of the several dozen people or so it seemed to dag that fawn had managed to make friends of in this past week the two young women bade each other cheery goodbyes and fawn popped down off the wagon to come stand with him as he watched his patrol form up and trot out through the gateway at least as many riders gave a parting wave to her as to him in a few minutes chatos patrol too mounted up and wheeled out at a slower pace for the rumbling wagon saun waved as enthusiastic a farewell as his injuries permitted silence settled in the stable yard dag sighed caught as usual between relief to be rid of the whole maddening lot of them and the disconcerting loneliness that always set in when he was parted from his people he told himself that it made no sense to be shaken by both feelings simultaneously anyway there were more practical reasons to be wary when one was the only lakewalker in a townful of farmers and he struggled to wrap his usual guarded courtesy back about himself except now with fawn also inside the horse boys disbanded toward the tack room or the back door to the kitchen walking slowly in the humidity and chatting with each other your patrollers werent so bad said fawn staring thoughtfully out the gate i didnt think theyd accept me but they did this is patrol camp is different said dag absently how eh weak platitudes rose to his mind time will tell dont borrow trouble youll see he felt curiously loath to explain to her on this bright morning why his personal war on malices wasnt the sole reason that he volunteered for more extra duty than any other patroller in hickory lake camp his record had been seventeen straight months in the field without returning there though hed had to switch patrols several times to do it must we leave today too asked fawn dag came to himself with a start and wrapped his arm around her snugging her to his hip no in fact its a twoday hard ride to lumpton from here but weve no need to ride hard we can make an easy start tomorrow take it in gentle stages or even later the seductive thought occurred i was wondering if i ought to give my room back to the hotel since im not really a patroller and all what no that room is yours for as long as you want it spark dag said indignantly um well thats sort of the point i thought she bit her lip but her eyes he realized were sparkling i was wondering if i could sleep in with you for frugality of course frugality yes thats the thing you are a thoughtful girl spark she cast him a merry smirk she flashed an entrancing dimple when she smirked which made his heart melt like a block of butter left in the summer sun she said ill go move my things he followed feeling as utterly scatterwitted as mari had accused him of being he could not could not run up and down the streets of glassforge leaping and shouting to the blue sky and the entire population she says i make her eyes happy he really wanted to though they did not leave the next day for it was raining nor the next either for rain threatened then too on the following morning dag declared fawn too sore from the previous nights successfully concluded bed experiments to ride comfortably although by midafternoon she was hopping around as happily as a flea and he was limping as the pulled muscle in his back seized up which provided the next days excuse for lingering as well he pictured the conversation with fairbolt why are you late dag sorry sir i crippled myself making passionate love to a farmer girl yeah thatd go over well watching fawn discover the delights that her own body could provide her was an enchantment to dag as endlessly beguiling as water lilies he had to cast his mind far back for comparisons as hed made those discoveries at a much younger age he could indeed remember being a little crazed with it all for a while he found he really didnt need to rack his brains to provide variety in his lovemaking for she was still overwhelmed by the marvel of repeatability so he probably hadnt created anything he couldnt handle quite dag also discovered in himself a previously unsuspected weakness for foot rubs if ever fawn wanted to fix him in one place she didnt need to hogtie him with ropes when her small firm hands worked their way down past his ankles he slumped like a man poleaxed and just lay there paralyzed trying not to drool too unattractively into his pillow in those moments never getting out of bed again for the rest of his life seemed the very definition of paradise as long as spark was in the bed with him the short summer nights filled themselves but dag was unsettled by how swiftly the long days also slipped by a gentle ride out for fawn to try her new mare and riding trousers with a picnic by the river turned into an afternoon under a curtaining willow tree that lasted till sundown sassa the horseford kinsman popped up again and dag found in fawn an apparently bottomless appetite for tours of glassforge crafters her endless curiosity and passion for questions was by no means limited to patrollers and sex flattering as that had been but seemed to extend to the whole wide world sassas willing nay proud escort and array of family connections guided them through the complex back premises of a brick burner a silversmith a saddler three kinds of mills a potterfawn cast a simple pot under the womans enthusiastic tutelage becoming cheerfully muddiedand a repeat of the visit to sassas own glassworks because dag had missed it before on account of being up to his waist in swamp dag at first mustered a mere polite interesthe seldom paid close attention anymore to the details of anything he wasnt being asked to track and slaybut found himself drawn in along the trail of fawns fascination with studied and sweating intensity the glass workers brought together sand and fire and meticulous timing to effect transformations of the very ground of their materials into fragile frozen brilliance this is farmer magic and they dont even realize it dag thought completely taken by their system of blowing glass into molds to make rapid reliable replicas sassa gave to fawn a bowl that she had seen being made the other day now annealed and she determined to take it home to her mother dag was doubtful about getting it to west blue intact in a saddlebag but sassa provided a slat box padded with straw and hope which was going to be bulky and awkward dag steeled himself to deal with it later fawn unpacked the bowl to set on the table beside their bed to catch the evening light dag sat on the bed and stared with nearly equal interest at the way the patterns pressed into it made wavering rainbows all things have grounds except where a malice has drained them he commented the grounds of living things are always moving and changing but even rocks have a sort of low steady hum when sassa made that batch of glass and cast it it was almost as if its ground came alive it transformed so now its become still again but changed its like ithis hand reached out as if grasping for the right wordsings a brighter tune fawn stood back with her hands on her hips and gave him a slightly frustrated look as if for all her questions he walked in a place she could not follow so she said slowly if things move their grounds can pushing on grounds move things dag blinked in faint shock was it chance or keen logic that brought her question so close to the heart of lakewalker secrets he hesitated thats the theory he said at last but would you like to see how a lakewalker would move the ground in that bowl from one side of the table to the other her eyes widened show me gravely he leaned over reached out with his hand and shoved the bowl about six inches dag fawn wailed in exasperation i thought you were going to show me magic he grinned briefly although mostly because he could scarcely look at her and not smile trying to move anything through its ground is like pushing on the short end of a long lever its always easier to do it by hand although its said he hesitated again its said the old sorcererlords linked together in groups to do their greater magics like matching grounds for healing or a lovers groundlock only with some lost difference dont you do that now no we are too reducedmaybe our bloodlines were adulterated in the dark times no one knows anyway its forbidden i mean for your pattern walking thats just simple perception like the difference between feeling with your hand and pushing with your hand perhaps why is pushing forbidden or was that linking up in bunches to push thats not allowed he should have known that the last remark would elicit more questions throwing one fact to fawn was like throwing one piece of meat to a pack of starving dogs it just caused a riot bad experiences he replied in a quelling tone all right by the pursing of her lips and wrinkling of her brow quelling wasnt going to work try for distraction let me tell you though not a patroller up luthlia way survives the lake country without learning how to bounce mosquitoes through their grounds ferocious little peststheyll drain you dry they will you use magic to repel mosquitoes she said sounding as though she couldnt decide whether to be impressed or offended we just have recipes for horrible stuff to rub on our skins once you know whats in them youd almost rather be bit he snickered then sighed they say we are a fallen folk and i for one believe it the ancient lords built great cities ships and roads transformed their bodies sought longevity and brought the whole world crashing down at the last though i suspect it was a really good run for a while till then mei bounce mosquitoes oh and i can summon and dismiss my horse once i get him trained up to it and help settle anothers hurting body if im lucky and see the world double down to the ground thats about it for dag magic im afraid her eyes lifted to his face and kill malices she said slowly aye that mainly he reached for her swallowing her next question with a kiss it took the better part of a week for dags boat anchor of a conscience to drag him out of the clouds and back onto the road he wished he could just jettison the blighted deadweight but one morning he turned back from shaving to find fawn halfdressed and with her bedroll open on the bed frowning down at the sharing knife that lay there he came and wrapped her in his arms her bare back to his bare torso its time i guess she said i guess so too he sighed not that you couldnt count my unused camptime by years but mari gave me leave to solve the mystery of that thing not to linger here in this brickandclapboard paradise the hirelings have been giving me squinty looks for days theyve been real nice to me she observed accurately youre good at finding friends in fact everyone from the cooks scullions chambermaids and horse boys up to the owner and his wife had grown downright defensive of fawn farmer heroine as she was to the point where dag suspected that if she demanded throw this lanky fellow into the street hed shortly find himself sitting in the dust clutching his saddlebags the glassforgers who worked here were used to patrollers and their odd ways with each other but it was clear enough to dag that they just barely tolerated this mismatch and that only for the sake of fawns obvious delight other patrons now drifting in drovers and drivers and traveling families and boatmen up from the river to secure cargoes looked askance at the odd pair and even more askance after collecting whatever garbled gossip was circulating about them dag wondered how askance he would be looked at in west blue fawn had gradually grown reconciled to the planned stop at her home partly from guilt at his word picture of her parents probable anxiety and partly by his pledge not to abandon her there it was the only promise shed ever asked him to repeat he dropped a kiss on the top of her head letting his finger snake around and drift over the healing wounds on her left cheek your bruises are fading now i figure if i bring you back to your family claiming to be your protector itll be more convincing if you dont look like you just lost a drunken brawl her lips twitched up as she caught his hand and kissed it but then her fingers drifted to the malice marks on her neck except for these dont pick they itch are they ever going to drop off the other scabs did already soon enough i judge itll leave these deep bitterred dents underneath for a time but theyll fade almost like other scars theyll turn silvery when theyre old ohthat long shiny groove on your leg that starts behind your knee and goes around up your thighwas that a maliceclawing then she had mapped every mark upon him as assiduously as a patterngrid surveyor these past days and nights and demanded annotations for most of them too just a touch i got away and my linker put his knife in a moment later she turned to hug him around the waist im glad it didnt grab any higher she said seriously dag choked a laugh me too spark they were on the straight road north by noon they rode slowly in part for their dual disinclination for their destinations but mostly because of the dogbreath humidity that had set in after the last rain the horses plodded beneath a brassy sun their riders talked or fell silent with it seemed to dag equal ease they spent the next afternoonrainy againin the loft of the barn at the wellhouse where theyd first glimpsed each other picnicking on farm fare and listening to the soothing sounds of the drops on the roof and the horses champing hay below didnt notice when the storm stopped and lingered there overnight the next day was brighter and clearer the hot white haze blown away east and they reluctantly rode on on the fifth night of the twoday ride they stopped a short leg from lumpton market to camp one last time fawn had figured an early start from lumpton would bring them to west blue before dark it was hard for dag to guess what would happen then though her slowly unfolding tales of her family had at least given him a better sense of who he would encounter they found a campsite by a winding creek out of view of the road beneath a scattered stand of leatherpod trees later in the fall the seedpods would hang down beneath the big spadeshaped leaves like hundreds of leather straps but now the trees were in full bloom spikes stood up from crowns of leaves with dozens of linenwhite blossoms the size of egg cups clustered on them breathing sweet perfume into the evening air as the moonless night fell fireflies rose up along the creek and from the meadow beyond it twinkling in the mist beneath the leatherpod tree the shadows grew black wish i could see you better fawn murmured as they lay down across their combined blankets and commenced a desultory fiddling with each others buttons no one wanted a blanket atop in this heat hm dag sat up on one elbow and smiled in the dark give me a minute spark and i might be able to do something about that no dont put more wood on the fire s too hot now wasnt going to just wait and see in fact close your eyes he extended his groundsense to its full range and found no menace for a mile just the small nesting life of the grass mice and shrews and rabbits and sleepy meadowlarks above a few fluttering bats and the silent ghostly passage of an owl he drew his net finer still filling it with tinier life not a bounce but a persuasion yes this still worked the tree began to throng with his invited visitors more and more beside him fawns face slowly emerged from the gloom as though rising from deep water can i open them yet she asked her eyes dutifully scrunched up just a moment more yes now he kept his eyes on her face as she looked up so as not to miss the best wonder of all her eyes opened then shot wide her lips parted in a gasp above them the leatherpod tree was filled with hundreds perhaps thousands ofin dags wideopen perception slightly bewilderedfireflies so dense the lighter branches bent with their load many of them crawled inside the white blossoms and when they lit the clusters of petal cups glowed like pale lanterns the cool shadowless radiance bathed them both her breath drew in oh she said rising on one elbow and staring upward oh wait i can do more he concentrated and drew down a lambent swirl of insects to spiral around and land in her dark hair lighting it like a coronet of candles dag she gave a wild laugh half delight half indignation her hands rising to gently prod her curls you put bugs in my hair i happen to know you like bugs i do she admitted fairly some kinds anyhow but how did you learn to do this up in the woods of luthlia too no actually i learned it in camp back when my groundsense first came ini was about twelve i guess the children learn it from each other no adult ever teaches it but i think most everyone knows how to catch fireflies this way we just forget grow up and get busy and all though i admit i never collected more than a handful at one time before she was smiling helplessly its a bit eerie but i like it not sure about the haireh dag theyre tickling my ears lucky bugs he leaned in and blew off the wanderers from the curve of her ear kissing the tickle away you should be crowned with light like the rising moon well she said in a gruff little voice and sniffed her gaze traced the bending lanternflowers above and returned to his face what do you want to go and do a thing like that for anyhow im already as full of joy for you as my body can hold and there you go and put more in downright wasteful i say its just going to spill over the light shimmered in her swimming eyes he pulled her up and across him and let the warm drops spatter across his chest like summer rain spill on me he whispered he released her twinkling tiara and let the tiny creatures fly up into the tree again in the scintillant glow they made slow love till midnight brought silence and sleep lumpton market was a smaller town than glassforge but lively nonetheless it lay at the confluence of two rocky rivers which flanked a long shaleandlimestone ridge running northward two old straight roads crossed there and it had surely been the site of a hinterland city when the lords ruled as it was much of the new town was made of ancient building blocks mined out of the encroaching woods and drystone walls of both ordinary fieldstone and much less identifiable rubble abounded around both outlying fields and house yards now that dags eye was alerted to it however he noticed a few newer finer houses on the outskirts built of brick the bridges were timber recent and wide and sturdy enough for big wagons the hostelry familiar and friendly to patrollers for which dag was aiming lay on the north side of lumpton so he and fawn found themselves in early afternoon riding through the town square where the day market was in full swing fawn turned in her saddle looking over the booths and carts and tarps as they passed around the edge of the busy scene i have that glass bowl for mama she said i wish i had something to bring aunt nattie she hardly ever gets taken along when my parents come down here a yearly ritual dag had been given to understand aunt nattie was fawns mothers much older sister blind since a childhood infection had stolen her sight at age ten she had come along with fawns mother when shed married years ago in some sort of dowry deal semiinvalid but not idle she did all the spinning and weaving for the farm with extra to sell for cash money sometimes and was the only member of her family fawn spoke of without hidden strain in her voice and ground obligingly now that he understood her purpose dag followed fawns gaze one would not presumably carry food to a farm the cloth and clothing for sale new and used likewise would seem foolish his eye ran over the more permanent shops lining the square tools scissors needles something for her weaving or sewing she has a lot of those fawn sighed something that gets used up then dyes his voice faded in doubt ah likely not mama did most of the coloring though i do it nowadays wish i could get her something just for her her gaze narrowed furs well lets look they dismounted and fawn looked over the tarp where a farmwoman offered some in dags expert view rather inferior pelts all common local beasts raccoon and possum and deerhide i can get her something much better later dag murmured and with a grimace of agreement fawn gave over poking through the sad piles they strolled onward side by side leading their horses fawn stopped and wheeled lips pursing as they passed a narrow medicine shop tucked between a shoemaker and a barbertoothdrawerscribeit was unclear if the latter was all one man the medicine shop had a broad window with small square glass panes set in a bowedout wooden frame to make a larger view i wonder if they sell scent water like what your patroller girls found in glassforge or oil dag could not help wondering they could stand to restock for future use although the likelihood of immediate future use at the bluefield homestead seemed remote whatever gratitude her family might feel for his bringing their only daughter back alive was unlikely to extend to letting them sleep together there in any case they tied their horses to one of the hitching rails conveniently lining the cobblestone sidewalk and went inside the shop had four kinds of scent water but only plain oil which made dags selection immediate he occupied himself looking over the shops actually impressive stock of herbals several of which he recognized as of high quality and coming from lakewalker sources while fawn made herself redolent with happy indecision her choice finally made they waited while their small purchases were wrapped or not so small in proportion to fawns thin purse dag noted as she braced herself to trade out some of her few coins for the little luxury outside dag tucked the packets away in his saddlebags and turned to give fawn a leg up on the bay mare she was standing staring at her saddle in dismay my bedrolls gone her hand went to the dangling rawhide strings behind her cantle did it drop on the road i know i tied it on better than his hand followed hers and his voice tightened these are cut see the knots are still tied sneak thief dag the knife was in my bedroll she gasped he snapped open his groundsense flinching as it was battered by the uproar pouring from all the people nearby he searched through the noise for a faint familiar chime just there his head came up and he looked along the square to where a slight figure was disappearing between two buildings the roll cast casually over his shoulder as though he owned it i see it he said thickly wait here his legs stretched as he followed after not quite running behind him he could hear fawn demanding of passersby did you see anyone fooling around by our horses dag tamped outrage down to annoyance mostly at himself if hed been traveling through here with a group of patrollers someone would always have been left with the horses as a routine precaution so what had made him drop his guard some misplaced sense of anonymity the fact that if only hed bothered to glance out the window he could have kept an eye on the horses himself if hed left his groundsense more open he might have picked up some restive response from copperhead as a stranger came too near too late never mind in an alley in back of the buildings he closed with his quarry the boy was crouched behind a woodpile and not alone a much larger and older companionbrother friend thiefbossknelt with him as they spread open the bedroll to examine their prize the big man was saying disgustedly this is just some girls clothes why didnt you pinch those saddlebags you fool that red brute of a horse tried to kick me and people were looking the boy replied in a surly tone wait whats that the big man lifted the sharing knife sheath by its broken strap the pouch swung and his hand went toward the bone hilt your death if you touch it dag snarled coming up on them ill see to that the boy took one look at him yelped and sprang away casting a panicked glance over his shoulder as he ran the big man his eyes widening shoved to his feet hand closing on a stout log from the pile it was plain that they were far past the point of lame explanations and apologies sir about mistaken ownership even if the burly thief had possessed the wits and nerve to try to escape that way he came around already swinging dag flung up his arm to protect his face from a blow that would have caved it in as it was the oak log connected with his forearm with a sickening thud and he was bashed by his own armpluslog so hard as to be knocked half off his feet hot agony burst in his forearm no chance to go for his knife but the hookandspring presently attached to his left arm cuff doubled as a weapon of no small menace the big man ducked back in fright as dags return swing grazed his throat rapidly revising his chances against this unexpected unhanded reprisalbrighter than he lookedthe wouldbe thief dropped both knife pouch and log and galloped after his smaller partner fawn and a party of three or four lumpton locals rounded the corner as dag staggered upright again quietly he flipped a corner of the blanket over the leather pouch with a booted toe dag are you all right fawn cried in alarm your nose is bleeding dag could feel a wet trickle over his lip and licked at it unmistakable iron tang he tried to raise his hand to touch his throbbing face but found it would not work properly drawing breath through his teeth in a long hiss at the flaring pain he searched his mind for curses and found none strong enough his groundsense turned in upon himself left him in no doubt he wheeled away bent over and spat blood and fury on the ground before turning back to her nose is all right he mumbled in frustrated wrath right arms broken blight it chapter their hostelry in lumpton market turned out to be an elderly inn just off the straight road north from town fawn thought it a sad comedown from the fine hotel in glassforge for it was small and grubby if not without a certain air of shabby comfort further it demanded cash money even from patrollers in summer however patrons were sent out back of the kitchen to eat their dinners on plank tables and benches under some graceful old black walnut trees overlooking the side road much better than the dank common room looking around curiously fawn saw no other lakewalkers here tonight just a quartet of teamsters at one table intent on their beer and beyond them a farm couple busy with a pack of noisy young children even with his height striking looks and splinted arm in a sling dag drew only brief stares and fawn felt reassuringly unnoticed in his shadow dag slumped onto his bench with an understandably tired grunt and fawn slid in at his right she plucked loose the ties of the lumpy leather wrap hed directed she bring from his saddlebag unrolling it to find it contained an array of extra devices for his wrist cuff goodness what are all these this and that experiments or things i dont use every day as she stared in bewilderment and held up a wooden bolt anchoring a curved and edged metal piece looking like a small stirrup he added thats a scraper i spend a lot of time in the evening scraping hides out on patrol boring as all get out but one of the first jobs i took on after i got the arm harness forced me to strengthen the arm which was good when i took up the bow the scullion who doubled as servingwoman plunked down mugs of beer and trotted back inside with hook and splinted hand dag clumsily reached winced and fell back and fawn said ah the bonesetter told you not to try and use your hand five times when i was listening and i dont know how many more while i was out of the room i thought he was going to slap you at one point the man had hardly needed fawns encouragement to bind dags arm with quelling thoroughness having taken the measure of his aggravated patient very quickly the barest tips of dags fingers stuck out beyond the cotton wrappings you just keep it down in that sling there we need to figure out how were to get along with all this hurriedly she held the mug to his lips he grimaced but drank thirstily she managed not to splash him too badly when he nodded he was done and whisked her handkerchief from her pocket to overtake his right arm up to mop his lips and if you use your bandages for a napkin theyre going to stink long before six weeks are up so dont he scowled sideways at her ferociously and if you keep looking at me like that youre going to make me break out in giggles and then youll be throwing your boots at my head and then where will we be no i wont he growled i need you to get the blasted boots off in the first place but the corner of his mouth curled up nonetheless fawn was so relieved she got up on one knee and kissed the curl which made it curve up more he vented a long apologetic sigh for his touchiness third from the left therehe nodded to the leather wrapshould be a sort of forkspoon thing she pulled it out and examined it an iron spoon with four short tines on the tip ah clever i dont use it too often a knifes usually better if i have anything at the table but my hook or the social hand that last was dags name for the wooden handinglove which seemed to have little use but disguise among strangers and not a very effective one at that with a slight clunk dag set his wooden cuff against the table edge try swapping it out dags most commonly used device the hook with the clever little spring strip was set in tight fawn leaning in had to take a better grip before she was able to twist it out the eating tool replaced it more readily oh thats not too hard their plates arrived piled with carrots and mashed potatoes with cream gravy and a generous portion of pork chops after an exchange of silent looksfawn could see dag working to keep his frayed tempershe leaned over and efficiently cut his meat leaving the rest to him the forkspoon worked tolerably well although it did involve his extending his elbow awkwardly thoughtfully she kept the beer coming it might just have been getting a good hot meal into him after a toolong day but he slowly relaxed the stout scullion then brought thick wedges of cherry pie which threatened to push relaxation into sleep right there on the benches fawn said so should we stay here and rest up tomorrow or push on and rest at west blue will you be able to ride so far he had ridden from the bonesetters his reins wrapped around his hook but that had only been a mile ive done more with worse the powder will help hed prudently picked up what he said was a lakewalker remedy for pain from the medicine shop before theyd left the town square fawn wasnt sure if the faint glaze in his eyes was from the drug or the ache in his arm but on reflection it was just as well the medicine didnt work better or there would be no slowing him down at all confirming this he stretched and said i wouldnt mind pushing on theres folks at hickory lake who can do things to help this heal faster is it set all right she asked anxiously oh yes that bonesetter might have been a hamhanded torturer but he knew his trade itll heal straight dag had called him much worse things than that during the setting but the fellow had just grinned evidently used to colorful invective from his patients possibly fawn thought he collected the choice bits if you dont knock it around fawn felt a little sick with anticipation of her homecoming but if she had to do it at all better to get it over with dag clearly thought it her duty the right thing to do and not even for stupid sunny and all her brothers put together would she risk dag thinking her craven even if i am all right well ride on dag rubbed his chin with his left sleeve in that case wed best get our tales straight i want to leave out the primed knife in front of your family just as we did for my patrol all but mari that seemed both fair and prudent fawn nodded anything else is up to you but you have to tell me what you want she stared down at the red streaks and crumbs on her empty plate they dont know about me and sunny so theyre going to be mad that i scared them for seemingly nothing running off like that he leaned over and touched his lips to a red dent in her neck where one of the malice scabs had finally flaked off not for nothing spark yeah but they dont know much about malices either so he said slowly as if feeling his way if your sunny has fessed up you will have one situation and if he hasnt youll have another hes not my sunny fawn said grumpily we were both real clear on that hm well if you dont tell your folks why you really left youll have to make up some lie this creates a tension and darkness in your ground that weakens a person in my experience i really dont see why you feel any need to protect sunny seems to me he benefits more from you keeping this secret than you do fawns eyebrows rose the shame of the thing goes on the girl used goods they call you you cant get another suitor with good land if word gets around youre no virgin though i think a lot of girls do anyhow so you really have to wonder farmers eh dag pursed his lips does the same apply to widows then real ones not grass ones fawn colored at this reminder though she had to smile a little oh no widows are a whole different matter widows now well nobody can do as they please really there might be children there might be no money but widows hold their heads up fine and make their own way better if theyre not poor to be sure so ah do you hanker after a suitor with good land spark she sat up startled of course not i want you he cocked an eyebrow at her so why are you worrying about this again habit no she hesitated her heart and voice fell i suppose i thought we were a midsummer dream i just keep trying real hard not to wake up stupid i guess somewhere sometime someone will come along who wont let me keep you not for always he looked away through the deep shade of the walnut trees and down the side road where dust from the recent passage of a pony cart still hung golden in the westering sun however difficult your family is mine is going to be worse and i expect to stand up to them i wont lie spark there are things that can take me from you things i cant control death is always one he paused cant think of anything else right at the moment though she gave a short shaken nod turning her face into his shoulder till she got her breath back he sighed well what youll say to your people is not my choice its yours but my recommendation is to tell as much truth as you can save for the knife priming how will we explain my going to your camp your testimony to my captain is required in the death of the malice which is true if they ask for more ill get up on my tall horse and say its lakewalker business fawn shook her head they wont want to let me go off with you well see you cant plan other peoples actions only your own if you try you just end up facing the wrong way for the trouble you actually get hey he bent down and kissed her hair if they chain you to the wall with iron bolts undertake to break you out with no hands im very ingenious and if they dont chain you then you can walk away all it takes is courage and i know you have that she smiled comforted but admitted not in my heart not really they i dont know how to explain this they have ways of making me smaller i dont know how theyll be but you are not the same as you were one way or another things will be different than you expect truly exhausted hurting and uneasy they did not make love that night but held each other close in the stuffy inn chamber sleep was slow in coming the summer sun was again slanting west when fawn halted her mare and sat staring up the hill where a descending farm lane intersected the road it had been a twentymile ride from lumpton market and dag had to admit if only to himself that his right arm was swollen and aching more than he cared for and that his left picking up an unaccustomed load was not at its best either they had taken the straight road north along the spreading ridge between the rivers for almost fifteen miles before turning west descending into the valley of the western branch theyd crossed at a stony ford before turning north once more along the winding river road a shortcut fawn claimed to avoid doubling back a mile to the village of west blue with its wagon bridge and mill and now she was home her ground was a complicated swirl at the moment but it hardly took groundsense to see that her foremost emotion was not joy he kneed his horse up next to hers i think id like my social hand to start he murmured she nodded and leaned over to open his belt pouch and swap out his hook for the less useful but less startling false hand she paused to recomb her own hair and retie it in the curly horsetail with the bright ribbon then stood up in her stirrups to take the comb to him as well he lowered his head for the in his unvoiced opinion useless attempt to make him look his best he perfectly understood her determination to walk back into her home looking proud and fine not beaten and bedraggled he just wished for her sake that he could look more the part of a valiant protector instead of something the cat had dragged in youve looked worse old patroller go on fawn swallowed and turned grace into the lane which wound up the slope for almost a quarter mile lined on both sides with the ubiquitous drystone walls past a grove of sugar maple walnut and hickory trees a dilapidated old barn appeared on the right and a larger newer barn on the left above the new barn lay a couple of outbuildings including a smokehouse faint gray curls of smoke leaked from its eaves and dags nose caught the pleasant tang of smoldering hickory a covered well sat at the top of the yard and on around to the right the large old farmhouse loomed the central core of it was a twostory rectangle of blocky yellowish stone with a porch and front door in the middle overlooking the river valley on the far north end a singlestory addon looked as though it contained two rooms on the near end an excavation was in progress with piles of new stone waiting evidently an addition planned to match the other on the west another addon girdled with a long covered porch ran the length of the house clearly the kitchen no one was in sight suppertime said fawn they must all be in the kitchen eight people said dag whose groundsense left him in no doubt fawn took a long long breath and dismounted she tied both their horses to the back porch rail and led dag around to the steps her lighter and his heavier tread echoed briefly on the porch floor top and bottom halves of a double door were open wide and hooked to bolts in the wall but beyond them was another lighter doorframe with a gauze screen fawn pushed the screen door open and slipped in holding it for him he let his wooden hand rest briefly on her shoulder before dropping it to his side at a long table filling most of the righthand half of the room eight people turned and stared dag swiftly tried to match faces with the names and stories hed been given aunt nattie could be instantly identified a very short stout woman with disordered curly gray locks and eyes as milky as pearls her head now cocked with listening the four brothers were harder to sort but he thought he could determine fletch bulky and oldest reed and rush the nonidentical twins brownhaired and browneyed and ashhaired and blueeyed respectively and whit blackhaired like fawn skinny and youngest but for her a plump young woman seated next to fletch defeated his tutorial fawns parents sorrel and tril bluefield were no hardship to identify a graying man at the tables head whod stood up so fast his chair had banged over and on the near end a short middleaged woman stumbling out of her seat shrieking fawns parents descended upon her in such a whirl of joy relief and rage that dag had to close off his groundsense lest he be overwhelmed the brothers behind were mostly grinning with relief and aunt nattie was asking urgently what is that fawn you say told you she wasnt dead about time fawn her face nearly unreadable endured being hugged kissed and shaken in equal measure the dampness in her blinking eyes was not dag thought caught only from the emotions around her dag stiffened a little when her father after hugging her off her feet put her down and then threatened to beat her but while his paternal relief was very real it seemed his threats were not for fawn didnt flinch in the least from them where have you been girl her mothers voice finally rose over the babble to demand fawn backed up a trifle raised her chin and said in a rush i went to glassforge to look for work and i may have found some too but first i have to go with dag here to hickory lake to help make his report to his captain about the blight bogle we killed her family gazed at fawn as though shed started raving in a fever dag suspected the only part theyd really caught was glassforge fawn went on a bit breathlessly before they could start up again mama papa this here is my friend dag redwing hickory she gave her characteristic little kneedip and pulled dag forward he nodded trying to find some pleasantly neutral expression for his face hes a lakewalker patroller how de do said dag politely and generally a silence greeted this and a lot more staring necks cranked back short stature ran in fawns family evidently confirming dags guess fawns mother tril said glassforge why would you want to go there to look for work theres plenty of work right here which you left on all of us fletch put in unhelpfully and wouldnt lumpton market have been a lot closer said whit in a tone of judicious critique do you know how much trouble you caused girl said papa bluefield yeah said reed or maybe rushno rush ashheaded checkwhen you didnt show for dinner marketday night we figured you were out dawdling and daydreaming in the woods as usual but when you didnt show by bedtime papa made us all go out with torches and look and call the barn the privy the woods down by the riverit would have saved a deal of stumbling around in the dark and yelling if mama had counted your clothes a day sooner fawns lip had given an odd twitch at something in this which dag determined to ask about later i am sorry you were troubled she said in a carefully formal tone i should have written a note sos you neednt have worried id met with an accident how would that have helped for worrying fool girl fawns mother wept a bit more thoughtless selfish papa made me ride all the way to aunt wrens in the idea you might have gone there and he made rush ride to lumpton asking after you reed said a spate more of complaint and venting from all parties followed this fawn endured without argument and dag held his tongue the ill words were not ill meant and fawn apparently a native speaker of this strange family dialect seemed to take them in their spirit and let the barbs roll off mostly her eyes flashed resentment only once when the plump girl beside fletch chimed in with some support of one of his more snappish comments but fawn said only hello clover nice to see you too which reduced the girl to nonplussed silence notably missing was any word about sunny sawman so fawns judgment on that score was proven shrewd too early to guess at the consequences dag was not sure how long the uproar would have continued in this vein except that aunt nattie levered herself up grasped a walking stick and stumped around the table to fawns side let me see you girl she said quietly and fawn hugged herthe first hug dag had seen going the other wayand let the blind woman run her hands over her face huh said aunt nattie huh now introduce me to your patroller friend its been a long time since ive met a lakewalker dag said fawn reverting to her breathless anxious formality this is my aunt nattie that ive told you about shed like to touch you if thats all right of course said dag the little woman stumped nearer reached up and bounced her fingers uncertainly off his collarbone goodness boy where are you say something fawn whispered urgently um up here aunt nattie her hand went higher to touch his chin he obligingly bent his head way up there she marveled the knobby dry fingers brushed firmly over his features pausing at the slight heat of the bruises on his face from yesterday circling his cheekbones and chin in inexplicable approval tracing his lips and eyelids dag realized with a slight shock that this woman possessed a rudimentary groundsense possibly developed in the shadow of her lifelong blindness and he let his reach out to touch hers her breath drew in ah lakewalker right enough maam dag responded not knowing what else to say good voice too nattie observed dag wasnt sure who to she stopped short of checking his teeth like a horses although by this time dag would scarcely have blinked at it she felt down his body her touch hesitating briefly at the splints and sling her eyebrows went up as she felt his arm harness through his shirt and briefly gripped his wooden hand but she added only nice deep voice have you eaten asked tril bluefield and when fawn explained no theyd ridden all day from lumpton shifted to what dag guessed was her more normal motherly mode driving a couple of her sons to set chairs and places she put fawn next to herself and fawn insisted dag be placed on her own right on account of i promised to help him out with his broken arm they settled at last clover finally introduced as fletchs betrothed was also drafted to help plopping plates and cups of what smelled like cider down in front of them dag by this time very thirsty was most interested in the drink the food was a wellcooked stew and dag silently rejoiced at being confronted with something he could handle by himself though he wondered who in the household had bad teeth the forkspoon i think he murmured in fawns ear and she nodded and rummaged it out of his belt pouch what happened to your arm asked rush across from them which one asked dag and endured the inevitable moment of rustling craning and stunned stares as fawn calmly unscrewed his hand and replaced it with the more useful tool thank you spark drink he smiled down at her as she lifted the cup to his lips it was fresh cider very tart from new summer apples and thanks again youre welcome dag he licked the spare drop off his lower lip so she didnt have to chase it with her napkin yet rush finally found his voice more or less er i was going to ask about the er sling fawn answered briskly a sneak thief at lumpton market lifted my bedroll yesterday dag got it back but his arm was broken in the fight before the thieves got scared and ran off dag gave a real good description to the lumpton folks though so they might catch the fellows her jaw set just a trifle so i kind of owe him for the arm oh said rush reed and whit stared across the table with renewed if daunted interest tril bluefield looking hungrily and now more carefully at her restored daughter frowned and let her hand drift to fawns cheek where the four parallel gouges were now paling pink scars what are those marks she glanced sidelong at dag he shrugged go on she said thats where the mudman hit me the what said her mother face screwing up a sort of bandit fawn revised this two bandits grabbed me off the road near glassforge what what happened her mother gasped the assorted brothers too sat up on dags right he could feel fletch tense not too much said fawn they roughed me up but dag who was tracking them came up just then and um ran them off she glanced at him again and he lowered his eyelids in thanks he did not especially wish to begin his acquaintance with her family with a listing of all the dead bodies hed left around glassforge the human ones at least far too many human ones this last round thats how we first met his patrol had been called to glassforge to deal with the bandits and the blight bogle rush asked what happened to the bandits after that fawn turned to dag who answered simply they were dealt with he applied himself to his stew good plain farm food in the hope of avoiding further expansion on this subject fawns mother bent her head eyes narrowing her hand went out again this time to the left side of fawns neck and the deep red dent and three ugly black scabs then what are those nastylooking things um well that was later what was later in a desperately bright voice fawn replied thats where the blight bogle lifted me up they make those sorts of markstheir touch is deadly it was big how big would you say dag eight feet tall maybe seven and a half id guess he said blandly about four hundred pounds though i didnt have the best vantage or light reed said in a tone of growing disbelief so what happened to this supposed blight bogle if it was so deadly fawns look begged help so dag replied it was dealt with too go on fawn said fletch scornfully you cant expect us to swallow your tall tales dag let his voice go very soft are you calling your sister a liar sir he let the and me hang in implication fletchs thick brows wrinkled in honest bewilderment he was not a man sensitive to implication either dag guessed shes my sister i can call her anything want dag drew breath but fawn whispered dag let it go it doesnt matter he did not yet speak this family dialect he reminded himself he had worried about how to conceal the strange accident with the sharing knife hed not imagined such feeble curiosity or outright disbelief it was not in his present interestor capacityto bang bluefield heads together and bellow your sisters courage saved my life and dozens maybe thousands more honor her he let it go and nodded for more cider blatantly changing the subject fawn asked clover after the progress of her wedding plans listening to the lengthy reply with wellfeigned interest the addition in progress on the south end of the house it appeared was intended for the soontobenewlyweds the true purpose of the questioncamouflagewas revealed to dag when fawn added casually anyone hear from the sawmans since sarees wedding not too much said reed sunnys spent a lot of time at his brotherinlaws place helping clear stumps from the new field fawns mother gave her a narroweyed look his mama tells me sunnys betrothed to violet stonecrop as of midsummer hope youre not disappointed i thought you might be getting kind of sweet on him at one point whit piped up in a whiny practiced brotherly chant fawn is sweet on suhnee fawn is sweet on suhnee dag cringed at the spate of deathly blackness that ran through fawns ground he does not know he reminded himself none of them do although he would not have cast bets on tril bluefields unvoiced suspicions because she now said in a flat voice unlike any hed yet heard from her brooking no argument stop that whit youd think you were twelve dag could see the little ripple in fawns jaw as she unset her teeth not sweet in the least i think violet deserves better whit looked disappointed at not having drawn a more spectacular rise out of his sister from his expert lure but glancing at his mother did not resume his heckling perhaps dag suggested gently we should go see to grace and copperhead who asked rush miss bluefields horse and mine theyve been waiting patiently out there what said reed fawn doesnt have a horse hey fawn whered you get a horse can i ride your horse no fawn thrust back her chair dag rose more quietly with her where did you get a horse fawn asked papa bluefield curiously staring anew at dag fawn stood very straight she was my share for helping deal with the blight bogle which fletch here doesnt believe in i must have ridden all the way from glassforge on a wish horse huh she tossed her head and marched out dag cast a polite nod of farewell in the general direction of the table thought to add a spoken good evening aunt nattie and followed behind him he could hear her fathers growl reed go help your sister and that fellow with their horses which in fact launched a general migration of bluefields onto the porch to examine the new horse grace was exhaustively discussed at last dag swapped back for his hook and led his own horse in an escape to the old barn where spare stalls were to be found he lingered looking over the stall partition keeping a light contact with his groundsense so the gelding wouldnt snake around and attempt to savage reed his unfamiliar groom copperhead was not named for his chestnut color despite appearances when both horses were at last safely rubbed down watered and fed dag walked back to the house through the sunset light with fawn temporarily out of earshot of the rest of her relations well she said under her breath that could have gone worse really said dag really ill take your word truth to tell im finding your family a bit strange my nearest kin dont often like what i have to say but they certainly hear what i have to say and not something else altogether theyre better one at a time than in a bunch like that hm so what was that about marketday night what when rush said theyd missed you marketday night oh nothing much except that i left marketday morning while it was still dark wonder where they thought i was all day a number of bluefields had collected in the front parlor including aunt nattie now plying a drop spindle and fawns mother dag set down his saddlebags and let fawn unpack her gifts fletch about to escort his betrothed home to her nearby farm paused to watch as well tril held the sparkling glass bowl up to the light of an oil lamp in astonishment you really did go to glassforge fawn who had wobbled all evening between trying to put on a good show and what seemed to dag a most unfamiliar silent shrinking said only thats what i told you mama fawn pressed the corked scent bottle into her aunts hands and urged her to splash some on her wrists which smiling agreeably she did very pretty lovie but this sort of foolery is for courtin girls to entice their boys not for lumpy old women like me better you should give it to clover thats fletchers job said fawn with a more sparklike edged grin at her brother anyhow all sorts of folks wear it in glassforgepatroller men and women both for some reed hovering snorted at the idea of men wearing scent but nattie showed willing and eased dags heart by splashing a bit more on both herself and her younger sister tril and some on fawn as well there sweet of you to think of me lovie it was growing dark outside the boys dispersed to various evening chores and clover made farewells to her prospective inlaws the two young women fawn and clover eyed each other a little stiffly as clover made more congratulations on fawns safe return and dag wondered anew at the strangeness of farmer customs a lakewalker onlygirlchild would have been the chief inheritor of her familys tent but that position here was apparently held by fletch and not fawn but clover would take tril bluefields place as female head of this household in due time leaving fawn to go where i suppose said papa bluefield a trifle grudgingly if your friend here has a bedroll he could lay it in the loft keep an eye on his horse dont be daft sorrel aunt nattie spoke up unexpectedly the man cant climb the loft ladder with that broken arm he needs to be close by me sos i can help him said fawn firmly dag can lay his bedroll in natties weaving room good idea fawn said nattie cheerily fawn slept in with her aunt the boys shared rooms upstairs as did their parents papa bluefield looked as though he was thinking hard suddenly about the implications of leaving fawn and dag downstairs with a blind chaperone and theninevitablyof the implications of how long dag and fawn had been on the road together did he know anything about his aging sisterinlaws groundsense ill try harder not to cut your throat with your razor tomorrow dag fawn said ive lost more blood for less he assured her we should likely try to get on the road early what said papa bluefield coming out of his frowning cogitation youre not going anywhere girl she turned to him stiffening up tight i told you first thing papa i have an obligation to give witness are you stupid fawn dag caught his breath at the hard black rip through fawns ground his eyes went to nattie but she gave no visible reaction though her face was turned toward the pair papa bluefield went on your obligations are here for all youve run off and turned your back on them this past month youve had enough gallivanting for a while believe you me dag interposed quietly and quite truthfully actually spark my arms not doing all that well tonight i wouldnt mind a day or two to rest up she turned anxious eyes up at him as if not sure whether she was hearing support or betrayal he gave her a small reassuring nod papa bluefield gave dag a sideways look youd be welcome to go on if youve a need papa snapped fawn gyrating back to something not strained show but blazingly sincere the idea dag saved my life three times twice at great risk to his own once from the bandits once from the malicethe bogleand once again the night after the bogle hurt me because i would have bled to death right there in the woods if he hadnt helped me i will not have him turned out on the road by himself with two bad arms for shame shame on this house if you dare she actually stamped her foot the parlor floor sounded like a drum papa bluefield had stepped backward his wife was staring at dag with eyes wide holding the glass bowl tightly nattie was amazingly hard to read but she had a strange little smile on her lips oh papa bluefield cleared his throat you hadnt exactly made that plain fawn fawn said wearily how could i no one would let me finish a story without telling me i must be making things up her father glanced at dag hes a quiet one dag could not touch his temple he had to settle for a short nod thinking sir are you now it was not in the bluefield household apparently possible to finish a debate but when the squabbling finally died into assorted mumblings drifting away up stairs or down halls in the dark dag ended up with his bedroll set down beside aunt natties loom with an impressive pile of quilts and pillows arranged for his ease he could hear the shortest two women of the family rustling around in the bedroom beyond in lowvoiced preparation for bed and then the creak of the bed frames as they settled down dag disposed his throbbing arm awkwardly grateful for the pillows save for the night on the horsefords kitchen floor he had never slept inside a farmers house certainly not as an invited guest though his patrols had sometimes been put up by arrangement in farmers barns this beat a drafty hayloft with snow sifting in all hollow before hed met fawns family he would scarcely have understood why she would want to leave such comforts he wasnt sure if it was worse to be loved yet not valued than valued but not loved but surely it was better to be both for the first time he began to think a farms brightest treasure need not be furtively stolen it might be honestly won but the hopes forming in his mind would have to wait on tomorrow for their testing chapter the next morning passed quietly to fawns eye dag looked tired moved slowly and said little and she thought his arm was probably troubling him more than he let on she found herself caught up will or nil in the neverending rhythm of farm chores cows took no holidays even for homecomings she and dag did take a walk around the place in the midmorning and she pointed out the scenes and sites from her tales of childhood but her guess about his arm was confirmed when after lunch he took some more of the pain powder that had helped him through yesterdays long ride he slipped outwordlesslyto the front porch overlooking the river valley and sat leaning against the house wall nursing the arm and thinking whatever he was thinking about all this fawn found herself assigned to stirring apple butter in the kitchen and while you are about it dear why dont you make up some pies for supper she was fluting the edge of the second one and reluctantly contemplating building up the fire under the hearth oven which would make the hot room hotter still when dag came in drink she guessed please she held the water ladle to his lips when hed drained it he added theres a young fellow whos tethered his horse in your front woods i believe he imagines hes sneaking up the hill in secret his ground seems pretty unsettled but i dont think hes a house robber did you see him she asked then halted considering what an absurd question that sounded if you didnt know dag and then how well she had come to know dag that it should fall so readily from her lips just a glimpse was he bright blond yes she sighed sunny sawman ill bet clover told folks that im back and hes come to see for himself if its true why not ride openly up the lane she flushed a little not that hed likely notice in this heat and admitted he used to sneak up to steal kisses from me that way from time to time he was afraid of my brothers finding out i think well hes afraid of something he hesitated do you want me to stay she tilted her head frowning i better talk to him alone he wont be truthful if hes in front of anyone she glanced up uneasily at him maybe dont go far he nodded she didnt seem to need to explain further he stepped into aunt natties weaving room flanking the kitchen and set the door open she heard him dragging a chair behind it and the creak of wood and possibly of dag as he settled into it a few moments later footsteps sounded on the porch attempted tiptoe they paused outside the kitchen window above the drainboard she stepped up and stared without pleasure at sunnys face craning around and peering in he jerked back as he saw her then whispered are you alone for now he nodded and nipped in through the back door she regarded him testing her feelings strawgold hair still curled around his head in soft locks his eyes were still bright blue his skin fair and fine and summerflushed his shoulders broad his muscular arms tanned where his sleeves were rolled up coated with a shimmer of gold hairs that had always seemed to make him gleam in sunlight his physical charm was unchanged and she wondered how it was that she was now so wholly unmoved by it who had once trembled beneath it in a wheatfield in such wild flattered elation his daughter would have been a pretty girl the thought twisted in her like a knife and she fought to set it aside where is everyone he asked cautiously looking around again papa and the boys are up cutting hay mama is out giving the chickens a dusting with that antilice powder she got from your uncle and aunt natties bad knee hurt so she went to lie down after lunch natties blind she wont see me anyhow good he loomed nearer staring hard at her nojust at her belly she resisted an impulse to slump and push it out his head cocked as little as you are id have thought youd be popping out by now clover sure would have bleated about it if shed noticed you talk to her saw her at noon down in the village he shifted restlessly its all the talk there you turning up again he turned again scowling so did you come back to fuss at me some more it wont do you any good im betrothed to violet now so i heard said fawn in a flat voice i actually hadnt planned to see you at all we wouldnt have stayed on today except for dags broken arm yeah clover said you had some lakewalker fellow trailing you tall as a flagpole with one arm wooden and the other broke who didnt hardly say boo sounds about useless you been running around alone with him for three or four weeks seemingly he wet his lips so whats your plan switching horses in the middle of the river going to tell him the baby is his and hope he cant count too good a castiron frying pan was sitting on the drainboard swung in an appropriate arc it would just fit sunnys round face fawn thought through a red haze no im not playing your little game fawn said sunny tightly you wont pin this on me i meant what i said his hands were trembling slightly but then so were hers her voice went if possible even flatter well you can put your mind and your nasty tongue to rest i miscarried down near glassforge the day the blight bogle nearly killed me so theres nothing left to pin on anyone except bad memories his breath of relief was visible and audible he squeezed his eyes shut with it the tension in the room seemed to drop by half she thought sunny must have gone into a flying panic when hed heard of her return watching his comfortable little world teeter and felt grimly recompensed her world had been turned upside down but if she could now turn it back upright make all her misery not have been at the cost of losing all shed learned on the road to glassforgewould she she could not she thought in all fairness judge sunny for acting as though his daughter werent real to him shed scarcely seemed real to fawn a deal of the time either after all she asked instead so where did you think id gone he shrugged i thought at first you might have thrown yourself in the river gave me a turn for a while she tossed her head but not enough of one to do anything about it seemingly what would there have been to do at that point it seemed like the sort of stupid thing youd do when you get a mad on you always did have a temper i remember how your brothersd get you so wound up you could scarcely breathe for screaming sometimes till your pad tear his hair and come beat you for making such awful noise then the word got around that some of your clothes had gone missing which made it seem youd run off since not even you would take three changes to go drowning your folks all looked but i guess not far enough you didnt help look then either i take it do i look stupid i didnt want to find you you got yourself into this fix you could get yourself out yeah thats what i figured fawn bit her lip silence more staring just go away you awful lout i havent forgotten what you said to me that night sunny sawman you arent welcome in my sight in case youd any doubt he shrugged irritably his golden brows drew together over his snub nose i figured the blight bogle was a tall tale what really happened bogles are real enough one touched me here and there she fingered her neck where the dents glowed an angry red and reluctantly laid her palm over her belly lakewalkers make special knives to kill malicesthats their name for blight bogles dag had one between us we did for the bogle but it was too late for the child it was almost too late for the two of us but not quite oh magic knives now as well as magic monsters sure i believe that or maybe some of those secret lakewalker medicines did the job and the rest is a nice tale to cover it make you look good in front of your family eh he moved closer to her she moved back they dont even know i was pregnant i didnt tell them that part she drew a long breath do you really care which so long as its not on you feh she gripped her hair then drew her hands down hard over her face you know i really dont give two pennies what you think as long as you go think it somewhere else aunt nattie had once remarked that the opposite of love was not hate but indifference fawn felt she was beginning to see the point of that sunny edged closer again she could feel his breath stir the sweatdampened hairs on her neck so have you been letting that patroller fellow poke you does your family know that fawns breath clogged in rage she would not scream after a miscarriage you got no brains at all sunny sawman he did hesitate at that doubt flickering in his blue eyes besides she went on youre marrying violet stonecrop are you poking her yet his lips drew back in something like a smile except that it was devoid of humor he stepped closer still i was right you are a little slut and grinned in countertriumph at the fury she knew was reddening her face dont give me that scowl he added lifting a hand to squeeze her breast i know how easy you are her fingers groped for the fryingpan handle long footsteps sounded from the weaving room sunny jumped back hurriedly hello spark said dag any more of that cider around sure dag she said backing away from sunny and escaping across the room to the crock on the shelf she shifted the lid and drew a cup willing her hands to stop shaking somehow dag was now standing between her and sunny caller he inquired with a nod at sunny sunny looked as though he was furiously wondering whether dag had just come in if they had been overheard and if the latter how incriminatingly much this heres sunny sawman said fawn hes leaving dag redwing hickory a lakewalker patroller hes staying sunny looking unaccustomedly up gave a wary nod dag looked back down without a whole lot of expression one way or another interestin to meet you at last sunny said dag ive heard a lot about you all true seemingly sunnys mouth opened and closedshocked that his slanderous threats had failed to silence fawn well he had only his own mouth to blame now he looked toward the weaving room which had no other exit except into nattie and fawns bedroom and did not come up with a reply dag continued coolly so sunny has anyone ever offered to cut out your tongue and feed it to you sunny swallowed no he might have been trying for a bold tone but it came out rather a croak im surprised said dag he gently scratched the side of his nose with his hook a quiet warning fawn thought if both unobserved and unheeded by sunny are you trying to start something asked sunny recovering his belligerence alas dag indicated his broken arm with a slight movement of the sling ill have to take you up later sunnys eyes brightened as the apparent helplessness of the patroller dawned on him then maybe youd better keep a still tongue in your head till then lakewalker ha only fawn would be fool enough to pick a cripple for a bullyboy dags eyes thinned to gold slits as fawn cringed in that same level affable tone he murmured changed my mind ill take you up now spark you said this fellow was leaving open the door for him would you plainly unable to imagine what dag could possibly do to him sunny set his teeth planted his legs and glowered dag stood quite still confused fawn hastily set down the cup slopping cider on the table she swung the screen door inward and held it when dag moved his speed was shocking she caught only a glimpse of him swerving halfaround sunny his leg coming up hard behind sunnys knees and his left arm whipping around with a wicked whir and glint of his hook suddenly sunny was flailing forward mouth agape lifted by dags hook through the seat of his trousers his feet churned but barely touched the floor he looked like someone tumbling on ice three long dagstrides a loud ripping noise and sunny was sailing through the air in truth headfirst all the way over the porch boards to land beyond the steps in an awkward heap haunches up face scraping the dirt it was partly terrorized relief that dag hadnt just torn sunnys throat out with his hook as calmly as hed slain that mudman but fawn burst into a shriek of laughter she clapped her hand across her mouth and stared at the ridiculously cheering sight of sunnys drawers flapping through the new vent in his britches sunny twisted around and glared up his face flushing a dull mottled red then scrambled to his feet fists clenching between the dirt and the curses filling his mouth his spluttering was nearly incoherent but the general sense of ill get you lakewalker ill get you both came through clearly enough and fawns breath caught in new alarm best bring a few friends dag recommended dryly if you have any aside from the flaring of his nostrils he seemed barely winded sunny took two steps up onto the porch but then veered back uncertainly as that hook came quietly to the fore fawn darted for the frying pan as sunny hovered in doubt his head jerked up at a thumping and shuffling sounding from the weaving roomblind aunt nattie with her cane she had risen from her nap at last sunny stared wildly around tripped backward down the steps turned and fled around the side of the house youre right spark dag said closing the screen door again he doesnt much care for witnesses you can sort of see why nattie wandered into the kitchen hello fawn lovie hello dag my that apple butter smells good her face turned following the retreating footsteps rounding the house and fading young fool she added reflectively sunny always thinks if i cant see him i cant hear him you have to wonder really you do fawn gulped dropped the pan on the table and flew into dags embrace he wrapped his left arm around her in a reassuring hug aunt natties head tilted toward them a smile touching her lips thank you kindly for that bit o housecleaning patroller my pleasure aunt nattie here now dag folded fawn closer for what its worth spark he was more afraid of you than you were of him he added reflectively sort of like a snake that way she gave a shaken giggle and his grip eased i was about to hit him with the frying pan just before you came in thought something like that might be up i was having a few daydreams along that line myself too bad you couldnt really have cut his tongue out she paused was that a joke or not im not too sure sometimes about patroller humor eh he said sounding faintly wistful not in any case currently practical though i suppose im right glad to see sunny doesnt believe any of those ugly rumors about lakewalkers being black sorcerers her trembling diminished but her brows pinched as she thought back im so glad you were there though i wish your arm wasnt broken is it all right she touched the sling in worry that wasnt especially good for it but i havent unset it were lucky for your aunt nattie and sunnys ah sudden shyness she drew back to stare up at his serious face her eyes questioning and he went on see despite whatever hog butchering hes done sunnys never been in a lethal fight ive been in no other kind since i was younger than him hes used to puppy scraps the sort you have with brothers or cousins or friends or in any case folks youre going to have to go on living with age weight youth muscle would all count against me in that sort of scuffle even without a broken arm if you truly want him dead im your man if you want less its trickier she sighed and leaned her head against his chest i dont want him dead i just want him behind me miles and years i suppose i just have to wait for the years i still think of him every day and i dont want to dead would be even worse for that wise spark he murmured her nose wrinkled in doubt how seriously had he meant that lethal offer to be so relieved that she hadnt taken him up on it remembering she fetched him his drink which he accepted with a smile of thanks nattie had drifted to the hearth to stir the apple butter which by the smell was on the verge of scorching now she tapped the wooden spoon on the pot rim to shake off the excess set it aside turned back and said youre a smart man patroller oh nattie said fawn dolefully how much of that awfulness did you hear pretty much all lovie she sighed is sunny gone yet that funny look dag got when consulting his groundsense flitted over his face long gone aunt nattie fawn breathed relief dag youre a good fellow but i need to talk with my niece why dont you take a walk he looked down to fawn who nodded reluctantly he said i expect i could stand to go check on copperhead make sure he hasnt bitten anybody yet i spect so nattie agreed he gave fawn a last hug bent down to touch his ciderscented lips to hers smiled in encouragement and left she heard his steps wend through the house to the front door and out fawn wanted to put her head down in natties lap and bawl instead she busied herself raking the coals under the oven for the pies nattie sat on a kitchen chair and rested her hands on her cane haltingly at first then less so the story came out from fawns foolish tumble at the spring wedding to her growing realization and fear of the consequences to the initial horrid talk with sunny teh nattie sighed in regret i knew you were troubled lovie i tried to get you to talk to me but you wouldnt i know i dont know if im sorry now or not i figured it was a problem id bought all on my own so it was a problem to pay for all on my own and then i thought my nerve would fail if i didnt plunge in for nattie today fawn resolved to leave out nothing of her journey except the uncanny accident with dags sharing knifepartly because she was daunted by the complicated explanations that would have to go with partly because it made no difference to the fate of her pregnancy but mostly because lakewalker secrets were so clearly not hers to give away no not just lakewalker secretsdags privacy she grasped now what an intimate and personal possession his dead wifes bone had been it was the only confidence hed asked her to keep taking a breath fawn plunged in anew she described her lonely trudge to glassforge her terrifying encounter with the young bandit and the strange mudman her first flying view of the startled dag even more frightening but in retrospect almost funny the horsefords eerie abandoned farm the second abduction the whole new measure for terror shed learned at the malices hands dag at the cave dag that night at the farm she did end up with her head in natties lap then though she managed to keep her tears down to a choked sniffling nattie petted her hair in the old way she hadnt done since fawn had been small and weeping in pain for some minor hurt to her body or in fury for some greater wound to her spirit sh sh lovie fawn inhaled wiped her eyes and nose on her apron and sat up again on the floor next to natties chair please dont tell mama and papa any of this theyre going to have to go on living with the sawmans theres no point in making bad blood between the families now eh lovie but it gars me to see sunny get off free of all this yes but i couldnt stand for my brothers to know theyd either try to do something to sunny and cause trouble or theyd make a mock of me for being so stupid and i dont think i could bear that about this she added after a moment of consideration or both im not sure even your brothers are thoughtless enough to make mock of this nattie hesitated then conceded reluctantly well perhaps halfwhit fawn managed a watery smile at the old jibe poor whit maybe its that old joke on his name that drives him to be such an awful thorn to everyone maybe should start calling him whitesmith instead see if it helps theres a thought nattie sat up staring into her personal dark i think maybe youre right about the bad blood though oh my yes all right this story will stop with me unless some other problem comes from it fawn breathed relief at this promise thank you talking with you eases me more than i expected she thought over natties last words then said more firmly you have to understand im going away with dag one way or another nattie did not immediately burst into objections and dire warnings but said only huh and then after a moment curious fellow that lakewalker tell me more fawn busying herself once more about the kitchen was only too glad to expand on her new favorite subject to an unexpectedly sympathetic or at least not immediately outraged ear i met his patrol in glassforge she described mari and saun and reelaif touching only lightly on dirla and razi and utauand sassas proud tours to show off his town and all the fascinating things folks found for work there that did not involve cows sheep or pigs the bowdown and dags unexpected talents with a tambourinea word picture that made nattie laugh along with fawn at that point fawn came to a sudden stop youre heelsup in love with him then nattie said calmly and at fawns gasp come girl im not that blind in love it seemed too weak a term shed imagined herself in love back when she was mooning over sunny more than that i trust him right down to the ground oh aye after all that tale i think im half in love with him myself nattie added after a thoughtful moment havent heard such joy in your voice for a long long time lovie years fawns heart sprang up as though weights had been shifted from it and she laughed aloud and gave nattie a hug and a kiss that made the old woman smile foolishly now now theres still some provin to be done you know but then the pies were baked and fawns mother returned to start the rest of supper sending fawn to milk the cows so the boys could keep cutting hay while the light lasted she went by the front porch on the way but dag had not yet returned to his thinking seat there dag made his way back to the house after a stroll around the lower perimeter of the farm in part to stretch his legs and mind and in part to be certain sunny had indeed packed off resentful and ripe for trouble that boy and his abrupt and satisfying removal from fawns presence had likely been dangerously selfindulgent for a lakewalker alone in farmer country but dag could not regret the act despite the renewed throbbing of his jostled arm dags last veiled fear that once back in the safety of her home fawn might repent her patroller and double back to her first love faded altogether once upon a time sunny had held star fire in his hand and thrown it away in the mud of the road he wouldnt be getting that fortune back ever there seemed nothing in the wide green world dag could do to him worse than what he had already done to himself smiling crookedly dag dismissed sunny from his thoughts in favor of more urgent personal concerns in the kitchen he found fawn gone but her mother tril buzzing about putting together supper for eight a clicking and whirring from the next chamber proved to be nattie at her spinning wheel within sight and call of her sister and he made sure to say how de she returned a friendly but unenlightening evening patroller and carried on evidently the incident with sunny was not to be discussed on the whole dag was relieved he greeted tril amiably and attempted to make himself useful hooking pots on and off the fire for her while trying to think his way to other possibilities for a halfhanded man to show his worth to the female who was in lakewalker terms the head of tent bluefield tril watched him in such deep alarm he began to fear he was looming too tall for the room and he finally just sat down and watched which seemed to ease her his comment about the weather fell flat as did a leading question about her chickens alas dag knew little about farm animals beyond horses but a few questions about fletchs upcoming wedding led by a short route to west blue marriage customs generally which was exactly where dag wanted her to go the best way to keep her going he quickly discovered was to respond with comments on lakewalker customs on the same head tril paused in kneading biscuit dough to sigh i was afraid last spring fawn was yearning after the sawman boy but that was never a hope his papa and jas stonecrop had had it fixed between them for years that sunny would marry violet and the two farms would come together in the next generation its going to be a rich spread that one if violet has more than one boy there may be enough to divide among them without the younger ones having to go off homesteading the way reed and rush keep talking of the twins spoke of going to the edge of the cultivated zone twenty miles or so west and breaking new land between them after fletch married it was a plan much discussed but so far little acted upon dag was given to understand fathers arrange marriages among farmers sometimes tril smiled sometimes they just think they do sometimes the fathers have to be arranged the land though or the family dueshare for children who arent getting landthat has to be understood and written out and kept by the village clerk or you risk bad blood later land again farmers were all about land other wealth was thought of as lands equivalent it seemed he offered lakewalker couples usually choose each other but the man is expected to bring bridegifts to her family which he is considered to be joining horses and furs traditionally though it depends on what he has accumulated dag added as if casually i have eight horses at the moment the other geldings are on loan to the camp pool except for copperhead who is too eviltempered to foist on anyone else the three mares i keep in foal my brothers wife looks after them along with her mares camp pool tril said after a puzzled moment if a man has more than he needs he cant just sit on it and let it rot so it goes to the camp pool usually to outfit a young patroller and the camp scribe keeps a record of it its very handy if you go to switch camps because you can carry a letter of record and draw for your needs when you get there instead of carrying all that burden along at the hinterland meetings every two years one of the jobs for the camp scribes is to meet and settle up any lingering differences i have a long credit at stores how to translate that into acreage temporarily defeated him but he hoped she understood he was not by any measure destitute despite his present roadworn appearance he rubbed his nose reflectively with the side of his hook they tried me as a camp scribe for a while after i lost my hand but i didnt take to the fiddly work and all the writing i wanted to be moving out in the field you can read and write tril looked as though this was a point in dags favorgood pretty much all lakewalkers can hm are you the oldest in your family or what youngest by ten years but ive only the one brother living it was a great sorrow to my mother that she had no daughter to carry on her tent but my brother married a younger sister of the waterstridersthey had sixand she took our tent name sos it wouldnt be lost and moved in sos my mother wouldnt be alone see im a nice tame fellow i have a family too of a sort my brother is a very gifted maker at our camp he decided not to say of what the production of sharing knives was the most demanding of lakewalker makings and dar was highly respected but it seemed premature to introduce this to the bluefields doesnt he patrol he did when he was youngernearly everyone doesbut his making skills are too valuable to waste on patrolling dags needless to say werent so what of your father was he a maker or a patroller patroller he died on patrol actually killed by one of those bogles fawn talks of it was not entirely clear to dag if tril had believed in bogles before but on the whole he thought shed come to now and was rendered very uncomfortable thereby no he went in after a younger patroller who was swept away in a bad river crossing late in the winter i wasnt therei was patrolling in a different sector of the hinterland and didnt hear for some days drowned seems an odd fate for a lakewalker no or not just then he took a fever of the lungs and died about four nights later drowned in a sense i suppose actually hed died of sharing the two comrades who were trying to fetch him home in his dire illness had entered the tent to find him rolled over on his knife whether hed chosen that end in shrewd judgment or delirium or despair or just plain exhaustion from the struggle dag would never know the knife had come to him anyway and hed used it three years later on a malice up near cat lick oh aye lung fever is nasty tril said sympathetically one of sorrels aunts was carried off by that just last winter im so sorry dag shrugged it was eleven years ago were you close not really he was away when i was smaller and then i was away i knew his father well though grandfather had a bad knee by then like nattienattie listening through the doorway as she spun lifted up her head and smiled at her nameand he stayed in camp and helped look after me among other things if id lost a foot instead of a hand i might have ended like that uncle dag to my brothers pack or i might have shared early so um are there any onehanded farmers oh yes accidents happen on farms folks deal with it i expect i knew a man with a wooden leg once ive never heard tell of anything like that rig of yours though fawns mother was relaxing nicely in his presence now and didnt jump at all anymore when he moved on the whole dag suspected that it was easier to coax wild animals to take food from his hand than to lull bluefields but he was clearly making progress he wondered if his lakewalker habits were betraying him and if he ought to have started with fawns papa instead of with the women well it hardly mattered where he started he was eventually going to have to beguile the whole lot of them in order to get his way and in they clumped sweaty and ravenous fawn followed smelling of cows with two covered buckets slung on a yoke which she set aside to deal with later the crowd minus clover tonight settled down happily to heaping portions of ham beans corn bread summer squash assorted pickled things biscuits butter jams fresh apple butter cider and milk conversation lagged for a little dag ignored the covert glances as he dealt with biscuits by stabbing them whole with his forkspoon tril if he read her aright was simply pleased that he seemed to like them happily he did not need to feign this flattery although he would have if necessary where did you go while i was milking fawn finally asked him took a walk down to the river and back around i am pleased to say theres no malice sign within a mile of here although i wouldnt expect any this area gets patrolled regularly really said fawn ive never seen patrollers around here we cross settled land at night mostly to avoid disturbing folks you wouldnt notice us papa bluefield looked up curiously at this it was quite possible over the years that not all patrols had passed as invisibly to him as all that did you ever patrol west blue fawn asked not lately when i was a boy just starting from about age fifteen i walked a lot in this area so i might have dont remember now we might have passed each other all unknowing she looked thoughtful at this notion um no not then he added when i was twenty i was sent on exchange to a camp north of farmers flats and started my first walk around the lake i didnt get back for eighteen years oh she said ive been all over this hinterland since but not just here its a big territory papa bluefield sat back at the tables head and eyed dag narrowly just how old are you lakewalker a deal older than fawn i daresay i daresay dag agreed papa bluefield continued to stare expectantly the sound of forks scraping plates was suddenly obtrusive cornered must this come out here perhaps it was better to get it on the table sooner than later dag cleared his throat so that his voice would come out neither squeaking like a mouses nor too loud and said fiftyfive fawn choked on her cider he probably should have glanced aside first to see she wasnt trying to swallow anything his forkspoon hand was no good for patting her on the back but she recovered her breath m a moment sorry she wheezed down the wrong pipe she looked up sideways at him in muffled possibly alarm or dismay he hoped it wasnt horror papa she muttered is fiftythree all right a little horror they would deal with it tril was staring you look forty if that dag lowered his eyelids in nonargument fawn papa bluefield announced grimly is eighteen beside him fawns breath drew in sharply aggravated dag tried almost successfully to keep his lips from curling up it was hard when she was clearly boiling so much inside she was ready to pop really he eyed her blandly she told me she was twenty although from my vantage it scarcely makes a difference she hunched her shoulders sheepishly but their eyes connected and then she had trouble not laughing too and all was well papa bluefield said in an aggravated tone fawn had an old bad habit of telling tall tales i tried to beat it out of her i should have beat her more maybe or less dag did not say aloud as it happens i come from a very longlived kin dag said by way of attempted repair my grandfather i told you of was still spry till his death at well over a hundred one hundred twentysix but there was more than enough mental arithmetic going on around the table right now the brothers particularly seemed to be floundering staring at him in renewed wariness it all works out dag went on into the toolong pause if for example fawn and i were to marry we would actually arrive at old age tolerably close together barring accidents all right hed said the magic word marry it wasnt as if he hadnt done something like this before long ago well all right it had been nothing at all like this kauneos kin had been overpowering in an entirely different manner the terror rippling through him felt the same though papa bluefield growled lakewalkers dont marry farmer girls he couldnt grip fawns hand below the table for reassurance all he could do was dig his fork into her thigh with unpredictable but probably unhelpful results at the moment he did glance down at her was he about to jump off this cliff alone or with her her eyes were wide and lovely and terrified and thrilled he drew a long breath i would i will i wish to marry fawn please seven stunned bluefields created the loudest silence dag had ever heard chapter in the airless moment while everyone else around the table was still inhaling fawn said quickly id like that fine dag i would and will and wish too yes thank you kindly then she drew breath and then the storm broke of course as the babble rose fawn thought dag should have tackled her family one at a time instead of all together like this but then she noticed that neither mama nor aunt nattie was adding to the rain of objections and truly whenever papa turned to mama for support he received instead a solemn silent stare that seemed to unnerve him aunt nattie said nothing at all but she was smiling dryly so maybe dag had been doing more than just thinking all this day fletch possibly in imitation of papas earlier and successful attempt to embarrass dag about his age came up with we dont take kindly to cradle robbing around these parts lakewalker whit his tone mockthoughtful but his eyes bright with the excitement of battle put in actually im not sure if hes robbing cradles or shes robbing graves which made dag wince but also offer a wry headshake and a low murmur of good one whit it also made fawn so furious that she threatened to serve whits pie on his head instead of his plate or better still his head on his plate instead of his pie which drew mama into the side fray to chide fawn so whit won twice and smirked fit to make fawn explode she hated how easily they all could make her feel and act twelve then treat her so and feel justified about it if they kept this up much longer she was afraid theyd succeed in dropping her back to age two and screaming tantrums right on the floor which would do just about nothing for her cause she caught her breath and sat again simmering i hear lakewalker men are landless and do no work cept maybe hunting said fletch determinedly returning to the attack if its fawns portion youre after let me tell you she gets no land do you think i could carry farm fields away in my saddlebags fletch said dag mildly you could stuff in a couple o chickens maybe whit put in so helpfully dags eyes crinkled be a bit noisy dont you think copperhead would take such offense and picture the mess of eggs breaking in my gear which made whit snicker unwillingly in turn whit fawn decided didnt care which side he argued for as long as he could stir the pot and keep it boiling and he preened when folks laughed at his jokes dag had him halfwrapped around his thumb already so what do you want eh asked reed aggressively frowning dag leaned back face growing serious and somehow she was not sure how commanding attention all around the table it was as if he suddenly grew taller just sitting there fletch brings up some very real concerns dag said with a nod of approval at fawns eldest brother that puffed him up a bit despite himself as i understand it if fawn married a local lad she would be due clothing some furniture animals seed tools and a deal of labor to help set up her new house except for her personal gear its not lakewalker custom or expectation that i should have any of that nor could i use it but neither should i like to see her deprived of her rights and dueshare i have an alternate plan for the puzzle papa and mama were both listening seriously too as if they were all three speaking the same language of a sudden and what would that be patroller said papa brows now pinched more in thought than in antagonism and not nearly as red in the face as hed been at first dag tilted his head as if in thanks incidentally emphasizing his permission to speak without interruptions from juniors i of course undertake to care for and protect fawn for as long as i live but its a plain fact that i dont lead a safe life a slight emphatic tick of his wrist cuff on the table edge was no accident fawn thought for now i would have her leave her marriage portion here intact but definedwritten out square in the family book and in the clerks record witnessed just as is right no man knows the hour of his shariof his end but if ever fawn has to come back here i would have it be as a real widow not a grass one he tilted his head just enough toward fawn that only she saw his slight wink and she was as cheered by the wink as chilled by the words so that her heart seemed to spin unanchored sheand her children if anywould then have something to fall back on wholly separate from my fate mama face scrunched up in concentration nodded thoughtfully at this in the hope that such a day would be long from now or never it would have to be attested by fletch and clover as well cant help thinking that clover would be just as glad to put off paying out that dueshare with all the work shell have here starting up fletch opening his mouth shut it abruptly as it finally dawned that not only would he not be required to disgorge any family resources right away but also that fawn would be out of the house when he brought his new bride home and only by the slightest brightening of dags eyes did fawn realize that dag had hit fletch precisely where he was aiming and knew it a blessed silence fell just long enough to finish consuming pie fawn was reattaching dags hook before whit wiped his lips and said in brotherly bewilderment but why ever would you want to marry fawn in the first place the tone of his voice alone threw fawn back into a pit of unwelcome memories of youthful mockery as if she were the most unlikely candidate for courtship in the whole of west blue and for a hundred miles beyond in any direction as if she were a cross between a village idiot and a freak of nature what was that stupid phrase that had worked so well repeatedly to rile her up hey runt you must have been drinking ugly juice this morning and how those words had made her feel like it need i say asked dag calmly yes said fletch in his stern iamsopaternal voice that made fawn long to kick him even more than she longed to kick whit and even made papa cock a bemused eyebrow at him yeah old man said rush scowling of all at the table but nattie the twins had said the least so far but none of it had been favorable give us three good reasons dags eyelids lowered briefly in a cool yet strangely dangerous assent but his side glance at fawn felt like a caress after a beating only that very well he held their attention while he appeared to think deliberately clearing a silence in which to speak for the courage of her heart which i saw face down the greatest horrors i know without breaking for the high and hungry intelligence of her mind which never stops asking questions nor thinking about the answers for the spark of her spirit which could teach bonfires how to burn thats three enough for going on with he rose from the table his hook hand briefly touching her shoulder all this is set beside me and you ask me instead if i want dirt i do not understand farmers he excused himself with a polite nod all around and a murmured evening aunt nattie and strode out fawn wasnt sure if she was more thrilled with his words or with his timing he had indeed figured out the only way to get in the last word in a bunch of bluefieldsshoot it into the target and run and whatever comment mockery or insult might have risen in his wake was undercut to shamed silence by the sound of mama weeping quietly into the apron clutched up to her face the debate didnt end there naturally it mostly broke up into smaller parts as they took on family members in ones or twos although fawn gave dag credit for trying for efficiency that first night the twins cornered her the next afternoon in the old barn where she had gone to give grace and copperhead some treats and a good brushing rush leaned on the stall partition and spoke in a voice of disgust fawn that fellow is way too old for you hes older than papa and papas older than rocks and hes all so banged up if you were married youd have to look at that stump he hides i bet or touch it ew ive seen it she said shortly brushing bay hairs into the air in a cloud i help him with his arm harness now his other arms broke and a great deal of other assistance that she was not inclined to bring to the twins attention you should see his poor gnarly feet if you want to see banged up reed sat on a barrel of oats across the aisle with his knees drawn up and his arms wrapped around them rocking uneasily he said in a thin tone hes a lakewalker hes evil this brought fawns irritated and vigorous brushing to an abrupt halt grace twitched her ears in protest fawn turned to stare no hes not what are you going on about they say lakewalkers eat their own dead to make their sorcery what if he makes you have to eat corpses or worse what does he really want you for his wife reed said fawn with grim patience is that so very hard to believe reeds voice hushed what if its to make magic he already does that would likely not be a useful answer what are you afraid ill be made a human sacrifice how sweet of you reed sort of reed unfolded indignantly dont you laugh its true i saw a lakewalker once whod stopped to eat in the alehouse in west blue sunny sawman dared me to peek in her saddlebags she had bones in themhuman bones tell me was she wearing her hair in a knot at the nape of her neck reed stared howd you know youre lucky you werent caught i was she took me and shook me and told me id be cursed if i ever touched anything of a lakewalkers again she scowled soshe told me shed catch and eat me fawns brows drew down how old were you again ten reed for pitys sake said fawn in utter exasperation what would you tell a little boy you caught rifling your bags so as to scare him enough never to do it again youre just lucky you didnt run into dags aunt marii bet she could have come up with a tall tale that would have made you pee yourself into the next week she was suddenly glad the sharing knife was stored with her own things and wondered it she ought to warn dag to watch his saddlebags reed looked a bit taken aback as if this point had never before occurred to him but he went on anyhow fawn those bones were real they were fresh fawn had no doubt of it she also had no desire to start down some slippery slope of explanation with the twins who would only ask her how she knew and badger her endlessly when her answers didnt fit their notions she finished brushing graces flanks and turned her attention to her mane and forelock rush was still mired in the age difference its sickening to think of a fellow that old pawing you what if he got you pregnant she was definitely not ready for that again so soon but it was hardly a prospect that filled her with horror perhaps her and dags future children if any wouldnt be saddled with being so blasted shortnow there was a heartening thought she smiled softly to herself as grace nudged her velvety nose into her hand and whuffled rush went on he as much as said it was his plan to keep you till you were and then send you back to batten on us only if he dies rush yeah well how much longer can that be and what does it matter to you anyhow you and reed are going to go west and break land you wont even be here she let herself out of the stall and latched the door on fletch and clover then you two are so so soshe groped for a sufficient wordhowling stupid oh yeah rush shot back he claimed he wanted to marry you because you were smart and how dumb do you have to be to believe that you know its just sos he can get his old hands on your young self hand she corrected coldly and how she missed its touch on her young everything escape from west blue with or without a wedding could not happen soon enough rush imitated upchucking with realistic noises fawn supposed stabbing him with the pitchfork was out but maybe she could at least whack him over the head with it he added and how dyou think well feel in front of our friends stuck with that fellow in the family considering your friends i cant say as im real moved by that plea i cant see as youve much considered anybody but yourself lately reed said more urgently and with a peculiar fearful tinge in his voice i see what it is hes magicked you up some way already hasnt he i dont want to hear another word out of you two or what said rush youll never speak to us again im working on that one snarled fawn and stalked out of the barn not all of the encounters were so aggravating fawn found an unexpected ally in clover with whom shed never before much gotten along and clover brought fletch right into line the two girls were now in great charity with each other feeling they could have been best friends forever and mistaken in all their prior judgments fletch was a bit dizzied dag made undaunted use of the news about his age to put himself rather above it all and he mainly talked privately with mama and papa or nattie whit continued to fire off barbs in blithe disregard for their aim with the result that everybody grew furious with him except for dag who continued patient and determined ive dealt with dissolving patrols down to and including breaking up knife fights he assured fawn at one especially distraught moment no one heres tried to stab each other yet its been a near thing fawn growled by supper of the second night after dags proposal fawns parents had gone so far as to forbid discussion of the topic at the table somewhat to dags relief it did render the meal uncharacteristically quiet dag thought his plan to extract fawn gracefully from the clutches of her kin was not going as well as hed hoped whether it took two days or twenty or two hundred he was determined to persevere but it was plain fawn was close to melting in this family crucible and her strain communicated itself to him open to her ground as he could not help being theyd taken too long on this journey already much more tarrying in west blue and hed risk not beating maris patrol back to hickory lake and they would panic and think him missing again and this time he wouldnt be dragging back in with another malice kill in his bag to buy forgiveness bluefields were falling to him slowly fletch and clover were openly agreeable nattie quietly agreeable and tril mainly just quiet whit didnt greatly care and papa bluefield still sat on the fence sorrel and tril bluefield reminded dag a bit of patrol leaders their heads stuffed with too many duties and details too many peoples conflicting desires and needs an unsolvable dilemma had a good chance of being invited to go away he thought they might break simply because they could not afford to spend all their time and energy on one problem when so many more crowded upon them dag felt almost cruelly ruthless but he steeled himself to keep up the blandishments and subtle pressure fawn took care of the unsubtle pressure reed and rush remained a stubborn reservoir of resistance dag was not sure why as neither would talk to him despite several friendly lures separately he thought he might have gotten somewhere but together they stayed locked in a knot of disapproval fawn when he asked her for guidance into their objections just went tightlipped but their more hotheaded remarks at least served to drive their papa further and faster toward conciliation than he would have gone on his own if only from sheer embarrassment some opposition was its own worst enemy still i should have liked to have made some real tentbrothers now there was an unreasonable hope to flush from hiding dag frowned at himself the gift of comradeship hed once found with kauneos brothers in luthlia so fine in the having was all the more painful in the loss maybe it was better this way after the postsupper chores the family usually gathered in the parlor cooler than the kitchen to share the lamplight dag had walked out with fawn to feed scraps to the chickens as they came through the kitchen door and into the central hall he heard raised voices from the parlor by this time dag cringed at opening his groundsense in this raucous company not a one of them capable of a decent veiling but he did prick his ears to hear reeds voice rumbling hostile and indistinct and then trils raised in sharp fear reed put that down fawn brought me that all the way from glassforge beside him fawn drew in her breath and hurried forward dag strode after bracing himself in the parlor reed and rush had more or less cornered their parents tril was sitting beside the table that held the bright oil lamp some sewing in her lap nattie sat across the room in the shadows with the drop spindle that was rarely out of her hands now stilled whit crouched by nattie a spectator on the fringe for once not heckling sorrel stood facing reed with rush pacing nervously around them reed was holding up the glass bowl and declaiming overdramatically in dags view sell your daughter to some bloodyhanded corpseeater for the sake of a piece of glass reed fawn cried furiously dashing forward you give that back its not yours dag thought it was sheer force of habit when confronted with that familiar sisterly rise reed quite unthinkingly raised the bowl high out of fawns hopping reach at her enraged squeal he tossed it to rush who just as unthinkingly caught it tears of fury sprang in fawns eyes you two are just a pair of yard dogs if you hadnt dragged useless here home with you rush began defensively ah yet another new nickname for himself dag realized he was collecting quite a set of them here but his own fraying temper was not nearly such a grating goad to him as fawns humiliated helplessness sorrel glanced at his distraught wife whose hands had flown to her mouth and barked angrily boys thats enough he strode forward and started to pull the bowl out of rushs grasp sorrel unwilling to snatch let go just as rush afraid to resist did likewise it was no ones fault exactly or at least no ones intention dag saw it coming as did fawn and a desolate little wail broke from her lips even before the bowl hit the wooden floor edge on and burst falling into three large pieces and a sparkling spray of splinters everyone froze in equal horror whit opened his lips looked around and then closed them flat sorrel recovered his voice first hoarse and low whit dont move you got no shoes on tril cried reed rush how could you and began sobbing into her sewing their mothers anger might have rolled right off the pair dag thought but the genuine heartbreak in her voice seemed to cut them off at the knees they both began incoherent apologies sorry does no mending she cried tossing the scrap of cloth aside it was flecked with blood where she had inadvertently driven her needle into her palm in the shock of the crash ive had it with the whole pack of you the bluefield uproar was so painful in dags ground which he tried to close but could not for the strength of his link to fawn that he found himself dropping to his knees he stared at the pieces of glass on the floor in front of him as the angry and anguished voices continued overhead he could not shut them out but he could redirect his attention it was an old old method of dealing with the unbearable he slipped his splinted right arm from its sling and with it and his hook he clumsily pushed the large pieces of the bowl as close together as he could those splinters nowmost of those glass splinters were no bigger than mosquitoes if he could bounce a mosquito he could move one splinter and if he could move one he could move two and four and more he remembered the sweet song of this bowls ground as it had rested in the sunset light of their refuge in glassforge gifting rainbows and he began a low humming searching up and down for the right note just there the glass splinters began to wink then shift then rise and flow over the boards of the parlor floor he shifted them not with his hand but with the ground of his hand the ground of his left hand the hand that was not there and the very thought was so terrifying he shied from it but even that terror did not break his concentration the splinters flew up circling and swirling like fireflies around the bowl to find their places once more the bowl glowed golden along all the spiderlines of its fractures like kiln fire like star fire like nothing earthly dag had ever seen it scintillated reflecting off his draining chilling skin he held the pure note faintly through his rounded lips the lines of light seemed to melt into rivulets streams rivers of pale gold running all through the glass then spread out like a still lake under a winter sunrise the light faded and was gone dag came back to himself bent over on his knees his hair hanging around his face like a curtaining fringe mouth slack staring down at the intact glass bowl his skin felt as cold and clammy as lard on a winter morning and he was shivering shuddering so hard his stomach hurt he pressed his teeth together so that they would not chatter the only sounds in the room were of eight people breathing some heavily some rapidly some choked with tears some wheezing with shock he thought he could pick out each ones pattern with his ears alone he could not force himself to look up someonefawnthumped down on her knees before him dag she said uncertainly her small hand reached out to touch his chin to tilt his face upward to meet her wide wide eyes he pushed the bowl forward with his left arm it was hot to the touch but not dangerously so it did not melt or disappear or explode or fall apart again into a thousand pieces it just sang slightly as it scraped across the floor the ordinary song of ordinary glass that had never been slain or resurrected he found his voice or at least a close imitation of his voice it sounded utterly unfamiliar in his own ears as though it was coming from underwater or underground give that back to your mama he pressed his wrist cuff to her shoulder and levered himself upright the room wavered around him and he was suddenly afraid he was going to vomit making a mess right there on the middle of the parlor floor in front of everyone fawn clutched the bowl to her breast and rose after him her eyes never leaving his face are you all right she asked he gave her a short headshake wet his cold lips and stumbled for the parlor door to the central hall he hoped he could make it out onto the front porch before his stomach heaved tril on her feet was hovering nearby and she stepped back as he passed fawn followed pausing only long enough to thrust the bowl into her mothers hands dag heard fawns voice behind him low and fierce he does that for hearts too you know and she marched forthrightly after him chapter fawn followed dag onto the front porch and watched in worry as he sat heavily on the step his left elbow on his knee and his head down in the west behind the house the sky was draining of sunset colors to the east above the river valley the first stars were pricking through the darkening turquoise vault the air grew soft as the days heat eased fawn settled down to dags right and raised her hand uncertainly to his face his skin was icy and she could feel the shudders coursing through his body youve gone all cold he shook his head swallowing give me a little in a few moments he straightened up taking a deep breath thought i was going to spew my nice dinner on my feet but now i think not is that usual for after doing things like that noi dont know im not a maker wed determined that by the time i was sixteen hadnt the concentration for it i needed to be moving all the time i am not a maker but that was she prompted when he stayed stopped that was a making absent gods he raised his left arm and rubbed his forehead on his sleeve she tucked her arm around him trying to share warmth she wasnt sure how much good it did but he smiled shakily for the attempt his body was chilled all down his side we should go into the kitchen by the hearth i could fix you a hot drink when i can stand up he added maybe go around the outside of the house where they would not have to hazard her family she nodded understanding groundwork he began and trailed off you have to understand lakewalker groundworkmagic you might sayinvolves taking something and making it more so more itself through reinforcing its ground theres a woman at hickory lake who works with leather makes it repel rain she has a sister who can make leather that turns arrows she can make maybe two coats a month i had one once did it work never had occasion to find out while i had it i saw another turn a mudmans spear though iron tip left nothing but a scratch in the hide of the coat not of the patroller he clarified had what happened to it lent it to my oldest nephew when he began patrolling he handed it on to his sister when she started last i knew my brothers youngest took it with him when he went out of the hinterland im not sure the coats are all that useful for theyre like to make you careless and they dont protect the face and legs but you know you worry for the youngsters his shudders were easing but his expression remained strained and distant that bowl just now though i pushed its ground back to purest bowlness and the glass just followed i felt it so clear except that except that he leaned his forehead down against hers and whispered fearfully i pushed with the ground of my left hand and i have no left hand and it has no ground whatever was there for that minute is gone again now ive never heard of anything like that but the best makers dont speak of their craft much except to their own so i dont know dont know the door swung open whit edged out into the shadows of the porch um fawn what whit she said impatiently um aunt nattie says um aunt nattie says shes had enough of this nonsense and shell see you and the patroller in her rooms and be having the end of it one way or another as soon as the patroller is up to it um sir behind the fringe of his hair dags lips twitched slightly he raised his face thank you whit he said gravely tell aunt nattie well be along soon whit gulped ducked his head and fled back indoors they rose and went around the north side of the house to the kitchen dag resting his left arm heavily across fawns shoulders he stumbled twice she made him sit by the hearth while she fixed him a cup of hot water with some peppermint leaves crushed in holding it to his lips while he drank it down by then hed stopped shivering and his clammy skin had dried and warmed again she saw her parents and fletch peeking timidly from the darkness of the hall but they said nothing and did not venture in aunt nattie appeared at the door to her shadowed weaving room well patroller you were flyin there for a bit i guess yes maam i was dag agreed wryly fawn you fetch in the patroller and what lights you want she turned back into the dark scuffing feet and cane over the floorboards not wearily but just for the company of the sound as she sometimes did fawn looked anxiously at dag the firelight shed poked up glimmered redorange over his skin yellow on his coarse white shirt and the sling and his eyes were dark and wide he looked tired and confused and as if his arm was hurting but he smiled reassuringly at her and she smiled back you ready she asked not sure but im too curious to care possibly not a trait helpful to longevity in a patroller but there you go she took down the candle lamp with the chipped glass sleeve from the mantel and lit it grabbing the unlit iron holder with the three stubs while she was at it and led off with a muffled eh he levered himself up out of his chair and paced after her nattie called from their bedroom close both doors lovie it will keep the noise out and in fawn reflected she pushed the door to the kitchen closed with her foot and picked her way around the loom and the piles of dags gear in the bedroom nattie seated herself on the side of her narrow bed and motioned to the one across from it fawn set the lamp and the iron ring on the table between and lit the other candles and went back and closed the bedroom door dag glanced at her and sat down facing nattie the bed ropes creaking under his weight and fawn eased down at his left here we are aunt nattie she announced to which dag added maam nattie stretched her back and grimaced then leaned forward on her cane her pearly eyes seeming to stare at them in a disturbingly penetrating fashion well patroller im going to tell you a story and then im going to ask you a question and then well see where were goin on to im at your disposal dag said with that studied courtesy fawn had learned concealed caution thats to be seen she sniffed you know youre not the first lakewalker ive met i sensed that i lead a dull life mostly lived in this house since tril married sorrel nigh on thirty years ago i hardly get off this farm cept down to west blue for the market day or a little sewing bee now and then actually nattie did both regularly being a chief supplier of fine cloth and having a deep ear for village gossip but fawn forbore to intrude on the stream of whatever this was going to be reminiscence apparently so for nattie went on now the summer before fawn was born was a tough time her mama was sick and the boys were rambunctious and her papa was overworked as usual i wasnt sleeping so good myself so i did my gathering in the north woods at night after theyd all gone to bed the boys being less help than more in the woods at that stage of their lives ages three to ten roughly fawn could picture it and shuddered roots and herbs and plants for remedies and dyes you know nights not only more peaceful the scents are sharper i especially wanted some wild ginger for tril thought i might make a tea to settle her poor stomach anyhow i was sorry for the peaceful that night because i fell and twisted my ankle something fierce i tried callin for a bit but i was too far from the house to be heard truly the woods on the steep valley slope to the north of their place extended for three miles before the next farm fawn made an encouraging noise in lieu of a nod i figured i was doomed to lie in the dew till morning when id be missed but then i heard a sound in the leavesi was afraid it was a wolf or bear come to eat me but instead it was a lakewalker patroller i was thinking at first id rather a bear but he turned out to be a nice young fellow he laid hands on my foot and eased me amazingly and picked me up and carried me back to the house i was skinnier back then mind bit of a dab really he was not near so tall as youshe nodded in dags general directionbut right stout nice voice almost as deep as yours he explained all about how he was on exchange from some camp way out east and this was his first patrol in these partslonely and homesick i was thinking anyhow i fed him quiet in the kitchen and he did a real fine job bandaging my ankle up nice and firm i dont know if he decided i was his adopted aunt or if he was more like a boy picking up a bird with an injured wing and making a pet of it but late the next night there came a tapping on my window he was back with some medicine some for my foot and some for trils tummy which he handed inhe wouldnt stay that time though the powders worked wonderful well i must say she sighed in fond recollection off he went and i thought no more of it but next summer about the same time of year there came that tapping at my window again we had a bit of a picnic on the back porch in the dark and talked he was glad to hear tril had delivered you safe fawn he gave me some little presents and i gave him some food and cloth the next summer the same i got to looking out for him the next year he came back one more time but not alone he brought his new bride just to show her off to me i think he was that proud of her he showed me their lakewalker marriagebracelets stringbindings they called em knowin i had a makers interest in all things to do with the craft thread and cords and braids as well as the weaving and knitting they let me hold them in my hands and feel them gave me a turn they did they werent just fancy cord they were magical yes said dag cautiously and at fawns curious look expanded each betrothed puts a tiny bit of their ground into their own cord the stringbinding ceremony tangles the two grounds then they exchange his for hers really said fawn fascinated trying to remember if shed noticed such bracelets on the patrollers at glassforge yes for marid had one and so had a couple of other older patrollers she had thought them merely decorative do they do anything can you send messages no well only that if one spouse dies the other can feel it for the ground drains out of their binding cord theyre often put safe away to save wear although they can be remade if theyre damaged but if one spouse is out on patrol the other back in camp usually wears theirs just to know to the one out on patrol it comes as more of a shock because you dont expect ive seen that happen twice its not good the patroller is dismissed at once to ride home if its at all possible theres a special terror to knowing what but not how except that you are too late and a thought that you know maybe the string just got burned up in a tent fire or some freak thingenough hope for agony but not enough for ease when i woke up in the medicine tent after the room grew so quiet fawn thought she could hear the candles burning she lifted her face to his and said a little wryly you know youve either got to finish those sorts of sentences or not start them he sighed and nodded i think i can say this to you if i cant ive no business anyway i was about to say when i woke up in the medicine tent after wolf ridge with my hand gone so was kauneos binding string which i wore on that side lost on the ridge i guess i made some difficulties trying to find it being fairly mixed up in the head right about then they hadnt wanted to tell me she was gone till i was stronger but they pretty much had to and then i wouldnt believe them it was like if i could just find that binding string i could prove them wrong i got over it in due course he was looking away from her as he said this fawn drew her breath in and let it out gently between her teeth he looked back down at her and smiled sort of and tried to move his hand to grasp hers in reassurance wincing as the sling brought him up short in painful reminder it was a long time ago he murmured before i was born indeed he added after a moment i dont know why i find that an easing thought but i do nattie had her head cocked to one side with the intensity of her listening when he did not go on she put in now i do know this patroller without those binding strings you arent married in lakewalker eyes he nodded cautiously then remembered to say aloud yes that is to say they are a visible proof of a valid marriage like your village clerks record and writing your name in the family book with all the witnesses signatures below the stringbinding is the heart and center of a wedding the food and the music and the dancing and the arguments among the relatives are all extra uhhuh said nattie and theres the problem patroller because if fawn and you stand up in the parlor before the family and all like you say you want and sign your names and make your promises seems to me shed be getting married but you wouldnt i said i had a question and this is it i want to know exactly what you are about that you think this wont twist around somehow and leave her cryin fawn wondered for a moment why he was being held responsible for her future tears but not her for his she supposed it was the the blighted age thing again it seemed unfairly unbalanced somehow dag was silent for several long breaths he finally raised his chin and said when i first rode in here i had no thought of a farmer wedding but it didnt take long to see how little her family valued spark present company excepted he added hastily nattie nodded grimly not disagreeing not that they dont love her and try to look out for her in a sort of backhanded absentminded way but they dont seem to see her not as she is not as i see her of course they dont have groundsense but still maybe the past fogs the present maybe they just havent looked lately maybe they never have looked i dont know but marriage seems to raise a womans standing in a farmer family i thought i could give her that in an easy way well it seemed easy at the time not so sure now he sighed i was real clear about the widowhood business though seems like a hollow gift patroller yes but i cant do a stringbinding here i cant make the string for one it takes two hands and ive got none and im not sure fawn can make one at all and weve no one to do the blessing and the tying i was thinking that when we reached hickory lake i might try for a stringbinding there despite the difficulties think your family will favor this idea no he said frankly i expect trouble about it but ive outstubborned everything my life has thrown at me so far hes got a point there aunt nattie fawn dared to say mm said aunt nattie so what happens if they pitch her out on her ear which lakewalkers have done to farmer suitors before i do believe dag fell very quiet for a little then said id walk with her natties brows went up youd break with your people can you not by choice his shrug failed to conceal deep unease but if they chose to break with me i couldnt very well stop them fawn blinked suddenly disquieted shed dreamed only of what joy they might bring to each other but that keelboat seemed to be towing a whole string of barges she hadnt yet peeked into dag had it seemed huhhuhhm said nattie she tapped her cane gently on the floorboards im thinkin too patroller i got two hands so does fawn actually dag seemed to freeze staring at nattie sharply im not at all sure that would work he added after a longer moment im not at all sure it wouldnt i have some knowhow fawn knows this land she can help gather the necessaries hair from each of us other things mines a bit short i have tricks for dealing with short fibers said nattie equitably you have more than that i think spark he turned to her give me a piece your aunt has made i want to hold something of her making something especially fine you know i think i know what hes wanting look in that trunk at the foot of my bed lovie said nattie fletchs wedding shirt fawn hopped up went around to the wooden trunk and lifted the lid the shirt was right on top she picked it up by the shoulders letting the white fabric fall open it was almost finished except for the cuffs the smocking around the tops of the sleeves and across the yoke in back was soft under her touch and the buttons already sewn down the front placket were carved of iridescent mussel shell cool and smooth she brought it to dag who laid it out in his lap touching it clumsily and gingerly with his right fingertips and more hesitantly letting his hook hand drift above it careful not to snag this isnt just one fiber is it linen for strength cotton for softness a bit of nettle flax for the shimmer nattie said i spun the thread special lakewalker women never spin or weave thread so fine it takes too much time and we never have enough of that fawn glanced at his coarse shirt which she had thought shoddy with a new eye i remember helping nattie and mama set up the loom for that cloth last winter it took three days and was so tedious and finicky i thought id scream lakewalker looms are little hanging things which can be taken down and carried easy when we move camp we could never shift that big wooden frame of your aunts thats a farmer tool sessile as bad as barns and houses targets he lowered his gaze to the cloth again this is good ground in this it used to be plants and and creatures now its ground is wholly transformed all shirt whole thats a good making that is he raised his face and stared at nattie with a new and keen curiosity theres a blessing worked in fawn would have sworn natties lips twitched in a proud smirk but the expression fleeted away too fast to be sure i tried nattie said modestly its a wedding shirt after all huh dag sat up indicating with a nod that fawn should take the shirt back she folded it away again carefully and sat on the trunk a tension hung between nattie and dag and she hesitated to walk between them lest something delicate tear and snap like a spiderweb dag said im willing to try for the binding strings if you are aunt nattie it sure would change the argument up home if it doesnt work were no worse off than we were except for the disappointment and if it does were that much farther along farther along to where asked nattie dag gave a wry snort well all find out when we arrive i expect thats a fair saying allowed nattie amiably all right patroller you got yourself a bargain you mean youll speak for us to mama and papa fawn wanted to jump up and squeal she stopped it down to a more demure squeak and leaped to the bed to give nattie a hug and a kiss nattie fought her off unconvincingly now now lovie dont carry on so youll be giving me the heebiejeebies she sat up straight and turned her face once more toward the man across from her one other thing dag if youd be willing to hear me out his brows twitched up at the unaccustomed use of his name im a good listener yeah i noticed that about you but then nattie fell silent she shifted a little as if embarrassed or or shy surely not before that young lakewalker fellow left he gave me one last present because i said i was sorry to part never having seen his face well actually his lady gave it me i suppose she was something of a hand at lakewalker healings it seemed of the sort he did for my poor ankle when first we met matching grounds dag interpreted this yes its a bit intimate actually its a lot intimate natties voice fell to almost a whisper as if confiding dark secrets it was like she lent me her eyes for a spell now he wasnt too different from what id pictured sort of homelyhandsome hadnt expected the red hair and the shiny suntan though on a fellow whod been sleeping all day and running around all night touch of a shock that she went quiet for a long stretch ive never seen fawns face you know the offhand tone of her voice would have fooled no one present fawn thought even without the little quaver at the end dag sat back blinking in the silence nattie said uncertainly maybe youre too tired maybe its too hard too much um dag swallowed then cleared his throat i am mightily tired this night i admit but im willing to try for you not sure itll work is all wouldnt want to disappoint if it dont work were no worse off than we were as you say i did he agreed he shot a bleak smile at fawn change places with me spark she scrambled off natties bed and took his spot on her own as he sat down beside nattie he hitched his shoulders and slipped his arm out of his sling you be careful with that arm warned fawn anxiously i think i can lift it from the shoulder all right now if i dont try to wriggle my fingers too much or put any pressure on it nattie im going to try to touch your temples here i can use my fingers for the right side but im afraid ill have to touch you with the backside of my hook on the left if only for the balance dont jump around eh whatever you say patroller nattie sat bolt upright very still she nervously wet her lips her pearl eyes were wide staring hard into space dag eased up close to her lifting his hands to either side of her head except for a somewhat inward expression on his face there was nothing whatsoever to see fawn caught the moment only because nattie blinked and gasped shifting her eyes sideways to dag oh and then more impatiently no dont look at that dumpy old woman i dont want to see her anyhow and besides it isnt true look over there obligingly dag turned his head parallel with natties if rather above it he smiled at fawn she grinned back her breath coming faster with the thrill shivering about the room my word breathed nattie my word the timeless moment stretched then she said come on patroller there isnt hardly nothing human in the wide green world could be as pretty as that thats what i thought said dag youre seeing her ground as well as her face you know seeing her as i do do you now whispered nattie do you that explains a lot her eyes locked hungrily on fawn as if seeking to memorize the sightless vision her lids welled with water which glimmered in the candlelight nattie said dag his voice a mix of strain and amusement and regret i cant keep this up much longer im sorry its all right patroller its enough well not that but you know yes dag sighed and sat back slumping awkwardly he slipped his splinted arm back in its sling then bent over staring at the floor are you sick again asked fawn wondering if she should dash for a basin no bit of a headache though there are things floating in my vision there theyre fading now he blinked rapidly and straightened again ow you people do take it out of me i feel as though id just come off walking patterns for ten days straight in the worst weather over crags nattie sat up her tears smearing in tracks like water trickling down a cliff face she scrubbed at her cheeks and glared around the room that she could no longer see my word this is a grubby hole weve been stuffed in all this time fawn lovie why didnt you ever say im going to make the boys whitewash the walls i am sounds like a good idea to me said fawn but i wont be here no but i will nattie sniffed resolutely after a few more minutes to recover her stability nattie planted her cane and hoisted herself up well come on you two lets get this started fawn and dag followed her out past the weaving room once through the door to the kitchen fawn cuddled in close to dags left side and he let his arm drift around behind her back and anchor her there and maybe himself as well the whole family was seated around the lamplit table papa and mama and fletch on the near end reed and rush and whit beyond they looked up warily whatever conference they were having theyd kept their voices remarkably low or else they hadnt been daring to talk to one another at all are they all there muttered nattie yes aunt nattie nattie stepped up to the center of the kitchen and thumped the floor with her cane drawing herself up in full pronouncement mode such as fawn had very seldom seen not since the time nattie had sofinally settled the argument for damages with the irate bowyers over the twins and whits cowracing episode years ago nattie drew a long breath everyone else held theirs im satisfied nattie announced loudly fawn shall have her patroller dag shall have his spark see to it tril and sorrel the rest of you lotshe glared to remarkable effect when she put her mind to it the focused blankness making her eyes seem quite uncannybehave yourselves for once and she turned and walked very briskly back into her weaving room just in case anyone was foolish enough to try to challenge that last word she gave her cane a jaunty twirl and knocked the door closed behind her chapter dag woke late from a sodden sleep to find that his next duty in this dance was to ride with fawn and her parents to west blue to register their intentions with the village clerk and to beg his official attendance on the wedding fawn was fussed and nervous getting dag shaved washed up and dressed which confused him at first because shed had the help down to a fairly straightforward routine and despite his fatigue he wasnt being gracelessly cranky this morning he finally realized that at last they would be seeing people outside of her familyones shed known all her life and vice versa it would be the first view most of west blue would have of dag the lakewalker that lanky fellow fawn bluefield dragged home or however he was now known to local gossip he tried not to let his imagination descend too far into the disagreeable possibilities but he couldnt help reflecting that the only resident of west blue who had met him so far was stupid sunny it seemed too much to hope that sunny was not given to gossip and it was already proven hed a habit of altering the facts to his own favor his humiliation was more likely to make him sly than contrite the bluefields could well be dags only allies in the farmer community it seemed a thin thread to hang from so he let fawn carry on in her efforts to turn him out presentably futile as they seemed the hamlet three miles south via the shadedappled river road appeared peaceful and serene as sorrel drove the family horse cart down the main and seemingly only street it was a day for fluffy white clouds against a bright blue sky utterly innocent of any intent to rain which added to the illusion of good cheer the principal reasons for the villages existence seemed to be a grain mill a small sawmill and the timber wagon bridge which showed signs of having been recently widened around the little market square presently largely idle were a smithy an alehouse and a number of other houses mostly built of the native river stone sorrel brought the cart to a halt before one such and led the way inside dag ducked his head under en excessively low stone lintel just missing braining himself he straightened cautiously and found the ceiling sufficient the front room seemed a cross between a farmhouse parlor and a camp loretent with benches a table and shelves stuffed with papers rolled parchments and bound record books the litter of records flooded on into the rooms beyond in through the back hall bustled the clerk himself who seemed by the way he dusted the knees of his trousers to have been interrupted in the midst of gardening he was on the high side of middle age sharpnosed potbellied and perky and was introduced to dag by the very farmerly name of shep sower he greeted the bluefields as old friends and neighbors but he was clearly taken aback by dag well well well he said when sorrel with determined help from fawn explained the reason for the visit so its true his stout but equally perky wife arrived gaped at dag dipped her knees rather like fawn upon introduction smiled a bit frantically and dragged tril away out of earshot the registry process was not complex it consisted of the clerks first finding the right record book tall and thick and bound in leather dumping it open on the table thumbing through to the most recent page and affixing the date and penning a few lines under some similar entries he required the place and date of birth and parents names of both members of the couplehe didnt even ask before jotting down fawns although his hand hesitated and the pen sputtered when dag recited his own birth date after a doubtful stare upward he blotted hastily and asked dag to repeat it sorrel handed him the rough notes of the marriage agreement to be written out properly in a fair hand and sower read it quickly and asked a few clarifying questions it was only at this point that dag discovered there was a fee for this service and it was customary for the wouldbe husband to pay it fortunately he had not left his purse with his other things at the farm and doubly fortunately because they had been far longer about this journey than hed planned he still had some silver shoals copper crays which sufficed he had fawn fish the little leather bag from his pocket and pay up apparently arrangements could also be made for payment in kind for the coinless there always come some here who cant sign their own names sower informed dag with a nod at his sling i sign for them and they make their x and the witnesses sign to confirm it its been six days since i busted the arm said dag a little tightly for this i think i can manage he did let fawn go first watching her closely he then had her dip the quill again and help push it into his fingers the grip was painful but not impossible the signature was not his best but at least it was clearly legible the clerks brows went up at this proof of literacy the clerks wife and fawns mother returned missus sowers gaze on dag had become rather wideeyed craning her neck curiously she read out dag redwing hickory oleana oleana said fawn first i heard of that part so youll be missus fawn oleana eh said sower actually thats my hinterland name dag put in redwing is what you would call my family name fawn redwing fawn muttered experimentally brows drawing down in concentration huh dag scratched his forehead with the side of his hook its more confusing than that lakewalker custom has the fellow taking the name of his brides tent by which i would become er dag bluefield west blue oleana i suppose sorrel looked horrified what do we do then swap names asked fawn in a tone of great puzzlement or take both redwingbluefield er redfield bluewing you two could be purplesomething sower suggested genially with a wheezing laugh i cant think of anything purple that doesnt sound stupid fawn protested well elderberry i suppose thats lakeish already taken dag informed her blandly well well we have a few days to think it over said fawn valiantly sorrel and tril glanced at each other seemed to inhale for strength and bent to sign below the day and time for the wedding was set for the earliest moment after the customary three days at which the clerk would be available to lend his official presence which to fawns obvious relief was the afternoon of the third day hence in a hurry are you sower inquired mildly and while dag did not at first catch his covert glance at fawns belly she did and stiffened unfortunately i have duties waiting at home dag put in quellingly letting his wrist cuff rest on her shoulder actually aside from averting panic by beating mari back to camp till this blighted arm healed he was going to be just as useless at hickory lake as he was here at west blue it hardly mattered at which spot he sat around grinding his teeth in frustration although west blue at least had more novelty but the disturbing mystery of the sharing knife was an itch at the back of his mind well buried under the new distractions yet never fading altogether three people jerked away from the sowers front window and pretended to have been walking up the street when dag fawn and her parents made their way out the front door across the street a couple of young women clutched each other and bent their heads together giggling a group of young men loitering in front of the alehouse undraped themselves from the wall and went back inside two of them hastily wasnt that sunny sawman just went into millersons sorrel said squinting wasnt that reed with him said fawn in a more curious tone so thats where reed got off to this morning said tril indignantly ill skin that boy sawmans place is the second farm south of the village fawn informed dag in an undervoice he nodded understanding it would make the west blue alehouse a convenient haunt not that it wasnt a gathering place for the whole community by the descriptions dag had garnered sunny must realize that his secrets had been kept or his standing with the bluefield twins would be very different by now if not grateful the relief might at least render him circumspect so were any of those loiterers the friends sunny had threatened to persuade to help slander fawn or had that been an empty threat and fawn had merely fallen for the lie no telling now the boys were unlikely to cast slurs on her in her brothers presence surely they all climbed back into the cart and sorrel clucking backed his horse and turned the vehicle around he slapped the reins against the horses rump and it obligingly broke into a trot west blue fell behind three days there was no particular reason that simple phrase should make his stomach feel as though it wanted to flip over dag thought but three days after the noon dinner dag dismissed the obscurities of farmer customs from his mind for a time in favor of his own he and fawn went out together on a gathering trip around the farm what are we looking for really she asked him as he led off first toward the old barn below the house theres no set recipe spinnable things with some personal meaning to help catch our grounds upon a persons own hair is always good but mines not long enough to use pure and a few more hooks never hurt the horsehair will give length and strength i figure its often used and not just for wedding cords in the cool shade of the barn fawn culled two collections of long sturdy hairs from the tails and manes of grace and copperhead dag hung on the stall partition eyes halfshut gently reminding copperhead of their agreement that the gelding would treat fawn with the tender concern of a mare for her foal or become wolfbait horses did not reason by consequences so much as by associations and the rangy chestnut had fewer wits than many but by dint of repeated groundwork dag had at length put this idea across copperhead nickered and nuzzled and lipped at fawn endured having hairs pulled out while scarcely flinching ate apple slices from her hand without nipping and eyed dag warily there were no water lilies to be had on the bluefield acres and dag was uncertain that their stems would yield up flax the way the ones at hickory lake did anyway but to his delight they discovered a cattailcrowded drainage ditch up beyond the high fields that sheltered some redwinged blackbird nests he held fawns shoes on his hook and murmured encouragement grinning at her expression of revulsion and determination as she waded out in the muck and gathered some goodly handfuls of both cattail fluff and feathers after that they tramped all around the margins and crossed and recrossed the fallow fields it was not the season for milkweed silk as the redolent flowers were just blooming and the stems were useless but at length they discovered a few dried brown sticks lingering from last fall whose pods hadnt broken open and dag pronounced the catch sufficient they took it all back to natties weaving room where fawn stripped feathers and picked out milkweed seeds and nattie set out her own chosen mix of fibers linen for strength a bit of precious purchased cotton brought from south of the grace river for softness and something she called catch nettle flax for shine all dyed dark with walnut stain fawn bit her lip and undertook the hair trimming taking special care with dag not so much to avoid stabbing him with the scissors he eventually realized as to be sure his head wouldnt look like a scarecrows on the day after tomorrow she set up a small mirror to cautiously clip out some of her own curly strands dag sat quietly enjoying watching her contort counting the hours backward to when theyd last been able to lie together and forward to the next chance three days under her aunts close supervision fawn then mixed the ingredients in two baskets until nattie plunging her arms in and feeling while frowning judiciously in a way that had fawn holding her breath pronounced them ready for the next step shaping such a disparate mass of fibers into the long rolls for spinning could only be done by the gentlest carding and a lot of handwork and even fawns willing fingers looked to be tiring by the end they went on to the spinning itself after supper the male members of the family had some dim idea that the three were up to some outlandish lakewalker project to please dag but they were well trained not to intrude upon natties domain and dag doubted they suspected magic so subtle and invisible a one as this was they went off about their own usual pursuits tril drifted in and out from labors in the kitchen watching but saying little after some debate it was decided fawn would be the spinner after all she was certain nattie would do it better but dag was certain that the more making she put into the task with her own hands the better the faint chance of tangling her ground in the cord would be she chose to spin on the wheel a device dag had never seen in operation before coming here saying she was better at it than at the drop spindle once shed finally settled and gathered up her materials and her confidence the task went much more quickly than dag had expected at length she triumphantly handed over for natties inspection two hanks of sturdy if rather hirsute twoply thread something between yarn and string in texture nattie could have spun it smoother and more even fawn sighed mm said nattie feeling the bundles she didnt disagree but she did say thisll do shall we go on now fawn asked eagerly full night had fallen and they had been working by candlelight for the past hour well be more rested in the morning said dag im all right ill be more rested in the morning spark have some pity on an old patroller eh oh thats right groundwork drains you pretty dry she added after a cautious moment will this be as bad as the bowl no this is a lot more natural besides ive done this before well kauneos mother actually did the spinning that time because neither of us had the skill each of us had to do our own braiding though to catch our grounds fawn sighed im never going to be able to sleep tonight in fact she did although not before dag had heard through the closed door nattie telling her to settle it was worse than sleeping with a bedbug fawns soft giggle was his last memory of the night they met again in the weaving room right after breakfast as soon as the rest of the family had cleared off this time dag closed the door firmly theyd set up a backless bench filched from the porch so that fawn could sit astride it with dag directly behind her nattie took a seat in a chair just beyond fawns knee listening with her head cocked her weak groundsense trying to strain beyond its normal limit of the reach of her skin dag watched while fawn practiced on some spare string it was a fourstranded braiding that produced an extremely strong cord a pattern called by lakewalkers mintstem for its square cross section and by farmers dag was bemused to learn the same well start with my cord he told her the main thing is once i catch my ground in the braiding dont stop or the groundcasting will break and well have to undo it all and start again from the beginning which actually we can do right enough but its a bit frustrating to get almost to the end and then sneeze she nodded earnestly and finished setting up knotting the four strands to a simple nail driven into the bench in front of her she spread out the woundup balls that kept the loose ends under control gulped and said all right tell me when to start dag straightened and slipped his right arm from its sling scooting up behind her close enough to touch kissing her ear for encouragement and to make her smile succeeding perhaps in the first but not the second he looked over her head and brought both arms around and over hers letting his hand and hook touch first the fiber then her fingers then hover over her hands his ground flowing out through his right hand caught at once in the thick threads good got it anchored begin her nimble hands began to pull flip twist repeat the tug as the thin stream from his ground threaded beneath her touch was palpable to him and he recalled anew how very strange it had felt the first time in a quiet tent in wooded luthlia it was still very strange if not unpleasant the room became exceedingly still and he thought he could almost mark the shift of the light and shadows beyond the windows as the morning sun crept up the eastern sky his right arm was shaking and his shoulders aching by the time she had produced a bit over two feet of cord good he whispered in her ear enough tie off she nodded tied the locking end knot and held the strands tight nattie ready nattie leaned over with the scissors and guided by fawns touch cut below the knot dag felt the snapback in his ground and controlled a gasp fawn straightened and jumped up from the bench anxiously she turned and held out the cord to dag he nodded for her to run it through his fingertips below the increasingly grubby splint wrappings the sensation was bizarre like looking at a bit of himself in a distorted mirror but the anchoring was sound and sweet good done we did it spark aunt nattie fawn smiled like a burst of sunlight and pressed the cord into her aunts hands nattie fingered it and smiled too my word yes even i can feel that takes me back it does well done child and the next she said eagerly catch your breath dag advised walk around shake out the kinks the next will be a bit trickier the next might well be impossible he admitted bleakly to himself but he wasnt going to tell spark that confidence mattered in these subtle things oh yes your poor shoulders must hurt after all that she exclaimed and ran around to climb up on the bench behind him and knead them with her small strong hands an exercise he could not bring himself to object to although he did manage not to fall forward onto the bench and melt he remembered what else those hands could do then tried not to he would need his concentration two days now thats enough rest your fingers he heroically choked out after a bit he stood up and walked around the room himself wondering what else he could do or should do or hadnt done to make the next and most critical task succeed he was about to step into the unaccustomed and worrisome territory of things hed never done beforeof things no one had ever done before to his knowledge not even in ballads they sat on the bench again and fawn secured the four strands of her own string on the nail ready when you are dag lowered his face and breathed the scent of her hair trying to calm himself he ran his stiff hand and hook gently down and up her arms a couple of times trying to pick up some fragment some opening on the ground he could sense swirling so alive beneath her skin wait there was something coming begin her hands started moving after only about three turns he said wait no stop that isnt your ground thats mine again sorry sorry she blew out her breath straightened her back wriggled and undid her work back to the beginning dag sat for a moment with his head bent eyes closed his mind picked at the uncomfortable memory of the lefthanded groundwork hed done on the bowl two nights ago the break in his right arm did weaken his very dominant ground on that side maybe the left now tried to compensate for the right as the right had long done for the maimed left this time he concentrated hard on trying to snag fawns ground from her left hand he stroked the back of her hand with his hook pinched with ghostly fingers that were not there just there he had something fastened in fragile and fine and it wasnt him this time go again her hands began flying they were a dozen turns into the braid when he felt the delicate link snap stop he sighed its gone again ngh fawn cried in frustration sh now we almost had something there she unknotted and hitched her shoulders and rubbed the back of her head against his chest he could almost feel her scowl although from this angle of view he could only see her hair and nose and then he could feel it when her scowl turned thoughtful what he said you said you said people put their hair in the cords because it was once part of their ground and so it was easy to pick up again to hitch on to because it was once part of their body right your living body makes its ground right you also once said one night when i was asking you all about ground that peoples blood stays alive for a little while even after it leaves their bodies right what are you he began uneasily but was cut off when she abruptly seized his hook hand and drew it around close in front of her he felt pressure and a jerk then another through his arm harness wait stop spark what are you he leaned forward and saw to his horror that shed gouged open the pads of both of her index fingers on the not especially sharp point of the hook she squeezed each hand with the other in turn to make the blood drip and took up the strands again try again she said in an utterly determined little growl come on quick before the bleeding stops try he could not spurn a demand so astonishing with a fierceness that almost matched hers he ran his hands real and ghostly down her arms once more this time her ground fairly leaped out into the bloodsmeared string anchoring firmly go he whispered and her hands began to twist and flip and pull you are scaring the piss out of me spark but its working dont stop she nodded and didnt stop she finished her cord of about the length of the one theyd done for him just about the time her fingers ceased bleeding nattie im ready for you nattie leaned in and snipped below the end knot dag felt it as fawns ground snapped back the way his had perfect he assured her absent gods its fine was it she twisted around to look up at him her face tight i couldnt feel anything i couldnt feel anything any of the times really it was you were he groped for the right words that was smart spark that was beyond smart that was brilliant the tightness turned to a blaze of glory shining in her eyes really i would not have made that mental leap well of course you wouldnt have she sniffed youd have gone all protective or tried to argue with me he gave her a hug and a shake and felt a strange new sympathy for her parents and their mixed reaction to her homecoming that first night youre probably right i am certainly right she gave a more sparklike giggle he sat back releasing her and slipped his aching splinted arm back into its sling for pitys sake go wash your fingers at once with strong soap and plenty of it you dont know where that hook has been everywhere hasnt it she shot a merry grin over her shoulder stroked her cord once more and danced out to the kitchen nattie leaned over and picked up the new cord from the bench running it thoughtfully through her fingers i didnt know she was going to do that dag apologized weakly you never do with her nattie said shell be keeping you alert i expect patroller maybe more than you bargained for funny thing is you think you know what youre doing i used to he sighed though that may have been because i was only doing the same things over and over spark returned from the kitchen towing her mother to see their finished work dag trusted fawn wouldnt mention the last wrinkle about the blood tril and nattie handed the cords back and forth tril gave one a tug nodding thoughtfully at its strength she squared her shoulders and dug in her apron pocket nattie do you remember that necklace mama had with the six real gold beads one for every child that broke that time the cart went over in the snow and she never found all the bits and never had it fixed oh yes said her sister the piece came to me and i never did anything with it either its been in the back of a drawer for years and years i thought you might could use the beads to finish off the end knots of these cords of fawns fawn excited looked into her mothers palm and picked up one of the four oblong gold beads peering through the hole nattie can we dag would it work all right i think it would be a fine gift dag said taking one that fawn pressed upon him to examine actually he wasnt altogether certain it wasnt a prayer he glanced at tril who gave him a short nearly expressionless nod very beautiful they would look really good against that dark braid and make the ends hang better too id be honored to accept beads and cords were put into natties clever hands and she made short work of affixing the old gold to the ends trimming the last bit of cord below the anchoring knots into neat fringes when she finished the two lengthsone a little darker one with a coppery glintlay glimmering in her lap like live things which they were in a sense thatll look well when fawn goes up to your country said tril theyll know were were respectable folks dont you think patroller yes he said hearing the plea in her voice and hoping he didnt lie good she nodded again nattie took charge of the cords putting them away until the day after tomorrow when she undertook to bind them about the unlikely pair tangled and blessed the cords would complete the ground link if both hearts willed it sign and signifier of a valid union that any lakewalker with groundsense must witness faithfully made dag was certain he would remember this hour of making as long as he lived as long as he wore the cord curled around his arm and how spark had poured her hearts blood so furiously into it and if her true heart stops ill know chapter one day was dags first thought upon awakening the next morning hed expected this weddingeve day to be one of quiet preparation for the small family ceremony with perhaps time to meditate with proper seriousness on the step he was about to takealso to calm the tiny voice screeching in the back of his mind what are you doing how did you end up here this wasnt in your plans do you have any idea whats going to happen when you get home to the last question a simple no seemed to dag a sufficient answer more complicated questions such as how are you going to protect spark when you cant even protect yourself or what about halfblood children he tried to ignore although the last thought led directly to would they be sawedoff and fiery and kept on going from there but after breakfast there descended upon the bluefield farm not the one or two neighbor girlfriends of fawns hed been led dimly to expect but two girlfriends five of their sisters four sistersinlaw a few mutual cousins and an indeterminate number of mothers and grandmothers they were like a plague of locusts in reverse bringing quantities of food with hands that produced and put in order instead of consuming and laying waste they talked they laughed they sang theyor at least the younger onesgiggled and they filled the house to bursting the male bluefields promptly fled to the far corners of the farm dag fascinated lingered for a time being introduced to the young women wasnt too bad even though he mainly garnered either intimidated silences or nervous titters in return the bolder ones however observing fawns aid to him wanted to try their hands at it too and he was shortly ducking being fed and watered like some strange new pet fattened for the slaughter he tried not to think an even more giggly troop albeit led by a sterner matron along with fawn who refused to explain anything cornered him with strings and proceeded to measure various parts of his bodyhappily for his shredding equanimity not that oneand floated away again in gales of laughter natties weaving room ordinarily a quiet refuge was jammed and the kitchen was not only crowded but intolerably overheated from the busy hearth by noon dag followed the men into selfimposed exile although he lurked close enough to listen to the singing floating out through the open windows with all the males gone some of the songs grew unsurprisingly rowdy this was to be a wedding party after all he was glad fawn was not to be deprived of these flourishes due to her strange choice of partner the female help left before supper although with plans to return again in the morning for the final push but it wasnt till afterward that dag found his thinking time he settled by himself on the front porch dangling his legs over the edge and watching the quiet river valley turn from goldgreen to muted gray as the sun set in the eaves of the old barn the soft tawny mourning doves called in their soft tawny voices it was dags favorite view on the whole farm and he thought whoever had originally sited this house must have shared the pleasure he felt strangely unanchored all his old certainties falling behind and no new ones to replace them except for spark and she made an unlikely fixed point in his spinning world because she moved so fast he feared hed miss her if he blinked he caught sight of rush walking down the lane in the gathering shadows after the bowl episode the twins had stopped aiming barbs at him but only because they now avoided talking to him at all if he couldnt make friends perhaps intimidation would do instead whit by contrast had become rather fascinated with dag following him about as though afraid hed miss another magic show dag tried treating him as a particularly feckless young patroller which seemed to work if only his arm hadnt been broken he might have offered to teach whit archery which would have made a good way to move them along amiably as it was his idle comment about it made whit say showing willing to a degree that surprised him when you come back maybe which made him wonder were they ever coming back half of dags original intent for the marriage proposal had been to repair fawns bridges here in case of some dire needin case of his death bluntly a lakewalker would be trying to join his brides family to fit in as a new tentbrother and the family in turn would expect to receive him as one farmer kin took in new sisters not new brothers and they werent trained up to the reverse it had taken dag some time to realize that the only members of the family he really needed to please in order to carry off fawn were the elders and they had quite expected her to be carried off sometime by someone in any case dag was a stretch of custom but not a reversal the questions this begged for dags own homecoming niggled hard the more so since fawn could not anticipate most of them and here came rush again walking back up the lane he spied dag on the porch and angled toward him between the house and the old barn a grassy area the sheep were sometimes turned out to crop what the sheep refused to eat was scythed once a year to keep the space from turning back to woods and blocking the view rush dag realized as he approached was tense and dag considered opening his groundsense wider unpleasant as it was likely to prove hey patroller said rush fawn wants you down by the road at the end of the lane dag blinked once slowly to cover the fact that hed just snapped open his groundsense to its full range fawn he determined first was not down by the end of the lane but nearly out of his perceptions to the west up over the ridge not alonewith reedshe seemed not to be in any special distress however so why was rush lying ah the woods below were not unpeopled concealed among the trees near the road were the smudges of four horses standing stilltied four persons accompanied them three blurred grounds he did not know but the fourth he recognized as stupid sunny was it so wild a guess to think that the other three were also husky young farm boys dag thought not did she say why dag asked to buy a moment more to think rush took a couple of breaths to invent an answer apparently having expected dag to leap up without delay some wedding thing or other he replied she didnt say but she wants you right now dag scratched his temple gently with his hook glad that he had mostly stuck to the deeply ingrained habit of not discussing lakewalker abilities with anyone here fawn and nattie excepted he was now one move ahead in this game he tried to figure how not to squander that advantage because he suspected it was the only one he had it would be amusing to just sit here and watch rush dig himself deeper concocting more desperate reasons for dag to walk down the hill into what was shaping up to be a neat little ambush but that would leave the whole pack of them running around loose all night to evolve other plans as little as dag wanted to deal with this tonight still less did he want to deal with it in the morning and most especially did he not want it to impinge on spark in any way his brotherly enemies it seemed were looking after that angle for him just now so he let his groundsense play lightly over the lower woods which he had crossed several times on foot in the past days looking for yes just exactly that a flush not of excitement but of that very peculiar calm that came over him when facing a bandit camp or a malice lair jerked his mind up to another level targets eh he knew what to do with targets but would targets know what to do with him his lips drew back if not he would teach them um dag said rush uncertainly he wasnt wearing his war knife that was fine he had no hand to wield it he stood up and shook out his left arm sure rush where did you say again down by the road said rush both relieved and the reverse absent gods but the boy was a poor liar on the whole that was a point in his favor you coming with me rush in a minute you go along i have to get something in the house all right said dag amiably and trod off down the hill to the lane he descended it for a few hundred paces then cut over to the wooded hillside plotting his routes he needed to surprise his ambushers on the correct side for his purpose he wondered how fast they could run his legs were long theirs were young best not to cut it too close mari would beat me for trying this fool stunt it was an oddly comforting thought familiar dag ghosted down the hill at an angle until he was about fifteen feet behind the four young men hiding in the shadows of the trees and keeping watch on the lane looks like sunny took my advice it was still early twilight dags groundsense would give him considerable advantage in the dark but he wanted his quarry to be able to see him evening boys he said looking for me they jumped and whirled sunnys gold head was bright even in the shadows the others were more nondescript one stout one as muscular as sunny and one skinny young enough to be foolish and big enough to be dangerous it was an unpleasant combination three were armed with cudgels for which dag had a new respect sunny had both a stick and a big hunting knife the latter still in the sheath at his belt for now sunny got his breath back and growled hello patroller let me tell you how its going to be dag tilted his head as if in curiosity youre not wanted here in a few minutes rush is going to bring down your horse and your gear and youre going to get on and ride north and you dont come back amazing dag marveled how do you figure youre going to make that happen son if you dont you get the beating of your life and well tie you on your horse and youll still ride north only without your teeth sunnys grin showed white in the shadows to emphasize this threat his friends shifted a little too tense and worried to quite share the amusement although one tried a huffy sort of laugh to show support not to find fault but i see a few problems with your plan first would be a notable absence of horse i spect rush is going to have a trifle of difficulty handling copperhead dag let his groundsense spread briefly as far as the old barn rushs troubles were indeed beginning he decided he did not have the attention to spare on managing his horse at this distance and withdrew the link the entire family had been told at the dinner table in front of sorrel and tril to leave copperhead alone unless dag was there rush was on his own dag tried not to smile too much patroller fawn can handle your horse indeed she can but you know you sent rush unfortunate that then you can start walking after a beating you have a high opinion of my stamina he let his voice go softer think the four of you can take me they glanced at his sling at his handless left arm at each other dag was flattered that they didnt all burst into laughter at this point he thought they should have but he wasnt about to say so the stout one in fact looked just a shade ashamed sunny granted was more guarded that hunting knife was a new ornament just to make it clear i decline your invitation to the road i dont care to miss my wedding now it does look as if you have the numbers on your side are you prepared to kill me tonight how many of you are ready to die to make that happen have you thought how your parents and families will feel about it tomorrow how the survivors are going to explain to them what happened killing gets a lot messier than youd think and the mess doesnt end with burying the corpses i speak from long experience he had to stop this by their uncertain expressions his words were getting through to at least two of them and that hadnt exactly been his intent when hed started babbling here run and chase that was the game plan fortunately sunny and the other muscular one were starting to try to stalk him moving apart and around to get into position for a rush to encourage them he started to back up and called no wonder fawn calls you stupid sunny sunnys head jerked up from the side one of his friends muffled a guffaw sunny shot a glare at him and snapped to dag fawns a slut but you know that dont you patroller right thats done it youll have to catch me first boys if youre as slowfooted as you are slowwitted i shouldnt have a problem sunny lunged his stick whistling through the air dag was not there dag stretched his legs driving up the hill dodging around trees boots slipping on old leaves and damp limestone lumps and greenblack rolling round hickory husks by the thump and pained grunt at least one of his pursuers was finding the footing equally foul he didnt actually want to lose the boys in the woods but he wanted a good head start by the time he arrived here ah hm his chosen tree turned out to be a shagbark hickory with a trunk a bit less than a foot and a half wide and no side branches for twenty feet straight up this was a mixed blessing it would certainly be a challenge for the boys to follow him up it if he could get up it he pulled his right arm from the sling and let it swing out of his way reached up with his left jammed in his hook clapped his knees around the trunk and began shinnying yanked the hook out again reached jammed shinnied again again he was about fifteen feet in the air when the pursuit arrived winded and swearing and waving their cudgels it occurred to him in a meditative sort of way as he dragged his body skyward that even without the unpleasant searing feeling in his left shoulder muscles he was putting an awful lot of trust in a small wooden bolt and some stitching designed to pull out the rough bark strips crackled and split beneath his gripping knees small bits raining down in an aromatic shower if his hook gave way and he slid down the bark would have an interesting serrated effect between his legs too he made it to the first sturdy side branch put an arm and a leg over winched himself up and stood he searched for his objective absent gods another fifteen feet to go up then a dry branch gave way under one foot which was partly useful for he was then able to kick it free and drop it on the upturned face of the skinny fellow who was being urged up the tree in dags wake by his friends he yelped and fell back discouraged for a moment dag didnt need too many more moments to his delight a rock whistled up past him then another ow he cried realistically to lure more of them a couple more missiles rose and fell followed by a meaty clunk and an entirely authentic ow from below dag made sure they could hear his evil laugh even though he was wheezing like a smithys bellows by now almost to goal absent gods the blighted thing was well out on that side branch he extended himself gripping the branch he was halflying across under his right armpit feet sliding along the wobbly bough below it wishing for almost the first time in his life for more height and reach overbalance at this elevation and he could swiftly prove himself stupider than stupid sunny a little more a little more get his hook around that attachment and a good yank dag clung hard as the rough gray paperwasp nest the size of a watermelon parted from the branch and began its thirtyfive footdrop most of the nests residents were home for the evening his groundsense told him settling down for the night wake up youre under attack his feeble effort to stir up the wasps with his ground seemed redundant when the plummeting object hit the dirt and ruptured with a loud and satisfying thwack followed by a deep angry whine he could hear all the way up here the first screams were a deal more satisfying though he cuddled back against the trunk of the tree feet braced on some less flexible side branches gasping for breath and applying himself to a few refinements persuading the furious wasps to advance up trouser legs and down collars proved not as difficult as hed feared although he could not simply bounce them like mosquitoes and they were much less tractable than fireflies a matter of practice dag decided he set to it with a will ah ah theyre in my hair theyre in my hair theyre stinging meee came a wail from below voice too highpitched to identify augh my ears ow my hands get them off get them off run for the river sunny the shuffling sounds of retreat filtered up through the leaves the pellmell flight wouldnt help them much for dag made sure they left under full guard even without groundsense though he could tell when his trouserexplorers made it all the way to target by the earsplitting shrieks that went up and up until breath was gone limp for the river sunny dag muttered savagely as the frantic cries trailed away to the east then came the matter of getting down dag took it slowly at least till the last ten feet when his hook slipped free and scored a long slash down the trunk in the wake of the flying bark bits from under his knees but he did manage to land on his feet and avoid banging his splint very much on anything on the way he staggered upright gasping it was easier when i could just gut them no not really he sighed and did his best to tidy himself up a trifle brushing bark and sticks and wide papery leaves from his clothing and hair with the back of his hook and gratefully slipping his throbbing right arm back into its sling a few stray wasps buzzed near in investigative menace he sent them off after their nest mates and slithered back down the slope to where the horses were tied he picked apart their ties and did his best to loop up their reins so they wouldnt step on them led them out onto the road and pointed them south trying to plant horsey suggestions about barns and grain and home into their limited minds they would either find their way or sunny and his friends could have a fine time over the next few days looking for them once the boys could get their swollen selves out of bed that is a couple of the wouldbe bullies including sunnydag had made quite sure of sunny on that scorewould definitely not be wishing to ride home tonight or for many nights to come as he was wearily climbing back up the lane he met sorrel hastening down sorrel gripped a pitchfork and looked thoroughly alarmed what in thunder was that awful screeching patroller he demanded some fool young fellows trespassing in your woods thought it would be a grand idea to chuck rocks at a wasp nest it didnt work out the way theyd pictured sorrel snorted in halfamused vexation the tension draining out of his body then paused really i think that would be the best story all around yes sorrel gave a little growl that reminded dag suddenly of fawn plain enough theres more to it have it in hand do you he turned again to walk up the lane side by side with dag that part yes dag extended his groundsense again this time toward the old barn his future brotherinlaw was still alive though his ground was decidedly agitated at the moment theres another part which i think is your place and not mine to deal with it was not one patrol leaders job to correct another patrol leaders people on the other hand teaming up could sometimes be remarkably effective but i think we might get forward faster if youd be willing to take some direction from me about what in this case reed and rush sorrel muttered something about ready to knock their fool heads together then added what about them i think we ought to let rush tell us then see huh said sorrel dubiously but he followed as dag turned aside from the lane at the old barn the sliding door onto the lane was open and a soft yellow light spilled out from an oil lantern hung on a nail in a rafter grace in a box stall by the door snorted uneasily as they entered the packeddirt aisle smelled not unpleasantly of horses and straw and manure and dove droppings and dry rot from copperheads box sounded an angry squeal dag held out a restraining hand as sorrel started to surge forward wait dag mouthed it was hard for dag not to laugh out loud as the scene revealed itself although the sight of half his gear strewn across the stall floor being well trampled by copperhead did quite a lot to help him keep a straight face on the far wall of the stall some wooden slats were nailed to make a crude manger and above it a square was cut in the ceiling to allow hay to be tossed down directly from the loft above although the hole was big enough to stuff down an armload of hay it wasnt quite big enough for rushs broad shoulders to make the reverse trip at the moment having scrambled off the top of the manger as a partial ladder rush had one leg and both arms awkwardly jammed through the hole and was attempting to twist the rest of his body out of range of copperheads snapping yellow teeth copperhead ears flat back and neck snaking squealed and snapped again apparently for the pure evil pleasure of watching rush squirm harder patroller rush cried as he saw them come up to the stall partition help me call off your horse sorrel shot dag a worried look dag returned a small headshake and draped his arms over the partition leaning comfortably now rush said dag in a conversational voice i distinctly remember telling you and your brothers that copperhead was a warhorse and to leave him alone do you remember that sorrel yes i do patroller said sorrel matching his tone also resting his elbows on the boards i know you magic him in some way get him off me well well have to see about that now what im mightily curious about is just how you happened to be in his stall without my leave but with my saddlebags and bedroll and all my gear which i had left in aunt natties weaving room i think your pa would like to hear that story too and then dag fell silent the silence stretched rush made a tentative move to swing down copperhead excited stamped and snapped and made a most peculiar noise halfway between whipsaw menace and a horselaugh dag thought rush swung up again hastily your brute of a horse savaged me rush complained his shirt was ripped on one shoulder and some blood leaked through but it was clear to dags eye by the way rush moved that there was nothing broken now now said dag in a mocksoothing tone that was just a love bite that was if copperd really savaged you youd be over there and your arm would be over here speaking from experience and all rushs eyes widened as it dawned on him that if hed wanted sympathy hed gone to the wrong store with the wrong coin dag didnt say anything some more what do you want to know rush finally asked in a surly tone im sure youll think of something dag drawled pa make him let me down sorrel vented an exasperated sigh you know rush ive drawn you and your brother out of wells of your own digging more than once when you were younger because every boys got to survive his share of foolishness but as youre both so fond of telling me youre not youngsters anymore seems to me you got yourself up there you can get yourself down rush looked appalled at this unexpected parental betrayal he started blurting a somewhat garbled account for his predicament involving an imaginary request relayed from fawn dag gave sorrel another small headshake sorrel looked increasingly grim no dag interrupted in a bored voice thats not it think harder rush after a moment he said i should also mention i suppose that sunny sawman and his three strapping friends are now on their way downriver to west blue under escort underwater mostly i dont think theyll be back for some several days how did youi dont know what youre talking about more silence rush added in a smaller voice are they all right theyll live said dag indifferently you can remember to thank me kindly for that later and fell silent again after a couple more false starts rush at last began to fess up it was more or less the story dag expected of alehouse conspiracy and youthful bravado in rushs version reed was the ringleader valiantly horrified at the thought of his only sister marrying a lakewalker corpseeater and thus making him brotherinlaw to one and rushs motivations were lost in a mumble dag wasnt sure whether this was strict truth or blamecasting nor did he greatly care as it was clear enough both boys were in it together they had found a strangely enthusiastic helper in sunny fresh from a summer of stumppulling and happy to show off his muscle unsurprisingly it appeared sunny had not seen fit to mention to the twins his prior encounter with dag dag chose not to either sorrel looked grimmer and grimmer rush at last stuttered to a halt a cool silence fell in the warm barn rush began to sag down copperhead lunged again rush tightened up once more clinging like a possum to a branch dag could see that his arms were shaking now rush said dag im going to tell you how its going to be i am actually prepared to forgive and forget your brotherly plan to beat me crippled or dead and buried in your pas woods on the night before my wedding the fact that you also seriously endangered the lives of your friendsbecause i would not facing that death have held back in defending myselfi leave to your pa to take up with you two ill even forgive your lies to me dags voice dropped to a deadly register that made sorrel glance aside in alarm what i do not forgive is the malice of your lies to fawn youd planned for her to wake up joyful on her wedding morning and then tell her id scunnered out in the night make her believe herself shamed and betrayed humiliate her before her friends and kin set her to weepingalthough i think her real response might have surprised you he glanced aside you like that picture sorrel no good dag took a long breath whatever reasons your parents tolerated your torment of your sister in the past it stops tomorrow you claim reed was afraid of me he wasnt near afraid enough either of you so much as look crosseyed at fawn tomorrow or anytime thereafter i will give you reason to regret it every day for the rest of your lives you hear me rush look at me dag hadnt used that voice since he was a company captain he was pleased to note it still worked rush nearly fell from his perch copperhead shied even sorrel stepped backward dag hissed you hear me rush nodded frantically all right i will halter copperhead and you will climb down from there then you will pick up every bit of my gear and put it back where you found it whats broken you and your brother can fix whats been rolled through the manure you can scrubwhich will keep you two out of further mischief for the rest of the evening i thinkwhat cant be fixed youll replace what cant be replaced i leave you to work out with your pa you heard the patroller rush said sorrel in a deeply paternal snarl really it was almost as good as the companycaptain voice dag extended his ground to his horse a familiar reach long practiced hed been saddled with this chestnut idiot for about eight years now disappointed at the loss of his toy copperhead lowered his head to the stall floor and began lipping straw pretending that it all never happened dag thought he had a lot in common with rush that way you can get down said dag he isnt haltered said rush nervously yes he is said dag now sorrels eyebrows climbed but he didnt say anything cautiously rush climbed down redfaced his eyes wary on copperhead he began collecting dags strewn possessions clothing and saddlebags and ripped bedroll knockedabout saddle and pummeled saddle blanket the adapted bow though kicked into a corner was undamaged dag was glad only the reasonably benign outcome was keeping him from utter fury right nowthat plus not thinking too hard about spark but he had to think about spark now dag said as rush made his way out of the stall with his arms loaded and dag closed the stall door after him rush set the tangled gear down very carefully we come to the other question what of all this would you have me tell fawn the place had been quiet like a barn for a moment it grew quiet like a tomb sorrels face screwed up he said cautiously seems to me shed be near as distressed for the word of this as for the thing itself i mean with respect to reed and rush he added visions of fawn weeping over dags battered corpse evidently presenting themselves to his minds eye as indeed they did to dags rush who had been rather red turned rather white seems that way to me too said dag but you know theres eight people who know the truth about what happened tonight granted four of them will be telling lies when they drag home tonight though i doubt even those will all be the same lies some kind of words going to get around dag let them both dwell on this ugly vision for a little then said im not reeds and rushs linker though i should have been i will not lie to her for them but ill give you this much and no more ill not speak first sorrel took this in almost without expression for a moment clearly thinking through the deeply unpleasant family ramifications then he nodded shortly fair enough patroller dag extended his groundsense briefly for all that the proximity of the two shaken bluefields made it painful he said reed is coming back to the house with fawn now id prefer to leave him to you sorrel send him down here to the barn said sorrel somewhat through his teeth that i will sir dag gave a nod in place of his usual salute thank yousir sorrel nodded back fawn returned to the kitchen with reed in some annoyance with him for dragging her out in the dark she lit a few candle stubs on the mantel to lighten both the room and her mood better still for the latter was the sound of dags long footfalls coming through from the front hall reed who had ducked into natties weaving room for some reason came out with an inexplicable triumphant smile on his face she was about to ask why he was so happy all of a sudden when the look was wiped clean at the sight of dag entering the kitchen fawn bit back yet more irritation with her brother she had better things to do than fuss at reed hugging dag hello was on the top of that list he gave her a quick return embrace with his left arm and turned to reed ah reed your papa wants to see you in the old barn now reed looked at dag as though he were a poisonous snake surprised in some place hed been about to put his hand why he asked in a suspicious voice i believe he and rush have quite a lot to say to you dag tilted his head and gave reed a little smile which had to be one of the least friendly expressions to go by that name fawn had ever seen reeds mouth flattened in return but he didnt argue to fawns relief he took himself off she heard the front door slam behind him fawn pushed back her unruly curls well that was a fools errand where did you two go off to dag asked he dragged me all the way to the back pasture to help rescue a calf stuck in a fence if the brainless thing had got itself in it had got itself out by the time we made it there and then he wanted to walk the fence line while we were out there i didnt mind the walk but i have things to do she stood back and looked dag over he was often not especially tidy but at the moment he looked downright rumpled did you have your quiet think yes i just spent a very enlightening hour useful too i hope oh you i bet you never sat still she brushed at a few stray bits of bark and leaf stuck to his shirt and observed with disfavor a new rip in his trouser knee stained with blood from a scrape walking in the woods i think i swear you been walking so long you dont know how to stop what were you climbing trees just one well that was a fool thing to try with that arm she scolded fondly did you fall down no not quite thats a blessing you be more careful climbing trees indeed i thought i was joking i dont want my bridegroom broken ill have you know i know he smiled glancing around fawn realized that miraculously they were actually alone for a moment he seemed to realize this at the same time for he sat in the big wooden chair by the hearth and pulled her toward him she climbed happily into his lap and raised her face for a kiss the kiss went urgent and they were both out of breath when their lips parted again she said gruffly they wont be able to keep us apart much longer not even with ropes and wild horses he agreed his eyes glinting his smile grew more serious have you decided yet where you want us to be tomorrow night ride or bide she sighed and sat up do you have a partiality he brushed her hair from her forehead with his lips likely because he had a notable reluctance for touching her about the face with his hook it turned into a small trail of kisses along the arches of her eyebrows before he too sat back thoughtfully here would be physically easier we wont get to hickory lake in a day still less in a couple of hours tomorrow evening if we camped youd have to do most everything i dont mind the work she tossed her head there is this we wont just be making love well be making memories its the sort of day you remember all your life when other days fade real question then the only really important one is what memories of this do you want to bear away into your future now there was a voice of experience she thought best listen to it its farmer custom for the couple to go off to their new house sleep under the new roof the party goes on if we stay i swear ill end up washing dishes at midnight which is not what i want to be doing at midnight i have no house for you i dont even have a tent with me itll be a roof of stars if its not a roof of rain it doesnt look like rain this high blue weather this time of year usually holds for three or four days i admit i prefer inn chambers to wheatfields but at least with you theres no mosquitoes i think we might do better than a wheatfield she added more seriously thinking about his words this place is chockfull of memories for me some are good but a lot of them hurt and the hurtful ones have this way of jostling into first place and this housell be full of my family tomorrow night id like to be someplace with no memories at all and no family he ducked his head in understanding thats what well do then her spine straightened besides im marrying a patroller we should go patrollerstyle bedroll under the stars right she grinned and nuzzled his neck and said seductively we could bathe in the river he was looking immensely seduceable eyes crinkling in the way she so loved to see bathing in the river is always good a clean patroller is um unusual she suggested and she also loved the way his chest rumbled under her when he laughed deep down in it like a quiet earthquake a happy patroller he finished firmly we could gather firewood she went on her lips working upward his worked downward he murmured around his kiss big big bonfire scout for rowdy squirrels those squirrels are a right menace he looked down over his nose at her though she didnt see how he could focus his eyes at this distance all three optimistic spark she giggled joyful to see his eyes so alight hed seemed so moody when hed first come in to her aggravation she could hear heavy footsteps coming down the stairs fletch or whit heading this way she sighed and sat up ride then unless we have a barker of a thunderstorm thunder and lightning couldnt keep me in this house one more day she said fervently its time for me to go on do you see he nodded im beginning to farmer girl this is right for you she stole one last kiss before sliding off his lap thinking tomorrow well be buying these kisses fair and square her heart melted in the tenderness of the look he gave her as reluctantly he let her slip out of his arm all storms might be weathered in the safe harbor of that smile chapter fawn flew through the irreducible farm chores the next morning the milking fell to her afterwards waving a stick with resolute vigor she sent the bewildered cows off to pasture at a brisk and unaccustomed trot for practical reasons the rule about the marrying couples not seeing each other before the wedding was put aside till after the family breakfast when aunt rose bluefield arrived to help mama with the food and the house along with fawns closest cousins and girlfriends filly bluefield and ginger roper to start the primping first came proper baths the women went off to the well the men were dispatched to the river fawn had grave doubts about leaving dag to the mercies of her father fletch and whit for such a vulnerable enterprise although at least the twins werent to follow till a long list of dirty chores had been completed filly and ginger dragged her away as she was still yelling strict orders down the hill after the men about not letting dags splints get wet there followed a naked wet silly and sudsy half hour by the well mama brought out her best scented soap for the task once they were back in the bedroom with ginger and filly starting on her hair fawn was relieved to hear footsteps and mens voices through the closed door to the weaving room dag giving some calm instruction to whit filly and ginger did their best from fawns dimly remembered description of what reela had told her to imitate lakewalker wedding braids although fawn was glumly aware that her own hair was too curly and unruly to cooperate the way lakewalkers long locks no doubt did the result was creditable anyhow with the hair drawn up in neat thick ropes from her temples to meet at her crown and from there allowed to spin down loose behind after its own turbulent fashion in the little hand mirror held out at arms length fawns face looked startlingly refined and grownup and she blinked at the strangeness gingers brother had ridden all the way to mirror pond this morning four miles upriver to get the flowers fawn had begged of him three nottoocrumpled white water lilies which ginger now bound into the knot of hair on the crown of her head mama said you could have had all of her roses you wanted filly observed tilting her head to examine the effect these are more lakeish said fawn dag will like them the poor man doesnt have any family or friends here and is pretty much having to borrow everything farmer i know he was pining that he couldnt send down his lakewalker bridegifts till after the wedding theyre supposed to be given beforehand i guess filly said mama wondered if no women of his own people would marry him because of his hand being maimed like that fawn choosing to ignore the implied reflection upon herself said only i shouldnt think so a lot of patrollers seem to get banged up over time anyhow hes a widower ginger said my brother said the twins said his horse talks human to him when theres no one around fawn snorted if no ones around how do they know ginger considering this conceded reluctantly thats a point besides its the twins filly granted thats another she added in regret so i guess they made up that story about him magicking together that glass bowl they broke too um no that ones true fawn admitted mama put it away upstairs for today so it wouldnt risk getting knocked down again a thoughtful silence followed this while filly poked at the curls in back to fluff them and pushed away fawns hands trying to smooth them hes so tall said ginger in a newly speculative tone and youre so short id think hed squash you flatter than a bug plus both his arms bein hurt however are you two going to manage tonight dags very ingenious said fawn firmly filly poked her and giggled how would you know eh ginger snickered someones been samplin i think what were you two doin out on the road together for a month like that fawn tossed her head and sniffed none of your business she couldnt help adding smugly after a moment i will say theres no going back to farmer boys after which won some hoots quickly muted as nattie bustled back in ginger set her a chair by fawns bench and nattie laid out the cloth in which shed wrapped the braided cords shed just delivered dags to him together with the other surprise present did he like his wedding shirt fawn asked a bit wistful because she couldnt very well ask nattie how did it look on him oh yes lovie he was very pleased id say even moved he said hed never had anything so fine in his life and was in a wonder that we got it together so quick and secret though he said he was relieved for the explanation of you girls with your measurin strings yesterday which had evidently been worryin him a bit she unrolled the wrap the dark cord lay coiled in her lap the gold beads firm and richlooking upon the ends where is he wearing his cord where should i wear mine he says folks mostly wear them on the left wrist if theyre righthanded tother way around if not naturally hes put his around his left arm above the harness for now he says when the time comes for the binding he can sit down and you can stand facing him left side to left side and i should be able to do the tyin between you without too much trouble all right said fawn doubtfully trying to picture this she stuck out her left arm and let nattie wrap the cord several times around her wrist like a bracelet tying the ends in a bow knot for now the beads dangled prettily and she twisted her hand to make them bounce on her skin a little of her most secret self was in it dag said bound in with her blood she had to take his word then it was time to get her dress on the good green cotton washed and carefully ironed for this her other good dress being warm wool for winter that dag would remember this dress from that night in glassforge when he had so gently and urgently removed it unwrapping her like a gift must be a secret between them but she hoped he would find it a heartening sight ginger and filly together lowered the fabric carefully over her head so as not to muss her hair or crush the lilies a knock sounded at the door from someone who did not wait for permission to enter whit who looked at fawn and blinked he opened his mouth as if to fire off one of his usual quipinsults then appeared to think better of it and just smiled uneasily dag says what about the weapons he recited revealing himself as a messenger sent he seems to want to put them all on he means all of them at once he says its to show off what a patroller is bringing to his brides tent fletch says no one wears weapons to a wedding it just aint done papa says he dont know what should be done so dag says ask spark and hell abide fawn started to answer yes its his wedding too he should have some of his own customs then instead said more cautiously just how many weapons are we talking about here well theres that great pigsticker that he calls his war knife for starters then theres one he slips down in his boot and another he straps on his thigh sometimes evidently what he wants with three knives when he only has one hand i dont know then theres that funny bow of his and the quiver of arrows which also has some little knives stuck in it he seemed a bit put out that he didnt have a sword by himseems theres one he inherited from his pa back at his camp and some ash spear or another for fighting from horseback which he also doesnt have here fortunately ginger and filly listened to this lengthening catalog with their faces screwing up whit nodding silent agreement at them finished youd think the man would clank when he walked you wouldnt want a patroller to fall into water over his head on his way to his wedding ill say his own brows rose in gruesome enthusiasm you suppose hes killed anybody with that arsenal spect he must have sometime or another thats a right sobering collection of scars he has i saw when we were down washing up though i suppose hes had a long time to accumulate em he added after another contemplative moment do you think hes getting nervous bout the wedding he dont hardly show it but with him how would you tell with whit as a helper it was a wonder dag wasnt frenzied by now fawn thought tartly tell himfawns tongue hovered between yes and no remembering just what all she had seen dag kill with those weaponstell him just the war knife in case it was nerves and the weapons a consolation tell him it can stand for the rest of them all right well know all right whit did not take himself off at once but stood scratching his head did the shirt fit him good fawn asked oh yeah i guess you guess didnt you look agh useless to ask you i suppose he liked it fine kept touchin it with his fingertips peekin out of those bandages anyhow like he liked the feel but what i want explained isyou know i had to help him button and unbutton his trousers so how in the green world has he been managing them for the past week cause i havent never seen him going around undone and i dont care how much of a sorcerer he is he has to have been doin the necessary some time whit said fawn go away ginger and filly thinking this through looked at fawns flushing face and began to giggle like steam kettles because whit never one to take a hint forged on i know it wasnt me or fletch or pa and it couldnt have been the twins who didnt warm to him a bit suppose it could have been nattie but really i think it must have been you and howow he ended in a yelp as nattie smacked him firmly and accurately across the knees with her cane whit if you dont go find yourself a chore ill find you one she told him dont you go embarrassin fawns patroller with all your supposing or youll have me to answer to and i will be here tomorrow whit daunted at last took himself out saying placatingly ill say just the knife right outside fawn could hear the sounds of hoofbeats and creaking carts coming up the lane and calls of greeting more folks arriving it felt very peculiar to sit still in this room waiting instead of being out bustling around doing mama came in wiping her hands on a towel to say shep sower and his wife just got here they were the last the suns as close to noon as makes no never mind we could start most any time is dag ready is he all right hes clean and dressed neat and plain he looks very calm and above it all except that hes had whit switch out his wooden hand for his hook and back again twice now fawn considered this which did he end up with hook last i seen hm so did that mean he was getting more relaxed to let himself be seen so by strangers or less to have the most useful tool and maybeweapon ready as it were to hand well itll be over soon i didnt mean to put him through such an ordeal when i agreed to stop back here mama nodded to fawns cousins you girls give us a minute nattie rose to her feet endorsing this come along chickies give the bride a breather with her mama she shepherded fawns helpers out to her weaving room and closed the door quietly behind them mama said in a few minutes youll be a married woman her voice was stretched somewhere between anxious and bewildered sooner than i expected well i never expected anything like this we always meant to do right by you for your wedding this is all so quick weve done more preparing for fletch she frowned at this felt injustice im glad its no more this is making me nervous enough you sure about this fawn today no all my tomorrows yes natties kept your confidences but you know if you want to change your mind we can stop this right now whatever trouble you think youre in we could manage it somehow mama weve had this conversation twice im not pregnant really and truly there are other kinds of troubles for girls thats the only one folks seem to care about she sighed so how many out there are saying i must be for you to let this go forward a few mama admitted a bunch ill bet fawn growled well timell prove em wrong and i hope youll make them eat their words when it does cause i wont be here to mama went around behind her and fussed with her hair which needed nothing i admit dag seems a fine fellow no ill go farther a good man but what about his kin even he doesnt vouch for your welcome where youre going what if they treat you bad ill feel right at home fawn bit down on that one before it escaped ill deal i dealt with bandits and mudmen and blight bogles i can deal with relatives as long as theyre not my relatives is this sensible if folks were sensible would anyone ever get married mama snorted i suppose not she added in a lower voice but if you start down a road you cant see the end of theres a chance youll find some dark things along it about to defend her choice for the hundredth time fawn paused and said simply thats true she stood up but its my road our road i cant stand still and keep breathin im ready she kissed her mama on the cheek lets go mama got in one last inarguable maternal sigh but followed fawn out they collected nattie and ginger and filly along the way mama made a quick circuit of the kitchen finally set aside her towel straightened her dress and led the way into the parlor the parlor was jammed the crowd spilling over into the hall papas brother uncle hawk bluefield and aunt rose and their son still at home uncle and aunt roper and their two youngest boys including the successful waterlily finder shep sower and his cheery wife always up for a free feed fletch and clover and clovers folks and sisters and the twins inexplicably well behaved and whit and papa and dag a head above everyone but still looking very surrounded the white shirt fit him well there hadnt been time for smocking or embroidery but nattie and aunt roper had come up with some dark green piping to set off the collar and cuffs and button placket the sleeves were made generous enough to fit over his splints and over his arm harness on the other side with second buttons set over to tighten the cuffs later there had been just enough of the shell buttons left to do the job fawn had whisked his sling away from him yesterday long enough to wash and iron it so it didnt look so grubby even though it was growing a bit tattered he was wearing the tan trousers with fewer old stains and mends also forcibly washed yesterday his worn knife sheath riding on his left hip looked so much a part of him as to be almost unnoticeable despite its wicked size a bit of spontaneous applause broke out when fawn appeared which made her blush and then dag wasnt looking at anything else but her and it all made sense again she went and stood beside him his right arm twitched in its sling as though he desperately wanted to hold her hand but could not fawn settled for sliding her foot and hip over so that they touched along the side a reassuring pressure the sense of strain in the room of everyone trying to pretend this was all right and be nice for fawns sake almost made her want them all to revert back to their normal relaxed horribleness but not quite shep sower stepped forth smiled cleared his throat and called them all to attention with a few brief practiced words to fawns relief he glanced at dag and skipped over his usual dire wedding jokes which everyone else here had likely heard often enough to recite themselves anyhow he then read out the marriage contract the older generation listened with attention nodding judiciously or raising eyebrows and exchanging glances now and then dag fawn her parents the three adult couples and fletch and clover all signed it nattie made her mark and shep signed and sealed it all then papa brought out the family book and laid it open on the table and much the same exercise was repeated dag stared curiously over fawns shoulder at the pages and she thumbed back a bit through the entries of births deaths and marriages and land swaps purchases or inheritances to silently point out her own birth note and several pages earlier the note of her own parents wedding with the names and countersigned marks of the witnessesmany long dead a few still right here in this same room doing this same task then dag and fawn coached by shep said their promises there had been a bit of a debate about them yesterday dag had shied at the wording all the farmer pledges to plow and plant and harvest in due season since he said he wasnt likely to be doing any of those things and for a wedding vow he ought to be speaking strict truth if ever he did and as for guarding the land for his children hed been doing that all his life for everybodys children but nattie had explained the declarations as a poetical way of talking about a couple taking care of each other and having babies and growing old together and hed calmed right down the words did sound odd in his mouth here in this hot crowded parlor but his deep careful voice somehow gave them such weight it felt as if they might be used to anchor ships in a thunderstorm they seemed to linger in the air and all the married adults looked queerly introspective as if hearing them resonating in their own memories fawns own voice seemed faint and gruff in her ears by comparison as though she were a silly little girl playing at being a grownup convincing no one at this point in the usual ceremony it would be time to kiss each other and go eat but now came the stringbinding about which most everyone had been warned in carefully casual terms something to please fawns patroller and in case that seemed too alarming nattie will be doing it for them papa brought out a chair and set it in the middle of the room and dag sat in it with a nod of thanks fawn rolled up dags left sleeve she wondered what was going through his head that he chose to so expose his arm harness to view but the dark cord with the copper glints was revealed circling his biceps fawns own cord having been out in plain sight all along papa then escorted nattie up and she felt along and found everything cords and arm and wrist she pulled loose the bow knots and collected both cords in her hands winding them about one another murmuring halfvoiced blessings of her own devising she then rewrapped the combined cords in a figure eight around dags arm and fawns and tied them with a single bow she held her hand on it and chanted side by side or far apart intertwined may these hearts walk together which were the words dag had given nattie to say and reminded fawn disturbingly of the words on kauneos thighboneknife that dag had carried for so long aimed at his own heart possibly the burned script had been meant to recall just such a wedding chant or charm the words the cords and the two hearts willing all had to be present to make a valid marriage in lakewalker not eyes but groundsense that subtle invisible powerful perceiving fawn wondered desperately how it was people made their assent work the strings grounds that way thinking really hard about it seemed for her about as effective as being a fiveyearold wishing hard for a pony eyes scrunched up in futile effort because a child had no other power by which to move the world doing has no need of wishing she would do her marriage then hour by hour and day by day with the work of her hands and let the wishing fall where it would dag had his head cocked as though he were listening to something fawn could not hear his eyelids lowered in satisfaction and he smiled with some difficulty he lifted his right arm and positioned the fingers of his hand about one end of the knot gathering up the two gold beads from the two different cords fawn at his nod grasped the other pair together they pulled the knot apart and fawn let the cords unwind from around each other fawn then tied her cord on dags arm and dag with natties help or rather nattie with dags hindrance tied his cord around fawns wrist this time with square knots dag glanced up under his lids at her with a muted expression joy and terror and triumph compounded with just a touch of wild unholy glee it reminded fawn of the loopy look on his face right after theyd slain the malice actually he leaned his forehead against fawns and whispered its good its done lakewalker ground magic of a most profound sort worked in front of twenty people and not one of them had seen it what have we done still sitting dag snaked his left arm around her and snugged her in for a proper kiss though it felt disorienting to be lowering her face toward his instead of raising it with an effort they both broke off before the kiss continued at improper length she thought he just barely refrained from pulling her into his lap and ravishing her right there she was way overdue for a good ravish later his bright eyes promised and then it was time to go eat the boys had set up trestle tables in the west yard under the trees so there would be room for everyone to sit down who wanted to one whole table was devoted to the food and drink which people circled and descended upon like stooping hawks carrying loaded plates away to the other tables women banged in and out of the kitchen after things forgotten or belatedly wanted with only the four families plus the sowers present it was literally a quiet wedding with no music or dancing attempted and as it chanced there were no little ones present to fall down the well or out of trees or stable lofts and keep the parents alert or crazed there followed eating drinking eating talking and eating when fawn hauled dag and his plate to the food trestle for the third time he bent and whispered fearfully how much more of this do i have to get down so as not to offend any of those formidable women im now related to well theres aunt ropers creamandhoney pie said fawn judiciously and aunt bluefields butterwalnut cake and mamas maplehickory nut bars and my apple pies all of them ideally or you could just pick one and let the rest be offended dag appeared to cogitate for a moment then said gravely slap on a big chunk of that apple pie then i do like a man who thinks on his feet said fawn scooping up a generous portion yeah while i can still see them she smirked he added plaintively that dimples going to be the death of me you know never she said firmly and led him back to their seats she slipped away soon after to her bedroom to change into her riding trousers and shoes and the sturdier shirt that went with them she left the lilies in her hair though when she came back out to natties weaving room dag stood up from his neatly packed saddlebags you say when spark now she replied fervently while theyre still working through the desserts theyll be less inclined to follow along not being able to move i begin to see your clever plan he grinned and went to get whit and fletch to help him with the horses she met them in the lane to the south of the house where dag was watching with keen attention as his new brothersinlaw tied on the assorted gear i dont think theyll try any tricks on you she whispered up to him if they were lakewalkers he murmured back there would be no end of tricks at this point patroller humor sometimes people are allowed to live after fawn made a wry face then added thoughtfully do you miss it not that part he said shaking his head despite the cooks best efforts the relatives did drag themselves from the trestle tables to see them off clover with a glance at the addition rising on this side of the house bade fawn the very best of luck mama hugged her and cried papa hugged her and looked grim and nattie just hugged her filly and ginger flung rose petals at them most of which missed copperhead seemed briefly inclined to spook at this just to stay in practice evidently but dag gave him an evil eye and he desisted and stood quietly i hate to see you going out on the road with nothing mama sniffled fawn glanced at her bulging saddlebags and all the extra bundles mostly stuffed with packedup food tied about patient grace fawn had barely been able to fight off the pressing offer of a hamper to be tied atop dag citing copperheads tricksiness had been more successful at resisting the lastminute provisions and gifts after a brief struggle with her tongue she said only well manage somehow mama and then papa boosted her aboard grace and dag wrapping his reins around his hook got himself up on tall copperhead in one smooth lunge despite his sling take care of her patroller papa said gruffly dag nodded i intend to sir nattie gripped fawns knee and whispered you take care o him too lovie the way that fellow sheds pieces it may be the thornier task fawn bent down toward natties ear i intend to and then they were off to a rain of goodbyes but no other sort the afternoon was warm and fair and only halfspent they would be well away from west blue by time to camp tonight the farmstead fell behind as they wended down the lane and was soon obscured by the trees we did it fawn said in relief we got away again for a while i never thought i would i did say i wouldnt abandon you dag observed his eyes a brighter gold in this light than the beads on the ends of her marriage cord fawn turned back in her saddle for one last look up the hill you didnt have to do it this way no i didnt the eyes crinkled think about it spark attempting to exchange a kiss from the backs of two variously tall and differently paced horses resulted in a sort of promissory sideswipe but it was fully satisfactory in intent they turned their mounts onto the river road it was all a perfect opposite to her first flight from home then she had gone in secret in the dark alone afraid angry afoot all her meager possessions in a thin blanket rolled on her back even the direction was reversed south instead of north as now in only one aspect were the journeys the same each felt like a leap into the utterly unknown
