dilacera tuis then on my wrath on and crush this plotter of big things close with him thyself rend him in pieces with thine own hands lucius annaeus seneca hercules furens chapter one a bloody awful day for t sir hugo st george willoughby commented as the hired coachandfour clattered and swayed to a stop on the cobblestones before the steps leading up to the old bailey with a wince and a sniff he sampled the weather sticking his head out of the righthand side door window into the cold arr his son captain alan lewrie royal navy idly replied lewrie it must here be pointed out was a tad hung over after a sleepless night in his rooms at the madeira club a sedate lodging for gentlemen not too far away from the old bailey at the corner of duke street and wigmore street his father the old reprobate leaned back to gather his walking stick and cloak allowing lewrie a view of the building oh lord lewrie whispered epiphany sunday of the new year of had been on the fifth of january and hilary term for kings bench trials had therefore waited to open on monday the sixth with all the pomp majesty and circumstance of which england was capable designed over the centuries to impress upon all crown subjects the innocent and the guilty alike the terribleis gucir and implacable inevitability of justice and law lewrie whom no one could ever call innocent exactly but who had yet to learn if he was to be declared guilty was definitely one of the impressed daunted in point of fact shuddering in dread and did we mention hung over lewrie looked beyond the horde of gawkers and spectators who spilled off the sidewalks onto the cobbled street who had yet no inkling of whom the coach contained up the wide steps that were clogged with even more spectators from nobility to pickpockets prostitutes and the flash lads the middling sort and the idle poor to the grim faзade of the building up beyond the roof to the sky that was grey and gloomy half coal smoke and half wintry overcast that boded even more snow later in the day up beyond to the flagpole oh lord lewrie reiterated squeezing his eyes shut to squint for a second before taking a second peek at the flag eyes must be going i think he muttered on january the act of union twixt england scotland wales and ireland had come into force with twentyeight new lords temporal and four lords spiritual seated in parliament along with even more members seated in the house of commons the old union flag had gotten updated with a socalled st patricks cross superimposed upon the old st andrews cross of the new union flag which made it to lewrie at any rate look rather squiffy and unfocussed maybe its just me lewrie thought as a coachee opened the door and folded down the metal steps evrything else seems clear though he had to shake his head and go brr before returning his eyes to the spectators there e is ats im huzzah several voices cried almost together as lewrie alit on the street cobbles and tried to shrug into the deep folds of his heavy wool boatcloak and clapped on his cocked hat saint alan the liberator imself christ i wish theyd lose thatun lewrie thought wincing as his father jostled him as he got out behind him black alan was hooted from others three cheers huzzah hells bells thatuns not a whit better he thought smile damn ye his father cautioned in a harsh whisper right near his ear confidence hmmm show for the damned mob what as yer barrister said sir hugo prompted lewrie forced himself to smile took off his hat and transferred it to his left hand to leave his right one free to fend off the pickpockets if for nothing else the last time hed appeared before kings bench the summer before one particularly skilled young lady of the lifting lay as his notorious old school friend clotworthy chute called it had made off with his watch and fob and leather coin purse right as hed threaded his way through throngs of wellwishers after his case had been held over for review so it was understandable he kept his toplights skinned for the charming threehanded jenny thursday the eighth of january and bloody damned early in the morning to boot was a hellish cold day for london had lewrie his druthers hed have worn two boatcloaks and a carriage blanket round his knees but his impending trial had become a nineday wonder no thanks to the many tracts cartoon prints and bought newspaper articles put out by the reverend william wilberforces society for the abolition of slavery in the british empire the last year entire so lewrie could hardly disguise himself any longer nor could he swaddle himself against the weather either reluctantly he flung back the boatcloak to reveal his giltlaced uniform coat and the hundredguinea presentation sword given him by the east india company after a sea fight against a french frigate in the south atlantic that saved a small convoy of john company ships returning from india in and despite his wariness of pickpockets and eyes darting for signs of threehanded jenny lewrie was thronged by gentlemen and ladies wishing to take hands with him by people fluttering portrait prints of the artist de kosters charcoal life sketch now available from mr brydons shop in charing cross for him to sign with pencil in the margins yed think im nelson fresh from the battle of the nile not a slavecrimper lewrie ruefully told himself and wondering if hed attract the same sort of acclaim should he be found guilty and carted off to the gallows a few days hence and would he have to put on the same confident and affable show to go game as a convicted highwayman god bless you sir good on yer might you do me the honour of inscribing best of luck tye this day sir me son served wi ye in th old jester sloop cap m un the devil take those horrid beaumans and god uphold the right i say captain lewrie came from dozens as he slowly made his way up the broad steps to the welcoming doors now standing wide open despite the cold and visibly blasting waves of warmth from the interior calls for abolition of slavery throughout the british empire now were followed by ere oos at git with the faint cry of thief thief from the edge of the crowd out by piles of shovelledaway snow now gone grey from coal smoke grit and frozen half to ice thankfully it was not directed at lewrie but at some clumsy pickpocket who was sprinting away as fast as his legs could carry him with or without the object of his craft pursued by a clutch of men oh there were some stout and prosperouslooking men heavily and expensively overcoated against the chill who stood far back at the edges of the crowd round to either side of the top of the steps who glowered at him men engaged in the sugar trade which utterly depended on slave labour for their crops men in the tobacco rice rum and cotton imports and men in the west indies and american shipping businesses which maintained the infamous triangle trade of british gewgaws to africa slaves in exchange to the americas and west indies then raw goods back to great britain any threat to slave economies would mean utter ruin to their fortunes sadly among those silently jeering men were several senior officers of his own service mostlike muttering that bloody bastard lewriethere were more than a few whod formed that opinion of him during his twentyyear naval career closer to though was a shivering clutch of saint giles blackbirds negro sailors off merchant ships docked or frozen in in the pool of london freemen or slaves who had been successful in running away to sea thousands of miles from the warmth of their islands in the caribbean half starved on bad victuals cheated of their due pay by skinflint captains crimped off at the end of their voyages to the impress service without hapence of their wages by some captains even cleverer they huddled in the slums of st giles a clan apart waiting for an outbound vessel to sign them aboard once more and living hand to mouth and begrudging every meal at a twopenny ordinary every pot of ale or beer in the meantime you show em sah you whup dem slavah mens they dared cry out ya git anuddah ship sah ahll take yah joinin bounty sah de good lord bless ya capm lewrie lewrie turned aside to go to them the crowd parting before him like the red sea had for moses and shook hands with as many as were in reach though he felt like snarling to hear the simpering and cooing of the respectable and superior sort among the abolitionists who kept the objects of their cause at arms length and patted themselves on the back for their doing of good works of the drawing room variety and would never even think of going down to st giles or of deeming those blackbirds real people and what had led to this display of acclaim a ships crew in the west indies ravaged by yellow jack in a disagreement between the beauman family of jamaica and his old friend christopher cashman who had retired from the army with his reaped wealth from hard field service in john companys army in india and who had for a time thought the life of a slaveowning sugar planter on jamaica would be the sweet life the bloody slave revolt on the ultrarich sugar colony on french st domingue which butchered whites no matter their class or station and which had drawn a british army with an eye to seizing the whole thing thankee that damned scheming fool henry dundas the secretary of state for war who would trade ten thousand british soldiers lives for an enemy colony in the west indies and a cheer in commons had led the patriotic beaumans to raise a regiment and who better to lead it than formermajor christopher cashman with that simpering twit ledyard beauman as colonel of the regiment over leftenantcolonel cashman with the rest of the officers mess made up from beauman kin and the younger sons of fellow planters mostlike with an eye for new lands for themselves and stout workers once they were back in chains outside portauprince though in the middle of a battle with the howling fanatical army of the exslave general toussaint louverture no slouch he but damn near a military genius col ledyard beauman whod gotten his martial experience from books and tabletop games with lead toy soldiers had panicked issued orders for retreat and had galloped to the rear with his cousins and toadies leaving lewries friend christopher cashman to sort out the mess back on jamaica after the eventual evacuation of all british forces the volunteer regiment shamed and disbanded the beaumans had laid all the blame on cashman using their newspaper to vilify everyone but them which had led to a duel of honour which duel had turned to a farce for ledyard had been shivering drunk and fearful and had turned and fired early clipping the top of cashmans shoulder kit had winced but turned and had taken careful implacable aim and ledyards cousin george sellers his second had thrown ledyard a spare pistol aiming his own at cashman and naturally lewrie as cashmans second and the judges on the field to boot had shot down the cousin whilst christopher had carefully plumped his own ball into ledyard beaumans belly the sort of wound that would take several excruciating days to prove mortal with such a feud which now included lewrie and death threats from the beaumans cashman had begun selling up his lands livestock furnishings and slaves for a fresh start in the united states just about the time that lewries precious hms proteus frigate had been hit with the yellow jack as a cruel joke on the beaumans kit cashman had proposed a scheme for a dozen beauman slaves off one of their plantations on portland bight next to cashmans to run away and go aboard proteus some dark night which they had done with hms proteus slipping close ashore like a thief in the night and sailing back out as quietly as smoke went up a chimney christopher cashman landed in wilmington north carolina eventually swearing hed never own another slave hed manumitted almost all his house hold servants and all the married couples olduns and children and lewrie had gone on to cut a swath of destruction and mayhem through the kings enemies in the west indies til when the shoe finally dropped and the beaumans discovered just who had made away with their property hugh beauman the elder of their jamaican clan with his icily beautiful new young wife his jamaican solicitor and witnesses in tow had come to england last spring toting a preordained boughtandpaidfor verdict of guilty and a sentence of death by hanging for a time it had appeared that kings bench would uphold the verdict and lewrie would be doing a newgate hornpipe but for the intercession of rev william wilberforce and his abolition society who had taken the case as a holy cause gotten him a wily young barrister to defend him and paid for his legal fees shouted abolition to the rafters of the house of commons daily and had flooded all london all the british isles with tracts to keep the pot boiling and the cause advanced embarrassing as all that notoriety was to lewrie now here he was about to enter a court of law to hear what lord justice oglethorpe of kings bench thought of that trial in absentia and the conflicting evidence that lewries barrister had presented in reply free of wellwishers and gladhanders at last at the doors to the old bailey at last lewrie turned to the crowd and waved his hat plastering a broad grin on his phyz that he most definitely did not feel and went inside no matter what transpired in the next few hoursand most trials in england barely lasted more than fourat least he might be warm again chapter two the outer halls of the building were just as thronged as those icy steps though the ton of the crowd inside was considerably higher and better known to lewrie there was his brotherinlaw major burgess chiswick the beautiful young lady to whom he was but lately affianced mistress theodora trencher and her wealthy abolitionist parents his fond supporter and patron since in the adriatic sir malcolm shockley of the midlands coal and iron fortune was there with the earnest young sir samuel whitbread he of the beer fortune and one of the new progressives in commons with sir malcolm there was his old schooldays chum lord peter rushton and by his side stood too clever by half clotworthy chute a trimmer and captain sharp who specialised in separating newcome heirs down to london from some of the wealth by playing guide to all things fashionable despite that stern majesty of the law the both of them and the lovely ladies by their side hooted huzzahed and stuck their fingers in their mouths to make shrill whistling noises cackling away like loons and waving at him which only encouraged even the haughtiest to follow suit bread and circuses his father sir hugo griped sotto voce as a servant took his hat cloak and walking stick bad as a roman raree show i swear necessary i spose but what flummery bloody hell lewrie exclaimed dignity and serene confidence bedamned as he turned over his own hat and cloak and caught sight of a bevy of navy men waiting for him with bright eyes and smiles how the devil did they dredge you up just damn my eyes for there stood officers and men from old hms proteus those who had turned over into his latest ship the savage frigate and had been there off portland bight the night of his crimelt adair his former second officer lt darcy gamble third into savage then a midshipman sailing master mr winwood midshipman grace even coote the purser along with all seven surviving sailors of the dozen hed absconded with the only man missing was anthony langlie then first officer of proteus and now commander langlie and in command of hms orpheus a brigsloop of his own savage put into torbay to revictual on the second sir lt adair gleefully explained as he pumped lewries paw in joy and up pops an order from lord saint vincent aboard the flag before we got the kedge anchor down captain wolters wasnt keen on it but here we all are sir ready to testify on your behalf no delay really with the weather foul in the channel and at least a fortnights work to put the ship right gentlemen lads im damned glad tsee ye damned glad and not just for your testimony hey lewrie enthused shaking hands with one and all dry read affidavits are one thing but your tales in your own wordsll be quite another my barrister tells me youve met my father before and here comes desmond furfy aspinall and jones nelson old boys week ha ha his coxswain liam desmond and his big mate patrick furfy lewries longtime cabin servant and cook aspinall and the very big black sailor most recently his personal bodyguard jones nelson had come into the hall so it really did become a grand reunion introductions had to be made all round from lord peter who had precedence down to the burly irishman furfy then there came lewries barristers clerk one mr sadler who was forced to play his usual role of coughing into his fist and aheming to beat the band to herd lewrie down the hallway to the proper courtroom sir sir captain lewrie ahem mister macdougall suggests we should be entering ahem right right then lewrie finally had to allow my pardons mister sadler and well be going lead on do you please the long and heavy table set aside for defence counsel was piled high with octavos bound in law calf the colour of pie crust with a large easel standing off by the far wall and something framed nearby currently covered and as big as a bed sheet joy of the morning captain lewrie his young puck of an attorney declared spreading his arms wide and swirling the black legal stuff robe he wore mr andrew macdougall esquire stood about four inches shy of six feet plump round and moonfaced no amount of dark cloth could make him appear sober nor did the stiff white peruke with three tight horizontal sidecurls and outstanding ribbonbound queue that jutted from the nape of his neck over his generous dark blond hair macdougall might have come extremely well recommended but lewrie still thought of him as the merest boy who should still have been playing pranks at university talented aye lewrie allowed to himself successful with past cases but tis no skin off his arse does he fail its just one more court appearance notorious enough tmake his name either way and it rather irked lewrie that the stout young whelp was all but ready to cut capers or do a hornpipe of glee good morning mister macdougall lewrie felt fit to reply i trust well both be smiling when the days done ow damn for he had stubbed the toe of one of his gilttrimmed hessian boots against a large wood box placed under the table i am completely certain that we shall sir macdougall replied now more than ever he added rocking on the balls of his feet and bestowing upon his brief a slyboots smile what lewrie enquired with a scowl of some confusion it was his life on the line for a second he could conjure that the box under the table was reserved for his head after they lopped it off hanging bedamned you know something i dont a most wondrous something captain lewrie macdougall all but chortled his face dimpled and rosy with delight word has come to me from mister twigg of the foreign office concerning your accuser hugh beauman sir it seems that he that frostily handsome young wife of his his own attorney and all his witnesses have decamped so lewrie said with another frown of confusion last time they were in court he turned into his own worst enemy with all o his bellowin and threats his barrister mostlike his witnesses sir macdougall reiterated peering at lewrie as if he were too simple to understand plain english decamped gone like thieves in the night no longer in london no longer in england dye see christ twiggs killed em lewrie just had to imagine there wasnt any reason that he could see for hugh beauman to withdraw his case short of a dire threat from official circles in hm government or a gang of hooded assassins to hustle the bloody bound corpses into the thames god knew how many thousands of pounds hugh beauman had already spent to discover whod stolen his slaves to bring the prosecution before a rigged jamaican court and justice pack the jury with his kin and employees then spend over a year in england supporting all of his henchmen paying thousands more to amuse and please that icy blond wife of his and her passion for shopping too by god waiting for a court date lewrie had known the beaumans since off and on and no matter they were as rich as the walpoles they were so countryput so chaw bacon they could make the crudest john bull country squire gawk and sneer dogslobberin huntin shootin fishin tenanttramplin slavewhoppin arrogant brute and boorish as they come were the beauman men and god help their womenfolk with thousands for publick show yet pennypinchin miserly in private overbearing and loud ungrammatic and blasphemous well so am i lewrie admitted to himself and so used to getting their own way all the time that it was ludicrous to think that hugh beauman the very worst of a very bad lot would just fold his tents and steal away after coming so close to getting his revenge zachariah twigg and his unofficial little private battalion of watchers noters spies and bullybucks both male and female served the crown damned well and god only knew how many foreign agents were crabfood downriver had it come to that stage lewrie wondered so what good for him but didnt he leave it just a bit late native chiefs rebel rajahs it aint like twigg thold off so long lewrie involuntarily looked about to see if anyone was watching before sketching a finger across his throat and shrugging a question best left unsaid in a court of law oh lord no captain lewrie nothing like that mr macdougall wheezed with good cheer they have absconded coached off to yarmouth to board the portugal packet out of reach of a kings bench warrant for perjury and laying a false prosecution well just damn my eyes lewrie barked too loudly drawing the attention of every spectator now filling the benches in the court room gone to portugal in this weather theyll be lucky do they not drown or get taken by a french manowar humph couldnt happen to a worse set o people the wife excepted perhaps aye that would have been a mortal pity mr macdougall said with a bemused nod it seems macdougall added drawing lewrie towards the far wall of the richly panelled court room near the mystifying covered easel that hugh beauman was made aware that should his barrister sir george norman put him or any of his witnesses in the box to testify they would lay themselves open to some extremely serious charges then once i presented my case in refutation of all their lies with all your officers and men and your black sailors to prove them liars well twould be a genuine wonder did beauman and his people not wind up in gaol awaiting their own trials a risk that mister hugh beauman evidently would not take his attorney sir george mightve told him lewrie asked no i rather doubt that captain lewrie macdougall said as he tapped the side of his nose sagely and tipped lewrie a broad wink lowering his voice even further sir george norman is ah still not cognisant of the flight of his principals though im certain all shall become plain to him soon enough haw haw and given the fact that it is not customary for principals to place more than a retainer fee with the solicitor who engages a barrister with the balance due after the completion of a barristers duties beauman left a huge debt when he scampered lewrie gawped in delight trying to keep his own voice down sir george cant touch him in portugal why theres thousands owing what my father did when he went bust lewrie enjoyed recalling after he crimped me into the navy and granny lewrie refused to die and leave me evrything he took a second to look back at the spectators benches and espied sir hugo who was hovering rather droolishy and leeringly wolflike over some chickabiddy woman in her late thirties i do so look forward to seeing the expression on sir georges face when that shoe drops deed i do captain lewrie mr macdougall whinnied like a panting pony if theyve decamped this could just be dismissed then just like that lewrie asked with a snap of his fingers well not quite sorry tsay macdougall sobered leading him back towards the defence table our first outing last year was an evidentiary hearing with lord justice oglethorpe ruling that he would review both the trial transcript and our affidavits even with those beaumans gone and sir george left without a leg to stand on with all previous testimony against you declared colourable there still remains the fact that with your own witnesses giving the lie to the evidence in the trial transcript you do lay yourself open to the charge of illegal conversion of anothers property assuming the jury will be of a mind to consider your black sailors property once i learned of the beaumans departure i did consider requesting an en bane proceeding with lord justice oglethorpe to rule upon your guilt or innocence yet tis not the irrefutable facts of your defence twill prevail today but the irrational emotions of your black sailors testimony that will carry the day logic bedamned tis the heartstrings of the jurymen the notoriety your cause has created among them beforehand the sympathy for your blacks and for you particularly that the jurymens wives have expressed over the last year that will hopefully find you acquitted macdougall all but promised in a sly cagy way be of sanguine takings captain lewrie you stand very good odds of walking out of court a competely free man aha a side door at the back of the courtroom opened a court official emerged in robe and wig with a large ornamental mace in his hand which he loudly thudded on the floor crying oyez oyez oyez to silence the packed crowd and order them to take seats free to do what lewrie wondered as the procession of officials emerged as lord justice oglethorpe in his voluminous black silk robes and large bagwig strode out as grand as a royal even were he acquitted lewrie just knew that lord spencer at admiralty would never give him another warship hed be assigned to the yellow squadron that unofficial dustbin for fools incompetents lunaticks and dodderers hed stay ashore on halfpay might even rise to rearadmiral of the red should he outlive his contemporariesbut beached waiting for seniors to die lewrie knew his shortcomings they were legion he could not pretend to be a gentleman farmer hed tried that tween the wars and had been a miserably confused failure he was too old to take up some new career too gullible to stand for a seat in parliament too idle and slugabed if given the chance to seek merchant service he was too poor to play the market at the change and mostlike would waste his last farthing on speculative idiocy and ignorance too much of a stiffnecked gentleman to stoop to anything that smacked of trade and commerce no matter how lucrative or risky such turned out to be for other venturers the prizemoney he had reaped in the med in the west indies and south atlantic was tied up in the sinking funds and three percents anyway and sooner or later the last of thatd come in and thered be nothing after maybe twigg needs a new cutthroat he speculated as he took a seat at the defence table before the summons to the raised dock chapter three lord justice oglethorpe was a stolid man a phlegmatic and ponderous older fellow who it was rumoured could take an hour choosing an entrйe from his clubs daily menu and so meditative at chess cards or backgammon that no one had asked him for a game since his teens your principals are not present sir george he enquired with a bland expression how odd they are not milud sir george norman usually a very smooth gentleman responded fidgeting a little looking as if he wished that he could jerk his head about to hunt for them both his clerks had already been sent haring round the halls and into the street outside in a desperate lastminute search for the beauman party and have you sir had cause to correspond with them prior to this instant oglethorpe intoned with his head cocked to one side i have not milud sir george had to admit all but wringing his hands not since a brief note from their lodgings in islington in receipt of my informing them of the date their case was to be held how extremely odd oglethorpe commented with an uncharacteristic huff mister macdougall i trust your witnesses are here we are in all respects both ready and eager to proceed my lord macdougall piped up as he bowed his head taking a second for a smirk in sir george normans direction a folder of pale law calf was opened up on the banc surface and papers rustled as lord justice oglethorpe cleared his throat with several ahems waiting out the snickers and whispers of the court spectators ahem in the matter of beauman versus lewrie after an exhaustive review of the trial transcript from the high court in kingston jamaica and comparing the witness statements sworn in that proceeding against the sworn affidavits provided by the defendant i find such contradictions of the facts of the matter obtaining to warrant an entirely fresh proceeding de ovo harumph further the nature of the jury empanelled on jamaica with so many of the members either kin to the beaumans or kin to the captain george sellers who perished along with colonel ledyard beauman in an infamous duel of honour and the inclusion of men either employed by mister hugh beauman or his kin or intimately linked with the slave trade on jamaica smacks of collusion and prejudice which as well requires a new proceeding de ovo therefore ahem i rule that captain lewries trial in absentia at kingston jamaica the verdict of guilty and the sentence of death by hanging is null and void and is set as the last of his ruling was drowned out by hoots whistles and cheers from the spectators and a boisterous round of clapping along with the surreptitious exchange of pound notes as bets were paid off that continued til oglethorpe gavelled them to relative silence and more carefully guarded pleased whispers coughs and the rustling of ladies skirtings at this juncture ahem lord justice oglethorpe continued i should empanel a jury i wonder however sir george whether such an action might be precipitate if your principal is not here and neither are any of the witnesses quoted in the transcript i conjure you sir are you able to lay a case against captain lewrie this day i i sir george norman stammered all his glibness and noble carriage punched from him is the transcript of the previous trial eliminated milud i do not see how i would be able no sir george could almost be heard groaning or grinding his teeth my lord macdougall cried will this odious charge hang over my principals head the rest of his life like the sword of damocles must captain lewries good name his repute as a successful commission sea officer in our navy be besmirched his accusers are not present today but when might mister hugh beauman come forth with a fresh proceeding a new crop of witnesses perhaps even an expanded list of charges since the first set did not suit a year my lord two or five or ten captain lewrie was perjuriously tried in absentia before macdougall said with a sly look once back on jamaica might mister hugh beauman arrange a second from wherever he has gone no i say my lord it must end here today justice must be done him oh christ it was almost over dont do lewrie fearfully thought id known beauman scarpered idve considered it myself i humbly urge you to empanel a jury of twelve men good and true my lord macdougall said with a hand on his breast let them hear and see the facts of the matter and determine captain lewries fate for good and all my lord some spectators cheered and huzzahed though most made buzzing sounds of confusion and surprise which noises covered lewries groan to the crowd in the courtroom it had looked over and done with and macdougalls request seemed suicidal mine arse on a bandbox lewrie gawped to himself he wants to show off got all his setpieces and cant abide not usin em milud sir george norman cried before the last of the hubbub died down to proceed without my principal my witnesses and the use of the trial transcript mister hugh beauman might as well be tried in absentia it would be so onesided sauce for the goose sauce for the gander macdougall chirped ahem from the lord justice and some more gavelling there is the risk to captain lewrie that at some time in the future a trial could be demanded by the plaintiff and though your presentation to a jury may not go much beyond your opening statements to lay charges sir george if counsel for the defence has his affidavits witnesses whose service may not allow them to be gathered together all in one place ever again might even be unavailable to captain lewrie and some future attorney should the plaintiff in this matter decide to pursue his case on more salubrious grounds well theyre here today if you have no objections sir george i am tempted to seat a jury and proceed how say you sir sir george norman kc could never admit that hed been taken in by the seeming authority of the trial transcript from jamaica that the witnesses hugh beauman had imported might have been lying through their teeth that hed never looked into the makeup of the jury before macdougall had brought it up there was also the honourarium to consider his fee which had been partly paid and with the beaumans fled the country looked like it might never be no skin off my arse he seemed to say to himself he scowled in thought for a long moment then bowed his head if mister macdougall wishes to proceed and the demands of the navy would not allow his witnesses to be gathered together at a later time then i bow to your ruling milud with voir dire objections and questioning it took an hour for a jury to be seated then came the opening statements sir george did his best though with a third party distancing air my principal asserts that on such and such a date captain alan lewrie with malice aforethought witnesses at the scene of the crime asserted that did conspire with leftenantcolonel christopher cashman now fled the jurisdiction of kings justice to america to receive twelve negroes slaves from my principals plantation on portland bight the value of the slaves at the time twentyfive pounds apiece macdougall ostentatiously cleaned his fingernails with a penknife til sir george was done then sprang to his feet like a jackinthebox my lord gentlemen of the jury i am not quite sure whether counsel for the plaintiff has just accused captain lewrie of outright theft or of the lesser charge of illegal conversion either way is it believable that the value of a human beings life the value of his short and brutal labour so backbreaking and hideous that most perish within five years is only worth twentyfive pounds and if so why did not hugh beauman sue in the court of common pleas for three hundred pounds he then encapsulated for the jury the injustice done his client at the trial on jamaica to which sir george norman made no objections he might have been contemplating dinner for his part was done it was old news for the spectators but visibly distasteful to the jury as they learned what a sham the trial in absentia had been and the feud that had preceded it now let us proceed gentlemen to the root cause macdougall said returning to the defence table for a letter that his clerk mr sadler handed him here is a letter from former leftenantcolonel christopher cashman with whom captain lewrie allegedly conspired i wish you to be patient as i read this affidavit sworn before a justice of the peace in wilmington north carolina in the united states and witnessed and notarised which affidavit has already been presented to the court and laid in evidence the affidavit laid out cashmans career in both the british and east india company armies his return to the west indies his initial acceptance of slavery as a necessity to work his lands his previous military service in conjunction with then lieutenant lewrie during the last year of the american revolution and their rencontre in the s when he had been asked by the beaumans to lead the volunteer regiment the botched battle ledyard beaumans cowardice and the feud that followed which led to the duel then by this time i was heartily sick of jamaica heartily sick of the beaumans and all their brute class and most especially sick of the horrid institution of slavery a view which i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my old friend alan lewrie wholeheartedly shared macdougall stressed pacing urgently before the jury box as he read on hed sold some of his slaves off the most troublesome and truculent but freed the bulk of them then as he was selling up after the duel it had been cashman who had suggested freeing some of beaumans slaves as well i took it upon myself to approach the field hands of mister hugh beaumans plantation next to mine on portland bight using one of my newly freed house servants as intermediary hinting that those among them who wished to run and join the royal navy would be welcome aboard a frigate which would be off the coast in a few days i then suggested to my fellow abolitionist alan lewrie that was his crew so decimated by yellow fever that he was in difficulties to keep her manned there could be a round dozen eager volunteers available lyin like a turkey carpet lewrie flummoxed to himself in the dock didnt happen quite like that a damned good lie though night that proteus closed the coast i rode down shoreward to the edge of my property which abutted the beaumans lands and with a great deal of satisfaction watched as the boats came ashore a dozen young men embark into them and was for a time fearful that the commotion from their parents and kinfolk who had come down the beach with them to see them off might awaken the overseers for such lamentations of loss yet joyful hosannahs of relief that some few of their fellows might gain their freedom were hardly to be contained no matter the need for quiet and secrecy at that moment i felt such a rush of pride that it was successfully carried off without interruption along with such a flood of emotion that brought tears to my eyes to see even a few young men escape the clutches of the beaumans and take their freedom from a life that is little better than a death sentence that i swore at that moment that not only would i abjure from owning another human being in my life but would work tirelessly to see slavery outlawed in all the nations of the earth no matter what that stance personally cost me the words of a man who now resides in a nation which upholds slavery in a state famed for its agriculture and naval stores all of which require negro slave labour in a town where such views are anathema where once the contents of colonel cashmans affidavit are known to his fellow citizens he very likely faces social and financial ruin sirs consider what courage that took for him to testify on captain lewries behalf macdougall posed to the jury milud sir george norman said with a piteous smirk as he rose to his feet it would seem that my learned colleague has just admitted his principals guilt to what specific crime my lord does sir george refer mr macdougall quickly retorted plucking the front of his black court robe does he maintain that captain lewrie instigated and premeditated the crime of robbery in the face of leftenantcolonel cashmans confessing affidavit or does he wish to now reduce his accusations to conversion of property the waters must be unmuddied upon this head for the clarification of the jury my lord let us be specific has he lost his fuckin mind lewrie could but goggle quietly lord justice oglethorpe scratched his scalp under his bagwig with a pencil scowled pursed his lips then impatiently waved both barristers forward to the front of his bench where ensued a lengthy hushed conversation one that must have pleased macdougall right down to the ground for when oglethorpe shooed them away he had a bright smile plastered on his phyz whilst sir george norman was shaking his head ahem upon reception of the confession from mister christopher cashman counsel for the plaintiffs has amended his accusations to a charge of illegal conversion silence silence in the he had to cry and gavel for order as the spectators raised yet another great cheer now let us see how the event occurred that dark night off the coast of portland bight three years ago mr macdougall said in the relative silence after the crowd had settled down once more he waved to his clerk mr sadler and another assistant who stood up the easel and hung the bed sheetsized roll of cloth upon the crosspiece allowing it to fall open wonder what that cost lewrie thought shifting in his chair in the dock to look at it macdougall had gone to a chart makers for an uptodate map of that section of coast compared the new one to the old one that proteuss sailing master mr winwood had used and had an artist or sign painter do up a largescale version in full colour pale blue wash for ocean rocky shoals in grey sand bars in tan and land in pale green with forests and fields done in a darker green a topographic map of the plantations in question surely must have come from jamaica as well for the beaumans and cashmans plantings were delineated quite accurately right down to the locations of the houses barns and slave quarters all of them neatly labelled as was the beach where the ships boats had grounded and all distances from specific points clearly marked corresponding to a distance scale in the lower left corner at this point my lord i call lieutenant adair to testify macdougall intoned going all solemn now that he was at the meat of the matter macdougall worked his way down through the commission officers to mr winwood and the purser mr coote showing how the crime was committed sir george norman sat mum at his table through it all a befuddled and seemingly disinterested air about him under english common law he had no right to crossexamine witnesses and with no witnesses of his own to present in rebuttal his continued presence was merely decorative yet macdougall did not stick to the distances the times or the particular actions that lewries juniors had performed that night to lt adair he posed the question of what he heard and saw on shore had the other slaves been celebrating they were sir adair stated i was fearful that their cries might rouse the overseers the form of it tears and hugging and handshaking sir joy and sadness mixed soft singing and such and once into the boats and making your way back to proteus sir did anything odd occur macdougall asked we heard barking sir lt adair answered at first i imagined that the overseers and their dogs were near the beach but in a short time we discovered that the barking came from seals sir seals lieutenant adair macdougall said striking a surprised pose obviously with foreknowledge of what adair would say in the west indies are they not hunted out it was eerie sir adair declared aye seals are rare in those seas but that night they appeared all round us every man at the oars saw them and commented on them a dozen or more of them swimming about our boats just beyond the reach of the oars right to the ships side sir where the rest of the crew saw and heard them as well and what did you make of that sir macdougall crooned gods blessing pon our action sir lt adair solemnly said then smiled captain lewrie and seals well sid als wellr tis mysterious how often seals have appeared in warning or almost approval sir just before captain lewrie went into a fight for so is the rumour in the fleet about him dye see sir a minor miracle some say did the dozen slaves sign aboard willingly were they fed and clothed kitted and paid the same as any english sailor were any of them troublemakers drunkards discipline problems were any of the black sailors stupid were any of them cowards macdougall asked him willingly aye treated the same as any volunteer very little trouble from any of them the usual binges on runs ashore which were rare same as british tars illiterate but not stupid for many went on from landsman to ordinary seaman two had been rated able in short time and there were certainly no cowards among them the runaways were as brave as lions every man jack lt adair could swear lt gamble and midshipman grace reiterated adairs high opinion of them whilst mr winwood told of their musteraboard baths under a washdeck pump and hose which he likened to their baptism into a new life how little theyd been told of christianity and the sacrifice and resurrection of the saviour which had many a lady in the courtroom dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and how he had taken it on himself to minister to their spiritual needs and education seeing as how hms proteus did not at that time rate a chaplain willing to ship to the fever isles of the west indies are you conversant with slavery laws in the crown colonies mister winwood macdougall finally asked somewhat sir more so now than previous winwood intoned in his sober and ponderous manner and frowned when his comment was taken as slightly humourous by the spectators what charge may be laid against a slave who runs away from his master or mistress mister winwood macdougall pressed uhm that since he is not a free man sir only property not reckoned a man at all really that he is guilty of stealing himself i believe winwood replied guilty of stealing himself macdougall pretended consternation in a loud voice and the punishment would be what an hundred lashes pilloried in the stocks branded his hamstrings cut so he may only limp a foot cut off with an axe i have heardtell that one or all of those punishments are awarded sir mr winwood agreed in grave sadness shaking his head sorrowfully a second unsuccessful attempt may result in death by the lash or being hung do civilised people do such to cows that stray horses that take the bitt tween their teeth and gallop macdougall posed to a dog that piddles on carpet a cat which climbs a tree indeed not sir winwood said yet many slaves do risk such punishments each year do they not mister winwood steal themselves and run on jamaica to the socalled cockpit country to the blue mountains and the jungles dont they what do they call them mister winwood they do sir they call them maroons winwood answered do you believe that captain lewrie is a thief mister winwood one who received stolen property for his own use sir no sir in this instance i would call him a christian gentleman the sailing master somberly replied turning to look the men of the jury in the eyes you might as well put me on trial for what we did that night i only wish wed had a ship of the line stead of a frigate in need of hands and taken all of them away macdougall paced back towards the defence table but paused in midstride and whipped about one last question of you sir if under jamaican slave law the blacks in this matter stole themselves who then used them for his own purposes mister winwood captain alan lewrie or king george the third in whose service twelve brave black men willingly volunteered and five of whom have perished now i must object milud sir george norman cried shooting to his feet roused from his nodding stupor at last the witness is a warrant officer in the navy not a legal scholar and cannot form a legal judgement in the first instance and for honoured counsel for the defence to suggest that his majesty shares any guilt in this crime is abominable and shameful in the second withdrawn my lord macdougall offered hiding his amusement i have no more questions for this witness the insult to the crown milud sir george pressed mister macdougall lord justice oglethorpe said with a dyspeptic scowl or warning you are known for frippery in court but let me caution you to eschew any suggestion of lиsemajestй against our sovereign the question is withdrawn my lord macdougall said looking a trifle hurt like a boy caught skylarking and called down for it an injudicious phrase when the proper statement might have been the royal navy or great britain which prospered from the services of the sailors in question rather than our king i stand admonished milord very well then you have more witnesses oglethorpe asked i do my lord it is now nearly a quarter to twelve the lord justice said so we shall adjourn for dinner proceedings shall resume this afternoon at half past one all rise the chief bailiff intoned once oglethorpe had left the courtroom lewrie came down from the raised and railed dock to join macdougall who was shedding his peruke and putting it in a small wood box and shrugging out of his robes a deuced good morning sir macdougall told him all smiles and high spirits a splendid beginning imagine a trial that will take all day why well be the talk of the town by supper and atop the front pages of all the papers by tomorrow morning ha ha hungry are you captain lewrie theres a delightful chophouse not a five minutes stroll from here aye i spose lewrie allowed you think we did well extremely well sir macdougall was quick to assure him with a puckish grin i thought just laying out how we committed the deed just like that lewrie fretted would doom us me as i shall tell the jury this afternoon captain lewrie was the deed an act of criminality or was it a deed of liberation i will fill the afternoon with the testimony of your black sailors and there will not be a dry eye in the courtroom once im done not one stony heart unmoved ready mister sadler shall we go then for i am famished lewrie fingered a breeches pocket to assure himself that his coin purse was still present and that it was suitably stuffed with a sufficiency of bank notes and coins enough to bear the cost of dinner with such imposing trenchermen as macdougall and sadler no matter the financial support of the abolitionists and other progressives for his legal expenses and all those visual aids dealing with attorneys was a dear business as a matter of fact captain lewrie macdougall said as he stowed away his court wear i am so sanguine about the rest of the day that this once allow me to treat lewries jaw it here must be noted dropped rather far chapter four the afternoons testimony indeed turned out to be emotional and dramatic as mr macdougall put all seven surviving black sailors in the witness box and led each of them first through their wretched lives as chattel slaves in the west indies and on the beauman plantation in particular then about their flight their reception aboard capt lewries frigate and their experiences in the royal navy since shoddy clothing if clothed at all the poorest meanest rations of condemned saltbeef or saltpork buginfested rice and but a few fresh greens or vegetables with even socalled holiday victuals of a barely unremitted sameness for even the rare duffs or puddings were though cooked on a sugar cane plantation sadly lacking in sweetness how prime field hands sleek when first they came from the slave ships and the vendue houses wasted away to skin gristle and bones before three years were out which was considered a bargain by unfeeling masters considering the sad low price placed on a human being theyd initially paid there were always ships arriving with healthy slaves from africa the barracks and pens were continually full and prices for people were nigh as low as those for cattle crude huts for shelters leafstuffed sacks for bedding on the dirt floors at night exposed round the clock to insects and weather up before the sun to the tolling of bells and the crack of whips poor victuals choked down after being scooped by hand from communal pots then backbreaking labour til the sun was all but set with only one brief break in the shade for a misers dinner and whips and chains and chokecollar boards round their necks for the slightest act of misbehaviour hot irons to brand recalcitrant shirkers hot irons to sear the tongue from those who dared speak back without being asked a question or for the merest suspicion of lying to an overseer master or mistress poisonous snakes had been imported from africa and india turned loose in the surrounding forests to make sure that slaves wouldnt dare run off without risking a fivestepper death for the slow the slowwitted or lazy for those who broke the poor tools they were given for hiding a canecutting machete or knife there was the whipping post where the lashes were doled out capriciously thirty for this sin fifty for another perhaps an hundred for the same offence at the whim of the overseers imagination with age or sex no assurance of leniency and slave women the young firm and handsome were masters prey overseers perquisites in the fields in the huts after dark it was just rape when drunken sons of slavemasters and their friends or cousins felt like it and the mother the father the lover who objected in the slightest laid himself open to pure torture and no one could lift a hand to rescue the young girls after all slave children quickened by white men fetched more when auctioned off and made lighter skinned lessafricanfeatured house servantstobe did house servants have it slightly better of a certainty but they paid a high price did slave women mothers against their will hope that their offspring might be bright enough to be spared field work of course if girls though planters sons desired them more did anyone ever preach the gospel to them only the snippets from saint pauls letters that urged slaves behave your masters and since signing articles aboard proteus macdougall asked the wiry young george rodney who had been a spry topman and a sharpshooter did captain lewrie ever put you or any of the other volunteers to any work in his greatcabins to wait upon his table buff his boots do his laundry anything like that nossuh he nevah did wull jones nelson be in is boat crew but dat coz he big un strong oarsman be a runout tackleman on de twelvepoundahr eighteen poundahr sah so captain lewrie did not consider you his personal property oh nossuh rodney firmly replied iz a british sailah in de royal navy sah iz a sailah o king george captain lewrie rated you a topman one of the lads who goes aloft yes did you want to be one oh yassah topmen be kings o de ship sah and he trained you all of you with pistols muskets swords and boarding pikes macdougall asked as he had of all the rest but mr cooke who was a bit too old and stout for close combat for he was indeed wellnamed and had been proteuss ships cook lemme shoot frenchmen wid his own ferguson riflemusket me or his ol coxn andrews e did sah rodney boasted said de bot o us have de good eye yes and have you killed a lot of frenchmen yassuh i sho have specially when we fight de french frigates two year ago rodney supplied round dozen right dere you mentioned coxswain andrews macdougall went on of what race was coxswain andrews he black like me sah well fo he run i hear tell he wuz a house slaver body slave rodney related so he wuz lightskinned he be capm lewries coxn almos since de merican revolution but he got killed in de south atlantic two

sees t th capm is is cook an cabin steward mistah aspinall ovah yondah rodney said with a jab of his arm to the sailors behind the defence table and did captain lewrie ever have one of you fellows flogged for disobedience macdougall asked cant recall dat evah happen sah rodney said frowning in reverie capm lewrie aint big on floggin cept fer when a mans been real bad didnt even flog hood howe

spose de capm think i punished enough the spectators could not contain simpers and snickers when the lad named his compatriots who at mr winwoods urging had taken new freemens names after their musteringin baths under the washdeck pump as if leaving pagan lives of sin behind and being washed white as snow by baptism new souls with new identities and not what some capricious slavemaster had named them hood howe rodney anson and nelson for naval heroes groome and cooke for their old occupations then bass and whitbread for the imported beverages their masters had drunk sir samuel whitbread member of parliament seated in the middle of the courtrooms spectator area that afternoon perhaps didnt find it quite so amusing but what rodney described were sailors antics the sorts of things that young men of any race might risk when in drink and high spirits and the adventures trampled by cape buffalo mauled and bitten by a lion on a hunting trapping jaunt into the wilds of mysterious africa with a circus battling pirates in the caribbean the french and spanish with lashings of prizemoney to prove their mettle and success why what english lad didnt wish to run away to sea and have such adventures lewrie peeked at the gentlemen in the jury box and was heartened to see a fair number of them smiling or shaking their heads in kindly wonder over such doings and you were paid the same as any british sailor in your rate seaman rodney macdougall goodnaturedly asked him evry penny tth jot an tittle sah rodney answered ol mistah coote de pursah an capm lewriez fair men sah an evry prize we take i git my share samez anybody we whup de creole pirates two year ago in looziana i made tree years wages right dere and now youre a free man seaman rodney macdougall continued in a softer voice do you wish to remain a british sailor and a free man best life i evah know sah aye i aint nevah let any one make me a slave again rodney declared with some heat i learn tread an write board ship so nobody gon trap me makin my mark on somethin i dont understand got cypherin too so nobody gon cheat me outta money neither war be ovah i spect ill ship out on a merchantman less i find me a good girl an start a famly and finally seaman rodney what do you think of captain lewrie macdougall asked him he be a fine man sah rodney gushed a fightin man and a good un an i just thank god he free me an god bless him fo evah and macdougalls summation was glorious of course focussing not so much on denying the theft of slaves as he did praising it for a courageous christian act with the jamaica trial transcript out he could not refer to it except to ask the jury to consider why not one accuser was present in court even though the beaumans had pursued the matter with whitehot eagerness and at the cost of thousands of pounds for several years did they suddenly fear being taken up themselves for laying a false and vengeful prosecution and lastly gentlemen macdougall declaimed in histrionic fashion his arms outstretched consider that the dozen slaves not worth three hundred pounds as lessthanhuman hewers of wood and drawers of water worked to death in a few short years then easily replaced with fresh young muscles the merest pittance of those who yearly perish the most minute fraction of all those hundreds of thousands yearning to live free have shed their blood for you given their lives for you who sleep snug at night behind britains wooden walls go aloft serve the guns endure the boredom of blockading and bravely face all the perils of weather and the wrath of the sea on our menowar all round the world this very minute this very hour ask how many more would wish to emulate these stalwart young men yes i say men not dumb beasts men who feel pain and joy suffer disappointment and revel in victory who serve god king and country in whose breasts burn the fires of patriotism as strongly as yours it would be unconscionable to deny england their services just as it would be equally unconscionable to return these men to the vengeful cruelty of slavery to their former master mister hugh beauman of jamaica macdougall declared and that sirs would be the logical result if the instrument of their newfound freedoms was condemned for a selfless act of liberation macdougall told the jury human bondage had been outlawed in our happy isle for nearly fifty years yet do you find that captain alan lewrie is guilty of stealing human beings you reduce these men to chattel status once more tacitly admit that they were mere property property i say with as little right to determine their own destinies as a bedstead or a dining room table to even reward hugh beauman a single shilling per head as a compromise settlement would be tantamount to calling these eager young volunteers in our navy no more men than a dozen pair of shoe buckles no gentlemen dont do it macdougall urged the jury deem what captain lewrie did a courageous act the leeward gun fired in the challenge to a foe as our beloved admiral horatio nelson urges all captains to fire no matter the odds or risk a first tentative but significant blow against the abominable practice of negro slavery that i am sure all true britons despise a bold geste done not for personal aggrandisement which i am also certain all britons cheer with nought but admiration for captain lewries courage in striking any sort of blow to this despicable institution and expose its putrescent evils for all the world to see we sing gentlemen macdougall said lowering his arms sounding weary and exhausted of a sudden which forced the twelve men of the jury to lean a bit forward britons never never never shall be slaves fine for us for we were born free men and are now engaged in a war defending our ancient right to remain free of a conquering tyrant with bulldog tenacity and determination can we deny the right to others who are just as determined to become free can we condemn a heroic paladin who freed the first few find these charges baseless and mean gentlemen macdougall cried suddenly finding new energy acquit captain lewrie and set him free upon our nations foes and in doing so condemn the brutes who would make scornful mock of freedom for any man black or white slave or free acquit acquit acquit and show the world what true britons think of human bondage the jury shuffled out to their deliberation chamber and lewrie had time to visit the jakes for a longdelayed pee making his way through the throngs of supporters in the hallways who had not gained seats in the courtroom was a maddening hindrance pon his bladder and it was with an immense sense of relief that he could stroll back out after doing up his breeches buttons to face the gauntlet once again now of much better less impatient takings sir sir come quick macdougalls clerk mr sadler urged making a narrow aisle through the crowd and beckoning in some haste the jury is ready to render bless me not above eight minutes in total never seen the like is that good or bad lewrie asked considering that whilst in the necessary it might have been a good idea to throw on his boatcloak exchange hats with a civilian gentleman and take legbail for parts unknown might be very good sir on the other hand excuse us id love tmeet a onearmed law clerk or lawyer lewrie told himself who cant say on the other hand macdougall gave him a tentative smile as he reentered the grim courtroom and a shrug as lewrie remounted to the railed dock where he felt too unsettled to sit down lewrie paced the tiny enclosure a fair approximation of a condemned mans cell he could imagine trying to appear stoic with a slight touch of bemusement as he looked over the refilling courtroom from his elevated vantage point damme theres a stunner he irrelevantly thought espying an especially attractive young lady in a lavender gown and matching hat hope springs eternal all that it cheered him that the handsome lass smiled at him and dipped him a brief bow of encouragement bang went the bailiffs mace and the cry of oyez as lord justice oglethorpe resumed his place in the banc and court functionaries filed in and took their own places as the twelve men of the jury reentered the courtroom through a side door and took seats in their own railedoff box there was much shuffling of feet coughing into fists the rustling of gowns and mens coats the creaking of a new pair of boots and the bang of a stubbed toe against the pewlike benches of the spectators gallery oddly there was no whispering or chatting this time only an expectant hush worthy of the last act of a tragedy staged in drury lane the jury has determined a verdict in the matter of beauman versus lewrie lord justice oglethorpe enquired once the last of the traditional forms had been acted out we have my lord the elected foreman announced pray do you declare it oglethorpe ordered ahem from the foreman free him pray god some feminine voice was heard to utter we the jury find in the matter of beauman et al versus captain alan lewrie royal navy that the defendant is not guilty halleluah a male spectator shouted a second before womanly shrieks of relief and joy and a general hooraw and chorus of huzzahs mixed with a tidal wave of bright chattering and glad laughter sailors behind the defence table raised three cheers holy shit lewrie thought dumbstruck and nighshaking with unutterable relief himself ready to break out in maniacal laughter as well what a marvellous thing it was to know that one would not be cashiered that one would not hang and that one did not owe ones lawyer tuppence not guilty well not innocent exactly but itll more than do lewrie thought more what did macdougall call it jury nullification emotion ruled not logic and thank god fort he goggled round the courtroom at the spectators the powerful and dedicated to abolition the enthusiastic and the mere lookerson whod come to any notorious trial lewrie spotted wee rev wilberforce and his coterie all looking about to break into unaccustomed dances of glee for such an earnest and usually dour crowd and confessed to himself that hed let them down badly that night for it was better than fair odds that hed be drunk as a lord drunk as an emperor by god by midnight lord justice oglethorpe was gavelling away had been for several minutes in point of fact before the crowd in the courtroom subdued to a level where in he could make himself heard captain alan lewrie oglethorpe solemnly intoned in a loud voice looking as stolid as ever he might had the jury gone the other way a jury of your peers having found you not guilty of the crime with which you were charged i now declare you a free man which formal declaration only served to set the crowd off once more oglethorpe banged away for order now looking tetched by the interruptions last year when first you appeared before this court captain lewrie you put up a surety bond to guarantee your future appearance which your presence today fulfilled oglethorpe announced in the amount of one hundred pounds such sum i now order returned to you these proceedings i now declare at an end and you are free to depart court is dismissed he said with one final bang of his gavel an hundred pounds lewrie thought as he exited the dock orgy a fкte champкtre a roast steer and barrels and lashins o drink i told you macdougall was chortling as he came to take hands with his brief and shake away vigourously i told you twould be a complete exoneration the jury found slavery guilty as i planned nullification dye mean wasnt it risky lewrie asked though in no mood to disagree with the verdict exactly so sir macdougall crowed but no one ever went smash overestimating the sway of emotions pon a jury the pluck of the heartstrings stead of the dry paper rustlings of cold hard logic congratulations to you captain lewrie pon your freedom and for how far this case has advanced the noble cause of emancipation of all slaves in the british empire mind id not suggest you do such again ha ha if i do ill engage only you mister macdougall lewrie teased allow me to extend my hearty congratulations to you as well sir for the notoriety of this will surely be the making of you though i dare say your name was already made congratulations and my utmost thanks for being my attorney mister macdougall i am forever in your debt have i another son someday ill name him andrew in honour of you dont trowel it on that thick lewrie chid himself and christ spare me fresh spitups and drool legitimate or otherwise but so ye dodged the hangman have ye huzzah lewries father sir hugo came forth to celebrate the devil might have ye yet but not this day haw haw then there were his former officers and sailors to surround him to clasp hands or knuckle brows and before the sir samuel whitbreads and sir malcolm shockleys lord peter rushtons and fieryeyed abolitionists seized upon him his coxn desmond and his mate furfy landsman jones nelson and the rest of his black sailors hoisted him up and bore him in triumph from the courtroom out through the double doors into the hallways to the massive entry halls someone had enough wit to gather up his hat sword and boatcloak and outside to the steps overlooking the street where people took up hail the conquring hero comes and three cheers and a tiger where with his sheathed sword in one hand and his hat hastily clapped far back on his head lewrie felt free enoughfreeto wave with his right hand to all in sight and huzzah right back at them hope they get me to a carriage quick though he had to think someones got my cloak and its perishin damn cold book juno tellus colenda est paelices caelum tenent juno i must dwell on earth for harlots hold the sky lucius annaeus seneca hercules furens chapter five im the wrong sort o hero lewrie thought with a yawn as he tossed back the covers at the fashionable hour of am a gentlemanly time to rise just a few years back he hurriedly slipped his feet into a pair of anklehigh bearskin slippers slung a floorlength dressing robe about his body and dashed for the ebbing fire in the grate of his room at the madeira club proper heroes got a servant to intrudedamned quietlyto lay fresh kindling and seacoal in the fireplace so they could sleep in wellearned peace til noon and awake in a toastywarm chamber too lewrie was certain proper heroes were not lodged amidst the earnest and dedicated either the sounds of early risers stamping about taking their ablutions opening and slamming chest lids opening and slamming doors on their way belowstairs to the dining room for a hellishearly breakfastclattering their shoes and boots on the steps and greeting each other with cheery bleats to boothad made lewries attempts at sleep all but impossible since before am the right sort of british hero someone like horatio nelson say would be roused to the accompaniment of a steaming cup of coffee cocoa or tea with buttered toast and jam or rusks too but lewrie saw no signs of such luxuries and doubted ringing for their fetching would result in their prompt delivery the kitchens and dining room closed at nine not to open again til dinnertime nelsond be roused by emma hamiltons tits too lewrie sourly thought as he whizzed away into the chamberpot he gave the cooling bed a fond look for a moment now the morning stampede of respectable gentlemen was done the lodging house would be quiet enough for a nap til the dining room reopened but hed made a late night of it was dearly in need of sustenance and at that moment could have killed someone for a cup of coffee after a shave and a perfunctory washup he threw on his civilian suitings pulled up his own boots tied his own stock and grabbed hat boatcloak and walking stick and headed for a warm and cozy coffeehouse it wasnt that his recent fame or notoriety if one prefers denied lewrie of a heros panache it was the sort of people with whom one was invited out to dine oh there were a few cheerful souls from parliament in commons and lords eager to have him in but in the main the bulk of the invitations he had received the last week were of the grim dour and respectable stripe to whom a witty comment a double entendre or a glass of wine above strict necessity would be simply appalling abolitionists social reformers antihunting and antigaming enthusiasts those grimly intent upon the eradication of prostitution in london for gods sake and the reclamation of the poor soiled doves engaged upon it those who fretted and wrung their hands over the sad lack of morals the absence of evangelising among englands sailors soldiers and marines why there had been people whod seemed in possession of all their wits at first earnestly dedicated to the eradication of demon rum ruinous gin and soulsucking brandy and so enthusiastic about their noble cause as to appear quite fanatical for the last week lewrie couldnt even leer at a promisingly bulging chest admire a graceful neck or ogle a fetching female face not if he wished to maintain the good will of those whod paid all his legal fees he couldnt a praiseful comment on the mouth of the nile playing at the covent garden theatre in honour of the battle and adm nelson or conversation about the overly melodramatic pizarro in drury lane had been received with odd pursings of mouths much as if lewrie had lifted a cheek and shot off a cheeser to his earnest hosts and hostesses the only good thing about pizarro were the moral lessons of the drama lewrie wasnt sure what those were exactlyslaughtering umpteen thousands of inca pagans spreading christianity with fire and sword and raking up mountains of gold and gems was a good thing that being a spanish conqueror resulted in final tragedy as opposed to say clive of india whod done pretty much the same thing but was so thoroughly british that he came home smelling like hungary water in comparison or was it the new fashions and colours that pizarro had sprung upon a drab london winter purple yellow puce and scarlet along with spangled hair nets and fifteenthcentury hats as big and floppy at throwpillows or exaggerated french berets for women anyway it was only the stylish the flash and the young sybarites who sported such togs pointedly not his hostesses who were as staid as throwbacks to cromwells puritans the first night right after his acquittal there had been his former officers to roister with but they had departed the day after back to hms savage at torbay taking burly landsman jones nelson with them for he sorely missed his fellow black mates and felt lost without them next to go not a day after was aspinall em sir ah aspinall had stammered redfaced that morning i wonder could i raise a point with ya captain lewrie aye lewrie had said over his cocoa and jam the last time he had had personal service in his rooms at the madeira club say on tis me mother sir aspinall had explained all but wringing his hands the people she does for theyve been most generous an lenient with her th last few years sir but her ailments aint gettin better my sister rose sir shes in service with another household an cant see to her as she should so well ive alla my prizemoney an ive thought i could purchase a wee place fr all of us make her last years comfy in a place of her own dye see sir i woz wondrin might ya write admiralty for my discharge on famly grounds sir youd leave my employ as well lewrie had said stunned and feeling sudden loss aspinall had been with him damnednear forever and where would he get a cabin servant steward and cook as good as aspinall someone as understanding and comfortable fear i must sir aspinall had gloomed same thing really im that sorry tlet ya down sir an ill stay on til ya finds yer new man but no no aspinall lewrie had assured him ill look around for a while i may depend upon the staff at the madeira ill write admiralty at once humph tis good odds helld freeze over before they wish to employ me in future so i doubt id need anyone with so many skills as you possess but whatever shall you do to earn a living aspinall prizemoneys fine but it wont last forever uhm nossir aspinall had related a lot more cheerfully i know a man in th publishin business intrested in my journals an those songs i collected aboard ship along with amusin anecdotes mongst the lads an such he thinks we can sell a lot of them to lads intent on volunteering aspinall and his publishing partner had been a bit more aspiring than that was the first volume successful there were plans for a guide to a world of useful sailors knots along with a companion book on the making of sennetwork small stuff into rings bracelets necklaces and doilies the sort of things that sailors wove for loved ones in their offduty hours or make and mend sundays all lavishly illustrated of course for aspinall had always been a dabhand sketch artist saving the cost of hiring one thered be a guide to the various parts of a ship the standing and most especially the running rigging that controlled the sails all an eager lubber needed to find his way through the mysterious world of the sea and its arcane language for there would be a lexicon of all the former and current slang and jargon decyphered for the complete neophyte it had been with some measure of surprise and a great deal of reluctance for lewrie to wish aspinall and his family well offer to write admiralty that very day obtain his discharge and final reckoning of his pay and to be gracious offer his name as a subscriber to all the future works even pen a recommendation to introduce the first one assuming the use of his name would not drive purchasers away from it wife reclused from him in high dudgeon in anglesgreen down in surrey and his daughter charlotte clinging to carolines skirts and her spites sewallis and hugh both back at their public school now hilary term was begun and christmas holidays were over and busy with their lessons his brotherinlaw the one whod still talk to him burgess chiswick was headoverheels in love newly affianced to the lovely and rich theodora trencher and also busy with his newly purchased majority in a foot regiment the only people left to lewrie from family inlaws or contemporaries in the navy was his slyly irish coxn liam desmond and desmonds old comrade the simple but strong patrick furfyneither of whom could butler valet or even boil a pot of water far as he knew of their civilian skills both those worthies much like his cats toulon and chalky did seem more than happy to remain with him for several very good reasons firstly they were not presently at sea and could stay warm and dry for a change secondly the quality of their victuals beat navy issue food all hollow thirdly there were thousands of pubs and taverns in which to slake their thirsts and at lewries expense and fourthly said taverns were in london where there were women by battalions for them to ogle flirt up and serve jack sauce or manage to put the leg over by finagling or the offer of a shilling or three and london was so full of theatres music halls exhibits and pleasure gardens and street rarees that desmond and furfy likely felt theyd gained the sailors paradise fiddlers green where every lass was comely and obliging the music never ceased rum and ale flowed round the clock and publicans never demanded the reckoning stout fellows in the main the both of them but like his cats they werent good conversationalists they werent aspinall chapter six the admiral boscawen coffee house at the corner of oxford street and orchard street site of the present day selfridges was just the sort of warm and cozy place that lewrie needed after a brisk stroll from the corner of duke street and wigmore street there was a blueaproned lad to take his hat cloak and walking stick a man to see him to a table of his own not too far from one of the two blazing hearths and yet another young man to fetch him his first cup of coffee with cream and sugar before toast butter and jam could be fetched there were piles of newspapers from which to choose as well and lewrie who had been rather busy at saving his arse the last week or so was glad to find some back numbers so he could catch back up with the latest doings brown bread fer toast only sir sorry tsay the waiter apologised after laying a plate before lewrie th lord mayors gotta down on white bread long with the crown its been banned lewrie had to gawp bad harvest they say sir the waiter said with a shrug th war an all anything else sir not for the moment no lewrie told him at least there was still more than enough fresh butter and a full pot of lime marmalade truth to tell lewrie rather liked brown bread so the ban on fine white bread was not much bother he was hungry enough by then to chew sawdust and the coffee was decently hot for a rare wonder which was one reason why he preferred the admiral boscawen in the times there was a reprint of the kings address to the closing session of parliament on new years eve which had featured king george escorted from the presence chamber by both admiral hood and nelson to the throne and lewrie stopped chewing long enough to read the detention of property of my subjects in the ports of russia contrary to the most solemn treaties and the imprisonment of british sailors in that country have excited in me sentiments in which you and all my subjects will i am sure participate far from english waters most of the previous year off the foes shores in the mouth of the gironde river and weeks from fresh papers from home hed missed most of the dustup with the danes british and danish warships had tangled in the mediterranean in the summer the danes insisting that their convoys and independent merchant ships were not subject to stopping for inspection for contraband that might aid the french a danish frigate the freya had traded a few shots off the english coast later on striking her colours to protect another small convoy just before christmas the danes swedes russians and even the mostly landlocked prussians who had hardly a navy or merchant marine to speak of had resurrected their former armed neutrality which they had insisted upon none too strenuously during the seven years war and the american revolution russia had gone even further seizing nigh three hundred british merchantmen in their ports and forcemarching nearly a thousand british captains mates and sailors off to the wilds of siberia just as winter was coming on if it shall become necessary to maintain against any combination the honour and independence of the british empire and those maritime rights and interests on which both our prosperity and our security must always essentially depend the king had further declared i enter no doubt either of the success of those means which in such an event i shall be enabled to exert or the determination of my parliament and my people to afford me a later edition of the times told that the public will learn with great satisfaction that lord nelson is about to be employed on a secret expedition and will hoist his flag in the next few days his instructions will not be opened until he arrives at a certain latitude we shall only permit ourselves to observe that there is reason to believe his destination is to a distant quarter where his lordships personal appearance would preponderate over the influence of the intrigues of any court in europe lewrie scoffed to himself with an audible snort mine arse on a bandbox not now it aint some news writer needs to be shot its the baltic for certain even if he cant take his dear emma which thought make lewrie smirk those prim and newly righteous hosts and hostesses of his were down on horatio nelson just promoted to viceadmiral of the blue on new years day hed been jumped from the eleventh of fifteen rearadmirals of the red over senior men and even if his rash actions had won the battle of cape saint vincent even if he had destroyed a whole french fleet at the battle of the nile then captured malta that was grumbled over not cheered for nelson was not quite respectable not enough for them anyway nelson was carrying on an affair grand to some infamous to others with lady emma hamilton doting over her like a calfheaded cully in creampot love right out in public and with her doddering old husband sir william hamilton by their side lewrie had heard he snubbed his longsuffering wife fannie leaving her to trail behind like a maidservant at an admiralty supper back in november she had sat mum watching her husband spoon and gush over the bouncy buxom emmas every word shed shelled some walnuts for him and put them in a glass which nelson had so brusquely brushed aside that the glass had been broken and it couldnt have been blamed on his blinded eye gentlemen of the aristocracy and squirearchy had been having mistresses and affairs time out of mind it was almost considered the proper thing once male heirs were assured upon the wife though an affair was not usually so overt with the husband tagging along and a fuming wife in tow most british gentlemen would hardly cock an eye over such the man was a fighter and won battles by god the common people and the mob loved him and with their usual waggonload of common sense cheered him like billyoh and if a naked romp with emma hamilton in the middle of the strand took place at noon theyd chortle and snigger and call him a hell of a fellow huzzah maybe i should let folks know how caroline and i stand lewrie idly mused or that i rantipoled the mort in naples long before him any odds ye wish the suppers im invited to would be from a livelier set had emma too did ye why ye could dineout on that for years his toast done and with a fresh cup of coffee poured and milked and sugared to his taste lewrie read on through the pile of papers an item in the morning post spoke of armaments being carried on in swedish and danish ports a rupture with the new northern league and it is daily expected that orders will be issued for capturing the vessels of those nations tit for tat seize our merchantmen well seize yours and from the times on the thirteenth of january there was even more lunacy yesterday lord nelson took his leave of the lords of the admiralty and this morning his lordship will positively leave town to hoist his flag we have reason to believe to know his destination is not the baltic my god they cant be that clumsy lewrie muttered not the baltic who do they think theyre fooling i ask you who indeed sir a fellow in navy uniform scoffed as he and two others took seats at the next table over he was a lieutenant and with him was a midshipman and an older fellow in civilian clothes i beg pardon for intruding but how open may our press be to speculate or publish rumours of things that should remain secret so freely i saw in the times on the sixth that admiral nelson was to be sent to the dardanelles to chastise the russians there what foolishness with admiral lord keith already in the med with a strong fleet lewrie said with one mocking brow up nothing for nelson there if we wish tswat the bears nose lord keith allied with the ottoman turks since napoleon invaded the holy lands can kick the russians in the fundament while nelson goes for their throat in the baltic soon as the ice melts good morning to you lieutenant young man sir god your manners george the elder fellow chid him allow me to name my nephew to you sir for you sound like a navy man this is george follows the younker here is my youngest son roger oglesby soon to go aboard his first ship and i am william oglesby captain alan lewrie sirs lewrie said rising to shake hands with them all b black alan lewrie the midshipman gushed guilty lewrie said with a chuckle though he felt like wincing over that sobriquet or as the court recently decided not ha a pleasure to make your acquaintance mister oglesby mister follows midshipman oglesby will you join me at my table sirs what ship he asked as they moved over to sit with him ehm im to go aboard the trojan sir seventyfour midshipman oglesby shyly said with cousin george im fifth officer into her captain lewrie lt follows said eyes alight with glee to be introduced to an officer with a reputation in the fleet as a scrapper who went after enemies with the ferocity of a howling tom hence the name follows morelikely knew the ramcat that or as lewrie sarcastically suspected to run into a lucky thief in the flesh i convinced my captain that trojan needed another gentlemanintraining the more the merrier hey weve spent the last two days purchasing the lads seachest and such the elder oglesby told lewrie with a wink george here supervised so rogerd not go to sea with an hundredweight of useless fripperies tomorrow well all coach down to portsmouth and the very best of good fortune go with you sirs lewrie wished them as the waiter arrived to take their orders why with any luck trojanll be in the thick of it by midmarch and you captain lewrie lt follows enquired will you be with us do you imagine he sounded eager enough for a good fight i had to give up command of savage before christmas lewrie was forced to admit the trial and all dye see and so far i have not yet heard from admiralty as to any new openings one hopes for another frigate even one half as fine but he ended with a shrug as if it was only a matter of time before he received a fresh active commission though in his heart he was deadcertain that hell would freeze over before lord spencer or evan nepean would consider him decent enough to command another kings ship devlishodd this russian business the elder oglesby said as he spooned sugar into his tea thought we were allies not all that long ago now this nonsense that tsar of theirs must be daft if he thinks he can take on england mans got a huge army already and millions more peasants to conscript if he feels like it lt follows remarked as he stirred up his own tea big as the french army is reputed to be with that levйe en masse of theirs i expect the russians could field three times as many men and wouldnt that be grand to see the tsar and bonaparte going at each other hammerandtongs he can parade an army lewrie said but i doubt hes any experience with ships strong as the russians are on land i doubt anyoned try to invade so they really dont have much need of a fighting fleet and dont expect their navy to have much of a role to play if anyone did what did the russians do at sea back when they beat the swedes early last century galleys and gunboats rowed up coves and marshes round the maze of islands up the rivers well they did send a strong squadron alongside us when we went at the dutch in mr oglesby pointed out dont recall all that much action at sea then another fleet from the black sea lt follows added sailed round the aegean and the med and their black sea fleet has gained a lot of experience gainst the turks over the years when catherine the great was still alive she knew to maintain an efficient navy even if about half the officers were really british or americans like john paul jones midshipmantobe oglesby dared to contribute to an adult conversation ive met some fellows who served with the russians follows told them when they couldnt find a post in our navy promotion is quicker in russian service and the rates of pay are more lucrative though i never heard them say much good of their ships or their men how so sir lewrie prompted waving for a fresh coffee the way they told it captain lewrie is when the russians need warships they go level several forests and set up shipyards on the banks of the nearest river to the sea they round up just any old sort of carpenters and put them to work in workregiments using green wood with no more seasoning or drying than the timbers get coming down to the banks from the woods on waggons and they conscript their men the same way turn army regiments into sailors overnight conscript serfs from the nearest estates and drill them like parade ground soldiers on facsimiles of masts and decks ashore whilst their ships are still building good for part of the year but when their northern ports freeze up theyre crammed into infantry barracks ashore in unutterable squalor til theyre needed again and its a wonder half of them dont perish and by the time theyre ready to go aboard in the spring its good odds their assigned ship has already rotted and must be replaced id expect things are better in the black sea where they may sail almost yearround lt follows allowed but their fleet in the baltic may not be all that formidable never heard the like lewrie scoffed thats an insane way to care for a ships crew or train it to excellence not our way certainly sir lt follows agreed im told their discipline is hellishhe winced as he saw his uncles deep frownbrutal in the extreme russians are so ive heard a cruel and surly race their peasants little better than dumb beasts rolling round in pigstys illiterate in the main and horrid drunkards do they get their hands on vodka they go as mad as red indians and just as dangerous to themselves as anyone who crosses their path with such men id imagine only the catoninetails can keep control hmm like british tars with a shipload o wine or rum lewrie japed give them just enough of a vodka ration tkeep em mellow do they devilish tipple that worse for you than gin back in better days not all that long ago during the frost fair on the frozen thames lewrie had run across eudoxia durschenko in an offmoment from her role in wigmores peripatetic extravaganza and had tasted a sip of vodka used as he was to imported kentucky bourbon hed thought hed poisoned himself it was better icecold she had told him but he rather doubted it at least it did not have the juniper berry taste of good old british blue ruin malta was the problem with the tsar mr oglesby mused aloud we took it back from the french before the russians could get there admiral nelson hoisted the flag of the kingdom of naples and the two sicilies stead of our flag or the russians and the tsar mostlike was mad enough to fall down and chew the carpets over it that king ferdinand of naples was the real owner in a way after all and lord nelson spent a lot of time with king ferdinand and his wife our ambassador to his court sir william hamilton lewrie said leaving emma hamilton unsaid they did influence him for certain but i was in naples in through and dined with king ferdinand several times dye know he maintained a waterfront fish shop where he did the cooking an odd sort o bird and a dabhand cook too but i never heard that naples claimed malta t wasnt malta owned by the knights of saint john of jerusalem since the crusades ah but king ferdinand is the grand master of the knights sir mr oglesby slyly returned the real one i suppose though i heard that the tsar thought he was since a few knights in the russian court flattered him up and held an election of their own making him the grand master imagine what an uproar that could cause in russia their own tsar the upholder of the orthodox church accepting an honourific that is usually awarded by a catholic pope ha ha the tsar had another grudge with us too lt follows contributed during the holland expedition there were two prizes taken not worth tuppence really a fiftysix gunner and a seventy gunner were supposed to be russian prizes but we kept them my lord is he that petty lewrie said amazed it would appear so captain lewrie mr oglesby said nodding whats worse when his mother catherine the great was still with us in turkey declared war on russia for the umpteenth time and we great britain and prussia egged the swedes to invade russianowned finland so tsar paul crown prince paul then naturally despised us for meddling and distrusts us to this very day the only reason russia became our ally in was because he thought that napoleon bonapartes invasion in egypts final aim was against russia not our possessions in india why else would he ally himself with his worst enemy the ottoman turks against the french oglesby said with a mystified shrug perhaps only the madness of kings may explain why the tsar now is so enamoured of bonaparte and the french napoleon told the tsar hed surrender malta to the russians lt follows stuck in only the russians and napoleon had captured thousands of russian soldiers when he conquered switzerland to make the deal sweeter he returned them in new uniforms boots and kits with all their colours as a gesture of good will hmmph lewrie commented i spose that would be enough for the russians to say thankee kindly and stand aloof from now on but to cozy up to the frogs surely their aristocracy should be quaking in their boots lest all that jacobin french insanity take root in their country libertй йgalitй fraternitй and bloody revolution would be the end of em whish chop he said miming the drop of the guillotines blade with one hand ive an acquaintance whos russian whos told me how they use their serfs so cruelly let the landless powerless slavepeasants get a whiff of freedom and rise up and itd be the terror all over again with the slave revolt on saint domingue thrown in to boot factor in captain lewrie the atheism of the french jacobites mr oglesby sagely pointed out in full agreement with him russia is a deeply religious country though its orthodox church is even more of a mystery to me than popery id imagine their theologians and lords spiritual would consider the french the very imps of hell and their first consul napoleon bonaparte the antichrist revealed indeed uncle lt follows chimed in one of the fellows who took service in their navy told me that the peasant conscript sailors board his ship took the authority of their priests as solemn as their officers and that the only reason there werent more revolts by serfs out in the countryside was deathly fear of condemnation and excommunication by the local priests even nobles walk wary round them after a thousand years of servitude with the threat of abandonment by their church and the coming of the cossacks to hack them to pieces should they turn on their masters abject subservience and resignation to a life of misery is common mind he said your average russian sailor or soldier is a marvellous fighter if decently led and treated lt follows said on with a grin but dull as oxen in the main superstitious uneducated and easily controlled so long as one doesnt act too much the tyrant push em into a corner whip em for no reason lewrie mused aloud you bully and beat a puppy you end up with a wolf whod tear your throat out sounds tme as if all russia is teeterin on a thin razors edge with nothing but the fear of hell and cossack sabres to keep it from exploding a grievous social system mr oglesby sadly commented much like our own west indies colonies or the american south with so many restive slaves i doubt any rich or titled and landed russian dares sleep too sound of a night surely the tsar knows as does his court nobles and church leaders how dangerous this new friendship with the french can be well you mentioned the madness of kings lewrie japed but as you say surely those who have the tsars ear could advise him not to run the risk fellows a nero a caligula mr oglesby said with a sniff of disdain emperor of all the russias reputed to be as mad as a hatter and unlike our parliamentary system hes a total autocrat as powerful as any roman emperor with nothing and no one able to rein him in and like a caligula the tsar is indeed mad cruel sadistic and is rumoured to be perverted cover your ears roger there is evil coming he told his youngest son who had been sitting gapejawed to be allowed to hear adults talking of such worldly things the man is said to have the morals of a wild beast such that no woman from the highest to the lowest palace servant is safe some also say that no man is safe either mr oglesby added with a grimace of distaste of such practices does he take a dislike to someone noble valet or stableman because he didnt like the wine the temperature of the soup someones new suit or dress hair ribbons or a beard not shaven that morning well off one goes to gaol siberia or a dungeon full of instruments of torture russia has already had one ogre such as he ivan the terrible mr oglesby intoned with a grim nod thankfully the russians did away with him though i cannot help but imagine that his death was but a temporary respite an absolute monarch will sooner or later turn monstrous if only to preserve his seat on the throne which is so rewarding and pleasing well with luck perhaps his nobles will treat this tsar paul as they did their ivan the terrible lt follows said with a laugh oh i know lиse majestй and all that he partly retracted not a tick after but still with a merry air yet hes not our king thank god midshipman oglesby piped up and perhaps the newun might take years before he goes as mad as his predecessor ha ha lt follows suggested unless insanity runs in the romanov family peter the great was sane mr oglesby pointed out though i cant recall why his heirs werent suitable to rule and russia ended with a german girl on the throne after the dowager tsarina died and catherine got rid of her useless idiot of a husband no one could say that catherine the great ever evinced the slightest sign of madness her son though well he said finishing his latest cup of tea and dragging out his pocketwatch good lord lads we were to meet the wife in the strand by twelve we must go else shell be wroth with us me more to the point you will pardon us do we depart captain lewrie it has been a pleasure to make your acquaintances sirs and a most enlightening conversation for which i thankee lewrie said as they all rose and made their parting salutations after theyd bustled out the door in overcoats and boatcloaks lewrie decided that he might as well pay his reckoning too and hunt up his own midday meal stultifying and as earnest as dinner conversation at the madeira club could be with so many gentlemen who had made their fortunes in trade sharing stock tips and complaints about workers prices and goods the club did lay a good table and could boast of a wine cellar that even almacks whites or bootles might envy there was also the realisation that said table said wine list was included in his weekly fee which his father had arranged for him which was about a quarter less than the others were chargedin some instances being kin to the old lecher had its advantages was his pace quick enough he could just make it back in time for a glass of something warming before the dining room door opened though as he maintained a brisk stride back up orchard street to wigmore street lewrie could not help recalling a latenight talk with that devious old rogue zachariah twigg nearly two years before when his legal troubles were just beginning to come home to roost twiggs grand scheme did not care a whit for the abolition of slavery though many of the reformers thought him an ally against the peculiar institution did not care if thousands of planter families in the west indies were impoverished should slavery be outlawed in the british empire along with the slave traders and shipping interests in west country seaports what twigg intended was to cripple any threat to great britain from slavedriving nations with his own country and its abolition of slavery the shining example the united states of america for one whose economy treasury and power was based on agricultural exports mostly reaped by slave labour create a rebellion as bloody as saint domingue or haiti or whatever they were calling it these days and america might even fracture in twain with one of the halves forced to ally itself with great britain against the other half perhaps even see the error of its ways and rejoin the empire someday no matter how much blood might be shed in servile revolts and civil war no matter how many hundreds of thousands perished and hadnt russia come up that night what had twigg coldbloodedly said that if russia ever turned its insatiable appetite for conquest westward and set its massive peasant conscript armies on the march those white slaves the serfs could be turned against the nobility and the landowners against the tsar himself and all the cossacks in the world could not put down the revolution the civil wars tween the warlords that would ensue in the holy names of abolition and freedom russia now seemed a foe and what was twigg up to in the face of that it wasnt just the nip in the air that made lewrie shiver chapter seven there was a warming pea soup served with a pleasant hock then dover sole with boiled potatoes and carrots the salad course was nothing worth much in the dead of winter but the roast pigeons accompanied by more potatoes carrots and peas was succulent and complemented by a promising beaujolais cheese sweet biscuit and the port some of the houses famed namesake a portuguese madeira finished off the meal which despite the victuals was nothing but a litany of bad sad gloom and the portent of utter ruin some of lewries fellow lodgers while not strictly so deep in trade that they kept a shop and handled money directly had all taken flyers on the exchange had invested in stocks and bonds beyond the safe and sane three percents and the sinking fund as a repository for their newmade men profits and the northern league recently formed round the shores of the baltic their armed neutrality and the threat of an expanded war had many of them shivering like a dog that was trying to pass a peach pit as an american naval officer had so vividly said to lewrie a few years back the tsar is so demented he could be committed to bedlam said one who had invested heavily in naval stores they dont have one an army officer in mufti rejoined well they should the civilian fellow reiterated and that king christian of denmarks not a whit better how else explain why the danes joined russia in this pact same as the swedes old man said another near the head of the long table its fear of what russia would do did they not sign on king christians in bedlam of a sorts already the army officer snickered called his royal apartments soon as the danes ousted king georges sister caroline matilda and chopped the head off her lover what the devil was his name their prime minister then struensee a much older gentleman told them between bites of his meal johann friedrich struensee and one of the biggest fools of the age i remember it well a featherbrained german besotted with voltaire rousseau and all those pagan french reformers turned all denmark insideout before they did for him and his cronies imagine a commoner german running an entire country and fathering bastards on a queen hed all but buried king christian in a dungeon before he was deposed mind now the danish king needed to be put in a dungeon for he was a vicious lunatick so their crown prince the regent is really struensees illegitimate git a member asked egad they say not but he aint insane like the old king so the old gentleman lasciviously hinted they shuffled off the little princess they were sure struensee quickened her and crown prince frederick was the only male heir the swedes though lewrie posed beaten to a pulp by russia their northern empire lost back in the seventeentwenties the army fellow offered swedish pomerania gone polish provinces and finland too fear again sir why they even attempted to fight the russians again in is beyond me but what about prussia signing on another asked fear of russia again the army officer said with a shrug perhaps a fear of france too after napoleon gave them a drubbing better to crouch in russias shadow than stand out in the open alone and since as captain lewrie here will tell you the prussians dont have much of a navy nor much of a merchant marine either its no skin off their nose aint that right sir nothing to lose at sea if we retaliate for certain lewrie agreed as he broke open a fresh hot roll and buttered it all those ships confiscated put out of business the investor in naval stores bemoaned its an outrage a violation of a solemn treaty and the embargo they threaten on their goods will cripple our navy pine mast stocks tar pitch turpentine and resin hemp for sails and rope rigging well theres nova scotia and the maritime provinces theres wilmington north carolina lewrie suggested much the same available in new england vermont new hampshire and such longer voyages higher prices the sad investor grumbled aye trust the yankee skinflints to take quick advantage of us and wring every penny they can from our lacks another said do they not embargo us as well a very gloomy cynic down the table posed theres no love lost twixt them and england since the revolution ended and despite that little notquitewar they had in the united states still thinks the french hung the very moon demned wars gone on long enough someone said oh i say now several cried weve not a single ally left bonapartes driven naples out of the war and beaten the austrians so badly at marengo and just last month at hohenlinden theyve sued for peace too the doubter retorted seven years of war worldwide millions of pounds spent to prop up socalled allies none of them faithful the treasury reduced to issuing paper fiat money prices five times what they were in and all these horrendous crushing taxes and what have we to show for it i ask you gentlemen a few conquests in the west indies more lands for rich sugar planters and nigh fifty thousand of our lads dead mostly of tropical fevers consider the very bread we eat today sirs rye or barley not wheat and oh dear there goes the price o beer and ale a younger wag said sniggering which at least gave most of them a relieving laugh staple of your common englishman indeed young sir doubting thomas quickly said and as you say becoming dearer by the minute as are all foodstuffs and goods yet do our common englishmans wages increase in like measure they do not and this war is pinching the very souls of the people hes to stand for a seat in commons next byelection or so i heard the army officer in civilian suitings whispered to lewrie god help us then lewrie muttered back yed think he was one of those who cheered the french revolution im sure twill be a pretty speech on the hustings the army man hissed behind his hand bloody liberals after dinner was done lewrie took himself upstairs to his rooms for a liedown he removed his coat undid the buttons of his vest and tugged off his boots he plumped up the pillows and stretched out on the newmade bed welcoming his cats toulon and chalky who awoke from a snooze on the bench before the fireplace and pounced up to join him with glad cries archbacked stretches and playful expressions there was nothing for it but to indulge them fetch some of their toys from the nightstand and dangle them by their strings letting the cats dash and pounce capture and leap til they were worn out and ready for naps of their own with toulon slung against the side of his leg and chalky softly purring on a pillow by his head not in the baltic mine arse lewrie thought as he tried to go to sleep yet mulling over all he had heard that morning nelson was the very fellow to daunt the danes swedes and russians did he get a fleet into the baltic before the ice melted at copenhagen karlskrona or reval and kronstadtbefore this new armed neutrality could get their fleets to sea and combinedhe could crush them as completely as he had the french in aboukir bay as odd a bird as lewrie considered horatio nelson to be he was a man who did nothing by halves at the battle of the saintes in the west indies in admiral rodney had been satisfied to capture only five french ships of the line and let the rest slink off lewrie had been at the battle of st kitts and had watched the famous adm hood repulse the french fleet yet not go after them after they were cut up and damaged adm hotham in the mediterranean in whose laziness and caution had nighdriven lewrie berserk thought hed done very well to capture a mere two well the wind had been scant yet cape st vincent and camperdown lewrie wore the medals for both great battles and had seen adm sir john jervis old jarvy and adm duncan in action despite their estimable repute as scrappers jervis had let the spanish fleet return to port after taking only a few ships as prize two of them nelsons doing that day whilst at camperdown at least duncan had managed to overawe the dutch and force them to go about and head for port scotching their hope to link up with a french fleet in the channel and invade england firstly then herded the foe into the shoal waters of their own coast strung out in a long line of battle before driving right into them in several columns at right angles and shattering them thoroughly taking most of them as prizes in nelsonfashion or duncanfashion lewrie thought with a snigger recalling the wildhaired towering duncan whod take you on with his fists for the possession of a wheelbarrow if his blood was up and when does the bloody ice melt in the baltic anyway he asked himself wishing he had asked one of the trading gentlemen attable an hour before truth to tell lewrie had never served in the baltic and in point of fact had only the foggiest notion where sweden denmark and prussia were much less the location of their naval bases they all lay to the east he was pretty sure tother side of the north sea with russia the furthest east of them all where one ran out of sea water supper then up early tomorrow lewrie ordered himself drop by admiralty see in what odour im held then a bookstore or a map makers another good nap after that then the theatre again or ranelagh gardens there would be a grand expositon of new nautical art held there through the spring along with a magic lantern slide depiction of the battle of the nile replete with stirring musical accompaniment and a narrator hidden behind a curtain lewrie had bought his children one of the smaller magic lanterns at scotts shop in the strand for christmas along with bissingers chocolates and a new doll for his wee daughter charlotte one of the better ones that went for ten guineas hopefully the boys hadnt burned down the house with the oil lamp yet or broken all the glass slides supper scraps suit ye lads lewrie asked his cats toulon cocked his rather large head up over his thigh for a second or two gave out a guttural closemouthed mrr then lay back down chalky stretched out his forepaws to touch lewries head and yawn all white teeth and pink mouth before dozing off again too thats what i thought lewrie muttered closing his eyes once more chapter eight lewrie had found himself an atlas so at least he knew where the possible enemies were sayers amp bennetts had baltic charts and largerscale charts of their principal naval harbours so he had a rough idea of how things lay as for when the ice melted though all hed gotten was a daylong series of shrugs admiralty had been no better the infamous waiting room was an arseholestoelbows chamber of hopefuls so many of them that the fireplace was almost redundant when it came to heating that large room as the lucky ones holding active commissions or warrants crowded in for a bit were ushered abovestairs then came clattering quickly down with a fresh set of instructions and making hasty departures not without a smirk or two from some of the cockiest of the lucky at those cooling their heels in hopes of employment a hint of action the chance of more older warships being fitted out and manned brought out even the nighdead oh it was a grim mob that lewrie beheld there were grizzled lieutenants in their fourties captains in need of crutches in their sixties all of whom had been on halfpay since the end of the american revolution whose uniforms were ready for museum pieces all sniffing the air like whitemuzzled foxhounds who could barely walk anymore bleating like ancient sheep all rheumyeyed for just one more shot at sea christ is that what i have tlook forward to lewrie wondered to himself appalled he had sent his name up to the first secretary evan nepean round ten of the morning rather too quickly for belief a silkysmooth young snotty had called out his name and sought him out with a note of reply in hand for one brief moment lewrie had felt a surge of hope even through the flunkys smug smirk the first secretary regrets that pressing matters preclude an interview with you today cpt lewrie or in the near future at any rate there are no openings in the fleet at present for a cpt of your qualities given your single year on the senior cpts list and lack of seniority it may be some time before we may contemplate your active employment polite way o sayin itll be a cold day in hell lewrie thought as he quickly wadded up the note and jammed it into a side pocket of his uniform coat his face reddening in embarrassment and anger and that smooth young flunky was still standing there before him with a faint smirk on his face waitin for a tip lewrie harshly muttered bugger off with the eyes of an hundred or more of his contemporaries upon him lewrie gathered up his hat and boatcloak and prepared to depart his soul smarting to be gawked at and whispered about behind hands by such a pack of superannuated dodderers and droolers by failures and drunkards by fools too lackwit to pass their lieutenants exams and incompetent twits and nohopes worse yet to imagine what false sympathy some felt bugger him more chance for me oh poor fellow the bastard born one ye know hee hee to be pitied by such a lot off to a new ship are ye sir the garrulous old tiler said as lewrie stepped through the anteroom for the doors to the walledoff courtyard well i reckon yell give them damned rooskies a good bash on th noggin hey sir make way fer a fightin captain ye younkers the old fellow barked at an incoming pack of lieutenants and midshipmen part like the red sea fer moses there an git ye in theres a mob o others waitin so dont git yer hopes too high standin room only an dont tread on nobodys boot tips neither mind har har equally galling were the smiles and appreciative looks from the many civilians round the environs of whitehall england might be all alone against france without allies and threatened by a fresh set of enemies the wars length and cost might be wearying yet the navy would set things right the royal navy aye the navy and nelson the people who doffed their hats the ladies who inclined their heads with grins imagined lewrie off to save them why else was that naval fellow so grimfaced and walking quite so quickly surely eager to board his ship and fillet anyone who dared challenge great britain why the angry stamping of his boots denoted dread determination egad see how his hands flex so on the hilt of his sword and all damn my eyes wasnt he that lewrie chap by god then god help the roosians maps and books just making ready capt alan lewrie rn sure to unemployed til the dawn of the next century fumed his way back to his rooms blackly contemplating how he might trail nepean home some dark night and throttle him for his haughty and brusque dismissal how hed go about challenging the next sniggerer or smirker to a duel and how much pleasure hed find in the skewering or shooting of the fool damn my eyes theres going tbe a battle lewrie furiously imagined two or three of em if we can take em on separately and ill not have a part in em become one o those losers no ill not ever mine arse on a bandbox if ill haunt the admiralty beggin for scraps like a stray cur christ on a crutch ive put in twentyone years most of em at sea and miserable too they dont want me any longer well just bugger em somethin tbe said for warm and dry for a change thirtyeight wasnt all that old he could comfort himself to think there were naval officers who had actually given up active commissions to sit in parliament go into business enter government service and make a pile of tin off the sops and graft that resulted lewrie imagined that taking holy orders was pretty much out for his sort even a lowly rectors position in a poor parish with an absent vicar taking the lions share of the benefice and tithes besides no one would ever believe it of him trade and business well he was a skilled mariner capable of being a merchant masterwas john company still grateful to him for saving that convoy in the south atlantic last year captaining an east indiaman would be pleasant and hellish profitable to boot or he could live on his invested prizemoney his savings with coutts bank and his late grandmothers ј annual remittance keep rooms at a family discount at the madeira club and become an idle wastrel about london where one could have a drink whenever drink by god lewrie muttered under his froststeaming breath i definitely need strong drink now drink and distraction as soon as he attained his lodgings lewrie made haste to strip off his uniform and pack it away in his seachest stow his cocked hat in a japanned wooden box and change into a tailcoat that was all the crack singlebreasted and cut to the waist with wide lapels and mshaped collars in a newly fashionable black over a snug pair of long grey trousers with plain and unadorned black boots on his feet minus the gold lace trim and tassels hed wear with his uniform to become even more a civilian his black neckstock he replaced with a cravat woven in blue gilt and cream paisley walking stick instead of sword a thimbleshaped black beaver hat with a royal blue band and short curled brims a singlebreasted overcoat with triple capes and he was ready for a good long and very unmilitary dinner a bottle or two of wine with port and brandy to follow and while away the rest of the day til it was time to toddle off to the theatre or ranelagh gardens with the aforementioned restful nap of course chapter nine the next week passed in slothful idyll late risings and lazy days followed by heady afternoons roaming central london for delightful diversions followed by even headier evenings there were public subscription balls drums and routs concerts and even a rare trip to a ballet or operaall followed of course by light midnight cold collations washed down with champagne and predawn tumbles into bed at the madeira club not to mention the requisite hangovers and while such a rakehell partially reformed as alan lewrie might have so far tumbled into bed alone it was a devilish closerun thing for london the greatest city in the world no matter what frogs boasted of their own paris possessed the most impressive collection of fetching young women of every stripe and grade actresses ballet dancers orangeseller wenches in the aisles grasswidows abandoned by straying or absent husbands still looking for affection the handsomest fetchingest young unmarried girls down to search for a suitable husband some of them coyly eager for a ride or two away from their unaware parents for a stray male london was a paradise and that didnt even begin to count the shop girls and house servants out on a spree on their lone days off or the ones of the commercial persuasion who ranged from costly courtesans and mistresses to the overmade brighteyed morts available for a kneetrembler in a dark doorway sadly though sometimes being regarded as a hero played to ones detriment people simply would regard lewrie as highminded or even respectable after all the flattering coverage in newspapers and abolitionist tracts the past year hed be introduced to lovely unmarried daughters by beaming papas and mamas but was expected to be the courtly but gruff seadog that it seemed all england expected even though the trial was over and he could be as beastly as he wished to be once more still there was that damnably honest part to play and god help him should he step outside it well there was theoni kavares connor the rich widow and mother of his bastard son she seemed to turn up wherever lewrie sported at least twice a week and made it quite plain that since he had so much time on his hands with his wife estranged from him and safely off in the countryside and how the devil shed discovered that lewrie had to wonder they should partake of a passionate rencontre and lewrie was not quite sure why he hadnt leaped upon her slim wee body and those glorious tits of hers yet there it was shiverin guilt mostlike he told himself or lingerin fear o gettin caught out equally maddening and mysterious was eudoxia durschenko with daniel wigmores socalled peripatetic extravaganza read circus cum theatrical troupe in winter quarters cross the river in southwark the girl was free to explore london too and maddeningly was simply everywhere lewrie had gone did she have a spy network worthy of zachariah twiggs or the secret branch of the foreign office did he hire a prad to take an icy but bracing ride in a park there eudoxia durschenko would be on her magnificent trained stallion moinya from her circus act did lewrie attend a subscription ball she was there too dressed in the height of fashion at ranelagh gardens covent garden theatres in drury lane shopping in the strand gawking at rarees and street performers and pursued by a clutch of rakehells and hopeful swains especially at those midnight champagne suppers with her exotically dark curly hair and highcheeked almondeyed features and full lips and those intriguing hazelamber eyes of hers eudoxia durschenko would have been the belle of the season no matter her class or origin and even the latest fashionable colours of puce lavender purple and all set well upon her graceful form even those sofapillow pizarro hats looked cunning atop her head in point of fact was he forced to choose between eudoxia and theoni connor lewrie would have plumped for the exotic russian girl hands down assuming he could wedge himself into her circle of admirers without looking like a total fool or moonstruck cully assuming eudoxias constant chaperone would let him unfortunately her father arslan artimovich durschenko was at her elbow constantly fetching as she was desirable as she was her father had once intimated that eudoxia was still a chaste young maid and he was determined for her to remain virginal even if he had to kill the first halfdozen young lechers who got within whiffing distance of her perfume it did not improve eudoxias romantic odds that her father was just possibly the scariest and ugliest patcheyed old devil lewrie had ever clapped his toplights upon the durschenkos claimed cossack origins so both were expert riders but arslan artimovich could swing a sabre with the best of them his previous circus act before the pan of a rifled musket blinded his right eye had been that of a marksman with any sort of rifle musket or pistol and the recurved asian bow and arrowsfrom horseback standing in the stirrups standing on the horses bare back hanging like a red indian under its belly or its neck the act that eudoxia now so ably performed after the accident hed turned liontamer and kept four of the beasts grown from cubs to huge rangy adults arslan artimovich was also able to substitute at the knifethrowing act he was in fine so menacing and scary that blackbeard and his pirates would have pissed their breeches in dread of him it must be admitted that arlsan artimovich certainly gave lewrie the squirts he had to admit though that the risk of his life to her papas vengeance or his lions just might be worth it kapitan lewrie zdrazvotyeh how good to see you again eudoxia had gushed the first night hed crossed hawses with her in the lobby of a theatre she had swept in from the cold swathed in a sleek long fur overcoat with hood soon as she had carefully removed the hood from her artfully styled hair she had boldly crossed to him and offered her hand to be kissed a regal yet eager smile plastered on her face and her eyes alight with glee my bold kapitan lewrie i was so relieved you are ac acquitted my english improves yes buzzhum of talk as he took her hand in his thats black alan lewrie dont ye know princess eudoxia from wigmores circus begad what a stunner indeed it does mistress durschenko lewrie had purred over her lacegloved hand it is my pleasure to see you again as well you are enjoying london he had asked lingering a trifle longer in his bow as she dropped him a fine curtsy her gown was lowcut and revealed a promising pair of poonts it amazes me kapitan eudoxia had declared pooh you do not use my name eudoxia aye lewrie had said with a sly smile one that she matched until they both heard a bears deep warning growl making him wonder if jose was there with his dancing bears paolo and fredo but it was arslan artimovich you remember papa kapitan eudoxia had said with a roll of her eyes and a minxish grin arslan artimovich sir lewrie had responded letting go her hand rather precipitously in point of fact and turning to bow greetings to her father delighted to see you well sir your servant kapitan lewrie the old cutthroat had rumbled arms akimbo to spread the wings of his own fur coat revealing a flashy blend of eastern and western garb a fur cap on his grizzled locks a doublebreasted tailcoat made of royal blue wool over a creamcoloured russian silk shirt that buttoned up the side of his neck a scarlet waist sash fortunately no sign of daggers or pistols shoved into it god be thanked buffcoloured snug trousers and tall topboots minus spurs you still alive arslan artimovich had added sounding as if he was rather surprised or was pointing out a temporary state dependent upon lewries behaviour he smiled evilly lewrie had tried to continue a conversation with eudoxia after that just long enough to not seem ungentlemanly or cowardly for he had felt a strong urge to toddle off to greet some others that was hard to do though for there came from the glowering papa durschenko a constant raspy whisper consisting of fondly recalled russian phrases such as peesa sikkim siyn tarakan nasyakomayeh and that old favourite gryazni sabaka what could one do when a lovely girls father called you prick sonofabitch cockroach insect and dirty dog all in stoneheavy cyrillic letters that sprayed the parquetry like blood from a cut throat you know o course that callin an englishman such things is cause for a duel lewrie drawled to papa durschenko then choice of weapon is mine that worthy offhandedly replied with a menacing hiss and a broad grin of expectation papa stoi stop insulting kapitan lewrie eudoxia scolded is boorish ne kulturny she said with her nose up evidently she had come a long way from her childhood cossack village or her familys nomadic yurt for all lewrie knew of her early years eudoxia mightnt be a grand actress but her turns with dan wigmores theatrical troupe had taught her how to playact wellborn hauteur her toplofty air put her papa in his place all he could do was utter an inarticulate grr and for a moment share with lewrie a frustrated look over his willful daughters new ways there was a sudden commotion at the doors to the theatre lobby with the crowd parting like the sea at a warships cutwater with men in royal livery leading the way the grand fellow in the very front waving a long staff in the bored manner of palace courtiers his royal highness george prince of wales the gaudily clad fellow in a powdered wig intoned in an equally bored manner and the clenchjawed nasally tone of the uppermost oxonian men bowed and ladies curtsied deeply all heads lowered as the prince swept in one hand languidly waving to one and all with a faint smile on his phyz and a nod to some he recognised well there was also a flirtatious glint perhaps even a wink to some of the prettier ladies though the heir to the throne acted as if his heart wasnt really in it til he espied eudoxia that is my dear the prince of wales murmured stopping before her ah em from the stunned eudoxia as he took her hand in his and brought it to his lips stunnin from the prince seen you ride and shoot what we were most impressed spasiba em thank you your highness eudoxia replied in a stutter like to faint yet reddening with pleasure yob tvoyemant from her papa and lewrie discreetly took hold of his arm before he reached out to strangle the fellow fascinatin hey the prince of wales asked of one of his simpering courtiers cocking a brow significantly lewrie realised that his courtier looked to be making a mental note to himself nodding to the heir as if he caught his meaning hed be up til dawn discovering where she lodged when she rode in the park and what her favourite colour was royalty bestowed upon her a departing nod a fond smile then glided on to the stairs to his reserved box doh eudoxia said under her breath employing her fan for its real purpose god above who is pasty fellow arslan artimovich growled the prince of wales heir to the throne lewrie explained one day hell be george the fourth a greatun for the ladies its said lewrie slyly added hoping that papa durschenko would lose sleep worrying over a rakehell royal instead of him sure tgod theres some nice jewelry headed her way lewrie thought with a wellrepressed snicker if the king lets him that is god damn kings and princes papa durschenko darkly muttered i wouldnt say that too loud were i you lewrie warned him paneemahyu he added using one of his very few words of russian englishmen take a very dim view of people insulting their rulers even pastyfaced princes calls himself florizel dont ye know he imparted in a whisper wants tbe everyones friend young women especially which information incited another grr from durschenko well ill take my leave of you sir mistress eudoxia lewrie said with a grin emulating the heir and taking her hand to be kissed im off to my seat and i hope you enjoy the show perhaps we may run into each other for a cold collation and some champagne grr leaving it at that lewrie had toddled off leaving eudoxia to her moment of glory and the greater adulation from her many admirers despite what her papa wished chapter ten the second week of lewries enforced idleness passed much in the same fashion as the first but with a lot less relish on lewries part his last rencontre with theoni kavares connor had turned out to be rather embarrassing in the vast rotunda of ranelagh gardens of all places shed been importunate and a bit of a shrew all but demanding that he pay court to her and lewrie never one to appreciate being pressed in a corner and with only the lamest of excuses as to why he had not yet dropped by namely that his new stature as a publick hero would not let him act as he had in the pastrespectability and all that theoni he had claimed which sounded stagey even to his earhadnt set all that well with her hissed like a bloody goose guardin her eggs lewrie had told himself at the time and like tpeck my shins an flog me theonis seething barely controlled anger then her tears had made a nasty scene for the crowd in the rotunda and sent lewrie on a lessthandignified trot to get away from her thankfully for the last three days he hadnt run into her anywhere after that he still slept in late but he didnt stay out quite as late in the ams as he had the first week fear of her he concluded so he haunted the madeira clubs library which contained rather a respectable collection of books and the common room with its cheery fireplace and comfortable leather sofas and chairs was a grand place to read up on all the latest editions mind none of them particularly salacious or interesting all followed the modern concept of edifying uplifting and useful or completely unworthy to the nineteenthcentury gentleman and damn priestley bentham and the whole lot of reformers lewrie stewed as he found most of them hard slogging he was all but nodding over a book as mystifying as any done by milton when a club servant ahemmed into his fist and handed lewrie a note ah hmm lewrie said as he opened it fearing that theonid run him to earth at last and wondering why there was nothing on the outside of the foldedover paper to show who had sent it christ he muttered once he had it open for it was from zachariah twigg my dear capt lewrie a matter has just yesterday arisen which i am sure will prove to be of the greatest interest to you should this note find you in your lodgings and not absorbed in your amusements do pray join me at my club almacks for dinner at one of the clock my man will await your prompt reply yr obdt servant twigg it was worse than theoni finding him worse than eudoxia dashing into the common rooms nude with her father and his lions in hot pursuit and out for lewries blood it was twigg damn his eyes whend he ever call me dear lewrie cynically thought and he just had tget at least one shot in bout my amusements oh this could be hellishbad who does he want me tkill and almacks he couldnt remember if that particular club was tory or whig and if it was did it really say anything about twiggs personal politics at least lewrie knew that almacks set a splendid table and twigg would be footing the bill so pen and paper please he told the club servant and i think theres a messenger laddie waitin there is sir ill fetch them directly the servant said so pleased to see you again lewrie zachariah twigg said in what could be mistaken for a pleasant tone almost purring with social oils as it were as he extended a longfingered skeletal hand to be shaken so pleased you got off and have been granted some time to reacquaint yourself to the joys of london life cold enough for you thankee for your invitation sir lewrie replied civil enough on his own part but still wondering whose throat those fingers had strangled lately not as cold as it was last week no but still chilly he felt like gawking at his plush surroundings for he had not been inside any of the grander gentlemens clubs in london except for the cocoa tree or one of the others that featured the hearty sort of revelry and gambling open to nonmembers and folk of both sexes after dark he felt like a countryput yokel just down from somewhere very dreary and shown into westminster cathedral for almacks was a grand establishment indeed done in the finest and subtly richest taste something warming perhaps captain lewrie twigg suggested as they strolled into a large library with many sofas and chairs a brandy for me hudgins yes sir and for you sir the distinguishedlooking older servant asked in a fair approximation of a courtly oxonian accent kentucky whisky lewrie requested a brow cocked in fun just to see if almacks stocked such spirits would evan williams suit sir thatd be splendid lewrie replied impressed even further a quiet corner over there ah twigg said pointing out one grouping of furniture near the tall windows at the far end of the room the tall and cadaverous twigg led the way swept the tails of his coat clear and took a seat on one end of a sofa while lewrie settled for a wingback chair nearby cold thats the bugabear lewrie twigg said in a petulant businesslike rasp enough cold to keep the danes swedes and russian fleets laid up inordinary and unable to sail the thames here in london is already thawing below london bridge and the rest of the river is open to shipping the passages into the baltic are free of ice and time is of the essence he promisin me a command lewrie thought with spurred hope of a sudden thatd be of great intrest tme like he wrote ive met some other officers who know some whove served in the russian navy sir lewrie told him frankly they dont sound so formidable conscript crews and all and limited sailing seasons in which twork their people up to competence in the baltic at least quite true yet with the russians combined with the danes as doughty fighters as the dutch and the swedes with a very competent navy things could get rather dicey should they put to sea together their numbers would be daunting so were the spanish at cape saint vincent lewrie scoffed i think old jarvy and nelson put paid to them despite their numbers you know that bonaparte is behind all this twigg said with a sniff and a thinlipped look of asperity anything to take pressure off france and force us to squander our own advantages far afield aye lewrie contentedly answered as he was handed a crystal snifter half full of amber bourbon as twigg got his own snifter of brandy from a silver tray both took a moment to swirl their drinks study the legs of evaporating alcohol which resulted and sniffed deep as over a fine wine only after their first sips did twigg continue its rather more devious than that lewrie twigg pointed out does this socalled armed neutrality no longer recognise our right to stop and search their ships for contraband or materials of war denying the existence of a blockade unless there is a royal navy warship off every bloody little pisspot of a port and limiting their concept of contraband to weapons shot and powder napoleon gets everything that he needs but cannon roundshot and powder with which to rebuild his own navy and equip an even larger army to the detriment of every nation in europe including us do but consider all that is exported from the baltic lewrie oh god hes lecturin his worst student lewrie thought with a silent groan hark tthis stupid have ye the wits tdo so flax and woven linen for sails twigg counted off with the fingers of his free hand pontificating as was his wont pine timber for masts and spars tar pitch rosin and turpentine with which to maintain ships not to mention fibres for ropes and cables ye did mention it didnt ye lewrie scoffed to himself as well as the raw materials for gunpowder manufacture twigg said on almost running out of fingers by then and the wool for uniforms the leather from russias vast herds of cattle for boots shoes saddles and harness and soldiers accoutrement pouches and belts swedish iron ore aye lewrie stuck in hoping to trump him on one item at least or hustle him along to his main point em twigg said looking puzzled for a rare once and peering at lewrie like he would at a talking cat iron ore yes i must allow i had not thought of that harumph well damme lewrie chortled in silence all good reasons to squash this pestiferous league of the north as soon as possible twigg added after another sip of his brandy west to east sir lewrie said smiling and crossing his legs with ankle upon knee the ice melts at copenhagen first and karlskrona in sweden second the russian ports of reval and kronstadt thaw last so we should engage them in like order as im sure that admiral nelson has already considered you impress me lewrie twigg said in genuine wonder or what passed for it at least it would seem that you have not squandered your free time ashore in idle pleasures not completely hmm you are quite implausibly still alive despite running into the lovely durschenko mort her wellarmed and tetchy father more to the point she seems tbe as well informed of my daily whereabouts as you seem tbe mister twigg lewrie answered shifting uneasily changing one leg to cross for another she knows im married since cape town and went nosehigh and disdainful of me for it yet he shrugged and the equally entrancing widow theoni kavares connor she of the currant trade fortune twigg drawled with a simper oh yayss he took a deep sip of brandy smiling and for such an imperious fellow almost mellowing to a soft chuckle of amusement im told that she rather uncannily is present wherever you go as well lewrie as good an intelligence service as yours i expect lewrie said rather morosely and took time to sip his drink and upon that head i have news which shall astound you mr twigg mysteriously imparted in a harsh whisper leaning closer ah hudgins my dear fellow is our table ready it is mister twigg the dignified majordomo assured twigg the one you requested in the alcoves for privacy you gentlemen are ready to dine yes let us repair to our dinner twigg decided rising with the sudden leggy spring a very large and lean grasshopper might flex i would have requested you dine me in at the madeira club lewrie though i doubt you would wish my discovery revealed on your home ground good as the kitchen is at the madeira as excellent as are its wine cellars still it has become a rather dull establishment abloodymen lewrie thought oh good enough when first started twigg allowed when the squirearchy down to london were its principal lodgersbut good godnow it is all trade and all these newmen those selfmade fellows in god knows what enterprises and rigourously humourless to boot such a commercial and grasping yet suddenly respectable lot good for cleanin up my fathers odour in london society his partnering with sir malcolm shockley in it lewrie commented and yours for lodging there twigg could not help remarking ouch and ow lewrie could only complain in silence chapter eleven twigg like all knowitalls who held information that one must know or dearly wished to know maddeningly kept his secrets through their repast though lewrie thought it a hellishgood repast and well worth the wait the sliding doors to their private alcove room swept open to reveal yet another splendid course a chicken soup laced with tangy tarragon followed by roast squabs with green beans in lieu of a springtime asparagus though dressed with a cheesy hollandaise sauce a bottle of pinot gris came with the first two courses and remained just long enough to accompany the midmeal salad of hothouse brussel sprouts and lettuce with a drippybacon dressing then came the main entrйe the sliced prime rib of beef with peas and frittered potatoes all sloshed down with a fresh bottle or two of claret and thickly sliced slabs of bread buttered and toasted with garlic white bread and the recent law bedamned apple pie a sauterne in counterpoint then port cheese and sweet biscuits followed all that and a silver pot of coffee was put upon the small sideboard to await their pleasure now to the matter at hand mr twigg said at last as those doors were swept shut at his gestured command making lewrie thank a merciful god that the trivial chattering entertaining as it had been was over your anonymous tormentor captain lewrie your wifes tormentor rather my irregulars have smoaked out the identity of the author of those scurrilous letters who is it lewrie demanded perking up when you delivered to me two letters at your wards marriage in portsmouth last year or was it at my town home here in london no matter the exact location recall i did remark that the author of them was obviously a person of some means possessed of a good copperplate hand and the purse with which to purchase very fine heavy bond paper oh god but he will prose on lewrie thought preen rather unfortunately such fine writing paper is available throughout london and many of the larger cities and towns twigg said frowning so until the unknown author sent a letter to your wife insinuating your further adulterous doings and was caught in the act we had very little to go on other than the clues unknowingly included in each of them to wit the proximity of certain suspected persons to you at the moment when you indulged your proclivity for the fairer sex ahem coming so is bloody christmas lewrie silently fumed wishing he could lay hands on twigg take him by the lapels and shake it out of him assuming lewrie lived after doing it it went without saying for as he could attest zachariah twigg one of the foreign offices master spies and cutthroats was a thoroughly dangerous man i could however reduce the number of suspects to those who could have witnessed or heard of your doings twigg archly related and through the employment of my irregulars discreetly surveill those in england twigg employed upwards of an hundred of his socalled baker street irregulars for his townhouse upon that thoroughfare was the very centre of his spiders web the lair from which he directed minor spies to keep an eye on foreign embassies even the friendly ones and foreign individuals who kept too lively a correspondence with people on the continent chambermaids and street vendors messenger lads cooks sweeps and beggars as well as an host of sharps from londons criminal element who could pick the right pocket crack the right window or door in the dead of night or the light of day copyists who could forge false information or duplicate hidden documents quickly so the housebreakers could put the originals back where theyd found them with no one any foreign spy the wiser til some other of twiggs minions recruited from the military who could safeguard the innocent or corner the guilty either leave them bleeding in some dark alley or simply spirit them away as if theyd never been never to be seen again sir malcolm shockleys wife lucy who was once one of those jamaican beaumans came to mind twigg simpered on for the first of these letters appeared soon after you ran into her in venice in whilst she was on her honeymoon tour of the continent with sir malcolm and sporting with that commander william fillebrowne who took your former mistress on tsktsk twigg said with a twitch of his mouth a rather disreputable baggage for all her beauty as for fillebrowne well hes the spiteful sort he proved that by throwing his possession of phoebe aretino in your face so tauntingly yet hes been at sea since and nowhere near any of your recent slips so we could eliminate him all this and the kings business too lewrie sourly asked two jobs for the price o one or something like that if you do not wish to know lewrie twigg warned say on then lewrie surrendered with a long sigh i was able to place a maidservant in the shockley residence to keep an eye on her correspondence twigg proudly explained with an assistant coachman as well able to report quickly and the most likely to be given the task of carrying any such letters lady lucy i have determined is not your tormentor well thats a relief i spose lewrie said going for the coffee cream and sugar on the sideboard pour one for me as well noir no sugar twigg ordered for a time i considered that the letters might have been a french ploy til i realised that no matter the wrath of guillaume choundas the americans exchanged him home in did you know that there was no real advantage in it not with you so junior and unimportant in the greater scheme of things demean me some more i ask you please lewrie fumed that lombardian female spy they set upon you in genoa that claudia mastandrea i therefore dismissed twigg said with a pleased sniff as he sipped his coffee as i did your former mistress phoebe aretino for though she may have prospered greatly the last few years and could buy expensive paper she is not as literate nor possessed of a fine handwriting as our culprit leaving lewrie pressed i even considered that your former ward la vicomtesse sophie de maubeuge might have written them if only to pique your wife and her interference in her early flirtations with that idiot neighbour of yours harry embleton to escape the dreariness of anglesgreen for the delights of london as she managed to do at last sophie never lewrie was certain enough to declare indeed the young lady in question is sweetnatured and kindly intelligent and commonsensical twigg admitted leaving lewrie posed again theoni kavares connor lewrie twigg said with a triumphant smile the mother of your bastard what why the bitch lewrie exploded not three days ago she was well it could have been embarrassing i know of it and it was twigg archly declared sniggering quite enjoying watching lewrie slowly twist in the wind consider the letters to your wife began in just after you rescued her from those adriatic pirates then bedded her on your passage back to gibraltar did you blab your peccadillos did you boast your older conquests to her christ no lewrie gawped mean tsay what gentlemend be that foolish twigg looked down the length of his long nose at lewrie as if he suspected that lewrie was that sort of gentleman superior bastard lewrie fumed to himself right she was grateful for her life her sons life lewrie said to fill the embarrassing silence that and pleasin sport after lightsout well and fleein the greek isles for good to come to england a step ahead of the french not sure shed keep the fortune in the currant trade her dead husbandd made and fear of how his kin would receive her she fell in love with you lewrie twigg said for all those reasons and your skill at rogering id imagine then to discover that she would bear your child and also discover what a rakehell you are yet still wished to keep you he trailed off with a gleeful smirk to take a sip of his coffee amazing how women find cads so intriguing and do anything to delude themselves and wish to keep their unworthy men had she any sense at all given your history with the ladies soon as she ferreted it out that she didnt simply write you off as a bad penny the boy i expect as if she needed me tsupport him lewrie scoffed shes as rich as the walpoles richer and its not as if she needed me for the guinea stamp her husband wasnt that long dead that she couldnt explain the boys birthing as legitimate so many bastards twigg pretended to be shocked one of them a midshipman in the american navy of all things half yours tother half a cherokee princess my word sir one could refer to your offspring round this world as the lewriean miscellany howd ye know o that un lewrie asked much humbled and pale i have my ways do i not twigg smugly simpered mmm dye mean theres others ye for me to know twigg almost laughed out loud for a rare once and for you to confront in future lewrie sure it was theoni lewrie said it was not a question really one thing he was sure of was that twigg knew what he was talking about when he finally got round to it watchers on the house a street urchin for running messages in my employ always at hand to deliver her correspondence twigg said she dont write her own ye know no she has a cultured personal maidservant for that who polishes things up and owns the fine hand evidently twigg said reaching inside his doublebreasted tailcoat to a breast pocket and withdrawing one of the poisonous billetsdoux your lack of attentiveness to mistress theoni connor of late and your public sham of respectability for society the last two years to satisfy wilberforce and his crowd prompted her to take desperate measures something about eudoxia lewrie quickly determined shes the only young woman ive been within sniffin distance lately am i right damme theonis little tantrum at ranelagh gardens tother day desperation exactly lewrie twigg informed him for here is a fresh one addressed to your wife one designed to even further infuriate your good if putupon caroline the goodscribbling maid was caught redhanded with it on her way to the posting house so the coach could deliver it to your house in anglesgreen we have her confession are you interested theoni knows of this lewrie asked well no wonder ive not run into her the last few days thought it was our spat but desperation indeed to see her schemes produce so little fruit over the years and you off at sea not exactly as diligent as earlier in answering her letters twigg elaborated we have a second meant for eudoxia durschenko the usual anonymous dear friend you must know laying out what an unfaithful cully you are to deflect her before the girl puts any more stock in you hah fat lot o good thatd do lewrie said with a wry laugh eudoxias known im married since cape town as i said and her papa already hates me worse than cold boiled mutton bsides did theoni have it scribbled in proper english i doubt either one of em could make heads or tails of it then why does she seem to run into you so often lewrie mr twigg sarcastically posed to him and why when she does does she evince such delight to do so even with her very watchful father at her side hmmm well er em lewrie stammered half intrigued by the sudden possibilities and half appalled with the image of how dead hed be should he run the risk surely she must see that its daft not to be better she takes up with the prince of wales hes intrested with florizel twigg scoffed now theres a slender reed poor fellow all he wishes is to be liked to be loved by one and all or merely appreciated good a king as he is george the third has been saddled with a sorry set of offspring oh there may be some gewgaws and presents from the heir but theyd come with social ruin for actresses and circus performers that might be good publicity lewrie cynically said draining the last of his cool coffee and going to the sideboard for fresh you should warn her off no matter twigg told him snapping his fingers and pointing to his own empty cup me why me lewrie asked talk to eudoxia or pour ye bloody coffee either one he thought for the good of the crown lewrie twigg told him impatient to have to explain things to lewrie and for more coffee i cannot for doing so would make it an official matter the peoples love for the royal family is paramount to continuing the war effort and another bloody scandal involving prinnie as some are wont to call him would harm that frankly i serve on sufferance as a partially retired consultant and to interfere in the heirs doings would be the ruin of me but since im already ruined theres no loss lewrie snapped that is pretty much it yayss twigg drawled smiling cruelly mine arse on a bandbox lewrie said with a resigned defeated sigh he poured twigg his desired cup too hash things out with theoni stop her business lewrie said as he sat back down idly stirring sugar and cream into his own coffee coach home and confront caroline with the truth too god o mercy well it is not as if you have much of anything else better to do lewrie twigg purred what with how things stand with you at admiralty at present oh thank you just so bloody much lewrie barked do you want to be reconciled with your wife lewrie mr twigg asked with a piercing probing stare well o course i do lewrie shot back hold on do i really he had to wonder though aye for our children if nothing else its not as if ive any other women in my life that i could dally with openly anyway nelson can get away with his affair with emma hamilton but even if we dont lewrie told twigg after all the tears that theoni put her through i put her through i owe caroline a semblance of a marriage she would never believe a word that crossed your lips twigg said matteroffactly for a change with none of his usual toplofty acid leave that to me after all twas i who sicced you on claudia mastandrea in genoa for the good of the crown that still leaves your corsican mistress phoebe aretino and theoni connor to deal with but one could be explained by long separation and the other by wounds and laudanum in the beginning and the machinations of a scandalous and crafty spiteful and possessive homewrecking bitch you would do that lewrie asked with his head cocked over it just wasnt like twigg to be charitable or very much care about people who were sometimes useful to him youve done me excellent service over the years lewrie twigg told him perhaps i feel as if i owe it to you i will coach to your home town with the evidence including the maids confessions and the last letter to caroline at any rate no need to include the one written to eudoxia directly hmm caroline will still think im trying to put the leg over her lewrie glumly confessed then amaze her and for a rare once dont mr twigg shot back with a brief bark of amusement her father would feed your choppedup carcass to his lions if you did ye know of that im quite aware lewrie replied in sour higg well that should conclude our business twigg said quickly finishing his coffee and tossing his napkin onto the table i must be off too damned many danes swedes and russians in england with the sudden urge to correspond with people in their home countries especially those who reside or trade in our naval ports codes to be decyphered whole letters to be lost or enhanced with false information twigg simpered throats to be slit lewrie posed tongueincheek as he rose well only do we must twigg said with a vague wave of his hand and an evil little grin i dont sppose you still have any influence with admiralty do you mister twigg lewrie said of a sudden mean tsay theres war in the offing and not all that much no lewrie twigg had to admit grudgingly as they left the alcove dining room and crossed the main hall towards the coat cheque not at least with the current administration over there though there are rumours hey pitt is quite unhappy twigg told him as a manservant took their tickets and went to fetch their hats and greatcoats he managed the act of union with ireland and convinced the king to ennoble all those new irish peers yet pitt hinged his entire legislation on a promise of catholic emancipation allowing papists to serve in the army navy and hold public office perhaps stand for seats in the commons as well king george however as defender of the faith as his full title tells us was adamantly against that does pitt step down dye see my meaning a new prime minister a new first lord aye lewrie enthused for a brief moment then deflated but probably someone whos heard of me and despises me as much as lord spencer already does damn nelson has already hoisted his flag in the san josef over at torbay in plymouth lewrie twigg further informed him as the servant returned with his hat greatcoat and long walkingstick and another club servant came to help him dress youve served under him i believe perhaps he could intercede for you and you did viceadmiral sir hyde parker good service and fattened his bank accounts with your seizure of all that lovely spanish silver a few years ago you could write him and ask for employment sir hyde whats he to do with this lewrie asked puzzled why sir hyde parker is to command the whole baltic god almighty parker lewrie was forced to gawp to wed again twigg snickered completely missing the point of lewries sudden discomforture and why not though his bridetobe is the daughter of admiral sir richard onslow frances i believe her name to be and is barely eighteen christ mister twigg sir hydes sixty if hes a day lucky devil twigg simpered as he drew on his gloves sir richard onslow to get a soninlaw so rich in prizemoney the girl to land such a secure future and sir hyde the ah fresh dew of her youth mister twigg lewrie muttered stepping closer to impart his knowledge of that worthy surely they must know that sir hydes not possessed of an urgent bone in his body twas his frigates that did his work for him and specially commissioned lesser tenders the frogs and the dons didnt have anything in the west indies with which to challenge us so sir hyde spent all his time sittin on his officiatin from his shore office and his flagship anchored til the apocalypse he mightve cruised barfleur over to saint domingue to talk with some of his junior officers now and again but he hasnt sniffed gunpowder since the american revolution indeed twigg asked down his long nose with a worried look on his skeletonously lean face now that is rather discomfiting news to me when speed is of the essence anent the melting of the ice over yonder in the baltic naval ports ah but he does have nelson dont he lewrie and with nelson involved a most impatient and urgent fellow he we cannot go very wrong well i am off lewrie i do hope my informations have lightened your burden somewhat you have my eternal gratitude sir for all youve done he had to respond with a hand upon his breast and a sketch of a bow ill hold you to that lewrie twigg said with an ominous look as he clapped his rather unfashionable old hat on his head one never knows when your ah inestimable talent for mayhem may prove useful again that promiseinparting turned the excellent meal in lewries innards to cold lead for he already knew what neckornothing harum scarum use twigg could put a fellow to and there was yet another cause for his dyspepsia now he knew that it had been theoni writing those letters all these years what was he to do about her and how best to go about crushing the spiteful bitch chapter twelve another hellishcold morning in london though the sun was out for a rare once and the sky was freshwashed and clear blue lewries breath steamed as he briskly strolled to the admiral boscawen coffee house deftly dodging the throngs of other pedestrians the trotting teams of carriages goods waggons and carts and the impudently rude london drivers and carters who filled the morning with shouts of by yer leave and ave a care there and make a way make a way ye bloody with the choicer curses bitten off admittedly it was rather early for lewrie to be astir given his bredinthebone penchant for laziness it was barely a tick after am and even the usually unperturbable servants at the madeira club had been forced to goggle their eyes to see him up and dressed so early and bound out the doors closehauled at a rate of knots once seated with a cup of coffee before him closer to the fire than before he slathered up a fingerthick slice of toast spread the jam heavy and chewed as he perused the morning post one of londons saucier papers and the one most filled with gossip and anonymous innuendo sir hyde parkers appointment to a command in the north sea has converted his honeymoon into a sort of ague a complaint always attended with a sudden transition from a hot to a cold fit a ragged earlier edition told him followed by the newest of that morning the thirtyfirst of january to wit should the gallant admiral who late entered the temple of hymen be sent to sea again he will leave his sheet anchor behind him which smirking line made lewrie wonder if the writers at the morning post were referring to nelson as well hadnt that worthy left emma hamilton behind to hoist his flag in the san josef wonder who writes this drivel lewrie pondered and how may i get in touch with one of em an put a flea in his ear he supposed that somebody perhaps a great number of somebodys fed juicy and lurid tidbits of scandal and gossip to the paper for the post and several other of the dailies seemed to be marvellously well informed with many of their racier items printed up the morning after the event not days or weeks later so they must have an host of tattlers and informers informers hmm lewrie thought zachariah twigg possessed an army of informers though he dreaded going to that well too often he was already too beholden to that toplofty old bastard lewrie also imagined that a clumsy call upon the offices of the post would result in gales of laughter and an item mocking his naпvetй printed the very next day yet there must be some way to expose theonis scandalous letters where does the post get all this drivel lewrie said as the waiter poured him a fresh cup of coffee and took his order for fried eggs a pork chop and grated potatoes theres thousands o waggin tongues sir the waiter replied with a snicker an grub streets full o scribblers livin hand t mouth in need o dirt dont work for the papers direct dye see might not eat do they not git a morsel twrite up an flog t which ever paperll take it most of em make their livins off the tracts an such hardfry yer eggs sir or do ye prefer em softer grub street hmm lewrie mused as he stirred sugar and some rather dubiouslooking fresh cream into his coffee didnt they do all those bloody tracts bout me for wilberforce and his crowd all those antislavery things while he was no longer the subject of almostdaily printings the campaign against slavery in the public mind and the halls of parliament continued with earnest hawkers on every street corner all it might take would be for him to accept one of the damned things see who had run it up and call upon the printer to offer his gratitude for all his efforts on his and the abolitionists behalf ha ha if one of the scribblers could be named he could approach him a bit of hemming and hawing as to how one might expose a woman who had caused a british heros wife so much pain carefully leaving out the fact of said woman bearing said heros illegitimate child of course with an authentic anger which he figured he could manage to convey hmm with a hint of a public scandal to come lewrie wondered something right out in the open like his scrambling from her sight at ranelagh gardens he imagined with a wince of chagrin to make it even juicier a story he took a sip of coffee and frowned as he considered how this plan might go awry am i devious enough tpull this off he thought never have been before dim bastard most people think me yet chapter thirteen think nothing of it captain lewrie mr leaver the rotund inksmudged proprietor of the printing business told him with a laugh you did us proud this past year with all the tracts and chapbooks ordered though tis rare for the subject of our firm to come calling with appreciation ha ha more like with an injunction dye see reverend wilberforce and his compatriots did us all proud as i see it mister leaver lewrie replied with all the financial support and the wellwritten articles placed in the newspapers well the texts were not our doing leaver told him as he poured them both companionable cups of warming tea in the back half of the firm past a high railing printing presses creaked and clacked like to drown out normal conversation and everyone but mr leaver seemed to be deeply stained and splattered black the proprietor was nighimmaculate by comparison the same person who provided the uhm copy to you wrote the newspaper items as well i spose lewrie idly wondered aloud trying for idle anyway i did notice a certain similarity in tone god help me does he ask for specifics lewrie thought wishing he could cross fingers for luck against that eventuality not exactly sure captain lewrie mr leaver allowed ruminating with a faint frown i usually never met the writers the text was delivered by someone with the abolitionist society and where they got it was anyones guess now there was missuz denby who writes for the papers who also came in with antislavery articles about you shell write for anybody sometimes the most scandalous flummery ahhmm gossip and such like in the morning post lewrie asked with rising hope and striving to not look hopeful hmpfh was mr leavers opinion of such missuz denby styles herself the doyenne of the qualitys doings though she writes under the pseudonym of tattler poor thing twas her late husband god rest him was a printer like me and a tract writer and not a bad hand when it came to turning a phrase ill give him that but once hed passed on missuz denby lost the business and has had to live by her wits since hardly a business for a woman hey at least she gained enough from the sale of the presses and such to keep body and soul together would have gone under in a year had she not women simply do not have the proper head for business i wonder how she manages to gather her information ive seen her articles under tattler and she seems remarkably well informed lewrie said even if hed never clapped toplights on that byline before in his life attends everything mr leaver said with a shake of his head brags that shes on catercousin terms with half the maids and footmen in london and that rich and titled ladies slip her gossip all the time why if she attends everything i must have run across her lewrie pretended to gape in astonishment cant miss her with all that red hair why speak of the devil if thats not her heading into chesters shop just cross the street this very minute leaver declared lewrie turned to espy a very chickabiddy dumpling of a woman quite short but done up in the latest fashionable colours of lavender and puce and sporting one of those pillowlike pizarro bonnets atop a towering oldfashioned mountain of vividly red hair good christ lewrie muttered see what i mean mr leaver said chuckling well thanks again for all your good services sir and i will take my leave lewrie announced slurping up the last of his tea and doffing his hat on his way out the door with undisguised haste he had a gossipmonger to deal with and time was of the essence your pardons maam but might you be mistress denby lewrie enquired with his hat to his breast and bestowing upon her a gallant bow as he did so to which the startledlooking woman replied with a quick dropped curtsy the one who writes under the name of well damme mrs denby yelped youre black alan lewrie to the life oh sir she gushed as she dipped him an even deeper and longerheld curtsy even if she had to brace herself with her furled parasol she rose at last looking as if she had tears in her eyes behind the hexagonal spectacles perched on the end of her nose noble captain lewrie courageous captain lewrie oh but it is my greatest honour to meet you at last i could but catch the briefest glimpse of you til your recent trial o course i tried my best to get close enough to you once twas over to receive but a mere press of your hand in passing damme might you grant me the favour of an interview a round dozen papers would bid for it damme do they not i was led to understand you wrote many of the abolitionist chapbooks and tracts regarding my case lewrie began to say i felt it the greatest privilege of my life sir mrs denby loudly declared i still do write their tracts decrying slavery dye see my meaning captain lewrie she said with a nervous laugh all but fanning herself you did me a magnificent service mistress denby for which i am eternally grateful lewrie told her clapping his hat back on his head at last i just spoke with mister leaver over yonder to give him my thanks and enquired of him who wrote such moving things about me he told me and then like a jackinthebox up you pop ha ha fortuitous indeed captain lewrie mrs denby gladly replied and i am quite honoured ever the more so that you took the time to thank me personally oh might you agree to let me interview you she gushed had i known your lodging place id have written a note long before even though certain salacious doings in society have had me quite occupied of late i most certainly could make time to probe your innermost thoughts she was all but bouncing up and down on her toes christ but she can wear ya out quick lewrie thought wondering if turning his innermost thoughts loose on london was all that good an idea wonder if she was mister denbys cause o death enthusiasm i also was led to understand that you write for the papers as the tattler lewrie said are those the society doings of which ye speak maam they are indeed captain lewrie mrs denby admitted with a hearty cackle as to that not only did i write in support of abolition and in firm support of you i spoke among all my contacts in the fashionable set dye see sir lauding you to the skies as enthusiastically as i decried the abhorrent institution of slavery you ehm have many contacts i take it maam oh captain lewrie mrs denby coyly confided though a bit loud and looking as if she would link arms with him even servants at st jamess marlbourough house any palace or estate you may name confide in me as do their masters and mistresses when they wish to dish a tasty little rumour about their rivals ha ha why there isnt a drum rout exhibition or public subscription ball that i do not attend and come away with fresh meat for grilling mrs denby confided snickering with wicked glee then i might have something right up your alley maam he told her oh captain lewrie call me georgina do she insisted with an even broader hungrier grin this time she did link arms with him is it delicious is it scandalous filled with intrigues romance or betrayal you have my complete curiosity sir and she said with a sly look there is a lovely little coffeehouse quite near to hand and there in all discreet confidence you must reveal it all to me well damme georgina denby said at last thumping her plump little self back against the high wood divider of their corner booth what a trollop what a foreign baggage the wench is she took time to wipe her hands on a table napkin for in her large bag she had stowed a steelnib pen and a screwtop jar of ink steelnibs werent all that cheap as lewrie already knew so he had to assume that hints and innuendos and dirt paid extremely well all through her interrogation for that was what it had felt like once hed broached the subject she had been scribbling away in a large accounting ledger filling several pages quickly both front and back with the details of lewries connexions to theoni kavares connor and her damnably anonymous dear friend letters though you do admit that you might very possibly be the father of her bastard mrs denby added in a pensive taking for the first time in the better part of an hour she has yet to take you to court with a belly plea so i wager shed singsong a soft whisper lewrie told himself so he prompted busying himself with pouring them both more tea damme its so obvious captain lewrie mrs denby chirped back to her enthusiastic self she wished the child you saved her and her firstborn and she became besotted by you i can easily see why mrs denby added with a flirtatious look an heroic wellsetup man of all his parts such as yourself still and all its hardly the way is it captain lewrie such affairs with children born on the wrong side of the blanket a touch more cream do you please ah why the mort was angling to land you for her own and nothing and no one was to get in the way of it hardly the proper way to solve such problems in english society is it she said with a disapproving sniff and a sip of her tea the hussy is greek mostlike provincial and ignorant of civilised ways no matter how wealthy her family was in the greek isles and the trade in currants england and london society does not look with particular favour on those who do not observe the niceties the foreigners that lewrie also well knew any day of the week in any street in the city there were oddlooking foreign types being showered with rotten vegetables or fruit clods of mud or dung and hooted and catcalled to their lodgings in a hurry by the infamous idle mob before his trial his accuser hugh beauman had been hounded from one hotel to another him and his ultrafashionable wife both for looking too grand and pretentious the only reason that eudoxias father arslan artimovich durschenko wasnt pelted and insulted in his fur shapka hat boots sash and odd roosian shirt was that he looked too dangerous to mess with and in his wastrel youth between schools after being sent down lewrie had hooted jeered and flung dung with the best of the bucksofthefirsthead hed run with that was why ambassadors and exotic pagan emissaries from ottoman turkey say were escorted upon official business by royal horse guard cavalry well for a foreigner shes hellishhandsome lewrie dared mention auburn hair almondshaped eyes with a slim waist despite bearing two children or damned good corsets and the most promising set of poonts beauty seems to forgive a lot in society medusa adams fling with lilith in the garden of eden dido mrs denby replied one hand waving in the air to conjure up infamous lovelies from the classics and the bible all of them were fetching in the extreme yet deadly and unforgivable like salome who lured king herod to slay john the baptist no captain lewrie proper society is quite brusque with those who violate the rules unwritten or no beautiful or not i see utter ruin ahead for mistress theoni connor mrs denby prophesied with a sly grin of anticipation to be involved in it she has not amassed a circle of supporters in london society even with all her wealth for entrйe she said with another dismissive sniff hence no allies i cannot recall anyone of importance remarking upon any attempt by her to insinuate herself with them i assure you sir the amusement such an attempt would have provoked among the quality with whom i associate would have reached me ears already hmph why the bitch will be completely destroyed ha ha lewrie dared let a smile gather at that news youve attempted to front her i wonder captain lewrie she asked birdquick peering at him we had a runin in ranelagh gardens a week back he replied not about this matter no for i still had no idea the letterwriter was her she was pouty that i hadnt called on her since the trial a mister well someone very good at getting to the bottom of matters like this did nab her maid the one with a good copperplate hand and an english education who polished em up for her after that shes dropped out of sight my sight thank god oh captain lewrie you must mrs denby enthusiastically told him insisted on it in truth a public scene without her very doors accusations shouted to the rooftops does she refuse you entrance in dread or shame no matter mostlike shed let me in to explain or lewrie mused damme now shes got me singsongin he silently groused well twould be best were she not in and you may feign that she denied you entrance mrs denby slyly suggested a note tucked into the door jamb saying that you must speak with her and mostlike her curiosity and the chance that you might have come round to her at last will be piqued resulting in another very public denunciation which i and as many of the better sort shall witness will be common gossip the morning after along with my article in the post and such other papers as i may induce will take the trick ha ha a public scene in montagu mews lewrie pretended to ponder as if loath to do anything quite so sordid loud enough to startle both the pigeons and the horses sir she said with a giggle to the rooftops to the rooftops i say then you must send me a note by runner telling me where and when the actual confrontation will occur why i warrant within the week the baggage will remove her vile self from london entire hmm her late husbands kin live in dublin lewrie said dublin mrs denby barked with a shiver for the shortest moment one could almost pity her that a greek a foreigner with a bastard son by another man in tow along with the late michael connors real son their only grandson and control over his shares of the family business to irk them even further no lewrie couldnt quite imagine her reception in dublin would be all that grand mind he did have a slight desire to witness it ill see to setting the scene this very day maam he told her georgina mrs denby chirpily insisted and i must be off as well you will uhm she added pointing to the slip of paper which bore the reckoning for their pot of tea and her sticky buns but of course georgina lewrie said with smile reaching for his washleather coin purse he rose handed her to her feet from the pewlike seat of the booth and bowed her departure for the door more notoriety he mused as he sorted out coins for the waiter that wont win me any less disapproval with admiralty he reckoned to himself if i cant hope tget another ship well i hope i enjoy this chapter fourteen he was best known about london as captain black alan lewrie royal navy so it was not a night for what his brotherinlaw burgess chiswick called civilian dress in hindoo mufti no it was his fulldress uniform with all the gilt lace and twin epaulets his hundredguinea east india company sword and both the cape st vincent and camperdown medals and covent garden was the site of the confrontationtobe lewrie had already called upon theonis house in montagu mews after determining that she and her maid were away shopping in the strand and had raised quite a ruckus after seeming to have knocked at the door and being denied entrance during which he had slipped a card into the jamb then descending the steps to the street to begin his rant to the rooftops as mrs denby insisted hide from me will you madam he had cried for a start and feeling like the greatest fool at the several good public schools of his youth lewrie had taken part in more than a few stage shows to the detriment of his studies and had usually been jeered for clumsy readings and stiff performances you wrote those scurrilous lying notes to torment my wife and ill not have it admit me or come out you jade you have poisoned my marriage with your lies and hurt my wife sore with your filth hold on hed thought should it ve been sweet marriage or shouldve written this down first gad this is lame how dare you ill have you in court for it hed gone on warming to his topic as passersby residents in the mews and street vendors had gathered just cause i saved you and your son from those serbian pirates in the adriatic oh your letters to me were flatterin but just cause i wrote you back didnt mean i favoured you or felt anything for you youre deluded jealous and spiteful get a man of your own and leave me and my wife be here now whats all this a dyspeptic neighbour asked him coming out upon his own front steps from next door hush up you not til mistress connor offers apologies lewrie shot back what the greek baggage the neighbour said with a sniff es arter some furrin mort e is a milkseller wench told a girl with a trey of posies and nosegays shes tormented my wife with lying letters for years lewrie accused to the neighbour whose wife had now joined him daft stuff imaginin shes in love with me stead of bein merely grateful sir spun moonshine bout us together sendin anonymous letters to drive my wife and me apart as if id ever leave my caroline for the likes of her i found out just yesterday whos been sendin em and i mean t get satisfaction well get it somewhere else damn ye the neighbour grumbled sue the uppity foreign bitch and leave off botherin this neighbourhood or ill call the charlies on ye begone sir mus be a mad woman lives ere the teenaged flower vendor told a pieman and a passing couple of strollers thinks shes got is feller fer er usband an im already married tchah the milkseller said with a spit on the cobbles ready fer bedlam she is furriners the pieman commented too damned many of em in england ye akses me oughter be run out o ere youll hear from my attorney lewrie shouted one last time shaking a fist at the windows of theonis parlour before departing covent garden theatre the biggest and grandest of all the playhouses in the district was thankfully no longer staging pizarro and had fallen back on a popular sheridan play a recurring staple though the styles and colours of the fashionable ladies showed that the fads inspired by that play would be around at least til midsummer lewrie milled round the ornate lobby with a glass of a rather thin rhenish in one hand barely tasting it in tiny sips that only moistened his lips as he scanned the arrivals for his prey and feeling as nervous as a pickpocket in a room full of justices wondering if theoni would actually dare show her face in publick after twigg had exposed her maid and he had staged his petty dramatics before her doors nervous as he felt though it was hard to keep his mind on the matter for there were rather a lot of mostattractive women entering the theatre that night more than a few fetching courtesans and ladies of the demimonde strolling and trolling themselves before the gentlemen without partners and even the girls who vended oranges and such whose charms were as delightful as the highpriced courtesans and whose morals were even lower than most actresses seemed even more alluring than usual lewrie bought himself a fresh glass of rhenish finding that he had drained the first without even noticing and took an inventory of how long it had been since he had put the leg over anything christ has it been two bloody years he gawped in wonder after he recalled his last amourous encounter tis a wonder i dont drool or squirt semen out my ears from the pressure his free hand involuntarily went to a lefthand pocket of his waist coat aha two cundums stowed away just in case hmm long as i go armoured would a whore be all that bad he speculated theoni would mostdefinitely be rightout within the hour he grimly determined and even nuzzling eudoxias perfumed neck would be a death sentence caroline the only reason his wife would ever let him under the covers with her again would be a ruse to whip out a very sharp knife and have his wedding tackle off mostlike even if she believed but half of what mr twigg promised to tell her there were a tad too many other women he could not explain away must get a recent guidebook t london quim he told himself and began to regard the strolling women with sharper eyes dear captain lewrie a gay voice chirped in giddy singsong it was mrs georgina denby damn her eyes tricked out in a stylish satin gown of bright shimmering blue with rather more flesh exposed than lewrie ever wished to see earrings necklace and bracelet of a pale topaz set if real he speculated gossip paid hellishwell and a pair of glasses perched on the tip of her nose a reticule bag of pale blue satin hung from one elbow and her hands held a small notebook and a pencil how delightful to see you again sir ah um mistress denby georgina lewrie flummoxed and applied her first name at her coy prompting the crowd in the lobby limited his movements but he sketched her a bow you keep well excellently well captain lewrie she replied dipping him a stumpy curtsy then came quite close to mutter has the bitch shown her face yet is this truly the appointed time and place sposed t be but lewrie said with a shrug frightened off most likely mrs denby whispered leering and rolling her eyes i must circulate only here as a witness not a fellow conspirator la la i trust you will enjoy the play tonight maam lewrie said in a morenormal voice with another brief bow ah yes captain lewrie i am certain i shall mrs denby replied in her normal gushing tones anything by sheridan always proves immensely droll and amusing ta ta with that she tottered away to smile and nod among the fashionable and dirtworthy and there she was the doorman bowed theoni connor inside a very nervouslooking theoni no matter the exquisite care shed taken with her appearance her placid smile simply would not hold for more than a few fleeting seconds and her eyes had the look of a harried deer as she paused just inside the lobby and peered about to spot him carefully tossing back the hood of her cape from an artful bejewelled do and unfastening it from her throat if i didnt despise her so much id be tryin tbed her lewrie told himself for theoni had come to impress with a costly set of diamonds on fingers wrist and throat that impressively bouncy bosom of hers a tad more exposed than most women present and wearing a new gown of champagne and ivory figured satin with a white lace stole over her shoulders she saw him winced for the briefest moment then plastered a hopeful smile on her phyz and threaded her way through the crowd in his direction lewrie stood stockstill and scowled and as she neared her smile went even sketchier alan i she said at last with a nervous toss of her head madam lewrie intoned still scowling i know what you did alan if you would how dare you he barked nigh to his quarterdeck voice have you no shame she squirmed as if looking for a hideyhole wringing her hands there is no excuse for tormenting my wife with your anonymous letters with your madeup lies madam lewrie harshly told her no excuse for besmirchin me and tryin truin my marriage with filth as you have youll write no more poison hear me this was as amusing as any sheridan play much like an entracte tween scenes on the stage inside and the crowd of theatregoers in the lobby just ate it up hushing breathlessly then buzzing and whispering among themselves all eyes on them damn you theoni shot back her artfully made face pale and sounding breathless like to swoon what of our son what of all of our letters as for the letters madam lewrie replied and one may trust that hed thrashed that point out in his head beforehand after your rescue from pirates in the adriatic by my hand you wrote me and i wrote back to be civil as for your son well you have a son by someone mostlike your dead husband is one charitable for you were not that long a widow when i saved your life leave my wife alone madam he quickly added raising a hand to cut off her protest as spots of colour dappled her cheeks well have no more of your imaginings get yourself a man of your own and do not torment us further i do not know you madam lewrie said in a stern voice turning away and giving her the cut direct why you lying theoni spat then made the worst of all errors one could make in england in her shock and outrage she lapsed into what lewrie took for modern greek hurling curses at him and falling back on her upbringing on zante in the ionian islands she added several insulting hand gestures of the maledictory variety too a couple of ushers and a manager forced their way to lewrie as another pair of ushers approached theoni as well hear now sir we will have none of this im afraid well have to ask you to leave the theatre sir my pardons to you sir lewrie said in answer to that threat in the mildest of takings but the scandalous way that woman has abused my wife over the years the identity of the anonymous writer i just discovered rowed me beyond all temperance i hardly expected the her to show her face in polite society my pardons again for any disturbance and of course i shall leave for the sake of your other attendees well thatd be good sir the manager allowed though i hope sometime in future to be allowed back lewrie asked with a hopeful grin with her barred for life i promise ill be as quiet as a dormouse well see sir and thankee for your consideration the manager said with a relieved look looking over towards the doors theoni wasnt taking it quite so well was stamping a foot imperiously and spittingmad still lapsing into greek at times as she fumed foreigners someone said with a sniff of disgust near lewrie simply wont behave proper hey a buzz of agreement followed courtesan mostlike my dear a gentleman told his partner captain alan lewrie that trial dont ye know got off good for him imagine her bloody gall mdear impugnin a hero such as he writin his wife filthy letters he said alarmin her for years the bitch was the general tone of the theatregoers as lewrie gathered up his boatcloak hat and sword and as he watched theoni put up a brief struggle against ejection the grin he wore upon his face could not help from slipping from museful to gleeful once sure that theoni kavares connor had coached away in high dudgeon and that the coast was clear lewrie took a stroll round the theatre district popping into a cleanerthanaverage tavern where a group of coaches awaited and ordered himself a pint of porter in celebration from a street stall he had purchased a guide to covent garden women and idly flipped through the pages surprisingly his halfsister belinda was still listed though getting rather long in tooth by then but the lavish description of her charms and what she specialised in was even lengthier her socketfee risen even higher yet he had not come out with a full purse and only two of his cundums and once in the saddle two would not be enough he knew he was too hungry to be sated by a mere two romps and the last thing he needed and what he had amazingly avoided during his long career as a rakehell was the french pox what he imagined he could afford that night by way of cyprian charms would be riskier than he wished in that regard there was also the very real risk of being lured into a jades rooms accosted by her fancy man and his accomplices and being found days later a naked corpse in the mudflats of the thames yet with the idea firmly embedded in his mind lewrie turned the pages to brothels londons many church bells began to chime the hour it was a quarter past eight pm or so his pocketwatch said after he took a quick peek at it why it wasnt even the shank of the evening the theatres were barely into the middle of their first acts of yet and the chophouses were still packed with diners nuther porter sir the waitress enquired slyly projecting a hip to the edge of his table even here in a somewhat clean tavern thered be rooms abovestairs for rantipoling and the servers augmented their earnings with sport she wasnt to his taste though in his nowstimulated state lewrie began to wonder exactly what his taste was and where hed draw the line no im off lewrie said tucking the guidebook into a breast pocket of his uniform coat and fumbling for his coin purse cor wot a pity the waitress leered an yew with hintrest in a lil sport ta lewrie said hastily taking his leave to the first hacking coach outside he shouted madeira club duke and wigmore to the coachee and clambered in time was wasting chapter fifteen in mufti again armed with a stout walkingstick that disguised a slim sword and with bank notes squirrelled away in several pockets he was pleased to discover himself back in his old haunts where he had rented his first london lodgings in panton street where many foreign emissaries lived or kept their mistresses the house that his hired coach took him to he remembered as one which in his time in had been the residence of a single family now though no finer establishment for the discerning gentleman in search of corinthian delights in st jamess in the utmost of security and serenity the house of mistress batson may offer the most exquisite selection of jewels of the demimonde or so the guidebook said and if mistress batsons lived up to a tithe of its advertisement it would be worth it lewrie decided as he alit and paid the coachman there was a hulking sort of fellow loitering by the front stoop who gave him a chary lookover come as a patron sir he asked in a gruff warning voice aye lewrie simply replied then go right in sir and take joy lewrie barely had to rap the large doorknocker once before the portal was opened by the hulking fellows obvious twin this one done up in a sober sort of livery from a cold night street to a gust of warm air from the stinks of london to inviting aromas of perfumes and hungary waters in a mйlange of scents from the din of carriages and dray waggons and the hummumm of people to almost a hush a violin played in company with a flute or recorder there was a faint clink of glasses a convivial buzz of conversation and soft teasing female laughter coming from somewhere beyond the entry foyer a stout older woman in the sack gown and overdone makeup of at least two decades past greeted him with a curtsy to which he replied with a short bow a leg and the doff of his hat welcome to mother batsons sir she said looking him up and down much like a tailor might you come for ease i take it i do indeed maam lewrie told her as another liveried servant took his hat boatcloak and walkingstick and gave him a claim chit i see by your cloak you are a seafaring gentleman sir the older woman said the navy maam just back from years at sea lewrie said and god bless our wooden walls she said back smiling at last though years at sea my my you sound insatiable as we say of those who do not stand evening watches maam i would like all night in and a morning departure lewrie told her when the suns above the yardarm and the streets are safer now that would require a guinea sir the older woman leered come into our parlour take seat and have a glass of something where you may find your hearts delight she offered not an arm to steer him but a palm to be crossed once a pound note and a silver shilling had been placed in that palm she did take him by the arm and lead him into a much larger room where the music was where other men lolled at their ease with drinks in their hands and young women by their sides where a waiter with a tray of glasses circulated and offered him champagne bottle in the room will be extra when youre ready was said in a soft voice another pound note went to the manservant who winked acknowledgement then drifted away lewrie took a look around and chose a short settee a bit away from the others even as he settled himself two men made their choice and were led by their cyprians to the grand old staircase damned if one of the men wasnt sir george norman kc the one who had prosecuted him just weeks before now minus his court periwig and his rectitude sir george jolted to a halt and gawped at him stupefied for a brief moment before lewrie raised his glass in salute and smiled to which sir george performed a slight shrug and displayed a worldlywise smile before following his doxy to the stairs and damned if the fellow with him wasnt a member of commons a fellow noted for being in the progressive reforming and moralising faction by the gay and bawdy interplay twixt sir george his choice of poll and the other couple it didnt appear as if theyd be taking separate rooms either do you have any preferences sir the older woman in the towering wig enquired after she had seen the foursome up the stairs with fond wishes she sat beside lewrie on the short settee hands in her lap as prim as a vicars wife at high tea we boast of ladies to every taste dark and exotic from the west indies or africa perhaps girls worthy of a rajahs harem in india or the far east old stout slim and young dark or fair whatever is your fondest wish short of a child of course here you may find your hearts desire and all skilled in every aspect of the pleasurable arts she said with many a simper and sly grins well hmm lewrie paused colouring a bit for it had been years since hed had to visit a commercial establishment christ wasnt it charleston way back in the american revolution or with cashman in portauprince in had no need o brothels he told himself not with so many willin sorts about slim and faird be nice lewrie told the mother abbess at last as english as plum pudding and as sweet then i have the perfect one for you sir the woman said rising to her feet and beckoning to a girl in the far corner near the musicians who was by herself and nodding dreamily in time to the melody tess my dear come and meet our guest the naval gentleman the girl seemed almost to jerk from her pleasant musings as if waking from sleep at dawn she sprang to her feet with a shy and winsome smile before remembering her lessons in grace then crossed the parlour to join them in a wellschooled glide it was a good thing the parlour was wellwarmed by two fireplaces for she wore only a thin and silky chemise cinched round the waist with a pale blue ribbon with a darker blue dressing gown over that unsashed so it peeked open with each step to show off her lowheeled shoes her white silk stockings tied above the knees and now and then showed off her slim ankles and thighs though she did keep her hands close to the laced edges of the dressing gown as if wishing to fold it snugger and less revealing tess this is ah no names are necessary are they but he is one of our naval heroes mrs batson for surely it must be she airily said by way of introduction sir this is tess newcome with us by way of belfast not quite english as you said but now that we are all british hmm honoured tmeet you tess lewrie said rising to greet her to give her a short bow from the waist yer servant sir tess replied dipping him a graceful curtsy will ye join me in a glass of champagne my dear lewrie bade the gentleman requests the rest of the night tess the older woman said in a soft coo to which tess gave a grateful relieved grin i leave you to your pleasures and amusements tess sir do take joy mrs batson wished them then glided away lewrie took the girls hand and led her to a seat on the settee then sat down beside her a second later the manservant was back with a fresh tray of glasses of champagne for them both newcome to us mine arse lewrie cynically thought sweet and young she may look but they mightve sold her virginity to one o the highest bidders the last six months runnin she was pretty though not painted up or tarted up with artifice for she had no need for rouge or paints pretty in a country way like a maidservant to a rural squires house a goosegirl or milking maid one might meet in a village on market day she had a nice oval face with a high forehead a quite cute nose and a smallish mouth with a bit of an overbite that gave her face the sweetest seeming innocence her eyes were darkgreenhazel and her sandybrown hair with the faintest hint of strawberry red was parted missishly simple in the centre of her head gathered loosely with ribbon at the nape of her neck and fell in long lazy curls with a few wispy strands either side of her face well i spose i could reveal that my first names alan without spillin any crown secrets he said grinning by way of beginning and yere really a navy officer a postcaptain lewrie confided whatever that is sir she said with another shy grin warships are rated lewrie casually explained to her now admiral nelsons new ship the san josef which he made prize at the battle of cape saint vincent years ago is a first rate of ninetyeight or an hundred guns he stretched his legs out a little and put one arm on the back of the settee shifting to face her anything below the rates a lieutenant may command or a commander but when you get to a frigate of the sixth rate with more than twenty guns thats what admiralty calls an official post ship and only a full captain will command her hence post captain ive had two frigates so far proteus was a sixth rate of thirtytwo guns and my last was savage a fifth rate of thirtysix guns oh an are ye goin tth baltic with admiral nelson then tess enthused shifting more to face him too will ye be beatin th bejesus outta th roosians and such speakin o crown secrets lewrie scoffed almost hooted in point of fact why everyone in englandand evry enemy spymust know that by now but no im without a ship at present i had tgive up savage before christmas there were some civilian things tsee to ashore so another captain has her now damn his eyes ooh i think i know who ye are tess whispered excitedly and squirmed a little bit closer still almost jouncing on her bottom in sly glee damme if yere not that alan lewrie wots been in all th papers are ye not guilty of that at least lewrie confessed with a teasing touch of his finger to her lips then to his own with a shussh sound gettin bags o use from that un he thought guilty or not dined out on it for weeks habloodyha yer secrets safe with me captain alan tess teased in return mums th word they clinked glasses and drained them and waved for refills as the girl wriggled even closer under the arch of his arm with her warm hip and thigh against him dont know as ive ever been introduced to a real hero before oh officers an such from some regiment or tother or so they claimed but she checked herself with a pretty moue a shrug and a toss of her hair as if talk of previous clients was discouraged by mother batson and those bullybucks of hers after all the illusion was the thing soldiers by god lewrie sneered pack o codswallops the lot of em they buy their commissions whilst navy men have to work tgain ours at least he assumed that tess was talking about gentlemen officers not the sweaty rank and file mrs batsons didnt look like the sort of establishment that would have private soldiers or ordinary seamen in even on boxing day more to the point lewrie hoped that tess had dealt with wellarmoured gentlemen in the past you stick with naval gentlemen theyll see ye right lewrie told her with a grin and a bit of a rising leer uhm like you captain alan she asked coyly inclining her head bestowing upon him another of those shy and fetching smiles her lips parted slightly care to discover the diffrence tess he muttered cocking a brow and suddenly very aware of the heat and closeness of her body and the scent of her perfume and her freshwashed hair she took a deep sip of champagne eyes turned away as if studying his proposal seeming somewhere twixt solemn and wryly amused then looked back at him smiled shyly once more and slowly nodded let us go up to your room then tess he said winking aye lets she agreed chapter sixteen her room was three storeys above the street beyond the grandness of the lower staircase where marble was replaced by solid oak and the carpetting was more worn tess lit them up with a single candle in one hand and lewries in her other they went down a wide and gloomy hall only lit here and there with a sole candle on a table or one or two mounted in wall holders there was a final door at the right of the hallway which tess opened beyond it instead of a goodsized bedchamber there was yet another passage much narrower which forced them shouldertoshoulder as she led him past a door to either side then an equally narrow cap to the t which presented a final pair of doors the one on the righthand side was slightly ajar and tess preceded him into the room beyond tiptoeing and hesitant ambush here lewrie had to worry for a moment as he followed quickly peering about for the sight of a bullybuck with a leadloaded leather cosh or a whackingthick cudgel more light captain alan tess asked or dye prefer th dark at least one or two more candles for now he said satisfied that he would not be bashed on the head and robbed yet as she ignited more candles with her first one lewrie could see where he was there had to be four smaller rooms carved out of the original large bedchamber he deduced the new walls and passageway made up of plain deal partitions though painted white with the impression of fine mouldings just painted on like stage scenery the wall to his right was substantial plaster still wallpapered the one ahead of him was also papered with a set of dark and heavy drapes covering a window he crossed to it with difficulty squeezing between a chestofdrawers and the foot of the bed to pull the drapes apart and look out down to panton street far below he let the drapes fall back together for it was cold the panes frosted and semiopaque come to think on it the room was chilly too and he couldnt imagine what theyd done with the fireplace that should have warmed the larger original room now that he could see lewrie took in the bed fairly close to the draped window then to a taller oldstyle nightstand on the other side where his requested bottle of champagne stood chilling in a pail filled with slushy snow aside two fresh glasses there was a folding screen set out from the deal partition they had passed through on the floor beside it a storage chest and against the middle wall by the chestofdrawers stood a washhand stand with a pitcher towels and two bowls they charge extra for the candles do they lewrie asked her with a wry chuckle oh nossir tess told him with a little laugh of her own as she finished lighting the requested candles now dye wish thave a fireplace those rooms there an there tones we passed comin in well th established girls get those less ye put in a request t mother batson didnt know lewrie said with a shrug peeling off his coat where does one theres a row o pegs yonder sir tess told him she went to the row of pegs herself quickly exchanging her lacy and revealing silk dressing gown for a heavier one of tan wool wrapping it round her body with a shiver not so quickly that lewrie couldnt get an appreciative eyeful of her figure despite the looseness of her chemise it only came to midthigh and silhouetted by a fresh candle the sight made him grin she was girlishly slim in arms back and hips with very shapely slim legs right down to an alluring gap tween her upper thighs yumbloodyyum he thought in sudden lust he went to the pegs hung up his coat and waistcoat stuffed his sporty paisley neckstock into a pocket and sat on the chest to tug at a boot lemme help ye with those sir tess volunteered kneeling to lend a hand lewrie stood in his stockinged feet and shivered there was a set of small carpets on the floor but they were old and threadworn without a bit of give or insulation maybe i should bring a dressing robe along next time lewrie said hugging himself for warmth i can only wish ye think enough o me tcome a second time tess teased still sitting on her heels below him theres a quilt t wrap up in do ye want she rose to her knees and placed a hand on the buttons of his breeches looking up somewhere twixt shyness and flirtatiousness as her fingers found his mounting erection might i help ye further captain alan lewries hand to the waistband buttons hers working up from the bottom of the row and he was free in a trice breeches and stockings discarded atop the chest and the boots and the rooms chill a sensual thrill from the hem of his shirt to his groin ye have armour she softly asked her hands under his shirt on the tops of his thighs theyll not let us without do ye not ive a few in the a round dozen lewrie told her in a throatconstricted mutter as tesss hands slid up to his hips bracketing his taut belly saints preserve us but i hope yell spare me the use of all of em arrah tess said with a gasp of alarm false or not he could not tell she dropped back to her heels eyes wide the green lanterns best lewrie assured her offering her a hand lets get under the covers then have another glass of champagne me girl vite vite as the frogs say out of her shoes tess was about four inches shorter than his five feet nine inches as she rose to her feet and with his hand in hers quickly led him to the bed he whipped the coverlet blankets and sheet back and they both jumped in her heavy wool robe slung to the footboard then the covers pulled up to her chin the pile of pillows flounced up and braced behind their shoulders and heads lewrie reached for the bottle and the glasses poured for both of them then shifted to his side to face her clinking his glass to hers once more she took a sip then leaned back against the pillows sighing contentedly never had champagne fore i come tlondon i never she told him flashing her that rather sweet shy smile again la tis a grand thing the bubbly deed it is lewrie happily agreed why a fellow captain i know benjamin rodgers couldnt go to sea at all did he not have at least three dozen dozen bottles in his lazarette store goes through it like a country squire sucks up ale he said with a hoot an here i thought goin tsea was all misery an hard times tess said shifting to her side to face him one hand propping up her head twas bad enough just goin by packet from belfast t liverpool and sick i thought id die fore settin foot on hard ground whush sure and itd take a power o strong drink tget me aboard a ship again tmake such life even passin tolerable it aint always that stormy in the main lewrie told her more good days than bad really the worst part sometimes is days on end o boredom one week after tother exactly the same humdrum and routine and theres dancin thornpipes an all tess asked smiling and much more at ease than their first moments shinnin up masts an such she added with a sly leer in her eyes yed not ask me tshin up a mast tonight will ye captain alan she asked with feigned dread seein as how youre a landlubber not a scaly fish i dont think ill put ya to the mainmast truck quite yet mdear he joshed with a grin and a throaty chuckle he slipped closer putting an arm behind her head and she snuggled up to him bringing welcome warmth and a heady mix of enticing aromas perhaps ill start ya out on the mizen only as far as the crojack yard ye haveta learn another tongue tbe a sailor she asked with a shake of her head weve our own language for certain tess he agreed yell not be too rough an hungry will ye captain alan she asked in a soft voice mean tsay ive simple normal tastes if thats your question he assured her feeling warm enough to undo his cuffs and slide out of his silk shirt nor am i a brute mind though it has been a long time but we have til dawn or a little later im assured i doubt well go through the whole dozen but ya never can tell am i inspired he said with a grin and you are inspiring they sipped at their champagne he faster than she and set his empty glass on the nightstand he turned back and she was waving her empty at him with a bolder grin of her own should i snuff some candles she asked as she slid down in the bed sweeping her long hair to one side only three single candles barely illuminated the small room it was all amber and gently flickering shadows now they were silent he could hear what was going on in the other cubicles the rhythmic thud of mattresses and the squeaking of slats or ropes urgent grunts moans and throaty soft laughter not right now lewrie said sliding over to hold her close to kiss her throat her shoulders and nuzzle below and behind of her ears he moved up to her forehead her cheeks and her chin testing whether she was the sort of whore whod kiss for real or turn her head away to feign passion his lips found hers and they were very soft and sweet as she allowed him then after a few light teasing kisses parted her lips and met him measure for measure his free hand gently slid under her chemise to roam over her hip and trail spidersoft down her thigh then back up slowly roving over the back of her leg til he could cup a firm babybottomsoft buttock and stroke a circle expanding wider to her waist tess shifted beside him parting her thighs wide enough for him to put a leg between them and feather his fingers from her waist to her belly then down to her fluff her arms were round him her kisses more urgent and the musk of her breath intensifying she slid a hand down to her waistsash and undid the loose knot so he could tickle his hand up her back above her waist cross her rib cage and slide the chemise up even higher lets have this off sweetness he growled helping her lift it free over her head and she flung it away with no care for where it landed then flung her arms round his neck beginning to moan kittenish as he buried his face against her neck and hair oh captain alan uhmm oh yes ooh tess whispered her fingers in his thick hair ah thats darlin it was such a sham almost enough to put him off for a moment yet he was determined almost challenged to take her beyond the playacting before the night was done one last openmouthed bout of kisses and he slid down her body to her breasts not all that large yet soft and milky and delightfully scented his tongue rimmed her puffy pink areolae and nipples smiling to himself as they went taut as he licked flicked and assayed a shuddery playnip that made her moan a tad more authentically lower down bestowing attention on her sides her ribs and she went onto her back slim thighs parted further to make room for him when he got to her stomach her belly her navel and tesss hips were slowly rolling and beginning to push up to him ooh ooh ah tess uttered as he gained the deliciously soft tops of her inner thighs and she lifted her knees shifting again and widening her legs as his hot breath stirred her cornsilkfine patch of fluff kissing her belly above it and feeling her stomach shudder if that aint real then its one hell of a trick he thought to the seat of pleasure at last tongue and lips on her cleft and she smelt so clean for a moment before the musk arose as tess went from dryness to dampness then to slickness as he pressed his face to her thered been a courtesan in his teens then a chinese whore in canton who had titteringly instructed him in how to pay attention to the little man in the boat not just a brief visit but a lengthy stay and the result he could conjure with what the chinese girl had called the hummingbird and damned if he would go anywhere else til hed lit a proper fire an honest fire it seemed to be working for tesss fingers clawed in his hair at his scalp her hips jouncing up in time with his tongue panting in rhythm and mewling soft yelps and urgent whines oh oh oh jesus joseph an mary oh god mdear uhm she whimpered her hands now clamped round his head knees almost to her chest shoving him into her groin oh god in heaven ye bastard yes yes yess ahhhaa she wailed arching her back ah ye darlin man oh jaysus she froze of a sudden loins pressed upward hard and her thighs gripping his head her arms flung outside the blankets to grip the pillows and the edge of the mattress to claw the sheets a moment more stiffness and she collapsed with a shudder croaking from a dry throat gasping for air as he swarmed up her to take her in his arms shift to lie on his side and stroke her all over my dear tess said with a shaky laugh once shed gotten her breath back my god but whered ye learn that un i never i told ye the navyd see ye right dear tess he chuckled faith if ye havent whush she fanned herself with the bed covers but isnt it time ye fetched one o yer cundums an had yere own pleasure she whispered beaming with fun i do believe youre right sweet un lewrie heartily agreed before he could turn over to fetch one though tess swarmed over him to the drawer of the nightstand and pulled one out your turn tess whispered a playful leer on her face for a moment my turn she added tossing back the covers and slipping down to his erection to tie the cundum on but not before her lips tasted him licked and surrounded its top her mouth and breath hot and wet and maddening tis a fearful big thing ye own captain alan tess said as she rolled away opening herself to him but i do believe ill manage dye start out gentle in the candlelight her eyes shone with mischief and her mouth pouted so very prettily her lips slightly apart now sir chapter seventeen as the bells of london chimed the hour of one in the morning a very pleased and smug alan lewrie allowed himself to imagine that he was not yet that old that he did mainwell for a fellow whod reached his thirtyeighth year his birthday had occurred a week before to no particular notice from anyone else friend or family hmm he purred into tesss hair as she lay half atop him one slim thigh between his and her belly stickydamp against him mmm was her matching purr as he stroked her back and kissed her cheek yere feelin sleepy yet darlin tess asked her head upon his chest is that a wish tess he asked chuckling faith it is not she answered propping her chin on him to peer drowsily sweet into his eyes with that fetching wee shy grin of hers breaking out on her face i was only wondrin do ye feel a wee bit peckish should i ring for somethin teat besides your sweet self he teased sweet jesus she said laughing softly sure and yell be th end o me an starve me into th bargain sounds good i am hungry lewrie decided what might they have well each evnin theres an invitation supper tess said rolling away to grope at the foot of the bed for her heavy robe for the regular customers more o what they call a buffet than anythin else tonight was ham roast beef an goose an theres sure tbe plenty left enough for sandwiches aye ring for something lewrie told her we might not need another whole bottle but we could stay awake long enough to finish one another bloody guinea sure tbe part of a bottle left by others in the parlour she speculated as she quickly dressed and hopped out of bed to search for her shoes be back in a tick wait lewrie said getting up on one elbow and taking her by the hand tess was simply delightful and with her heavy robe still hanging open he could not let her go without drinking in the sight of her her hair had long before come undone from its restraining ribbon and hung long and fair to her waist in soft curves and in the dim candlelight her body was a study in amber wash best choice ever i made lewrie told her cause youre the loveliest girl ive clapped toplights on in years tess ah go on with ye she laughed rewarding his words with one more shy grin and a cock of her head you keep the covers warm while i fetch us some vittles she stepped out into the narrow passageway and lewrie settled back with his hands behind his head about ready to laugh out loud in glee to have stumbled upon such a sweet young thing even if she was a whore he heard her shoes click down the passageway to the outer door the door open and close and listened to the sounds of the house now that things had slowed down a bit damnably there was still a wench in a nearby cubicle who must have aspired to the opera who trilled and hallooed false passion still cross the hallway perhaps muffled but still loud there was a couple who cursed each other like salty bosuns between animallike grunts and whoops when he and tess were not busy theyd giggled like schoolchildren to the sounds speculating what the other whores and customers really looked like and what particular act they were engaged in sleepy no he didnt feel sleepy in the slightest yet there were seven more unused cundums and with a cold collation and a new bottle of bubbly coming he imagined he might attain a new record tess was that intriguing and enflaming and im too bloody hungry he admitted to himself hallo lewrie muttered to himself as the amourous sounds of the house changed there were shouts belowstairs a thud or two then the quick clopping of someones shoes the opening and slamming of the hallway door some closer clopping which forced him to sit upright in bed there was a womans shriek of alarm another womans voice raised in high dudgeon men bellowing and the door to the cubicle burst open tess with her hair flying as she dashed in with a champagne bottle in her hand she slammed the door and clawed at a pocket of her heavy dressing robe help me capm she cried the chest the bloody chest he sprang from the bed stark naked padded to the door and she tossed him the champagne bottlehalffull as promised sloshing on his bare chest and stomach as she dug in the other pocket then sprang to the silk robe then the nightstand shift th damned chest block th fackin door please jesus for i cannot find th fackin key she wailed by then all the customers and whores on both the second and third storeys were either yelling in fright or bellowing in anger what the bloody hell lewrie demanded as he knelt to shift the large chest in front of the door fackin mad man oughter be in bedlam he should tess said in a gasping voice then exulted as she found a rusty key she tossed it to him which he dropped then scrambled for and locked the flimsy door for her he turned to face her what bloody mad man tess was now holding the throat of her wool dressing robe shut with one hand and in the other she shakily held a shiny wee dagger belowstairsuncomfortably closer than beforethere came sounds of a struggle and a bellowed demand tess vant tess and no other hear me peasants serfs how dare you yob tvoyemat eeep was lewries outburst upon hearing that russian curse whats durschenko doin here was his first panicky thought i aint toppin his daughter so he picked up the champagne bottle from the floor took a large swig that bubbled round his mouth and chin then went to tesss side blieve i know a bit more about daggers than you sweetlin lewrie said hand out to request it less youve killed somebody in the past with it here ill trade you he said offering the bottle for an offhand weapon he picked the empty champagne bottle from the nightstand now whos this bloody lunatick thats callin for ya lewrie asked over his shoulder taking stance between tess and the door his name aint durschenko is it arslan artimovich scrawny old russian devil with an eyepatch no no hes a student tess said with a weak shudder to her voice shed climbed onto the bed and was huddling in the far corner near the drapes says

another girl but yell not let him in an git me willya capm alan for th love o god not if i can help it no tess lewrie assured her hefting his dagger and makeshift cosh it sounded though as if the struggle had reached a hightide mark on the secondstorey landing safely a floor below more curses in russian from two voices some good old london accents from several more bullybucks sasha pamageetyeh doh viy mojetyeh mnyeh pamoch from one and oww and a grunt from another preceded by some lovely meaty thuds from fists and cudgels vill burn house down ow kill all you pryazni oof of a sudden it got delightfully quiet while whores continued to fret and fuss and gentlemen customers made idle threats an ironic series of cheers could be heard the grunts and heavyfooted shuffles as bodies were hauled downstairs and victorious bullybucks congratulated themselves on a duty well done think youre safe now lewrie told tess turning around she was behind the bed tween the mattress and the wall with the covers thrown over her to appear as a pile of blankets shoved off the bed one frightened eye peeked from a tiny fold hes gone bashed senseless by the sound of it lewrie said with a wry laugh him and another both damme i dont usually do my fightin in the buff he put the dagger back into the nightstand drawer the empty bottle on the floor beside it and hopped back into bed pulling up the covers and shivering well dont i get a reward he asked with a laugh tess untangled herself from the pile of covers spread them back out to cover all the mattress and slid in from the offside yeda fought him for me tess shakily exclaimed as she curled up to him under the covers her wool robe itchy on his skin yeda risked yer life tkeep me safe for a second he took that for false heroworship the fawning of a courtesan dependent on his purse yet she sounded truly amazed to have someone anyone stand up for her still have the bubbly let me have a sip theres a darlin lewrie bade he took a drink from the neck then grinned at her whoever the bastard was you were terrified and he was spoilin our time tgether so what else could i do for a pretty young lass doubt hell be comin here again so he would have handed the bottle back to her but tess threw her arms round his neck thrust a thigh between his and kissed him with a fierce passion she jerked the knot of her sash loose and spread the dressing robe over him pressing her feverwarm body to his she whimpered and cooed and clung to him like a limpet and did he feel sudden moisture on his face her face oh dont do that he thought as he hugged her back slipping his free hand under the covers and her robe to stroke her bare back and shoulders as she writhed against him a girls tearsll always land me in trouble there there sweetlin he murmured into her hair its all over and no harm done g git one o yere cundums she breathed an make love tme this very minute well if itll make ye feel better he japed damned if he wasnt ready to oblige her in point of fact for the threat of danger then her warmth and softness had made him as inspired as the first time with an erection as stiff as a marlingspike she sat up armoured him quickly with trembling hands then sat astride of him her robe cocooning them both and her long curly hair brushing his chest la yere th grandest bloody man she moaned minutes later there came a discreet rap on the door which made tess start and lewrie scramble for the dagger whos there the girl squeaked tis bob tess a man said in a gruff voice wi yer vittles no fear at roosky bastards long gone lewrie had to help shift the heavy chest and unlock the door so the waiter could come in with another salvaged bottle of champagne and a tray covered with a napkin which when whisked away revealed a pair of sandwiches and a dish of pickles two pound six sir bob told lewrie who was looking for his coin purse an well settle th reckonin in th mornin looks like you gave as good as you got lewrie told him noting the waiters bruises and the beginnings of a black eye lots bettern he sir bob said with a boxers grin him an his manservant both poxy bastardsll look like raw beef fer a week hell not ever come back pray jesus tess fearfully asked aint sayin e wont try girl bob reassured her clenching his fists together and cracking knuckles but weve leave tdump is arse in th thames if he do roosky titlesr no lewrie dug some money from a pocket of his coat and slipped the man the reckoning with another pound note atop it for his efforts and tipped bob the wink mmm roast duck tess enthused once bob had left and she had lifted the bread to look at her sandwich told ye the house sets out a grand table she sat in the middle of the bed crosslegged with her robe spread over her lap shifting with delight as she took a bite and chewed lewrie poured her a glass of champagne and slid under the bed covers using the borrowed quilt to drape his shoulders and chest like a red indian damme this is good lewrie agreed after a taste hot mustard and some sorta red jelly apple it may be all stirred tgether tess said smiling with pleasure after chewing and swallowing like wot ye serve with venisonr grouse mmhmm lewrie agreed again with his mouth full so who was this anatoli character he asked after a sip of champagne a customer tess told him looking uncomfortable with the subject first he come was round christmas end of terms he calls it from oxford once th weekr so til th night he and i she frowned and squirmed a bit he went with no one special til he lit on me damn his eyes tother girls said he was a rough un so i was leery dye see but he seemed nice enough th first timer two but then he turned brute on ye lewrie gently probed aye that he did tess spat an askin for me only fer all night like you she

rest with th older fellers not like you captain alan thats fer certain no sleep in you she reached out to brush his hair from his brow uhoh lewrie thought at her gesture dont go fond on me him though tess said turning pensive evry night for a fortnight an him swearin hed buy me out an set me up an me own lodgins for his own brr mean tsay tis a poor girls fondest wish tbe set up good as a lady but not with th likes o him even was he rich as that tsar o his just wouldnt do it natral no not him an wantin me without protections in th wrong she made an angry moue and swiped at her own hair tossing

half o what we sell is illusion dye see affection attention grace an beauty an all that shite oops she pealed out a laugh as she covered her mouth with a hand for a second blieve me capm alan this busness can be powerful strange sometimes see there in th corner lewrie looked where she pointed there was a bundle of birch rods which hed taken for an old broom or kindling for a franklinpattern stove theres some real quality sorts who cant get goin without ye whip their bare bottoms an tell em what bad boys they be and some who wish twhip you lewrie scowled bedamned if they will tess declared mother batson dont hold with her girls gettin hurt scarred up morelike and this anatoli liked tbe whipped lewrie asked oh no not him tess said after a big bite of her sandwich and a swig of champagne he cared more for puttin it in my mouth or my bumhole an all th time tryin tsneak his cundum off whilst im kneelin on all fours like a bitchhound might start out havin me th normal christian

love o god onliest way tshut him up was tkneel on th floor an ye know then he was cherrymerry again for a time one night tess said leaning close to confide in lewrie he got th window open an stood on th ledge stark nekkid an drunk as a lord fer evryone tsee swearin if i didnt be his alone then hed jump and swear on the bible capm alan twas all i could do not tgive him a push maybe you should have lewrie said laughing tother girlsd complained about him an after i told mother batson about that she told him he wasnt welcome no more thank god tess said with a forlorn look for a moment she took a pensive bite of her sandwich and slowly chewed not the sort ttake no for an answer though i take it he asked bob an them say they can spot him lurkin in th street most nights tess said with a shiver him an his man i havent been able tgo out with mother batson since they let you out lewrie enquired imagining the possibilities this house dont keep no slaves capm alan tess bragged if we need tgo shoppin see a show or somethin mother will take us with a couple o th burly lads o course we cant be stylish elegant nor fetchin in th same ol clothes all th time were closed of a sunday o course and

taverns with rooms tlet id walk out with you capm alan even does that mad roosky bastard follow us all th way id be safe with you fact o th matter tess cooed leaning her head on his shoulder putting

like th way ye bed me like ye care do i feel before he could begin to poohpooh that notion tess was kissing him again this time lightly fondly almost dreamily even with bread crumbs on her lips it was sweet well see about walkin you out lewrie told her putting on a wide amusing grin once we know this russky bastards no more threat to you hmm i know some people he hinted darkly for now though could i reserve you for all tomorrow night ye could come early for th supper an all tess gaily said all but clapping her hands though lewrie sensed a false note to her enthusiasm as if she was secretly disappointed that hed not squire her about in public not right away at least she looked him over a bit as if sizing up the heft of his purse the status of his accounts perhaps shed read the tracts or newspaper articles which had touched on his long string of captures and the scent of much prizemoney dont care what she says she aint givin it away for free he cautioned himself shes most like schemin for a place of her own an me her only patron and i cant afford that poor hopeful thing tis only three guineas th evnin she told him her head cocked to see how he reacted to that with champagne an vittles late at night like now extra o course id call that a toppin bargain lewrie cheered giving her a hug what time should i be here for the supper starts at seven tess told him looking relieved and pleased ill be all prettied up for ye more makeup than now you dont need false artifice tess he declared youre as handsome as any ever i did see just the way you are la yere th gallant man she chuckled go on with yer fine self long as ye prefer me so though they finished their sandwiches drained the last drops from the champagne bottle and slipped back under the covers her robe spread on the top of the blankets and coverlet londons church bells rang two in the morning and lewrie yawned his eyes beginning to feel gritty ye wish tsleep now alan tess asked about half out of it herself fore that could ye lock th door again an slide th chest tblock it itd make me feel safer she asked in a wee voice he borrowed her toosmall robe for a moment went about the cold room snuffing candles sliding the chest before the door and locking it with the key then slipped back into bed with her she came to him to drape across him as he embraced her a hard squeeze from him another from tess and a happy sigh in the dark after hed snuffed the candle on the nightstand as she nuzzled and burrowed her head into the hollow of his shoulder halfdrunk nigh fucked out yet lewrie thought head swimming no all he wanted then was to sleep for real sleep warm with a warm girl next to him a girl who was already breathing with her lips parted on his shoulder give it a rest he chid himself give her one too theres always tmorrow mornin and tmorrow night chapter eighteen what the bloody hell am i gettin myself into he asked himself after breakfast at the madeira club a somewhat hot bath and a change of clothes a shave and a halfhour tussle with toulon and chalky in his rooms after theyd gotten over their sulks that hed not spent the night in his own bed he was beginning to feel human again much refreshed lewrie trotted down to the common rooms to give the newspapers a gander nodding good mornings to the other lodgers he requested a cup of coffee then picked among the pile of dailies that his fellow clubmembers had already read he picked the morning post first looking for mrs denbys tattler article though it was hard to find newspapers crammed items together much like a stew onions next to broth meat sunk beneath the oatmeal the type font style and size was unvarying with only the briefest separation tween the end of one and the beginning of the next each headed by only the vaguest notices as to what each contained with nothing standing out and shouting its importance all of course intermixed with advertisements of the same sort with only the rarest and expensive woodcut illustration one usually saw illustrations only in pennytracts and pamphlets not newspapers one thing stood out though jesus christ lewrie yelped as he got to the middle of the first page despite the ink smudges caused by previous readers hands he could make out that the government had fallen the prime minister william pitt the younger he was called as opposed to pitt the elder now earl of chatham his father who had preceded him in that office had resigned twigg was right lewrie muttered he really meant it the morning post speculated that a new government would be formed by lord addington who would assume the office of prime minister at once the king would request him to form a new cabinet which the post assured readers from their sources would contain the earl of elgin as the new lord chancellor lord hawkesbury as foreign secretary and lord hobart would replace sir henry dundas as secretary of state for war admiralty admiralty lewrie hungrily growled in impatience he scanned down the page flitting from line to linestumbling into an advertisement for ladies hats before jumping to the top of the next column old jarvy by god he chortled as he found the speculated name i know him and he dont despise me pray god he serves admiral the earl st vincent sir john jervis prior to his victory and elevation to the peerage had been in command of the mediterranean fleet since then in command of channel fleet since only one drawback stood in the way of old jarvys acceptance of the office he had been at sea for bloody years on end in all weathers and might be so broken in healthhe was no spring chicken as lewries north carolina wife could colloquially saythat hed rather come ashore to retire not take on responsibility for the whole royal navy lewrie almost gnawed a thumbnail in fret wondering whether he should write him that very morning and send the letter to portsmouth before jervis even decided or whether to send it to admiralty hoping it would be the first thing the man opened and read upon taking charge a letter to portsmouth might cross jerviss path and miss him one to admiralty might get shuffled into the bottom of a vast pile of correspondence if not outright tossed in the dustbin by a departing secretary for the principal two secretaries to admiralty kept their lucrative government posts at the pleasure of the first lord and the current head of the navy lord spencer had no love for lewrie of that he was damned sure get my best uniform sponged an pressed for later lewrie decided realising that haste would serve no purpose and get the cathairs off he moved on to the times the chronicle the gazette and the marine chronicle the only copy of the courier was last evenings and would have nothing to offer all of them seemed to have spoken to the same anonymous sources in government and cited the same names of new ministers expected to form the new government the times speculated even further as to why pitt had resigned it was over catholic emancipation of course public office seats in commons military or naval commissions required adherence to the established church of england catholics and jews were barred from holding offices muslims jains hindoos perhaps even some of the oddest of the dissenter sects were barred as well for all lewrie knew people in the armys ranks could rise to sergeantsmajor people in the navy could rise as high as boatswain or hold admiralty warrant whatever their faith but to hold command posts well pitt and the king had come to loggerheads over it and king georges stubborness had won as defender of the faith the king would brook no innovations in time of war against a heathen pagan antireligious foe such as the republican levelling french just as well lewrie grunted to himself no place in the gunroom for whirlin dervishes or even homegrown druids with or without paintin themselves blue damme his hands his fingertips were nighblack with ink smudges and his coffee was cold uhm spears a fresh hot coffee and a wet hand towel if ye please he gingerly returned to the morning post delving further into it past the front page in search of something labelled tattler aha he chortled when he found it buried on page six court doings scandals upcoming bills of divorcement rumoured twixt unhappy spousesmostly for adultery which would make such salacious reading in the near future there were publishers who would obtain the transcripts and print them up for sale as mild pornography for those who got their jollies from such accounts last night in ranelagh gardens there occurred a contretemps between one of our naval heroes mentioned prominently in the news of late and a wealthy lady of greek extraction now residing in london engaged in the overseas currant trade now there was a slur trade was not a gentlemanly endeavour and for a woman to run such a business was even worse a mortal error to societys mores even were she englishborn and to be greek well oh mrs denby had done him proud lewrie decided after finishing the article tears a hint of a scandal false charges of paternity with prominent note taken of lewries supposition that her late husband had quickened the child in question and those letters sent in jealous spite perhaps by a mad woman confrontation before her doors loud protestations of condemnation for her actions theoni was lewrie smugly thought ruined in london mrs denby had even interviewed last nights witnesses for anonymous comment after hed gone as if to spread jamcurrant jamon this particularly savoury duff outraged amusement was the carefully selected consensus opinion with much sympathy for the unnamed naval hero and his tortured wife and nothing but loathing and revulsion for the perpetrator his fresh coffee came and a wet hand towel with which he wiped his fingers a moment later another club servant approached with a note lewrie flicked it open noting the initials tkc pressed into the wax seal it was from theoni in her own hand for once not the maidservant whod penned her poisonous letters so the english syntax was a little hard to follow beg for forgiveness leave caroline for her he read in silent astonishment good god the woman might be truly mad think about our son mine arse there be a reply sir the servant softly asked coughing into his fist theres a messenger waitin no no reply lewrie snapped crumpling the note in his fist he sipped his coffee slowly a tad worried it here must be noted that theoni might sue him for paternity she certainly had the money to do so and that would mean the rest of his life tied up in chancery court where lawyers made bloody millions off the carcasses of their clients would she dare risk exposing herself and the boy to public certainty instead of rumours and guesses about her identity hadnt thought o that lewrie ruefully mused but it seemed like a hellishgood idea at the time christ shit on a another note sir the same servant said with another cough bloody lewrie fumed tearing this one open i did not imagine you to be quite so clever sir to expose your tormentor so quickly and adroitly in celebration might you dine with me at the chophouse in savoy st and the strand at one oclock there are certain considerations anent your actions that must be discussed as well as the amazing news of the change in government please reply twigg meanin he thought of lawsuits before i did damn his blood lewrie muttered scowling at the clock atop the mantel then at the waiting servant the gentlemans runner is waitin good tell him that ill be pleased to accept the invitation to dine at the time and place proposed very good sir by god i do get tired o runnin ttwigg tsave mine arse he thought squirming twixt dread embarrassment who knows what ill end up owin him my firstborn son patronsre sposed tbe nice people book surge et adversa impetu perfringe solito nunc tuum nulli imparem animum malo resume nunc magna tibi virtute agendum est up and with thy wonted force break through adversity now get back thy courage which was neer unequal to any hardship now must thou greatly play the man lucius annaeus seneca hercules furens chapter nineteen momentous news mr twigg simpered dabbing his lips with his napkin as the soup course was removed i told you pitts administration would fall it was only a matter of timing do you see and to resign over such a trifling matter too im sure catholic emancipation was close to his heart lewrie said god knows why perhaps hed only sold the act of union to the irish with such a promise and what hed promised to his own faction for them to back it he added with a shrug which promises to his own faction he most certainly could never keep either twigg interjected with a faint thinlipped smile they assuredly knew that emancipation was a bootless endeavour from the very start and shammed their support for it knowing that the kings opposition to it would be its undoing and pitts maybe he was just tired lewrie said or looked to be at the end of his tether to his contemporaries those hungry for his place and higher positions twigg said with a sardonic cock of one brow the old and sick kingwolf always succumbs to the pack in the end torn to shreds his throat ripped out by the younger and stronger with his bemused smile twigg looked as if he liked his simile and would be partial to witnessing such an event hed always been a cold bloodthirsty sort when necessary well i am certain your odds have improved lewrie with jervis as first lord of the admiralty twigg breezed on as a waiter carried in some nicely browned squabs on rice depending on who serves him as first and second secretary and how they feel about me lewrie pointed out i do believe that sir evan nepean will stay on twigg told him as will marsden as second then im still up tmy neck in the quag lewrie groused speaking of twigg said with a twinkle in his eye i suppose youve given your letters to the lady in question a thought hmm lewrie replied a glass of sauvignon blanc by his mouth no you havent twigg said with a heavy disappointed sigh is mistress connor of a mind to get revenge in court chancery mostlike lewrie gloomed ahem as i said is she of a mind and has she saved all your letters to her over the years as i strongly suspect she has then they could prove to be damning evidence that the affair was mutual and that you are the father of her bastard protestations of lust love i aint that stupid lewrie shot back learned that from my father never put anything in writing ye dont wish made known later especially when it comes to women falsepromise broken troths belly pleas and all that far as i can recall i was chatty and pleasant but i never made any sort of claim the boy was mine well i mightve asked of his health and progress just as i did about her firstborn lewrie added family friend or godfather to the git nothing more than that and did you save hers twigg pressed scowling not a bit of it lewrie told him gone tcat litter long ago well thats something i suppose twigg said leaning back in his chair and swirling his wine glass idly one could not expect you to be that huge a calfheaded cully no matter how desirable the lady or how eminently bedable should i take that as a backhanded compliment lewrie asked id not twigg replied hmm lewrie gravelled at the backhanded insult oh by the by last night i ran across something interesting you might wish to look into about some daft drunken russian here in london a russian dye say hmm twigg mused between bites some nabob who calls himself a count anatoli or something like that lewrie breezed on between bites of his own squab and rice damned fool took a strong liking to a whore at mother batsons house and broke in past her pugs tget to her mustve run out of tin for the socketfee beastly sort i heard just wont do it regular goes for the windward passage unarmoured too can he get away with it got himself and his manservant thrashed to blood puddings by the sound of it mean tsay whats a mad russian count doin runnin free in london and us about to send a fleet tsmash em so you heard twigg said putting down his knife and fork and looking down that long nose of his most skeptically by word of mouth or by ear at the scene well lewrie flummoxed you simply cant keep your breeches buttoned can you lewrie twigg resignedly asked its a damned good house lewrie pointed out even my prosecuting attorney was there the toplofty bastard and an mp close to the progressives and the abolitionists to boot id gotten there early enough i mightve run cross a bishop in their parlour or the prince of wales oh i am certain it comes highly recommended twigg sneered he did though reach into a breast pocket for a slip of paper and a pencil and scribbled something down mother batsons or anatoli lewrie dared to jape as for recommendations might i give you the girls name too you are too amusing lewrie twigg retorted with a faint snarl i do my humble best lewrie said lifting his wine glass in a mock toast damme but this is good my barrister and i dined here before christmas so long as i footed the bill and their food is excellent ahem twigg grumped as if to shush him or stop his gob long enough to get a word in did you see this anatoli could you describe him or point him out later no i only heard him battlin his way up the stairs him and his man sasha or pasha or something like that lewrie told him i was on the third floor and they only got to the second before mother batsons bullybucks stopped em hes a young fellow though he was attending oxford as late as the last term til he came down to london and never went back hes lucky he didnt end up a naked corpse found floatin in the thames bad cess on the house i spose murderin a titled shit even a russian titled shit and havin it traced back to you thrashed rather badly was he twigg asked after a long period of brooding silence his brows knit together id expect lewrie said with another shrug and another sip of his wine and where is this house of ill repute twigg asked him with his paper and pencil out again in panton street where all the foreign emissaries live and keep their mistresses lewrie informed him with a sly wink id have thought youd have the whole street full of informers perhaps not as scrupulously as we might twigg said in a softer more conspiratorial voice usually one watcher at least would have noted the disturbance in panton street and would have reported it though did it occur past midnight perhaps his report has not yet been read sure this fellow was a russian lewrie twigg asked his head cocked over like a robin listening for a worm and looking dubious as he usually did when lewrie was involved the girl swore he was and i definitely heard russian lewrie told him pamajeetyeh thats help and uhm viy mojetyeh mnyeh pamoch thats can i get some help lewrie carefully pronounced syllable by syllable along with the usual pryaznis and gryaznis and yob tvoyemats the usual insults he said with a tight grin of possibly knowing something that mr twigg didnt fuck your mother you dirty this you filthy that and peasant ah but your association with mistress eudoxia durschenko and her equally charming father have broadened your linguistic skills twigg simpered back with an evil little grin to match his it didnt last of course and vanished in an eyeblink twigg took a sip of his wine and turned his attention to his plate so what are you to do now that admiral the earl saint vincent will take over admiralty twigg asked changing from calculating to cheerful in another eyeblink his eyes glued to his knife and fork hallo whats this lewrie was forced to wonder i know him too damned well since whens he ever played the merry andrew with me not without an ulterior motive he aint assumin hell accept lewrie said pessimistically i assure you he will twigg said and to foozle lewrie even further he actually tipped him a chummy wink theres a dead roosky in the near future lewrie determined or im a turk in a turban did i stumble on a foreign spy for him soon tbe found with his throat slit in saint giles hes been at sea so long he wants a shore position is that your thinking lewrie asked playing along that and the lure of enough power over the navy to weed out all the graft and corruption in the victualling arming and upkeep of the fleet its sailors most importantly twigg breezily said with knife and fork poised at midchest jervis has fumed about it for years given a chance to shake the navys administration like a rag rug from top to bottom and ashore as you said in relative comfort for the first time in years well consider it a done thing twigg bestowed upon lewrie a very chummy smile the sort that made his skin crawl and foreign opponents shiver in sudden dread thank god for that then lewrie said with a glad sigh one thing about twigg when he gave you a promise you could bank on it and as lewrie felt some sense of assurance regarding his careers revival he also felt a swell of relief that twigg had nothing more to do with his chances with lord st vincent and that he wouldnt end up working for the skeletal old murderer you said you know him well lewrie twigg casually enquired weve met a time or two lewrie had to admit not as close as catercousins no but i think im still in good odour with him a word of advice then sir twigg said resuming that lofty and smugly superior air of a man so well connected that his very word was gospel to the less well informed like lewrie saint vincent is a very early riser i am told with great disdain for the slugabeds and layabouts were i you once hes officially installed at admiralty id be knocking at the doors at the crack of dawn scrubbed up and shiny as a bright new penny a sober new penny brighteyed and bushytailed lewrie added and took delight to see twigg puzzled a colonial north carolina expression american however you wish to phrase it yayss twigg drawled leaning back in only mild scorn for the abusing of the kings english now i have smoaked out your tormentor and you have exposed mistress theoni kavares connor to the complete scorn of london society have you informed your good wife of yet well it only happened last night and and you were celebrating with a fetching young wench yayss twigg scoffed no matter as i promised news of this welcome though it may be would best be delivered by me first i shall coach to anglesgreen before the week is out and once returned inform you as to how my revelation was received time enough after that to write her twigg lifted his wine glass in lewries direction delivering yet another of those cheerful smiles my thanks again to you mister twigg lewrie said bowing from the waist in his chair and lifting his own glass prompted to share a glass no matter his reservations a glass with you sir i am certain there shall come a time in future when you may find a way to repay me for my ah humble services sir mr twigg slyly told him let us not be niggardly top us up a brimming measure and i shall be delighted to have a glass with you lewrie filled their glasses they clinked them together softly then both tipped them back to drain them off in one go are you not equally certain that you will do me a service someday captain lewrie twigg chirped almost mischieviously oh of that im mortalcertain mister twigg lewrie replied with a sinking feeling that his indebtedness to the old schemer just kept piling up to a point that would really put his life on the line for good and all after departing the chophouse lewrie ambled back to his club lodgings stopping at the admiral boscawen for coffee to counteract all the toasts and shared glasses that twigg had proposed he was in dire need of another good nap and a thought for supper on the town somewhere i really shouldnt he chid himself surely theres a whackin good book tread a new play tsee or oh hell he chid himself he went back to the brothel of course chapter twenty th top o th mornin captain the surly old longtime tiler at admiralty chirped as lewrie scurried through the archway passage in the curtain wall underneath the winged horse statues and quickly approached the doors may i say yere an early sort right enough morning lewrie said with a nod mornin more like th middle o th bleedin night sir the old fart barked and wheezed out a laugh but thats th way it is round ere these days an god help th late sleepers th waitin rooms nigh halffull aready but go on in captain sir an th best o luck tye the tiler said swinging a heavy oak door open for him and tipping his hat mind now sir th jakes aint been sweetened this early an theys no tea comin til close tnine lewrie checked his hat and boatcloak and mittens with the closet clerk then shot his cuffs resettled his sword belt and waistcoat and warily entered the infamous waiting room striving for an air of sublime confidence before his contemporaries what a shower o nohopes he thought as he sought a chair or a space on a hard wooden bench the weather that morningten minutes shy of amwas brisk and wet with a faint misty rain and it was still cold though not as cold as the week before in england it might as well be called the first harbinger of spring the first robin or first crocus shoot in comparison no wonder so many of the officers and midshipmen were sniffling hacking and blowing their noses into handkerchiefs there was little conversation for the very good reason that they were all there to win an active commission and everyone else was competition for full employment it also seemed that few of them had served together before eithercomplete strangers to each other as they were to lewrie there was no one he knew in the waiting room the baduns are yellow squadroned and the gooduns are at sea he sarcastically thought a harried civilian clerk came trotting by and lewrie snagged his attention just long enough to hand him his note a few minutes with the first secretary or the earl should he be in this early lewrie said with a false air of cheery hope oh he is believe me sir the clerk replied with a putupon and harried expression before accepting the note and dashing up the stairs lewrie was in colonial parlance indeed brighteyed and bushytailed sober and cleareyed after but a single bottle of wine with supper and a bedtime brandy bathed shaved buffed and polished fit to blind the unwary from the toes of his boots to the gilt lace on his coat collar and with the medals for cape st vincent and camperdown clinking on his upper chest he had even eschewed tesss companionship for two whole nights running and had gotten a blissfully restful full nights sleep he found a seat at the end of a wooden bench carefully sat down and crossed his legs giving the dimlooking midshipman seated at the other end of the bench a cheery nod and picked up the discarded copy of the marine chronicle that lay between them the midshipman gulped and nodded back rather vacantly and snorted back an impressive dottle of snot that trailed from his larboard nostril the lad looked to be a born mouthbreather to lewries lights by ten his air of confidence was wearing a little thin others came and went some lucky few were called abovestairs but the bulk of them were sent on their way with sympathetic whispers from one clerk or curt and thinlipped dismissals from another the teavendors cart had finally made its appearance in the courtyard but the necessary available for the denizens of the waiting room had yet to be emptied and it stank like a corpses armpit the sort of reek that lingered on anyone who risked it the sort of foul odour that turned freshpressed neckstocks limp and put famished buzzards off their feed em the more pleasant clerk shyly called making them all shuffle their feet and look up expectantly the vacant midshipman at the other end of lewries bench snorted back his last hours cable of mucus and gulped aloud captain lewrie sir are you present here my man lewrie announced springing to his feet with the fingers of his offhand crossed for luck the first lord will see you sir if youll come this way thankee kindly lewrie said absolutely delighted with that glad news yet wondering what sort of reception awaited him once hed gotten into the earl st vincents presence my lord lewrie said with a bow once hed been shown into a grand private office captain lewrie admiral jervis said rising from his chair and waving lewrie to a chair before his massive desk lewrie wondered if lord st vincent would stand throughout the length of the interview or doff his wig above his head for he had a most peculiar habit of removing his hat and holding it high in a constant salute whether he addressed a bosuns mate or a fellow admiral i remember you sir the good parts i bloody hope lewrie thought i am grateful that you recall me my lord and for taking some wee bit of your precious time to see me lewrie responded as he sat down yes admiral jervis would stand lewrie began to rise you and nelson at cape saint vincent the earl st vincent said shoving a hand in his direction to order him to stay seated i think you insisted that your ship was pushed to break away and follow nelsons even so it was a bold gesture one which checked the dons course long enough for the fleet to wear about i hear you are still bold captain lewrie though no longer in need of pushing admiral the earl st vincent kb actually cracked a smile he had aged of course and gotten stouter he wore his own hair now nearly white and receded from a broad brow still curly and unruly a broad and long almost doleful face with the advancing wattles reflecting his age and a round little chin with the characteristic long almost aquiline nose that seemed to persist among the titled yet with heavylidded eyes with bags under them that at the moment glittered with amusement on my own bottom my lord lewrie replied with a modest grin i find im much like goodyers pig never well but when in mischief notorious morelike jervis commented turning sombre an account of your recent trial and acquittal made its way to me and of course you are here like so many others to seek active commission ehm aye my lord lewrie sobered though i would think it false modesty to imagine myself as a twoapenny other one of old jarvys thick eyebrows went up at that statement damme what a foolish thing tsay lewrie chid himself now he thinks me a braggin coxcomb i do not compare myself to a troubridge a pellew or nelson my lord lewrie quickly amended lord spare us another nelson admiral jervis growled but i do believe that my record as a frigate captain speaks for itself lewrie went on it has been he deuced hard to read of the preparations against the baltic powers and for the first time since the start of the war in seventeen ninetythree to not have any role to play in the coming battles and whats he got against nelson lewrie wondered his affair with emma hamilton the scandal pray god he dont know the half of me old jarvy just stared at him though that brow was lowered to a placid patient expression the silence was squirmily painful so despite his fear of seeming to beg lewrie just had to fill the void command of a warship in time of war just may be the onliest thing im really good at my lord lewrie confessed if there is any place where my services could prove useful in the coming weeks for the good of the navy well what do you think of hm dockyards captain lewrie the earl st vincent said of a sudden resting his thick fingers on the top of his desk theyre a pack of bloody thieves my lord lewrie said with corruption from biscuit to artillery hangin every tenth man like the romans decimated a cowardly legion would screw the others honest hanging the earl st vincent abruptly said seeming to lean back perhaps that might be a touch too draconian oh shit i forgot lewrie chid himself squirming despite his attempt to look calm after the spithead and nore mutinies of it was to jerviss fleet in the mediterranean and off the coast of spain that the most vehement former mutinous ships and their guiltiest men had been assigned jervis had had to play the hangman to see that the sentences of the courtsmartial were carried out out of sight and out of mind as if the whole rebellious affair had been no more than a single nights drunken riot in the public mind not the small bundle of kindling that could have ignited a nationwide revolution as bloody as that which had ravaged france in three hundred lashes then my lord lewrie substituted what would you say to the notion of the dockyards threatening to stop work is their pay not doubled lewrie the earl gravelled doubled i and that a delegation is bound to london to press those demands upon me admiral jervis rumbled on at the very least id sack the lot of em my lord lewrie told him angered that at such a critical time the already wellpaid dockyard workers would threaten a walkout and cripple the fleet still hurriedly fitting out for battles in the east my thoughts exactly sir the earl st vincent fumed with a grim smile on his face that zachariah twigg might envy them and any who abetted them the organisers and conspirators to boot damned unpatriotic of em i must say my lord lewrie said and damn sir andrew snape hamond into the bargain for all of his laxness that this matter should ever arise admiral jervis fumed on i should bring troubridge in to replace him could i do so to work round him at the very least admiral sir andrew snape hamond had been controller of the navy since in charge of all the various navy boards that supervised the dockyards and contractors supplying the fleet lewrie had heard that hamond had spoken up for him after proteus had returned from the south atlantic getting him his larger frigate hms savage so quickly after yet glad hamond aint my real patron or id not have a single hope of another ship lewrie thought you know something of the work of the dockyards lewrie the earl enquired their management or accounting only to be at the receiving end of their largesse lewrie admitted with a bleak smile and the smile was forced for he felt a sick feeling that whatever employment old jarvy might offer wouldnt be an active commission into a frigate but a penandink shore post about which he knew nexttoabsolutelynothing and was sure he would be an utter disaster at cobblers stick tyour lasts lewrie thought even if its a damned narrow one civilian clerksd be cheaper or copyists under nepean and marsden who was that young rogue who wrote the board the earl mused with the slightest hint of frosty humour complaining of how little paint his ship had been allotted which side of the ship do you wish me to paint sirs he asked ha i cant recall my lord lewrie replied though everyone i know wished hed been that bold no matter then the earl said with a sigh i will enquire captain lewrie you have made for yourself an enviable reputation in the navy at sea at least hmm in these parlous times for you to be pent ashore on halfpay i consider a waste i make no promises for the immediate future mind but i am grateful for your good opinion my lord and for keeping me in mind lewrie said knowing a prompting departure line when he heard one he got to his feet and delivered a bow i will take no more of your time sir and thankee again for seeing me even as he reached for the door knob there came a knocking and the bustling entrance of the dismissive hardfaced underclerk with a sheaf of papers and an urgent out of my way look on his phyz to claim the first lords attention oh well at least he saw me lewrie thought as he steeled himself to clomp down those stairs to the waiting room with a confident and selfassured air perhaps a faint smirk in parting for the others who cooled their heels with even less hope of employment than he now what the hell do i do with the rest of the day he asked himself the week and the next chapter twentyone alan lewrie discovered that populous as london was it might be possible for him to have spread himself a rather bit too wide about the town when in need of stationery ink and sealing wax and upon shopping in the strand one february morning he ran into more people than he cared to know at one time and in the same one place at least alan me old lord peter rushton an old school chum expelled at the same time from harrow as he came striding along the sidewalk in the opposite direction with that everpresent amanuensis of his that seemingly honest captain sharp clotworthy chute another old chum from harrow who specialised in fleecing the naпve and unwary newcomes my lord lewrie cried back with a grin doffing his hat and making a sketchy leg in answer how goes it in lords hallo to you too clotworthy how goes the gullible heir trade ninetyfive percent dreadfulboresome and only now and then intrestin lord peter who now sat in the house of lords napped there mostly during the intolerably long debates said back mainwell old son was clotworthys puckish reply as he rubbed his mittened hands together grinning like an applecheeked cherub mainwell altogether i see youre still anchored as it were so sorry though the london seasons been a joy id imagine i met with the earl saint vincent last week and it sounded promisin but lewrie said with a shrug em alan lord peter said with a leer now youre done with that greek creature might you mind did i ah saw her did ye lewrie teased at the theatre before you saw her off rushton said leaning closer great god what tits she has whatd your wife say tthat hey lewrie asked a brow cocked same as yours id imagine lord peter hawhawed actlly i and she prefer seprate residences now theres two male heirs afoot christ whoda thought such a sweet chickd turn so termagant so quick clotworthy heres the right idea he dont purchase he only rents for a time damme have you turned hermit on us alan we havent seen hide nor hair of you since the trial was over whereve you been keeping yourself know ya dont gamble but we thought youd turn up at some of the better public clubs clotworthy seemed to complain well theres the abolitionist crowd lewrie began to explain call a dog like me a good name and its risky to lose kapitan lewrie zdrazvotyeh hello to you erp was lewries comment as he turned about to see eudoxia durschenko alighting from a hired coach a few yards up the strand a furswathed vision of a winter princess her lustrous dark hair spilling over the collar of a white ermine coat that reached to her ankles yet open to reveal a rich darkred gown bugger theoni connor ill take her lord peter muttered in awe mistress durschenko lewrie said doffing his hat and bowing greetings as she strode up to them the proper graceful glide bedamned how delightful to meet you again you do not ride in park in the mornings eudoxia said with a fetching pout as she dropped him a curtsy at last do not tell me it is too cold for english gentlemen she said with a teasing laugh some navy business of late lewrie explained gentlemen allow me to name to you mistress eudoxia durschenko of the world famous wigmores peripatetic extravaganza mistress durschenko this fellow is viscount draywick lord peter rushton and our old school friend mister clotworthy chute ahem came a disapproving cough and there was eudoxias papa the lanky oneeyed old devil arslan artimovich durschenko again lewrie doffed his hat to the old fart forcing a smile which courtesy arslan answered with a sniff of disgust knowing the mans distaste for royalty of any country lewrie took a little savage joy in introducing him too ah you are the magnificent bareback rider and archer from the circus lord peter exclaimed saw your performance several times before christmas haw haw said at the time mistress durschenko was the most amazing of them all didnt i clotworthy deed ya did my lord clotworthy assured her delighted to make your acquaintance the both of you and youre the liontamer chap are ya not sir da was her fathers laconic answer we are in winter quarters now in southwark eudoxia said in pleasure but still do dramas and comedies circus begin in spring well shall we all have tea lord peter suggested simply oozing innocent charm i be delighted from eudoxia nyet from her papa looking like he wished to spit i should toddle along from lewrie locking eyes with him nonsense from lord peter capital idea clotworthy exclaimed pooh kapitan lewrie eudoxia coaxed is perfect raw day for hot tea we see so little of you she added with a lovely moue as have we from lord peter seen so little of him haw i insist alan old son come along well grr from papa durschenko and the sound of irregular yellow teeth grinding now isnt this lovely lord peter rushton enthused once they were all seated round a large table near the fireplace of a fashionable teaand coffeehouse a block down from their mutual encounter unlike most coffeehouses that catered strictly to men and their newspapers this one canted more to sticky buns pies puddings duffs trifles and jam cakes it was warm dry filled with several delicious aromas of baking goodies and positively awash in ladies and children out and about their shopping uhmm tea is good eudoxia commented amazing everyone by stirring a large spoonful of jam into her cup is very russian far sweet in tea she perkily explained sugar not always av available so use honey or jam in russia tea brewed in big samovar and served in glasses with metal holders very strong very hot how fascinating lord peter remarked causing even clotworthy chute to discreetly roll his eyes so tell me brave kapitan lewrie soon go to russia he brings back proper tea glasses yes eudoxia asked turning to lewrie dont know as ill take part lewrie had to admit shrugging as if it really didnt matter to him i still need appointment to a ship oh pooh you will get eudoxia assured him blithely confident and at her most captivating you go fight the tsar though you will need warm furs ochyen kalodni very cold the winter and not warm til late in spring not have furs could catch your death freeze solid as tree da papa durschenko added with a nasty grin happily contemplating such a fate should we order some cakes lord peter suggested my treat would that make up for all the tatties you cadged off me at school my lord lewrie teased both rushton and chute ever had been skint no matter their families reputed wealth while at harrow so lewrie had learned to be leery of their appetites even after inheriting the title rents and acres once his elder brother had been carried off by an unfortunate mayonnaisebased made dish gone bad that the proper heirs fiancйe had cobbled together there hadnt been all that much real income not after lord peter and clotworthy had squandered a respectable pile of tin on their illtimed grand tour of the continent right in the middle of the war and lewrie had heard some rumours that lady draywick peters wife was the daughter of an incredibly wealthy wool merchant with army contracts one of those newmade commoner families with aspirations to the peerage these days though wealth made in trade was everywhere and like most marriages it was a canny arrangement for both sides i doubt a year o suppers would make recompence hey clotworthy peter guffawed here waiter the bell suspended over the door tinkled and another party entered the coffeehouse lewrie looked up and blanched christ he thought ye gonna walk out why pick this place and why right bloody now mrs batson the mother abbess in company with a brace of her whores with bob the bullybuck waiter and former boxer playing a role as escort and package bearer came bustling in chirping gay as magpies and one of them was tess a million people in london they tell me and yet he gawped he had not in point of fact visited mrs batsons brothel in almost a week hadnt seen tess in much more than a dressing gown and some slinky stuff or the altogether and the transformation was nighblinding her hair had been styled by a dresser into springy ringlets to frame her face the centre part now gone replaced with girlish bangs upon her forehead and its colour enhanced more toward strawberry blond with a wee bonnet perched atop her upswept hair a puffsleeved and highwaisted gown with a very lowcut dйcolletage very stylish and striking with a modest muslin overskirt and an embroidered silk stole to a casual observer tess was gowned as fine as an heiress yet as respectable as a bishops daughter theyd done something with her toilet too the weeest hint of rouge or paint the faintest enhancement of her lips why she was delectably pretty she nodded to him could not restrain a fond excited yet shy smile as a servant took their outer coats and led them to a table ahhmm lord peter faintly croaked hmm clotworthy commented over the rim of his tea cup as if making an appreciative yummy aah lewrie let slip discreetly nodding and smiling back kraseevi even papa durschenko whispered papa eudoxia chid him at your age da she is beautiful but much too young for you nyeh malyenkee byelakoori dyevachka arslan artimovich growled back goodnaturedly bolshoi krasni galava he said winking and lifting his hands as if hefting something lewrie took a second look and deduced though he knew very little russian that the old devil was more taken by a slightly older redhead with an impressively hefty set of catheads and a seductive leer on her face papa eudoxia tittered a trifle embarrassed bolshoi thats big lewrie puzzled out and i know krasni is red galava must mean redhead together nyeh is not what malyenkee byel he asked eudoxia means little blonde eudoxia explained as the waiter returned to take their orders only natral lord peter tuttutted hoisting his tea cup in salute to her father you think little blonde is pretty eudoxia asked with a sweet smile on her face yet with one brow arched well i spose lewrie said with a shrug if one likes that sort he tried very hard not to squirm under her knowing gaze poor thing is ryebyonak eudoxia said with a sniff turning to take a quick squint at the other table little more than child shesnatsat eelee syemnatsat uhm sixteen or seventeen grack lewrie commented strangling on a sip of tea and nigh to spewing a mouthful on the cheery tablecloth indeed sorry must have gone down the wrong hawse pipe girls look like ah eudoxia told him leaning close so she could whisper close to lewries ear prostitukas girls of evening really lewrie exclaimed pretending to be shocked london is fill with such eudoxia said struggling for the proper word allowed in public we go to pleasure gardens theatres walk down street they are everywhere in bolshoi number godless city papa durschenko said with distaste though his eyes were glued to the rubenesque redheads bosom godless country not like russia in a respectable coffeehouse lord peter feigned outrage as well what is the world comin to from such a source such primness was so unimaginable that lewrie almost brayed out loud though he did note that lord peters attention was torn twixt eudoxia and tess in equal measure he was all but fingering his crutch could he have got away with it before children furs dye say lewrie piped up swivelling to face eudoxia i note you and your father are very well garbed did you bring them from russia or did you find them here in london oh furs from russia very old now she said smiling again circus and comedies so suc successful we find new a furrier in hudson bay company in haymarket has beautiful furs i help you shop for them yes kapitan alan gryazni tarakan her father growled lewrie knew thatun by heart filthy cockroach he meant the oneeyed devil glared daggers and one hand was suspiciously near his waistband i couldnt impose lewrie quickly said such an expressive language russian lord peter dithered on tell me sir what did you just say have to practice acts rehearse i tell her papa durschenko lied his grin so feral that peter leaned back a bit in his chair no time for shopping all that in two words hah clotworthy said with a shake of his head impressive russian short and direct arslan artimovich replied dangerous fellow her father lord peter rushton asked lewrie once theyd taken their leave and had repaired to a tavern that served muchneeded restorative drink cut yer throat for tuppence lewrie assured him between sips of a calming brandy determined the girl dies a virgin i think and mostlikell be in the bedchamber on her weddin night tsee does it go his way or else so you havent um rushton asked amazed wouldnt even chance it less he croaks first lewrie admitted oh rum go clotworthy said with a sigh still the girl does seem took by you alan even if theres no future in it might prove a challenge lord peter mused dont even think it peter clotworthy cautioned if anyone in london was familiar with the truly dangerous it was chute and the old devil had put the wind up him go for the chamin little whore instead the otherun so took with alan here you rogue sir rushton hooted yes i noted she had eyes for you no wonder we aint seen him since the trial a delectable young beauty wherever did ya find her alan lewrie didnt want to tell him of a sudden even if tess was only a whore oft as hed sworn that hed have made a topping pimp come come now dont make me depend on clotworthy to ferret her out rushton pressed with an expectant leer which brothels she in and whats her fee dare ye risk bein seen in a brothel peter lewrie countered the wife and all your seat in lords and reputation oh tosh rushton laughed easier for me than you old son damme im a peer evryone knows how things stand twixt me and the wife its expected of my sort did whoring or keeping a mistress on the side make the slightest diffrence there wouldnt be the tenth of a quorum left in lords only those whove outlived their cocks and i sometimes wonder bout them seriously alan peter continued all atwinkle it aint like we havent shared and shared alike before where can i sample her and what does she cost mother batsons a new place in panton street lewrie reluctantly told him knowing that clotworthy chute could smoak her out by suppertime anyway her names tess newcome from belfast didnt know she was that young dye see sixteen or seventeen eudoxia thought two or three guineasll do shes just a passin fancy lewrie thought squirming so why does it irk me tpass her on a bloody bargain is she a good ride rushton snickered rich as peter rushton lord draywick was from what was left from his inheritance and his marriage into a trade fortune there was the possibility that he might find tess a very pleasing diversion even go so far as to buy her out and set her up as his mistress under his protection the saying went certainly he could not afford to do that or even go to mother batsons all that often might be best for her lewrie considered a place of her own with a maid and a cook rich gowns and jewelry some place warmer than that drab little cubicle she has now only the one customer to deal with too as much security as she could expect til peter gets tired of her might be best all round might be tesss fondest wish and since when did i care a toss for a whores welfare her bloody feelings i thought that bloody bellwether in charge of her baalambs hellishresembled emma batson clotworthy exclaimed as if hed solved a mystery famous in her youth she was and probably has her first shilling a clever old baggage with a head for her business as good as any fancy man i can tell you tess is she tess who dont know really lewrie said shrugging well last names hardly matter do they lord peter sniggered his nose in his brandy glass first names either dearie and my joe and darling serve just as well sixteen or seventeen hmm shes hellishsweet and endearing lewrie said his eyes fixed on the far wall as he took a sip of his own drink a newcome as i said he almost shook himself to reject that line of thinking theres a supper every evening for select patrons and the girls of their choice it aint a quick place even though theres another parlour for the walkins set a quite nice table really and ya meet the finest set o gentlemen lewrie added with a bark of sardonic amusement damn my eyes are you sweet on her alan lord peter rushton exclaimed feigning mock horror i do believe you are just like ya were at school the chambermaids who did for our rooms or that tavern wench at the crown and cushion where we always went do you recall her clotworthy betsy or judy or something indeed i do peter old son clotworthy seconded with a dreamy expression on his phyz damned impressive set of poonts she had as i remember and a most obligin mort alan here was so besotted with her hed have run off with her had she not been makin such a good livin makin half the students and a fair number of the faculty as happy as clams haw haw made me happy i can tell you and only one shilling a throw oh those were fine days nights rather ten minutes in the taverns pantry lord peter hooted with her skirts thrown up and sitting on an ale barrel for six pence oh but alan was always that way mad for quim then in creampot love for them damme i guess i always was lewrie confessed to himself poor fellow never figured out that likin em aint necessary just cause he got the leg over clotworthy said shaking his head in amusement just throw down yer money enjoy em and be done haw haw damme but i dont think i like these shits half as much as i used to lewrie thought with an uneasy feeling a tightening of his innards right ive always been a calfhead cully when it comes to the women whores or proper no matter fine enough friends when we all were lads but have i changed did they change or never have so a good ride is she this tess creature alan clotworthy goggled at him with a knowing leer lewrie squinted with sudden anger for a second before tamping it down firmly well youd be the best judge of that he said instead slowly drawling his answer damme am i jealous he wondered does she play the shy virgin peter queried or is she game for any place time fashion or orifice hey an acrobat is she dammit lewrie silently fumed taking time to answer by sipping on his drink theyre like schoolboys still civilian schoolboys a gentleman doesnt tell such have i got so old i cant feel chummy with fellow rakehells any longer or have i gotten wiser thats for you to find out peter lewrie told him faking a sly grin after he had finished the last dollop of brandy in his glass now did i have your purse id buy her out and set her up for shes that pleasing to me youd play pygmalion with her alan rushton japed not noticing his old friends reticence it didnt matter a whit to him on her mostlike clotworthy interjected next time you call at mother batsons youll put in a good word for me with the abbess lord peter asked with the girl as well is her establishment as fine as you say and sets such a fine table i might become a regular caller panton streets convenient to whitehall and my townhouse let her know a wealthy patrons coming hey he said with a wink and a leer at his double entendre well of course peter what are friends for lewrie said trying not to grit his teeth or slap the lecher silly hypocritical as such an act might be and ruefully chiding himself for being perhaps but a shadow compared to his old compatriots lascivious natures then a glass with you sir peter insisted snapping fingers for the waiter to come top them up lewrie would have risen and left but for that offer which could not be rejected or be thought of as a sneaker despite his distaste he stayed on ah but were a merry band of rogues clotworthy said with a cheery smile remember our old motto peter alan what wilkes said of life a few good fucks and then we die ha ha damme but i believe i started the day lookin for stationery lewrie said perking up as he changed the subject yet here i sit with not a single sheet nor a haporth of ink yet and there is that furrier in the haymarket to discover just in case admiraltys run short of postcaptains before the fleet sails for the baltic youll not dine with us alan clotworthy chute exclaimed in seeming disappointment perhaps hed fancied that lewrie would foot the bill as he had at harrow with ale porter and tatties some other time clotworthy lewrie demurred i think ill finish this last glass then toddle along i believe we should all consider our drinks celebratory that we survived an encounter with mistress durschenkos charmin father hmm do you think well really have to go fight the russians danes and swedes alan clotworthy asked mean tsay aye and the sooner the better lewrie assured him time is not on our side not with the weather warmin and their navies ports thawin out do they put to sea and combine well beat em like a drum no matter peter scoffed with a sublime confidence that bordered on indifference he even allowed himself one idle yawn weve nelson after all and alan can he tear himself from betwixt his doxys legs clotworthy chuckled over the rim of his glass well see wont we lewrie asked finally finishing off his brandy and more than ready to depart one way or tother by yer leave sir an impatient porter snarled at him trying to make way on the crowded sidewalk with several wrapped packets by yer own bloody leave damn yer eyes lewrie snapped back more than ready to fight someone raising his walkingstick in threat pardons pardons the weedy little brute shied away more sauce than sinew and scurried off bloody hell lewrie growled under his breath what a pack of codsheads are they what idve become if id stayed ashore in london anywhere in england he fumed to himself as he strode along for his lodgings then thank god for the navy alan lewrie had always cynically cheerfully admitted that he would never be buried a bishop that the most he had aspired to would be to be considered a buckofthefirsthead a merry denizen of the cock and hen clubs in the more sordid parts of london sleep in late roister and rantipole til dawn and begin it all over had he had his druthers such as he seemed to be doing now yet not only had it become tiresome boresome but it was beginning to pall the ambrosia turned to ashes in his mouth the mornings encounter with peter and clotworthy made him squint with revulsion christ am i havin an epiphany he wondered he shook that notion off with a shiver and a barely audible brr idle hands the devils workshop he recalled and ive been damned idle since before christmas or totherun lie down with dogs and ye rise with fleas oh god ye dont hear from me much but i really need tget back tsea doesnt have tbe a frigate a cutter would do a onemasted revenue sloop hell even the impress service just so long as im employed at something im not a huge sinner after all compared to some i could name right im a fool for women and i always get in trouble ashore there may be women aboard warships despite what the admiralty wishes but none that tempt my eye the pluguglies most of em foul an rough as bosuns he accepted the fact that peter and clotworthy were right in one regard he never had been a callous unscrupulous abuser of womens affections hed always gone soft on them in point of fact two of his duels in his early days had been in defence of a girls good name or honour so didnt that count for something mean tsay write off the odd convenient quarterhour romp here and there and what have you he thought scanning back over his conquests as he dodged a brace of strolling ladies and a street urchin bullying a wee dog a string of fond relationships thats what by sorry longtime mutually pleasin love affairs dont make me a bad person not like peter or clotworthy or he practically stormed up the steps to the doors of the madeira club thrusting the doors back so forcefully that the day porter at the desk jumped in fright scrambling to come round to gather up his cloak hat walkingstick and mittens still raw out sir a fine mist falling still ill have your cloak and hat sponged then send them up to your rooms sir er thankee lewrie mumbled realising that hed stomped back to the club so fiercely that hed worked up a sweat under his clothes any letters for me uhm nossir none so far today very well then do any come ill be in the common room very good captain lewrie lewrie dabbed at his temples and cheeks with a handkerchief to make himself presentable once hed found a nice quiet corner and a thickly padded leather wingback chair near the fireplace a servant took his request for hot coffee and padded away leaving him to stew on the mornings doings what the devil do i do he muttered as he stirred sugar and milk into his cup it cant go on like this not for long or ill be skint by easter his accounts at couttss bank some prizemoney that had dribbled in from mediterranean captures way back in was sufficient for keeping a gentleman of his station in moderate comfort with enough to keep up his rented farm and home in anglesgreen both the boys at their school his daughter charlottes first tutor and his wife with her typical thriftiness in fine style dabbling with the whores though sweet as one of them was lord peter could afford such squandering both of his purse and his repute but he was the beau ideal of the abolitionists of the respectable of the dour hannah more rev wilberforce and all of their grim adherents and he could not risk running into any more of them in mother batsons parlour saint alan the liberator he would have to see tess just one more time he realised with what the french would call tristesse a sweetsad sorrow flooding him there really was no future in it even were he as rich as the fabled walpoles sadly he also realised that if he could afford for her to be his longtime kept mistress hed tire of her someday too and abandon her to her uncertain fate better he spoke of lord peter to her and hope that tess struck him the right way after all he did try to plant the seed of the idea in peters mind of buying her out and setting her up under his protection that would be best in the long run and go back to living the life of a salty tarsplotched nautical monk chapter twentytwo good morning captain lewrie the day porter greeted him as he entered the club the next morning giving him a chary cuttyeyed look as he took his things to hang up breakfast will be served the top of the hour sir theres to be pork chops and smoked mullet fresh up from sheerness umph was lewries sleepy comment thankee coffee or tea in the common room sir the porter advised to a man who looked badly in need of either morning all lewrie nodded to his fellow lodgers gathered by the table of pots cups and saucers mister giles major baird mister pilkington showalter pilkington was the clubs cassandra sure that trade would end and the economy go smash due to this baltic business showalter was still angling for a seat in commons next byelection on his home hustings and courting monied supporters like a streetwalker mr giles was hellishdevout and big in the leathergoods trade and tanneries whilst major baird their chickennabob come back from india with a fortune of at least ј was still searching for a suitably proper wife or oral sex in the loge boxes at the theatres yet all eyed him as charily as they would a naked drunk at the altar of the local parish church know too damned much about my business lewrie thought with a wince and a sigh and where i was damn em there were some askance glances some whispers and mutterings making lewrie wonder were his breeches buttons done up proper or was a used cundum dangling from a coat pocket frankly it had been a damned sad night tess had noticed his moodiness and tetchiness and had tried to jolly him out of ittil shed learned the reason for his detachment shed sat up in bed a quilt and the coverlet wrapped round her and her arms about her knees with a pensive look on her pretty face yell not come tme no longer alan me dear shed said with a hitch in her voice and a swipe at her eyes with a fist sure am i too expensive is that it no tess its not the money though im not a rich man not really hed tried to explain practically curled up around her with all the pillows under his shoulders and head that darkhaired girl ye were with then dye wish ya were with her the more not if i wish tlive hed said with a wry laugh explaining eudoxia durschenko and her fierce father theres no one else i wish tbe with ye know im married no matter how badly that has turned out she and itis distant now might improve dear man tis rare the single man who comes here tess said with a wry look and a toss of her hair a stab at a smile before she turned pensive again i know how men are how well i know and how the world is i just hoped she broke off and lowered her head to her knees shielding her face with the spill of her hair that i could take you under my protection lewrie softly asked reaching out to stroke her head in answer she looked up for a second and jerkily nodded yes before burying her face again theres a fellow though lewrie had posed the slim man with me in the coffeehouse peter rushton lord draywick hes rich as croesus and he asked about you i dont know lewrie sighed and shrugged lamely really rich mad tfind where you were devil take me but i told him hes very amusing he aint you shed whispered her urge to cry out muffled and a bit sniffly as if she wept but he could get you out of here tess with grand lodgings of your own but the one fool tdeal with not lewrie told her hmph was her comment on that did i have it in my power was i free tdo so id get you out of here he swore and not just thave you to myself ye really care that much about me shed asked lifting her head brushing back her hair and swiping her eyes free of tears once again aye i do wish someone would sure tis not the life they promised back in belfast some procurer lewrie had asked i got in a speck o trouble tess said sitting upright and smoothing the coverlet over her thighs we werent shantypoor like most in ireland but poor enough for all th children tknow they must make their own way soon as they could another wry smile or a rueful quick twist of her mouth that could pass for one mum an da was just scrapin by an without th rest of us workin and sendin em sixpence th month theyd haveta sell their loom an go

so well how old were you then lewrie had asked dreading her answer fifteen tess said with a slight sniff and a shrug before i was workin th looms with mum an da but where wed get enough to eat all of us tgither was th problem so i had tgo out on me own like th poor pig farmerd say when th corn runs short root hog or die dye see she said with a mirthless little laugh how long ago was that he had his fingers crossed two year ago tess told him th feller promised more pay an he come through with a bit of it an he wasnt that bad a man twas his son was th real devil him an his friend brought in tmanage who took advantage of th fetchin girls in th shop an when his father lost intrest in me for a newcome that was when it got bad on me an i schemed tgit outta there thats when i got in th trouble so shes seventeen round the age when a lot of poorer girls get married lewrie thought with a sense of relief he put an arm out to her and she gratefully slid into his embrace cuddled up next to him what sort of trouble he asked what sorta trouble ya think a girl gets into with two randy lads takin turns with her bout evry night tess scoffed sounding bitter and a bit amazed by his seeming naпvetй i caught a baby an was gonna be turned out with nothin but me wages paid til the end of the week so i dipped into th cashbox an i run tbelfast where i didnt think theyd find me the babe lewrie pressed stroking her back no oned hire a pregnant girl an th parish churches were no help either tess continued ignoring his question just wanted me tmove along tth nextun so i wouldnt be a burden on

theres what she spent on me all the dresses an such tget me started hairdressers an makeup an teachin me tspeak right an be charmin tess had said with a grin as if it was the accepted way of the world dont rightly know how much she paid him but she says ive worked it off an only have her now trepay ive even laid a little by for meself shed naпvely boasted an sent a little tmum an da like before and sent them bastards at th laceworks all o what i stole so they cant have me took up can they mean tsay ive made rec recompense twas more than ten shillins an they hang people who steal that much in th main im doin alright tess had decided for now buttis a hard life lewrie had commiserated nary so bad as most tess had said with a little chuckle as shed snuggled closer to him did i come tlondon just another poor girl ida ended a maidr tavern girl not makin ten pound a year an maybe gettin room board an one gown an pair o shoes at boxin day an still be took advantage of for nothin a shillin at

as i please maybe get a place o me own without dependin on a feller like yer lord draywick nor any man and do what lewrie had asked her why th same as i do now tess had declared looking up at him

anythin find me a decent feller a clerk or a farmer an might even marry someplace where no onell know what i did before so even though you dont like the life and do want to get out of here youll stay with it lewrie further asked confused by her initial sadness then her blunt acceptance what else is a poor lass tdo captain alan tess had countered its not that hard a life though its a hard world shed said in conclusion then had groped under the covers to stroke his nudity well if i cant convince ye ttake me under yer protection theres th rest o th night left us if youre intrested o course shed coyly whispered do i not see ya again id wish a last grand night tremember ya by ya darlin impressive man oh darlin yere own self lewrie had responded passion rekindled in an eyeblink hands caressing lips kissing from her neck to seen the papers captain lewrie exmajor baird enquired as he sidled up to get a refill of hot tea thought they might be of interest to you uhm lewrie replied snatched from his sad reverie the dockyards the navy dockyard workers baird chortled they had the nerve to send a delegation to town demanding their pay be doubled and lord saint vincent sacked the lot of them yesterday well damn my eyes lewrie exclaimed rather a bit too loudly for the respectable waiting for breakfast he said something like that would be his reaction good for old jarvy sent out orders for anyone who contributed to their trip and anyone who joined in what he termed illegal combinations to be sacked as well the gall of the greedy to threaten to walk out just as our navy is faced with another threat well they got what they deserved hear hear lewrie heartily agreed ahem gentlemen the head butler intoned at the doors to the dining room breakfast is served you spoke with lord saint vincent exmajor baird enquired as they queued up to file in and take seats a few days ago looking for a ship lewrie told him taking a bit of joy to be known among the powerful i was at the battle back in followed nelson when he countered the spanish van and met admiral jervis after at least he remembered me but nought was promised well see ah mullet kippers he was famished for he and tess had fallen asleep just a bit after midnight and had not sent down for their usual cold collation a pork chop a couple of kippers two slices of fatty and crisp bacon with two fried eggs and a heap of fried diced potatoes and even the brown bread was cut two fingers thick and nicely crunchily toasted wanting only slavers of butter and currant jam didnt even linger for coffee or tea when i left lewrie thought with a guilty wince at his cowardice all that had needed to be said had been said had he found a way to slip out before she woke he just might have but excuse me sirs uhm captain lewrie the day porter said in a soft voice leaning close to his chair youve a letter from admiralty captain lewrie and theres a messenger awaiting your reply ho ly shit lewrie thought with a start and a sudden flood of warmth and just thankee jesus you gentlemen will excuse me lewrie said tossing aside his napkin and sliding his chair back frankly it felt rather good for the other lodgers to goggle at him and speculate in muted whispers as he stepped out into the central hall and broke the wax seal upon the creamy bond paper and read it sir you are required and directed to report to admiralty as soon as possible following receipt of this letter here to declare your immediate availabilty to take upon yourself the charge and command of his majestys frigate thermopylae now lying at great yarmouth a brief written response pursuant to your acceptance of this posting returned to us by admiralty messenger should precede you i am sir sir evan nepean st secty to admiralty youre bloodydamned right i will lewrie whooped with glee practically bounding for the front desk and the spare pen and ink a quick scribbled yes and a glance towards the young messenger who stood with his hand out and lewrie was headed for the cellar stairs where he hoped liam desmond and patrick furfy were loafing there ye are my lads he cried spotting them both chummily seated near the warm cooking fireplace and griddle stoves devouring their own breakfasts with gusto furfy froze with a length of kipper in his mouth round up all my chests from the storage down here and the garret and see ive all the keys handy weve got a ship huzzah desmond shouted dye hear pat were goin back tsea and about time too ill go dress and be back in a few hours lewrie quickly told them before nightfall therell be a power o shoppin to do so you two look lively now wots er name sir furfy called to his captains back as lewrie hustled back up the cellar stairs thermopylae lewrie shouted over his shoulder a frigate wotsorta names therm whativer liam furfy asked his compatriot once captain lewrie had gone why ye great ignorant spalpeen desmond chid him as he cut two slices of bread for a last fattybacon sandwich twas a famous battle from long ago or a famous admiral o some sort o th greeks or romans iver hear th english name a ship fer anythin else get a move on pat lash up an stow me lad for sure as god made th green apples fer a good purge were off tth baltic with all o th others gonna fight th heathen roosians arrah chapter twentythree by midday the next morning lewrie and his small party were on the road eastlondon to chelmsford chelmsford to ipswich and east to the coastal road to great yarmouth where the fleet was gathering for the baltic expedition it was an expensive and long trip in a hired carriage with a carting waggon following close behind which bore all of lewries stored furnishings wine and hastily bought supplies for god knew how long a time at sea wine by the case whisky by the barricoe brandy by the gallons those damned furs which at such short notice lewrie could only purchase some used items and those reeking of badly cured hides and camphor whatever they were actually pelts of he had no idea at the moment there were dried sausages and smoked fish for the cats the requisite keg of dry beach sand he could find for their necessary box he could buy later his cratedup plate and pewter service his glasses and china the collapsible settee and chairs a teacaddy freshly filled with coned suger tea leaves along with sacks of chocolate and coffee beans the grinder the pots pans grills and utensils and all the myriad of easily forgotten things that made life at least tolerable at sea bootblack and metal polish spare uniforms and sloptrousers dress and undress rigs shirts and stockings underdrawers and neckstocks for every occasion from a howling winter gale to a presentation ball before foreign dignitaries lewrie thought hed managed to gather the important things there had also been desmonds and furfys seachests and kits to restock bills to be paid through his solicitor money drafts for daytoday voyaging expenses to be drawn the quarterly sums to be set aside for his wife caroline and his children and the farm and letters to write hed gotten fingercramp before he was done informing his father sir hugo sir malcolm shockley lord peter caroline hugh sewallis and charlotte that hed gotten a new ship and to address future letters in care of admiralty and last of all a note to eudoxia durschenko then one to tess the poor chit and still he fretted as the coach rocked and jangled and thudded into the early evening that there might be something important that hed forgotten and might be unavailable in great yarmouth shops uhm sir liam desmond spoke up at last after the boredom of watching the flat and depressing countryside of essex rolling by in the gathering twilight what sorta frigate is this thermdiddle thermopylae lewrie grunted dragging himself back from a reverie of his night with tess ah shes a fifth rate of thirtyeight guns eighteen pounders he explained repeating what little hed been told by mr nepean they took her lines off the french hebe but shes britishbuilt a little longer than the old ones one hundred fifty feet on the range of the deck so many of them coming into service theyre callin her one of the leda class ive heard that theyre good stable gun platforms and handle extemely well over a thousand tons burthen wots it mean though sir therm how ye say it furfy pressed a very long time ago the persians tried to invade greece with a millionman army and a fleet of five hundred ships lewrie replied the greeks acted like the house of commons on a bad day and couldnt agree to cooperate they were all a bunch of citystates not a real country then so the spartans under king leonidas set out to stop em he picked a narrow pass right by the sea high cliffs above and a straight drop from the road a place with a hot spring like at the resort of bath that the greeks called thermopylae which means a hot spring and there they fought for nigh on a week with the persians crammed into a narrow front no more than twenty men wide dyin by the thousands cause they couldnt drive through the spartans and their spears shields and swords the persian king xerxes lost a tenth part of his soldiers that gave time enough for the athenians to beat the persians in great seabattles that destroyed most of the persian fleet and let the greeks sort themselves out and raise their own army leonidas and the spartans saved greece kept it from turning into a mess as bad as the ottoman empire and saved the basis of our civilisation spartans now furfy enthused aint there a spartiate in the navy arready lotsa ships named for greeks an romans both i think there was even a leonidas too werent there liam think i heard th name pat desmond told his friend so sir once th spartans saved th day did they make this leonidas king over all uh no lewrie had to confess a traitor showed the persians a way round the mountains that was unguarded and took em from both ends so the spartans died to a man oh was furfys shuddery comment he looked as if he wished to cross himself or spit for protection against bad geas they died gloriously mind lewrie added famous to this day same as helen of troy hector and achilles in the iliad like horatius at the bridge and oh like horatio nelson then furfy said perking up aint it a pity pat that therell niver be frigates or ships o th line named after irish heroes an such lewries coxn said like brian boru or the battle o clontarf cuchulain or conary mцr the high king aye furfy supplied his eyes alight or places like tara conall o th victories or finn mac cooal desmond added in a wistful respectful voice lewrie who knew next to nothing of irish myths kept his mouth shut and even managed not to snicker scowl or raise a single brow though he thought the both of them were off on a pagan religious jaunt just like the irish he thought swannin off into fables pardon me more capm but is this thermopylae still fittin out desmond asked him further mean tsay if shes fresh from th gravin docks it might be weeks afore shes ready for sea no desmond shes aswim already in full commission lewrie informed him and ready in all respects but for the health of her captain hes come down with the winter agues so badly they told me that he had to write and ask for relief else his ship and his officers and men would miss out on things and he thought that a worse thing than stepping aside himself a captain joseph speaks i think he is never heard of him myself even though i imagine hes a lot senior to me and was made post years before i was have either of you no they hadnt either furfy went back to staring out his windows at the countryside whilst desmond frowned in thought lewrie was about to shut his eyes and try to nap despite the jolting of the coach when desmond spoke up in a soft voice capm sir it might be tetchy yer takin over this capm speaks mostlikes been posted a year or more an all his people would be usedta him by now heres me yer coxn replacin his an sore th fellowll be tlose his call an his position tbe certain well there is that lewrie uneasily allowed from his first ad hoc appointment to command of a converted bomb ketch in the far east to the shrike brig when old lt lilycrop had been invalided off to the alacrity the jester sloop and the frigates proteus and savage he had either commissioned them with new crews or been the first appointed to them shrike well hed already been her first lieutenant when he had supplanted lilycrop so hed been familiar with her crew but this would be the first time in his career that he would be stepping into someone elses shoes offloading one mans cabin furnishings and putting his own in place and facing an utterly strange new set of faces and names and attitudes a ships company that mostlikely had rubbed together for a year or two already and might look upon him as an interloper much like his last first officer in savage lieutenant urquhart had probably felt being appointed into a ship whose crew had turned over entire after three years as shipmates in proteus and he would be going aboard without the usual entourage that a royal navy captain should have too instead of his own cook clerk and steward his own favoured boat crew he had a mere two his coxn liam desmond and the hapless patrick furfy most captains rated at least half a dozen trustworthy people from previous commissions together sometimes as many as fifteen for admirals if one counted an extra clerk and several more snotnosed gentleman volunteers too young to qualify as midshipmen yet but could serve as cabin servants such a coterie of longtime favourites would be upsetting to the men holding small place aboard a ship already in commission anyone who did not hold proper admiralty warrant could be demoted and replaced in a twinkling and that would further foment the distrust and dread of the coming of a new captain who might prove to be as big a tyrant as pigott had been in hms hermione where theyd finally mutinied and murdered and sailed her into an enemy port better the devil ye know lewrie mused oh damn servants there was another snag lewrie had depended upon the staff of the madeira club after aspinall had quit to enter his new career as an author to replace all the skills aspinall had possessed hed need at least three men a cook a manservant and cabin steward combined and mostlike a cabin servant to aid the steward as quick as his appointment had come though there hadnt been time to interview people and hire a few not if hed had two weeks notice lewrie could only hope that within his new frigates crew from among the people captain speaks had left behind he might discover some who at least knew their left hand from their right could boil water or brew coffee set plates without breaking half of them or scribble correspondence that was actually legible and stay out of his wine and spirits locker chapter twentyfour ahem mr midshipman tillyard announced rapping on the door frame that led to the officers gunroom sirs come lt farley the second officer lazily called out officers did not stand harbour watches that was left to the midshipmen and the petty officers midshipman tillyard stepped into the frowsty warm gunroom hat under his arm and beheld his superiors at their leisure lt farley and lt fox his very good friend were at the long table down the centre of the space in their shirtsleeves a backgammon board between them with lt fox in midthrow of the dice the marine officer lt eades in full kit despite the officially sanctioned idleness was reading the sailing master mr lyle was poring over a chart as usual and the ships surgeon mr harward was playing a wagerless game of vingt et un with the purser mr pridemore beg pardons sirs but theres a sailing barge bearing down on us and theres a postcaptain aboard her mr tillyard announced i think our new captain is come at last yipes lt farley barked who has the deck sealey sir tillyard told him bloody hell thatll never do fox said with a snort rising from the game and a very promising cast of the dice to throw on his waistcoat and coat sir lt farley said rapping upon the louvred door set into the deal partition to the first officers small cabin i heard mister farley thank you the first officer replied departing his cramped private space shrugging into his own coat sarnt crick marine lt eades was calling out already out on the gundeck beyond sideparty to the starboard entryport respects to midshipman sealey and hes to summon all hands on deck mister tillyard how much time do we have the first officer ordered as they all dressed properly and began the trot up the ladderway to the quarterdeck and gangways shes still about a cable off sir tillyard replied bound direct for us but under reduced sail not trying to catch us napping then the first officer said with a firm nod perhaps our new captain is giving us time to welcome him properly aye sir tillyard hesitantly agreed the first lieutenant took a quick inventory once he was by the open entryport every yard squared to mathematical perfection every brace and halliard all the runningrigging properly coiled and hung on the pinrails or flemished down on the decks the sails were gasketed and furled as snug as sausages the guns were stowed at proper right angles to the bulwarks muzzles bowsed to the bottoms of the gunport sills their tackle and blocks taut and neatly stowed there was nothing out of place nothing to be faulted for despite that the fellow crossed the fingers of his right hand behind his leg and almost muttered a prayer another glance about and he was satisfied that they were ready in all respects boat ahoy midshipman sealey shouted overside through a brass speakingtrumpet ayeaye a bargeman in the bows of the approaching boat yelled back holding up one hand to show four fingers as well in warning that a postcaptain was aboard and in need of the requisite number of men in the sideparty to receive him the senior officer in the barge had also thrown back his boatcloak to display the gilt epaulets on his shoulders as the barge dropped her lugsail and turned to ghost parallel to the mainchains and boarding battens hms thermopylaes first officers eyes crinkled at the corners his full mouth tautening in a faint grin well damn my eyes he muttered officers presented drawn swords marines in full kit stamped and slapped brown bess muskets in salute so hard that small white puffs of pipeclay arose from crossbelts and taut musket slings the bosun mr dimmock and his mate mr pulley trilled away in long duet tune upon their silver calls as the dogs vane of the newcome officers cocked hat peeked above the lip of the entryport as he nimbly scampered up the new captain attained the deck performing a last jerk upon the tautly strung manropes a little hop for the last step before he doffed his hat in return salute his eyes roaming down the line of officers toed up to the tarry seam of a freshly holystoned deck plank and his mouth fell open in surprise arthur ballard lewrie gawped i was wondrin where youd got to welcome aboard captain lewrie sir lewries former first lieutenant into the converted bomb ketch hms alacrity in the bahamas replied performing a brief bow from the waist well just damn my eyes lewrie said with a pleased chuckle its been what twelve years now aye sir about that ballard pronounced buhlard answered in his typical sombre gravity a gravity that camoflauged a dry wit spose i should read myself in then well have some time to catch up lewrie allowed reaching into his bestdress uniform coat for his stamped and sealed commission document swords were sheathed muskets lowered hats plumped back on heads as lewrie walked to the crossdeck hammock nettings at the forrud edge of the quarterdeck to face his new crew gathered along both sailtending gangways and in the frigates waist below the boattier beams and gangways ships compny off hats lt ballard ordered by the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral of great britain and ireland and all his majestys plantations and et cetera to captain alan lewrie hereby appointed to his majestys ship thermopylae he read to them in his quarterdeck voice so that even a halfdeafened old gunner in the bows could hear him by virtue of the power and authority to us given we do hereby constitute and appoint you captain of his majestys ship thermopylae willing and requiring you forthwith to go on board and take upon you the charge and command of captain in her accordingly strictly charging all the officers and company belonging to said ship subordinate to you to behave themselves jointly and severally in their respective employments with all due respect and obedience unto you their said captain and you likewise to observe and execute such orders and directions you shall receive from time to time from your superior officers for his majestys service hereof nor you nor any one of you may fail as you will answer the contrary at your peril and for so doing this shall be your warrant given under our hands and the seal of the office of admiralty this twentythird day of february eighteen oh one in the fourty first year of his majestys reign he concluded carefully rolling up the precious document into a slim tube to stow inside his coat til he had time to store it safely away in his greatcabins lewrie looked down on the men who were now officially his crew and noted that some of them were smiling whispering back and forth behind their hands or their hats as in most ships of the royal navy there were some men from almost every nation even some from enemy states and of course there was always a sprinkling of free blacks lewrie spotted at least half a dozen and they were all beaming fit to bust the others though what theyve seen me tuppin tess he puzzled to himself some other mutton i know that the sudden change in captains can be wrenching to a crew which has gotten used to the old ones ways lewrie said on in a slightly softer voice though with a stern expression plastered on his face to appear captainly to the ships people despite wanting to grin cut capers snap his fingers and do a little hornpipe of glee to be back aboard a ship any ship i am certain captain speakss order book his postings to positions of trust and his methods were carefully thought out and crafted for the overall good of the ship and her people dont know he couldve been a ravin crank lewrie thought sotil ive gotten myself sorted out and familiar with his strictures his ways will continue in force lewrie assured them in a few weeks perhaps sooner the warships gathering here in this port the ships readying in other harbours will sail for the baltic by now thats no secret is it i fully expect that thermopylae will be in the thick of things and am determined that she and all of you will acquit yourselves in the finest traditions of our navy mister ballard he said turning to face his first officer carry on sir ships company on hats and dismiss ballard ordered lt ballard then introduced lewrie to his officers and holders of warrant allowing lewrie to make quick sketchjudgements about them lt farley the second officer was a slim fellow with curly dark blond hair and a lean face behind his grave expression he looked to be a bit of a tongueincheek wag likewise the third officer lt fox who might as well have been his partner in crime lt eades the marine was about the same age as the commission officers in his late twenties but a stiffer more sobre sort perhaps a stickler for discipline with his marines the sailing master mr lyle was in his late fourties a fellow from felixstowe just down the coast thickset and roundfaced unlike most east anglians though he seemed most affable the purser herbert pridemore was even stouter proof of the adage that all nip cheeses fed better than the crew the surgeon frederick harward seemed almost amused which was rare in the fleet and young for his posting ill request that you find me a large keg of sand sir lewrie bade the purser sand sir pridemore asked puzzled for the gun crews sir for my cats mister pridemore lewrie said with a smirk so they can relieve themselves my compliments to the ships carpenter as well mister ballard and ill have him make me a box about so he said sketching the size in midair with his hands for their necessary aye sir ballard replied with one brow cocked significantly surely old pitt can no longer be with you no hes gone to fiddlers green long ago lewrie said but toulon and chalky are still younguns the ramcat lewrie heard someone whisper in glee one of the midshipmen of course no one elsed dare lewrie was then introduced to his six mids from the eldest down to the youngest midshipman sealey was old for the rank in his early twenties and looked to lewries lights to be none too bright else he would have passed the oral exams by now there was a lad in his late teens named furlow who appeared bags sharper there was a midshipman privette about sixteen as hawknosed and darkhaired as a cornishman who looked tarryhanded there was also mr tillyard who stood out of order with the younkers who looked to be a wag then a brace of fourteenyearolds named pannabaker and plumb one could barely gawk and stammer whilst plumb doffed his hat gave a jerky waistbow and could not resist asking are your cats the reason youre called the ramcat sir in a cheeky manner thats for me tknow and for you tfind out mister plumb lewrie said with a sly grin before turning to ballard again soon as im settled in mister ballard id wish to meet the bosun and his mate the masters mates quartermasters the master gunner and all department heads might as well get the names and faces settled in my mind quick as possible very good sir ballard replied might you care to see your quarters now captain weve sent the most of captain speakss things ashore already there are some ah remaining for the nonce yes lets lewrie agreed oh mister ballard my coxn liam desmond and his friend patrick furfy from my old boat crew lads ballard said with a nod mister dimmock workparty to see the captains goods aboard ayeaye sir the marine sentry by the doors to the greatcabins presented arms and stamped boots as lewrie entered ducking under the deck beams the greatcabins might have once been nice lewrie decided there was the usual blackandwhite chequer canvas nailed to the deck and there were the pounder guns bowsed to the port sills which took up a lot of the space the lower half of the inner hull planking was painted the usual bloodred and the planking above was pale tan as were the deal partitions that would come down fold and be stacked below when the frigate cleared for action a chartspace had been constructed at the forward starboard side its fiddled shelves now bare and the tall desk with its slanted top empty to larboard lewrie could see where a sideboard a dining table and chairs had been placed much the same brighter marks or scuffs on the canvas deck covering showed where desk and chairs made the daycabin where a settee and more collapsing chairs had been grouped round a winecabinet to larboard there was a narrow hangingcot still slung in the sleepingspace handily near to the larboard quarter gallery and its necessary closet and hello you old bastard hello something squawked furfy had fetched in the wicker cage which held the cats both of whom stood on their hind legs front paws working on the wicker and their tails swishing little jaws chattered as they let out shuddery urgent trills of huntingkilling lust i meant to mention that sir lt ballard dryly pointed out captain speakss african grey parrot hes had it for years and its developed quite a vocabulary bought it at cape town when he flog the bugger flog the bugger the parrot cried once it had espied the cats was just a lieutenant in the eighties ballard continued captain speakss wife detests the bloody thing and refuses to have it at the wrestlers arms the hotel where theyre lodging for him to recover id think the hotel would agree with her lewrie commented im a saucy rascal tweep the parrot cried hello go to the devil why dont you lewrie muttered oh dont encourage it sir ballard cautioned that only makes it worse what the hell are we tdo with it then arthur lewrie asked god only knows sir the gunroom dont want it though there are the midshipmen ballard replied but the masters mates and surgeons mates who bunk with them might object strenuously captain speaks had obviously doted on the bloody bird for its cage was big enough for a frisky mastiff with many rods and ladders and even a spread of inchthick tree limbs for exercise with a ball on a twine a small mirror a bowl of seeds a water dish and a dry cuttlefish on which it could hone its beak the whole thing was made of dulled brass rods soldered together with a bright green painted canopy wont last a dog watch once my things are in and the cats are free to roam lewrie predicted removing his boatcloak and hat and looking for a row of pegs on which to hang them good god thats a franklin stove he exclaimed as he spotted the squat metal monster in the semienclosed sleepingspace weve spent the last year running the baltic convoys ballard explained and prowling the dutch and german coasts right into the heligoland bight there are french and dutch privateers working out of christiana and amsterdam captain speaks bought several of them for the gunroom and the peoples quarters on the gundeck theyve come in handy to take the chill off when we can obtain coal and that only during the day when the wind and sea allow the victualling board does not see the need to provide heat belowdecks in winter and told us that supplying coal was our own business captain speaks was thoughtful but not so rich that he could purchase enough all by himself and its been rare that the officers and hands could chip in and afford a decent store either sir meaning that i should is that it arthur lewrie asked i would not presume to speculate sir ballard replied but i admit some coal would be welcome so long as were firmly anchored the harbour and the north sea have been awfully raw this winter lewrie could agree with that if the weather had seemed to moderate in london the further east hed come closer to the sea the wind had blown colder and colder wetter and downright icy even here belowdecks and out of the wind he still felt an urge to shiver now and then well well see depending he allowed he pulled out his pocketwatch and checked the time halfpast eight in the morning to prove it one bell of the forenoon watch chimed far forward at the belfry and a glad sound that halfhour bell was to lewrie for time to be rung aboard a ship once again id expect ill be hard at it past dinner to get all my dunnage and bumf set up properly lewrie announced but i would like you to sup with me tonight arthur shall we say seven of course sir ballard responded with a solemn halfbow oh shit lewrie said ive no cook or steward or personal victuals live or not scuse me capm furfy said as several sailors entered with chests and furniture settee tstarbd same as ye like sir aye furfy thankee lewrie told him any recommendations mister ballard he asked now that others were present and the use of first names might be taken the wrong way by the hands well sir captain speaks took his manservant ashore with him to help nurse him through his illness ballard explained his wife insisted one of the cabin servants go too his cook is still aboard though a fellow named nettles hes very good used to be at an ipswich hotel before the captain discovered him and hired him away youve one cabin servant left a lad named whitsell though he isnt much only twelve after all you didnt bring the usual entourage sir id have expected to see will cony with you hes a bosun into a sixth rate now lewrie told his old compatriot married to a woman in anglesgreen he and maggie have two boys now no when i had to give up command of savage i could only take away three or four people and one finally went back aboard her and tother my prime man had family need of discharge since then i lodged at a gentlemens club where i had no need to hire anyone on and quick as a wink orders came to report aboard instanter aye i heard sir ballard said with a veiled look as if he disapproved but would not say so about lewries recent contretemps i do have a suggestion sir if i may he added tilting his head to the chartspace where there was more privacy once there and with the first load of furnishings delivered and the workparty departing for a second load ballard continued theres a young fellow whos been aboard about a year sir whos more suited to steward duties than ever he would be as a sailor last up the shrouds last down and damn all useless aloft too puny for pulleyhauley as well the bosun and mastcaptains guncaptains all despair of him hes named pettus a pressed man no matter he was never a seaman how well i know that fraud lewrie said with a wry sigh indeed sir he claims he was a manservant to a bishops residence at brighton before he was rounded up ballard said do you wish to see him sir round seven bells aye lewrie decided i should have enough of my cabins set up by then beggars cant be choosers i spose ye have things tsee to arthur then ill not keep you if you do very well sir ballard replied delivering another grave halfbow and departing hello you old bastard the parrot squawked bobbing its head stop yer gob ye bloody pigeon lewrie snapped give me the punch ladle ill fathom the bowl the bird responded singing the old drinking tune right on key roast parrot on a bed of rice lewrie shot back damn my eyes damn my eyes the bird singsonged ill sic the cats on you if you dont shut up lewrie warned im a good parrot i am tweep christ on a crutch lewrie muttered but youre a nuisance bloody nuisance the parrot uttered making lewrie whirl about to gawp in wonder how smart was the damned thing he wondered and whatll he blab next if i say anything unguarded in here chapter twentyfive landsman pettus tsee th captain sah the marine sentry cried banging the brassbound butt of his musket on the deck enter lewrie commanded looking up from his desk where he and captain speakss former clerk a former solicitors clerk with the unfortunately chosen name of george georges were going over the ships myriad of forms and accounts to assure that lewrie was not accepting responsibility for a pig in a poke in came a young fellow in his early twenties tall enough to have to duck under the overhead deck beams barely it was more a hunchedshoulder diffidence or wariness lewrie thought noting how the fellow appeared on the lookout for a cuff or a touchup from the bosuns starter you wished to see me captain sir pettus said looking fearful of committing some wrong without knowing thatll be all for a little while georges lewrie told his new clerk get some air on the gangway til i send for you again aye sir flog the bugger the parrot squawked trice him up i do not have a steward pettus lewrie said rising from the desk in the daycabin i came away at short notice and your former captains man is ashore with him and im loath to call him back aboard as long as captain speaks is so ill and in need of him mister ballard suggested your name aye sir pettus said with a note of hope to his voice hed made an attempt to be as presentable as he would be at sunday divisions his face was shaved his thick thatch of light brown hair was combed and his sloptrousers were mostly free of slush and tar smuts he wore a chequered blue shirt a printed red calico neckerchief and a short sailors taped jacket that was a bit too short in the sleeves and with some brass buttons replaced with plain black horn ones his flat tarred hat was in his hands before his waist being turned round about in involuntary nervousness pettus looked lean and spry enough to make a topman yet youve served a gentleman before im told lewrie asked i have sir aye pettus eagerly replied breaking out in an open grin in brighton sir i was a footman to the dioceses bishop him and his family not his personal man sir but i was with them for six years since i was fourteen and first got my position i did for his younger son for a year or so as well as waiting attable there was a lot of entertaining sir so i know my way about it was a grand place sir wardrobe laundry keep track of plates and utensils and all that there were others who did that sir pettus admitted seeming as if his hopes were suddenly dashed then quickly spoke up once more i did keep the sons wardrobe sir so hed always have clean linen and pressed stocks that everything was fresh and presentable from the laundry maid blacked and buffed shoes polished silver and such for all the suppers too and helped the scullery maids with the dishes sir before and after read and write lewrie asked sitting on the edge of his desk yes sir pettus said i mean aye sir my dad taught at a local school til he died and i had to find a position higher mathematics i never mastered but i can keep a running account book as good as anything ive a little latin a dab of french sir why did you lose your position then pettus lewrie queried and how the devil did the press get you well uhm sir pettus deflated going all cuttyeyed as a bag of nails twas a proper house the bishops manse sir run on very moral lines as i expect you can imagine even did the son that i did for have a secret wild streak most vicars sons do as i remember lewrie said thinking of several boys from church families at his several public schools wild was a mild word for em he thought with a private grin and god bless a vicars daughter too he was mad for drink sir and someone had to go along to keep an eye on him keep him out of trouble when he got cupshot pettus explained the tarred hat going round and round more agitatedly and then there was a new maidofallwork that was hired on one summer for the season i was well she was pretty as a bunch of flowers sir and she and i struck up a liking a strong liking just sixteen she was sir and id a mind that did i put enough aside after a few years the both of us might marry sir but oh dear lewrie thought you poor deluded young bastard well sir she and i went a bit ahead of ourselves on our days off pettus mournfully related if you get my meaning sir we ah found some private places a good walk from town or the glebe and ah made love sir like we were already married the son found out about us saw us when he went riding near where we and the next time i had to go along to guard his drinking bouts he japed me something awful about her and it didnt stop outside the house sir he started abusing me at home too making the worst slurs against nan the girl sir til i couldnt take it any more one last insult the middle of the day at table before his family and i i dumped the soup tureen on him sir pettus confessed in a meek voice shrugging and looking down at his shoes creamy pea soup enough for twelve he added with a rueful laugh im a saucy rascal the parrot commented well thats one way tmake an exit lewrie said picturing that scene with some relish it would have been the sort of thing he would have done the only problem though sir was that he blabbed all about the girl too and got us both sacked pettus said returning to his misery bishops wife said she wouldnt stand for fornication in her house and swore no respectable place would have either of us not if we depended on her for a recommendation nan she had to leave the parish and try her luck in chichester and i havent gotten one word from her since and the impress service lewrie asked i had a little money laid by so i could take cheap lodgings whilst i looked for new work sir pettus said i do think i got it in my head to go looking for mister edw the son sir and give him a proper thrashing for what hed done but i was never much of a man for drink sir but i knew taverns and public houses would be where i could find him and i got as drunk as a lord by the time id made all the rounds sir it was a warm night so id taken off my coat and hat somewhere and on the way to one of the really low taverns i ran into the press party and in trousers and waistcoat with no neckstock either they took my garb for short clothing cried that i was a sailor and jumped me woke up in the press tender on the way to portsmouth into the receiving ship and then aboard thermopylae sir just damned bad luck all round pettus lewrie decided aloud do you still drink steal never stole anything in my life sir pettus declared almost angrily at the suggestion as for drink well he simmered down after being pressed the rum issue is welcome tis all i can do to choke it down sir and give sippers and gulpers to the other lads most of the time that way they dont bully me quite so badly i admit it makes life aboard ship more bearable sir but im not a sot your spirits would be safe with me if thats what youre wondering you understand that serving me here in the cabins you would hear things discussed that should not be blabbed to the other sailors lewrie went on mums the word about where were going what the officers and i talk about mums the word sir aye pettus solemnly assured him my last man i allowed to berth in his pantry yonder lewrie said pointing his chin towards the dogsbox of a stores cabin that he had had the carpenter mr lumsden erect from spare partitions in addition to the captains store room below on the orlop and the lazarette stowage beneath the padded transom settee right aft you would be responsible for the safekeeping of all my goods strictly under lock and key til i need something feel like striking as my steward and man pettus i would sir pettus exclaimed all but wagging his tail like a puppy in eagerness youll see sir i wont let you down youll have to tolerate the cats lewrie said with a smile as he decided to give pettus a try toulon there hes the blackandwhiteun chalkys the other and er captain speakss parrot too sir pettus asked bloody nuisance the bird chose to squawk i may be fattenin him up for supper lewrie said scowling in the birds direction shift your dunnage once youve eat and as soon as you do my coxn desmond will show you where my coffee beans and grinder are and the pot uhm sir pettus shyly said none of my business sir but mister perry captain speakss coxn ah ill deal with that but thankee for mentioning it to me he said close to the captain is he pettus been with him as long as the parrot i heard tell sir pettus replied maybe he could take the beast lewrie said with a snort or wish tgo ashore to tend to captain speaks thatll be all for now pettus report back by two bells of the next watch ayeaye sir well thats one problem solved lewrie thought congratulating himself and considering sending to the galley for a plate of whatever the crew would be eating as for perry keelhaul the bastard the bird screeched thawheep chapter twentysix til we strike soundings in the channel of old england from ushant to scilly is twenty five leagues thawheep the parrot sang within his clothcovered cage right aftas far from the diningcoach as he could be placed bloody lewrie muttered under his breath let me out for gods sake awrk you must admit sir hes quite the remarkable vocabulary for a dumb beast lt ballard commented with a wry smirk one might conjure that its intelligent or that the hindoo concept of reincarnation is valid that an old soul came back as a bird tbe dredged in flour and panfried does he keep that up lewrie threatened turning his head to scowl at the cage toulon and chalky were seated below the cage watching it sway gently chittering and working their paws on the deck their tails jerking turning back to lt ballard he asked are you sure captain speakss wife is deadset against having it ashore adamantly sir ballard said with a grave expression and a pursing of his full lips well im just as adamant that the bloody bird goes lewrie grumbled as he cut himself a bite of ham cold as it will be where were going itd be a wonder does the damned thing not freeze tdeath i spose the coalburning stoves were captain speakss way of keeping it tropicwarm the cage was hung quite close to a stove aye sir lt ballard replied as he delicately lifted a forkful of mashed potatoes and green peas to his mouth it is a wonder indeed that the bird has not succumbed to the cold and damp already or the loss of its master gravely ill is speaks lewrie asked motioning for the cabin boy a snotnosed twelveyearold named whitsell to refill the glasses mister harward the surgeon said it was pneumonia in both his lungs sir quite grave aggravated by captain speakss recurring bouts of malaria contracted long ago in the east indies and african waters ballard informed him taking a small sip of his fresh glass of wine he has hopes a shore physician may bring him through though which will take a long time for recovery lewrie speculated aloud assured that his posting would not be temporary speaks would not be popping up like a jackinabox to reclaim his command anytime soon and pray god he does recover he added hoping he didnt sound too impious for now though much like old times hey arthur of course sir ballard replied his old first officer into alacrity tween the wars had changed very little arthur ballard was a squarebuilt fellow about an inch shorter than lewries five feet nine as fit and strong as a pugilist his face was square with a broad but regular nose ending in a pronounced chin cleft his hair was still as dark and wiry as lewrie remembered still cut close to his head which had become the fashion of late his brows were heavy and dark as well shading intelligent eyes of dark brown hue well perhaps the frown lines either side of his mouth were deeper and the crinkles round his eyes were more pronounced and perhaps he had filled out and gained a little more weight than he had in the s in the bahamas but he was the same watchful sobre and contained fellow he always had been it was only his mouth that betrayed another nature for his lips were full and almost sensual the bottom lip slightly protruding whenever his face was in repose ballard had joined the navy as a cabin servant at age nine and had risen to third officer of a frigate in before shed paid off and hed come aboard alacrity as her second and only commission sea officer what hed done since when alacrity had paid off lewrie would discover mostly over suppers such as this one they had written a few times to each other then civilian matters had taken precedence and they had lost contact shortly after the outbreak of the war of the first coalition in february of still a touch shabby lewrie noted of ballards uniform as he always was lived on his navy pay with no extras from his family as i recall for even if an invitation to dine with the new captain was a formal affair no matter their long acquaintance arthur ballards bestdress coat was a bit worn the gilt lace going dull and his shirt a bit dingy perry lewrie said after a bite of bread roll and a sip from his wine glass i expect he feels lost without captain speaks aboard and to lose his place as coxn to my man desmond might he be able to strike for quartermasters mate or some other post arthur the poor fellow is mostly unlettered sir ballard said with a sad shake of his head and lacks the mathematical skills required he can barely add or subtract consistently best he goes ashore then to tend to his captain lewrie decided unless speakss wife objects to him too i believe both captain speaks and his wife regard coxn perry as a good work to perform sir ballard replied with a sly grin on his face much as a parish church employs the village dullard as their christian duty hes faithful and utterly loyal to them so sending perry ashore would be best sir hes a capital seaman but weve more than enough of those aboard already and he takes the parrot with him lewrie added why i do believe that perry is immensely fond of the parrot as fond as he is of captain speaks ballard rejoined bestowing a brief seated bow and nod for lewries decision ill tell him hes free to go before the forenoon watch begins tomorrow if that will be suitable for you sir damned right itll be lewrie said casting a wary glance over his shoulder towards the cage stocky blackandwhite toulon was still seated mouth agape in anticipation of a bite of parrot but the spryer chalky had just completed a flippingover leap of some prodigious height that had jostled the cage enough to quiet the bird come lads ham for supper you can eat the bird later old william pitt ballard said in reverie of lewries original pet a very surly and standoffish yellow ramcat inherited from hms shrike i would have thought mean as he was that hed have put you right off all cats sir they grow on you lewrie fondly said as the cats trotted over the table and leaped atop it and theyre wonderful and amusing companions thankfully these two scamps are scads more affectionate than old pitt too just what a captain needs to relieve the loneliness of command right catlins he said ruffling their fur and stroking them bowtostern as pettus set out two saucers heaped with tiny bits of ham and peas and shredded rolls in gravy odd lewrie idly thought as the cats seemed wary of eating too close to ballard though theyd usually make pests of themselves with any table guest with those who disliked cats the most of all he had to tempt them to settle onto their haunches and dig into their tucker lewrie looked over at ballard who was craning his neck over his shoulder peering at the forward bulkhead above the sideboard for a moment i know its not the done thing arthur but lets say this is more a working supper lewrie suggested returning to his victuals we may be at sea within the week and id like you to discover all ye may tme about thermopylae and her people of course sir ballard said with another bow of his head and a dab at his lips with his napkin all told weve been in commission for about a year and a half do you see the second and third lieutenants farley and fox were as thick as thieves having served together as midshipmen long before and were immensely competent though both were possessed of a merry prankster streak the sailing master mr lyle quite unlike most of his post was also a cheerful soul though quite exacting when on duty surgeon harward was a bachelor in his midthirties a bookish fellow intrigued by natural philosophy and science who kept pretty much to himself even in the officers mess his surgeons mates fortnum and potter were betterskilled and more conscientous than the runofthemill cunnythumbed surgeons mates one usually encountered due to harwards demanding standards and their continual tutelage under his watchful eyes their purser herbert pridemore seemed more honest than the usual nip cheese a married man with three children to support though so it was early days as to just how honest his measures and books were the marine officer lt james eades was a bit of a martinet a strict disciplinarian though most thought him firm but fair young for his rank he was only twentytwo eades was simmeringhot for glory combat and honour almost as bad as an army officer and how hed gotten his place without the benefits of a welltodo family was still a mystery eades didnt have the innate gentlemanly manners of the class of fellows who attained commissioned rank he could when irate curse like a bosun and was rather loud and prone to drink in the gunroom the midshipmen sealey was the oldest at twentyone but he had failed his first oral examination for his lieutenancy though he was good at his job furlow was eighteen and very clever and sharp privette the next youngest at sixteen was just as competent but a very dull sort oh there was tillyard who was nineteen and he was lt ballard tossed off as if it was no matter or should not be distant kin to him but was shaping well as an officertobe i will not lavish him with undue praise to gain him favour with you sir merely announce that we are catercousins ballard stiffly admitted the youngest lads mr pannabaker and mr plumb were fourteen and as was to be expected had their good days and their bad days as petty officers given their youth and middling amount of experience both could be slyly cheeky and pranskterish though not of late they are both captain speakss nephews sir ballard related hes three sisters all with large families and second sons in need of careers normally theyre lively and impish younkers but without their uncle aboard do you see they are quite downcast cossetted were they lewrie asked a bit i must admit sir ballard gravely said good lads in the main and the hands like them and obey them chearly ballard pointed out they are no shrinking violets or fools with a firm rein on their sillier moments and a sharp eye on their performance of their duties they both show great promise as for those who held admiralty warrant both the bosun mr dimmock and the bosuns mate mr pulley were tough older tarpaulin men and nothing escaped their attention the master gunner mr tunstall the gunners mate mr shallcross and the yeoman of the powder bohanon were equally capable and that went for the carpenter mr lumsden the quartermasters and their mates the cooper the armourer and the sailmaker mr cable and his mate durham to boot the captains of the masts the quartergunners almost everyone aboard ballard could find no real fault with oh among the able seamen the ordinary seamen and landsmen there were the usual drunks the unwillingly pressed men and scrapings from the county assizes courts and gaols due to the quota acts which swept up the dregs that the army had not gotten to first but all told thermopylae was crewed by as competent a ships complement as one could expect in wartime growl they sometimes might but go they would and if wellled theyd do their duty and more ive only had time to flip through the punishment book lewrie admitted as they sat and savoured hot coffee and brandy on the settee and chairs once the table had been cleared i didnt see all that many defaulters names nor did i note that many lashes awarded was captain speaks a tartar or merely firm but fair arthur the captain was uhm firm but fair i would adjudge him sir ballard cautiously stated for the navy frowned on criticising senior officers even ashore and in strictest privacy among juniors he cared deeply for the welfare of the ships people and was quite popular with them though he in no wise ever cossetted or played a popularity dick he was is a consummate sailorman strict when necessary yet a rather easygoing fellow most of the time ballard further explained sounding almost prim in his choice of words they recognised his care for them sir and responded with dare i say it outright affection ouch lewrie barked with a small laugh ive always thought of myself as an easygoing sort too but damme these are going to be a tight pair o shoes tfill well perhaps as we rub together the hands and i well sort it out right toulon after supper and a brief romp with a couple of bottle corks the cats had come to the settee where lewrie sat halfsprawled with a leg up on the cushions toulon to snuggle against his chest and the other to drape himself across his thigh except for a brief sniff at his bootshod legs with their ears flat both toulon and chalky had quite ignored arthur ballard which was quite unlike their gregarious and curious natures which again struck lewrie as odd he was as good a fellow as anyknolles of the jester langlie of both hms proteus and savageand the arrival of supper guests from a first officer to midshipmen to a marine messenger passing the word from a watch officer was cause for glad familiar greetings and well be ready for sea when dye reckon arthur lewrie lazily enquired stifling a yawn it had been a long and busy day and his newbuilt bedcot hanging aft his usual wideenoughfortwo was calling pettus had filled some tin cylinders with boilinghot water in lieu of emberfilled warming pans and had even spread one of those furs atop the coverlet so his bed would be toastywarm all but lastminute stores are aboard now sir ballard said head cocked over as he calculated once admiral sir hyde parker issues sailing orders i expect a full day for livestock gunroom delicacies and such to be fetched off perhaps the coal as well sir after that thermopylae would be ready to sail in all respects good lewrie said with a nod the admiral is already here in great yarmouth amp nelson lewrie asked faintly scowling his flagship has not yet come round from plymouth sir though he is expected daily ballard further informed him damme times wasting lewrie grumbled the ice in the foes harbours could be melting as quick as our last snow is there anyone senior to talk to there is captain riou sir ballard said he is the senior frigate captain present and is expected to be named commodore over all the fifth and sixth rates in the expedition hes in the amazon the fellow who sailed guardian back to cape town after hitting the iceberg lewrie said in some surprise the very one sir ballard agreed in his usual grave way that had been a tale in guardian a partially disarmed old gun frigate on her way to new south wales with convicts seeds and ј of stores aboard had struck an iceberg in the fog east of cape town and had come near to sinking despairing that shed go down despite everyone sailor or convict manning the pumps round the clock riou had sent off all five ships boats to try to make it back to cape town miles off one boat had foundered in heavy seas drowning all aboard but the other four had managed to row away one boat had been rescued by a french merchantman the others had vanished without a trace then weeks later riou with less than thirty brave men still aboard to plug fother patches and pump incessantly sailed guardian into port saving ship stores seeds and lives i look forward to meetin him then lewrie said allowing a yawn at last ill have another peek at the old order book whilst i eat breakfast and will let you know if theres anything i wish changed arthur other than that it sounds as if ive landed aboard a fine ship with a fine crew you have sir ballard said with a touch of pride and the very fellow id request for my first lewrie added lifting his cup of brandylaced coffee in salute and smiling widely i will endeavour to please sir as i did once before well its lacking one bell to lights out and the master at arms mister mackie is a humourless stickler would there be anything else sir if not i will take my leave and let you get a good nights sleep none i can think of arthur lewrie said rising do let me know the price of coal hereabouts and just how often the stoves could be used on your previous winter cruises ill consider it good night then sir ballard said with a departing bow good night to you as well mister ballard lewrie replied in kind perhaps our last sound sleep before things get exciting hey indeed sir ballard said he turned and walked forward to the door glancing once more at the diningcoach partition will you be needing anything else sir his new man pettus asked as he gathered up the last cups saucers spoons and glasses from the starboardside seating area no more tonight pettus lewrie told him yawning again i think you and whitsell can doss down for the night oh the cook nettles aye sir relay to him my thanks for a handsome supper lewrie said i quite enjoyed it is that his customary talent i expect ill dine as well as i would at a fine hotel hes probably in the galley with the ships cook sauder sir pettus said with a shy grin keeping warm and nattering over a glass of rum sir i mean to say uhm not that hes a drunkard exactly sir but pettus stammered thinking hed blabbed too much hes accommodated himself to life aboard a warship lewrie said with a chuckle warrants and petty officers will always have a flask stowed away and will take an unregulated nip now and then its no matter long as he can cook so well ill turn in you and whitsell finish up and turn in yourselves i can undress myself still savouring the last lingering tastes of ham potatoes and peas fresh butter and succulent white bread rolls a spicy vegetable and bean soup a fish course of smoked mullet and a cherry jumble he went aft to his washhand stand scrubbed his teeth with powder pumice and a stiffbristled brush rinsed and began to undress quickly for the temperature was dropping and a cabin aboard a ship at anchor was an icebox a damp icebox lewrie usually slept nude in better climes but was thankful to note that pettus had dug out a long flannel nightshirt for him and had hung it on a row of pegs near the bedcot he kept his kneehigh cotton stockings on too as he hefted himself over the railing of the bedbox and under the covers where he found several patches of heat left by the tin warmers up to his chin went the blankets a thick quilt his wife had made him long before the heavy painted coverlet and that fur rug which reeked equally of camphor and was it bear musk north american bison no matter for toulon and chalky were entranced by the scent and padded all over it sniffing and pawing pausing to glare at him with their jaws halfopen and their eyes slit in exotic pleasure do not pee on it hear me lewrie cautioned them mrr toulon said in ectasy mrrf chalky added sneezing good night sir pettus softly said from beyond the partition to the bedspace as he snuffed the last candles night lewrie replied good night ladies good night ladies good night ladies were going tleave you now the parrot contibuted oh do shut the bloody hell up lewrie snapped wheehoo the bird whistled back good night awrk thankfully after that last utterance the parrot quieted down with only a few mutters and wingflutters and after a few more long minutes of snuffling and exploration toulon and chalky settled down as well curled up together in a wad behind his knees silently grooming each other by the feel of it through the thick covers in darkness and curled up in the fetal position to hug the last of the heat from the warming tins and his own body lewrie could not quite go to sleep til he had puzzled out arthur ballards odd behaviour not one time had he presumed upon their old friendship to call him alan but sir even in private oh back then in alacrity lewrie and he were within six months of the same age about six months as to the dates of their lieutenancies and both of the same rank with dame fortune tipping lewrie the nod to command the saucy little converted bombketch a small vessel with a small crew and they the only commission officers aboard her he didnt mention the trial not once lewrie realised with a start didnt ask anything personal either damme does he disapprove o me doins the scandal lewrie let out a little snort as he considered that ballard might read london papers and could have put two and two together about him and theoni too no matter how salaciously veiled mrs denbys article was christ lewrie thought stiffening as he recalled how hed caught ballard looking about for the portrait of caroline that usually was hung on the diningcoach partition or the forrud bulkhead over the sideboard arthurd always been fond of her and they got along like a house afire the few times we were ashore in the bahamas he remembered as grave and dignified as ballard carried himself so much care he took with his every utterance it was only the rare shore suppers in a chophouse or at their rented cottage out by east bay when ballard had ever let his guard down and had japed and laughed like a normal fellow only then did he unbend and smile a lot and the cats odd reaction to him god above even that frog agent that fellow brasseur or whatever hed called himself who had come aboard savage during the close blockade of the gironde pretending to be a simple local fisherman and had lied about the shore defences like a french newspaper lied like a bulletin from paris was the french expression why toulon and chalky had been mad for him when he came aft for a glass of rum and lewries gold o course he was covered in scales and reeked o fish lewrie told himself yet even so tis rare they run into a man they shun now why is that as if to answer his quandary toulon and chalky shifted a bit both uttering wee sleepwhimpers as they pressed closer to each other and him arthur dont like me for some reason lewrie thought almost with an audible grunt cant be professional can it no not him so it must be personal oh hell do his duty right enough but i doubt his hearts quite in it this time round im his new captain not his oldun so maybe thats a wrench for him same as for speakss nephews or his coxn or his bloody parrot lewrie punched his pillows into a deeper pile and dragged a few last inches of covers and fur half over his head leaving just enough of a gap so he could breathe and tried willing himself to a peaceful rest puzzle it out in the morning he thought chapter twentyseven delighted to welcome you aboard captain lewrie capt edward riou said with what sounded like genuine enthusiasm once lewrie had taken the salute of hms amazons sideparty doubly welcome is your thermopylae of equal weight of metal to amazon you will take coffee or tea sir for tis an unbearably chilly morning thatd be toppin fine captain riou thankee kindly lewrie replied shivering under his heavy wool boatcloak edward riou was a very pleasant gentleman though by the way he carried himself so urgently with every gesture and movement of his hands spare but efficient lewrie could quickly assume that riou was a most active and hardcharging fellow once below in the greatcabins and free of hats and cloaks riou appeared strong yet spare with wavy hair thick upon his pate and curling over his ears and neck an intelligent high brow thicker darker eyebrows and large expressive eyes his face was a long oval split by a very long nose a thoughtful sort of pose to his mouth and a determined chin he was scads senior to lewrie but showed him every sign of the nicest sort of condescension theres a comfortable chair sir riou offered do take a seat and well see you warmed up in a trice youve replaced captain speaks i take it riou said playing the perfect pleasant host i have sir poor fellow lewrie told him riou sat down in a chair opposite and his cabin steward was there with a tray bearing a coinsilver coffee pot sugar creamer and meissen china cups and saucers cannot stand tepid coffee myself so have a care captain lewrie my own preference indeed sir lewrie replied grinning as he felt the heat through the cup aah splendid brew he added after his first tentative sip nigh to boiling too i do apologise if i interfere with your preparations for sea sir but with neither of our admirals present yet i thought it prudent to speak with the mostsenior officer in port well there is rearadmiral graves reputed to be on his way to us but for the nonce i suppose ill have to do riou said with an easy grin with the fleet divided into the usual three divisions van main body and rear i hear hes to be third in command after sir hyde and nelson pending the arrival of someone else mind its all still a bit up in the air sir hyde is not present im told sir lewrie asked oh he is but he has not yet gone aboard ardent where hes hoisted his flag temporarily capt riou said with a disappointed twitch of his mouth the rumour is that hes to have the london when she gets here and will not go aboard ardent only to have to shift all his dunnage later he ah has taken lodgings ashore at the hotel the wrestlers arms riou added with a faint frown oh lewrie said with gawp of surprise id thought things were already afoot all but ready to sail sir time of the essence all that ice melting one would think riou agreed his frown a touch deeper than before and rolling his delicate cup tween both hands for warmth it is a quickly gathered expedition though robbing peter to pay paul as it were taking vessels from channel fleet recalling others from the french blockade and juggling ships and officers like a circus act such things take time he said sounding as if he was putting the best face he could on what seemed a serious lack of urgency pray god sir not too much time lewrie said we should be at em but then people have accused me before of bein too rash a frigate captain who cant see the larger intent then you are a man after mine own heart captain lewrie and i do believe a drap of rum in your coffee would not go amiss riou offered with a conspiratorial sly grin lewrie had only stayed aboard amazon for a bit less than an hour being treated to a quick tour by a proud capt riou to show off how fine was his frigate amazon was indeed shipshape and bristol fashion in every respect damme but i like that fellow lewrie exclaimed once hed sat down in the sternsheets of his boat and his coxn desmond had gotten it underway for the town piers captain riou is one hell of a fellow now if only parker turns out tbe half the man riou is lewrie thought come tthink ont i cant recall ever really meeting him hed been under admiral parkers command in the west indies for almost three years and had exchanged reports and orders but the closest hed ever gotten to the man was to call upon his shore headquarters out on the point of kingston harbour dealing with that drinkaddled staff captain known as the wine keg later with capt nicely who had taken his place once the former had died in the barrel and hed heard sir hyde parker snoring in his chambers just above the entrance hall lewrie had made the man a pile of tin with his capture of that newminted spanish silver at barataria bay but then parkers favourites like otway and others who had been allowed to cruise independently and reap prizes like a dealer raked in cards from the baize of a gaming table had made him umpteen thousands more he wondered if the man would even recall his name more ships comin in yonder sir desmond pointed out towards the soueast to the treacherous entrance through the series of shoalbanks offshore that guarded great yarmouth from the full onslaught of the north sea a brace of ships of the line third rate s led the procession followed by a small frigate or sloop of war and a brace of bomb vessels or gunboats at that distance it was hard to tell how their masts were spaced they keep acomin in like that sor twill be that soon th whole shebang gits underway aye liam patrick furfy the starboard stroke oar muttered to his mate eyes in th boat pat desmond whispered back an mind yer ps an qs as coxn he was supposed to keep good order though stern discipline and a hard face came unnaturally to the fellow shebang lewrie asked what sorta word is that ive heard of irish shebeens all fleas and whisky but whats a shebang furfy lock stock an barrel like sor furfy replied with a grunt of effort paying more mind to the pace of the stroke th whole thing you listen to furfy long enough you ladsll learn a thing or two lewrie told his boat crew all of whom but for desmond and furfy were strangers to him so far ye listen tpat furfy yell learn all th wrong things liam desmond countered which raised a small laugh from them all easy all now bow man ready with yer gaff an painter desmond ordered as the boat ghosted towards the foot of the slimy stone stairs at a quay toss yer oars larboard he added putting his tiller over a moment later and lewrie was able to step over the gunwale to the wet steps and trot up to the top of the quay wont be but half an hour with sir hyde desmond hot cider on me if a vendor comes by but keep em close he ordered ayeaye sor his coxn replied knuckling his forehead in salute a foul wind was whipping over the harbour out of the eastnoreast not quite a dead muzzler yet to pen the gathered warships in port it was a cold scandinavian wind though that whipped his cloak and plastered it to his back threatening to snatch away his best hat as he set a brisk pace towards the wrestlers arms hotel head down and a hand on his hat he almost rammed a pair of gentlemen who trudged against the wind in the opposite direction giving ground and swivelling his shoulder clear without half looking at them captain lewrie sir my stars it is you huh was lewries witty rejoinder as he turned about damn my eyes mister mountjoy to the life sir his former clerk in hms jester cried looking both relieved and pleased speak of coincidence sir but i was just in search of a boat to come out to you whyever mister mountjoy lewrie asked with a frown recalling that thomas mountjoy the younger brother of his london solicitor was now employed by the foreign officenot by the silkdrawers laced handkerchiefs oxonian drawlers who implemented and delivered british diplomacy but by the other department the one that employed zachariah twigg and james peel spies lurkers and cutthroats did the need arise and dealing with their sort was never a very healthy thing to do well first off sir mister keane here who coached down from london with me is an admiralty messenger mountjoy said turning to indicate the young fellow with him lewrie cocked a brow in wonder admiralty orders captain lewrie keane said tapping a thick canvas despatch bag slung over his shoulder just confirmed with viceadmiral sir hyde parker sir well let me see em then lewrie requested holding out a hand well erm they might best be opened and read aboard ship sir keane said coughing into his fist not from caution it sounded wet phlegmy and ominous sealed orders sir well one set sealed tother uhm private keane might have said more but for a fresh bout of hacking which bent him half over i suppose youve saved me a call upon our admiral parker mister mountjoy lewrie asked beginning to get one of those fey feelings that association with twigg usually engendered customary after all sir hyde sir is ah quite busy and barely had the time to see us do you see mountjoy explained with a twist of his mouth with a confidence that lewrie had not seen in him when hed served as his clerk mountjoy actually winked and further said i do believe sir hyde and his bride are otherwise engaged captain lewrie draggin his sheetanchor like the papers said lewrie surmised lady frances is become known as his little batter pudding i do believe sir mountjoy replied with a salacious grin well i can see why mister keane came down from london mister mountjoy but why is your presence required as well lewrie just had to ask though dreading the answer well there is another niggling little matter sir mountjoy confessed looking more like his old hesitant self for a moment if i may accompany you aboard your ship i can enlighten you further he said tapping his lips with a mittened finger which request for privacyfor secrecyalmost set lewries innards squirming into a gordian knot mine arse on a lewrie grumbled knowing that hed been hadagainand carping would not even make him feel better about it much less get him out of whatever deviltry the new government had come up with anything more for me from admiralty mister keane he asked instead turning to that wheezing worthy nothing more sir if you would take possession of the orders and affix your name in receipt of them ah here keane said opening his canvas bag to produce a ribbonbound and waxsealed bundle of paper a short receipt form and a stub of pencil save me a row out to your ship in this weather do you see and grateful for it ha ha lewrie shoved the orders under his boatcloak into a side pocket of his uniform coat then looked for a flat surface turn round mister keane would ye be so kind he said employing the mans back as a writing desk on which to press the form and pencil his name down there ye are then mister keane and take care of that cough i fully intend to sir and thankee for your solicitous keane tried to say interrupted by another bout of fluid coughs he had the good courtesy to turn himself away alee of both mountjoy and lewrie til he was done a hot mustard salve mountjoy hopefully suggested followed by candled tea cups applied to draw out the humours perhaps a scalding bath followed by a bowl of stifflaced punch sir was lewries sage advice drunk in a bed piled with covers and hourly changes o warmin pans it dont work ye cant feel any worse in the morning mister keane i thankee again for your solicitation sirs and take my leave to follow your advice keane said bowing from the waist godspeed he concluded before turning to lope for the nearest warm tavern so what the devil is it this time mister mountjoy alan lewrie sourly demanded as he led his former clerk towards his waiting boat it is more in the nature of a diplomatic mission sir thomas mountjoy told him frighteningly cryptic and tightlipped meanin some diplomats throat must be slit i spose lewrie sarcastically rejoined does twigg have somethin tdo with this he did participate in the initial consultations yes mountjoy answered though loath to say too much in the open lewrie increased his pace if only to warm up forcing mountjoy to toddle along off his larboard quarter to keep up mister twigg was not instrumental in the choice of ship or captain however sir does that mollify you by god it does not lewrie groused i shouldve known gettin an active commission so quickd have a catch to it id get leery even if twigg was only walkin by admiralty or whitehall and wasnt at the bottom of it whatever it is once completely laid before you sir youll see that it really is quite straightforward mountjoy attempted to console well they all begin that way dont they mister mountjoy lewrie shot back past gutchurning dread to a good fume christ on a crutch sir will that foul old schemer ever be shot o me or me of him perhaps when he passes from this mortal coil at last captain lewrie mountjoy said with an enigmatic smile yet when he finally does god help england he stated with a touch of awe and respect for his patron chapter twentyeight a franklin stove mountjoy enthused once pettus had taken his overcoat hat and cane and had seen to his captains things as well mountjoy rubbed his chilled hands over the stove savouring the heat and thank god coals cheap in england lewrie said enjoying his earlymorning splurge with the purser in much the same fashion he cocked an ear and looked about the parrots gone aye sir pettus told him after hed hung up their things on the row of pegs mister ballard sent him ashore with perry just at the change of the watch coffee sir nighboilin aye lewrie gladly agreed turning to lift the back of his coat to the stove wont do in a seaway but our surgeon mister harward says its best for the ships people are they kept a bit warm thermopylaes been prowling the north sea and baltic all wi though one might imagine that the body heat they generate along with the warmth of the galley fires trapped below would provide some heat mountjoy speculated facing about to thaw his own bottom hallo youve made an addition hallo toulon you old rascal and whos the new one sir thats chalky lewrie told him as the cats trickytrotted to greet the new arrival came off a french brig we made prize in the west indies well the americans took her but chalky came aboard as a gift the quasiwar twixt the united states and france yes sir mountjoy replied kneeling and wiggling his fingers to attract lewries cabinmates my mentor james peel wrote me of it and your part peel tell you my american bastard gave me the cat lewrie wondered for mountjoys tone bordered on the cryptic again as if he was smirking too bad guillaume choundas got away mountjoy commented once toulon had taken a tentative sniff and had decided that mountjoy was vaguely familiar the american navy defeated his ship so they had custody of th shit lewrie explained heading for the settee i tried to lay our claim on him but well sir with the disagreement with france settled the yankees no longer had reason to hold him on his parole mountjoy said i think hes back in france though in none too good odour with their new first consul napoleon bonaparte our sources say that choundas is pensioned off from their navy and no longer much of a threat lurking round paris looking for active employment mister twigg said it was most diplomatic of you the way you acceded to the american claims sir mountjoy said looking up from his kneeling position on the floor where toulon was now rubbing him and purring as he was stroked the manner in which you cooperated with the united states navy gained their trust and kept our tacit support of them from public purview as well so i can be diplomatic can i lewrie scoffed meanin this should be a walk in the park something like that sir oww mountjoy meant to say in compliment before chalky feeling left out nipped him for attention shouldve warned ye bout chalky hes the jealous sort lewrie said well damme mister mountjoy here it is almost old boys week first my old first officer arthur ballard turns up as thermopylaes first lieutenant and now you makes one wonder do ye hang about in yarmouth long enough ye run into everyone ye ever knew ah coffee he exclaimed as pettus appeared with the blackiron pot and cups as soon as mountjoy took seat in a chair across from him before the cats could claim a lap pettus poured the coffee for them then sat the pot atop the franklin stove tautly lashed down in the middle of the greatcabins and firmly embedded in a tinlined wood box filled with sand diplomatic ye say lewrie said after a warming sip once he had laced his drink with freshgrated sugar and some cream drawn from the frigates nanny goat kept in the forecastle manger up forward uhm mountjoy cautioned casting a glance at pettus one of those mums the word moments pettus lewrie said to his new servant you and whitsell take a turn on deck for a bit now he said once theyd departed just who is it does twigg wish me to murder or would shovin em over the side in the dark of night do in your orders from admiralty sir mountjoy uneasily began glancing about for hidden witnesses or for ears pressed to the windows of the coachtop overhead which you shall open and read shortly you are directed to sail for the baltic preceding the fleet and reconnoiter the ports of copenhagen karlskrona kronstadt and reval to determine the thickness and condition of the ice which at present prevents the ships opposing us from sailing and combining all by our lonesome little selves mister mountjoy lewrie had to gawp and goggle just who the bloody hell dreamt that up i believe it was a suggestion from admiral nelson sent to captain thomas troubridge who is now seconded to a seat on the board at admiralty and relayed to lord saint vincent the first lord sir mr mountjoy related in a low conspiratorial tone whilst neither i nor anyone at the foreign office are privy to the thought behind the plan i gather that the consensus was that should a lone british frigate enter the baltic her presence would not be cause for much alarm among the powers in the armed league of the north do you see even with a war in the offing it is only natural that in the pursuit of a diplomatic solution to our contretemps with the danes swedes and russians messages from his majestys government would still be delivered to our ambassadors til the very last moment and their delivery by a fast frigate not a packet brig would elicit no undue response hes grown a lot since last i saw him lewrie thought remembering the henheaded utterly landlubberly callow young cully who had stumbled over every ring bolt and coiled line who after one taste of adventure and mayhem ashore in pursuit of that french counterpart to twigggillaume choundasand their escape from the utter rout of the austrian army had been gulled into taking a more active part for king and country than scribbling in ledgers and account books to take employment and training under twiggs and jemmy peels arcane tutelage though mister mountjoy the presence of a british frigate to recall our ambassadors before the shootin startsd make em scramble tsnap us up lewrie cynically pointed out well that would be an act outside the diplomatic niceties sir mountjoy took delight in countering quickly as beyond the pale of conduct between civilised nations as would our arrest and imprisonment of their embassies and legations it just isnt done sir besides mountjoy continued legs now crossed in clubman fashion one ankle resting on the other knee with chalky up in his lap and his cup and saucer balanced on the bent knee as serene as a man taking high tea with his doting mother with the navies of the armed neutrality iced up in port the odds of encountering any of their ships already brought out of ordinary manned and got to sea perhaps by chopping open channels through a mile of threefootthick ice are rather low sir he said with a charming grin why itd take thousands of workers to get one ship out a task better suited to the egyptians piling up the pyramids or the chinese erecting well whatever it was the chinese built with a round million coolies what there is that lewrie cautiously allowed him the point loath though he was to admit it thermopylae might run a greater risk from punching her hull open on a stray floe or berg of foundering on some badly charted shoal or small island of which the baltic boasted an appalling plenty ice once the sun rose just naturally created fog like london spewed coal smoke slow as the fleet for the baltic is gatherin it might be different in a few weeks but do we sail today or before the end of the week he mused shrugging oh thats the straightforward naval mission mister mountjoy lewrie said once the other shoe figuratively dropped go in scout then sail back out and meet parker and nelson somewhere in the skagerrak or the kattegat and report what weve seen but ye said there is a diplomatic side to my orders are there letters to be delivered to foreign capitals not letters sir exactly mountjoy said going all cuttyeyed and putting lewrie back on his guard in a trice at least not letters from foreign office that you will personally deliver no we have entrusted the plan for a possible peaceful solution to people who possess more influence with the tsar and his court than our ambassador john proby lord carysfort at the moment well actually mister mountjoy went on squirming in a way that just naturally forced lewrie to cross his own legs to protect his nutmegs against an imaginary boot at this moment his majestys government does not have an ambassador resident in saint petersburg mountjoy confessed lord carysfort is our ambassador to berlin and the russians but hes used to dealing with the russians even at long distance by post im to pick up lord carysfort and take him to russia lewrie asked save him a long troika ride through the snow is it spare him from the packs of wolves he added the sarcasm in full flow ah no sir you are to embark a pair of eminent russian nobles who are to deliver his majestys offer for a peaceful solution to the tsar themselves mountjoy explained tsar pauls recent affection for napoleon and france his eager acceptance of support for his spurious claim to the island of malta and his acceptance of the title of commander of the knights of saint john a catholic honour awarded by a very small heretical batch of courtiers well it goes against the grain for nobles steeped in the russian orthodox church sir and what france and bonaparte stand for liberty fraternity and equality are anathema to the structure of russian society sure to cause bloody revolution the overthrow of aristocratic authority rebellion of their millions of serfs nationwide perhaps a wholesale slaughter of the rich landed and titled as vicious as the french revolution and the terror which it engendered there is great concern that the tsars recent capricious actions and the armed neutrality might present the russian empire with war on two fronts and with our navy allied with the ottoman turks in the black sea they might lose all their conquests of the last hundred years entire sir there is the possibility that should the unofficial embassy you carry to russia succeed in contacting key members of the court and swaying them to stand up to the tsar but the tsar is daft mister mountjoy lewrie took great glee in quickly pointing out as mad as a hatter as a march hare and anyone who gainsays himd have tbe even crazier than he is or have a desire thave his head chopped off i cant see anyone sane opposing the tsar might as well insult a genghis khan with a toothache or a bad breakfast and whop goes your head well it may be slim odds sir but theres always the hope mountjoy said and if the mission fails then at least we tried lord hawkesbury our new foreign secretary has determined that the avoidance of a costly new war in addition to the present one against france is best in the long run hmm lewrie mused puzzling that one out toulon climbed into his lap and kneaded for pets which lewrie gave distractedly the only snag mister mountjoy is is the ice so thick that the russians cant yet get out how the devil am i to get in with my passengers if saint petersburg kronstadt reval or any major ports are unavailable it is my understanding that any small fishing port will do sir mountjoy told him sleds could be summoned over the ice if even the small harbours are unreachable and the embassy may proceed by land anyplace will suit just so long as they are landed as close to saint petersburg as possible and youll be going along on this neckornothing jaunt mister mountjoy lewrie asked to speed em on their way in point of fact no sir mountjoy answered close to squirming again the presence of a british subject in company with the embassy would poison its chances of success immediately he was quick to explain and for a second lewrie could almost but not quite take that as believable yet youll sail with us til landfall at least wont you he skeptically enquired sorry sir mountjoy said with a stab at a disarming smile and a hapless shrug of disappointment to be missing a grand adventure i was instructed to escort them down from london explain the matter to you then return deliver them into your capable hands then dash back to my superiors oh christ lewrie gawped i smell a rat mountjoy a great big toothy twiggscented rat rather something rotten in denmark sir to quote the bard mountjoy breezily replied attempting a chuckle no mister twigg as i said was consulted in this matter only to the extent of advising lord hawkesbury as to who might best be approached in saint petersburg and who might best serve as the emissaries frankly id he delighted to go along sir working for our particular branch of the foreign office is not quite as exciting as mister peel made it out to be when first he and mister twigg recruited me i spend the most of my time officebound in london with only the occasional adventure uhhuh lewrie scoffed at that mean tsay my livelumber is already here in yarmouth they are sir mountjoy said warming their fundaments in a hotel for the moment another fellow coached down with mister keane and me a captain hardcastle a merchant master very familiar with the baltic and the ice conditions all told there will be six men to make room for admiralty was also to send down a lieutenant ricks who took service with the russian navy for several years also in the baltic im told he wintered over with them at least two of his years so he should prove most informative about how soon in the spring they get their ships remasted rearmed and brought out of ordinary six men lewrie asked wondering where lt ballard would find room for them all there would be some disgruntled officers in the gunroom if turfed out to accommodate foreigners two servants sir mountjoy explained only one manservant per emissary they wished to have three apiece but we finally convinced them theyd be going by frigate not a yacht do they fetch a lot o dunnage with em lewrie pressed for more information would the aristocrats be separated from their servants even for the night or must thermopylae shift all her stores on the orlop at the last moment too we also convinced them to limit themselves to but one waggonload of goods sir in addition to their trunks and bags mountjoy told him rather a lot of it consists of wine and other spirits id advise you sir mountjoy said leaning forward to not match them drink for drink especially do they offer their national spirit which is called vodka its powerfully intoxicating and will sneak up and swat you tween the eyes before you even notice well i survived slivovitz and serbian pirates plum brandy so i might essay at least a taste lewrie allowed resigned to the fact that nothing outside damnation to hell lasts forever he supposed he could tolerate a halfdozen lubbers for a month or so even if he had to subdivide his greatcabins to accommodate some of them speak english do they lewrie quipped passably sir mountjoy said with a grin relieved perhaps that lewrie was not kicking furniture or ranting over the sudden revelation of his orders or mr twiggs slight connexions to them you will have captain hardcastle and lieutenant ricks both fluent in russian to carry you over the stickier translations of course all russian nobility the tsars court especially speak french in lieu of their own tongue after several days of listening to the two gentlemen slang away in russian i can see why a beastly language tell me about it lewrie commiserated recalling eudoxia and her father when they spatted with each other then of course sir there is your own partial mastery of russian mountjoy said with a smile and a nod what mastery mister mountjoy lewrie said in surprise i uh we were led to believe you had a smatter sir so i can tell when im bein cursed beyond that not a bloody word lewrie took some joy in telling him oh my mountjoy muttered book movenda iam sunt bella clarescit dies ortuque titan lucidus creceo subit now must my war be set in motion the sky is brightening and the shining sun steals up in saffron dawn lucius annaeus seneca hercules furens chapter twentynine oh springing joy lewrie dourly said as a hired barge came alongside thermopylaes starboard cleared to make way for their passengers and goods about ten in the morning of the day after mountjoy had brought his news aboard the two russian nobles had found their coaching journey from london too exhausting though mountjoy had said that theyd been in no urgent rush and had made stops every two hours for warmups latemorning starts each day and earlyafternoon halts at only the best coaching inns or hotels from london onwards after reaching great yarmouth theyd lodged themselves in the wrestlers arms the same hotel where viceadmiral sir hyde parker and his little batter pudding still enjoyed their honeymoon where the gravely ill capt speaks his wife retainers physician and parrot strove for his recovery and where there were several large fireplaces and deeppiled soft beds they had sent word aboard that they would rest for a night then join thermopylae at first light this morning evidently first light to a pair of russian nobles meant closer to clear decks and up spirits at seven bells of the forenoon almost nigh to noon sights than crack of dawn first sparrow fart even eight bells of the morning watch at am forewarned lt ballard had concentrated upon the loading of any lastminute purchases by the purser the master gunner sailmaker or armourer the cooper or carpenter for the officers and midshipmens messes and the captains cook lt ballard surreptitiously pulled out his pocketwatch to take a squint at it then heaved a small fretful sigh before stowing it away again doesnt make a diffrence mister ballard lewrie told him the winds still foul for us tmake an offing he looked up to the long snaking commissioning pendant at the truck of the mainmast the winds had come more sutherly but not by all that much as yet whistle up the sideparty and all hands now theyre almost alongside perhaps by sundown ayeaye sir beg pardon captain lewrie capt hardcastle their merchant master intruded not willing to spend admiralty funds on an expensive shore lodging when he could pocket the difference and sleep for free aboard thermopylae and drink and sup on navy largesse he had reported aboard just after noon of the day before in my experience the wind will shift quick by dawn tomorrow go back to stiff westerlies let us get out slick as anything not having served in the north sea before sir i thankee for that news captain hardcastle lewrie told the fellow who looked as if hed spent most of his life being battered by stiff winter winds and heaving greenwhite seas hardcastle was ruddy chapped skinny yet wiry as a teenaged topman though going rapidly bald lewrie had dined him in the night before and the man ate like a teenaged topman too lt eades appeared in his finest uniform with a party of his marines accompanied by sgt crick and corporals thomas and frye the frigates officers and midshipmen were there as well turned out in sunday divisions inspection best pulley the bosuns mate sounded a call for all hands to bring the crew up from where theyd been sheltering belowdecks from the wind and the cold humph lewrie said with a suspicious sniff as he got an eyeful of the goods stowed down the centreline of the approachings barge a powerful lot of it for one waggonload mister mountjoy do they buy their wine by the tun or do they fetch off their own water kegs im not quite sure sir mountjoy who had been scuttling to and from shore to hasten their arrival since the aforementioned crack of dawn sounded as if the nobles cargo had multiplied overnight i think something was said of lastminute shopping but so lewrie demanded which of ems which then there were only four civilian passengers in the barge besides the three sailors managing her all looking up at the railings of the frigate with varying interest or the studied lack of it there was a tall and thickset older fellow in a lustrous and expensivelooking coat of some sleek fur that reached to his ankles with the collar up round his neck below a fashionable narrowbrimmed thimble of a beaver hat was it his own hair that was so white or did he sport a short peruke he appeared sublimely indifferent to the proceedings the older gentleman is count dmitri rybakov sir mountjoy prompted from lewries right elbow in a loud whisper as if in awe of foreign nobility the heavyset chap in the shapka fur hat beside him is mostlike his servant the other one standing by the stays is count anatoli levotchkin and his servant now wheres lieutenant ricks he was to leave london but a day behind us umhmm lewrie responded more interested in the perfect turnout of his sideparty and officers for a moment to make sure nothing was amiss it would not do his suddenly resuscitated career any good for a titled foreigner to lodge a complaint of lиsemajestй upon him count rybakov so boredlooking simply struck lewrie as the very sort of arrogant paininthearse whod take offence over the slightest bit of suspected dishonour or disrespect he then turned his attention to the younger man whom mountjoy had pointed out to him if count rybakov looked about fifty years old the younger noble could pass for his son levotchkin appeared to be in his early twenties if not in his late teens he also wore a sleek long doublebreasted fur overcoat though with the wide collar and lapels down and had one of those fur hatsa shapkaon his head with the earflaps turned up the baldy beside him his supposed manservant was a hulking pugilistbig and roughlooking brute who not only wore no hat at all despite the cold but wore a shaggier and cheaper hide coat lined with sheep wool open to the elements whilst the other men wore buckled shoes or topboots that peeked from below the hems of their long coats this fellow wore furlined midcalf boots with his trousers stuffed into them looks like those two had a bad night of it somewhere lewrie japed under his breath taking note of a few fading bruises on both the young nobles and his servants faces i understand they were set upon by a gang of thieves a couple of weeks ago in london sir mountjoy supplied sotto voce now that the barge was snugly alongside no lewrie goggled cant be can it whatre the odds that thats tesss count anatoli what were they doin in england anyway before this scheme got dropped on em mister mountjoy lewrie asked turning away from the barge to look at the fellow from the foreign office oh count rybakov had come to purchase blooded race horses and hunters sir mountjoy was happy to relate to reveal his knowledge english and irish thoroughbreds simply mad for them and i think count levotchkin was doing a term or two at oxford christ he very likely is tesss count lewrie realised as he tried to portray idle curiosity now aint this goin tbe intrestin liked london society so much that he stayed on nigh a year sir mountjoy was blathering on cheerful as a magpie after he sent his new horses on to his russian estates he got invited to country houses for foxhunting and steeplechasing last autumn the pytchley or the quorn i forget which but he took a hedge badly during one of the cubhunts before the season started proper and had to heal up by then he was back in london just in time for the winter balls and such everybody likes him immensely even the prince of wales hes a lively dancer too especially at the contredanses who levotchkin lewrie asked taking another squint at the stifffaced young twit clinging to the larboard stays of the barges single mast oh no sir count rybakov mountjoy corrected him i dont know that much about count levotchkin just met him before we took coaches here seems a serious sort of sprog to me he does well does rybakov dance well ill have the ships band tune up and let him try his hand at a hornpipe lewrie wryly said does thermopylae actually have a band mountjoy asked no but ive still my pennywhistle lewrie told him with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek lord spare us mountjoy said in a whispered sigh echoed by lt ballard who had overheard and had been a victim aboard alacrity when lewrie had first tried his hand at music his talent had not improved appreciably when mountjoy had been aboard hms jester either with his servants help the elder noble clumsily mounted the gunnl of the barge trying to balance for a breath or two using his goldknobbed ebony walkingstick as a prop before stepping out for the mainmast channel platform a slight harbour scend raised up the barge just in time to make it an easy step rybakov was quick to seize hold of one of the thick deadeyed main stays as if catching his breath at his daring before essaying anything more strenuous he looked up for the first time glowering at the difficulty of battens and manropes should we have lowered a bosuns chair dye think mountjoy whispered i know you always say its undignified but might not have a clue capt hardcastle opined mightve got aboard a merchantman right off the pier by gangway sir lewrie stepped to the bulwarks and leaned out the open entryport might you require a chairsling sir how the devil count rybakov fumed back waving one hand at the boarding battens tiy idysodar charochko he added under his breath aah he spat right after discovering that his expensively gloved right hand was sticky with tar the boarding battens are like rungs on a ladder sir lewrie helpfully explained the ropes strung through their outer ends one holds onto as one ascends really we can rig a sling chort count rybakov snarled whether he meant damn or did he intend shit it was no matter it was a quite useful word he flung his walkingstick up at lewrie who startled barely managed to snag it as it twirled else it would have gone into the waters between the hulls of the frigate and the barge then stepped off the chain platform to the battens took hold of the manropes with both hands and made a slow way upwards right foot up first then he brought the left to meet it before moving up to the next batten once clear of the chain platform the younger count levotchkin sprang up atop the gunnl of the barge with ease hopped across to the platform then waited for the older man to clear the battens he grinned as if it was funny lewrie couldnt make out what rybakov was saying under his breath but he could guess each deep exhalation sounded furious in some language hes goin to complain i just know it lewrie thought a stern letter to the foreign office admiralty askin for my head as the crown of count rybakovs stylish hat peeked above the lip of the entryport the bosun and his mate began to shrill a long duet call lt ballard cried for the crew to doff hats and lt eades barked for his marines to bring their muskets to the present with loud and uniform slaps of hands on wood and short boots stamping on oak decks lewrie doffed his cocked hat with his right hand in salute and tucked the walkingstick behind his left leg welcome aboard thermopylae my lord lewrie said with a hopeful smile errr count rybakov grumbled back sounding very much like a pirate rolling off an angry arr as he stripped off his thin gloves without caring where they went he tossed them over his shoulder then stuck out his right hand for an eyeblink lewrie thought he wished to shake hands but realised that rybakov only wanted his walkingstick back by then the younger noble had scampered up the battens to the deck as the bosun and his mate continued their long intricate call worthy of an admiral being piped aboard welcome aboard his majestys ship thermopylae my lord lewrie repeated for him doffing his hat once more count levotchkin glared a very stern chinhigh look at one and all slowly swivelling his head from bow to stern and up and down the waiting row of officers and midshipmen who were toeing the line of a deck seam with their hats off and lifted high in salute the young sprog had seemed excited when he had stood by the barges stays looking up almost in wonder and expectation but now he had put his aristocratic phyz on as if ordinary people and experiences were beneath him and made no impression count rybakov count levotchkin allow me to present to you captain alan lewrie of his britannic majestys navy mountjoy quickly intervened to make the formal introductions an officer famed for his skill and courage captain lewrie i name to you count dmitri rybakov and count anatoli levotchkin your humble servant my lords lewrie chimed in bowing from the waist and making a leg with his hat swept to his chest may i present you to my officers my lords after all we shall all be together for some time on our voyage are any of them noble count levotchkin asked giving them all a dubious upanddown scanning much like a tailor to the crown might to a pack of newcome parvenus uhm i dont believe lewrie said looking to lt ballard for help in that regard ballard gave his head a brief shake of no no one sorry then it is of no matter count levotchkin said with a snobbish sniff where are our quarters it is cold british seadogs count rybakov said more jovially smiling broadly england s wooden walls yes i would like to meet your officers kapitan lewrie introduce me to them of course my lord lewrie said with a bit of relief that he was going to be friendlier than his colleague maybe he wont write complainin letters after all he thought hoped rather rybakov shot a stern glare in levotchkins direction before he went down the line of officers and midshipmen with lewrie exchanging greetings thankfully lewrie could call all of them by name by then right down to the youngest mids pannabaker and plumb levotchkin was forced to trail the elder man bestowing short jerks of his head when each was named to him obedient but letting all know that he was very bored with the proceedings yes our quarters kapitan lewrie count rybakov said after the last introductions were done and the manservants had clambered up to the gangway with the lighter luggage this way my lords lewrie bade mister ballard youll see their dunnage hoisted aboard i will depend on your servants to show my first officer which items are required for your everyday existence and which of the bulkier items may be stowed below on the orlop sir yes my man fyodor and sasha know our wants rybakov agreed sasha lewrie twigged to the name isnt that the fellow tesss count called to for help the night mother batsons bucks beat em all tpuddin god thisll be really intrestin aah warmth count rybakov enthused making a bee line to the franklin stove to warm his hands and unbuttoning his long overcoat take yer things sir pettus offered rybakov looked him over for a moment as if sizing him up as worthy enough before handing him his hat and walkingstick and letting him remove that heavy fur coat once rid of his outer wear count rybakov displayed a full head of hair atop his head light grey or dingy white not a peruke and worn in a modern style his suit was dark green waistlength in front with the long tails behind that were all the crack in london that season with snug matching breeches below and white silk stockings and stout shoes with gilt buckles there was a waistcoat of jacquard stripes in white and salmon to add a jaunty note to a sombre overall hue as did his neckstock of dark red moire silk forgetting his aristocratic airs count rybakov turned about and lifted the tails of his coat to warm his bum the same as any man sighing and smiling with pleasure to have a thawed backside a glass of something warming as well my lord lewrie asked or might you take tea or coffee first count levotchkin damn the young sprog he had flung off his own fur hat and his coat and was prowling through lewries winecabinet without leave im sure youll find something warming in there sir lewrie said allowing his sarcasm a looser rein for a moment levotchkin had tossed his hat atop the dining table and had simply let his coat hit the deck in a furry heap for someone else to pick up later whitsell the cabin boy tried to pick it up but it was damnably heavy without recognising that lewrie had even spoken count anatoli took a bottle of kentucky whisky from the racks unstoppered the decanter and took first a sniff then a short swig straight from the bottle with a shrug that signifed that it might do levotchkin helped himself to a glass and poured it full before crossing the cabins for a slouch on the starboardside settee with one topbooted foot atop the large brass traytopped low table that lewrie had fetched back from his time in india tween the wars in the s kulturny plyemyaneek count rybakov chid him in russian culture lewrie translated from his very limited stock of words and phrases in his head tothers cousin nephew one of em so theyre related somehow put some manners on hes saying kentucky bourbon whisky count levotchkin lewrie told him i am sorry we dont run much to vodka nor gin either rums our stockintrade that and small beer or wine tea yes kapitan count rybakov exclaimed using his enthusiasm to deflect his kinsmans bad manners fyodor ah the glasses for tea we russians prefer it so hot the tea glass must be surrounded by a metal holder im familiar with em my lord lewrie replied though still fuming over the younger noble making so free with his spirits sorry we dont have a samovar aboard to brew tea the way you like lots of sugar fyodor rybakov reminded his servant who was digging through a small chest you have lemon kapitan for now sir aye a limited supply sad tsay hard to get in england in midwinter lewrie told him tea pipin hot pettus for you count levotchkin nyet the young man snapped if youll take a seat sir lewrie bade the older man an arm swept in the direction of the settee and chairs and cocking a brow over the sheer amount of luggage coming in a solid stream through the forward door and piled by his sailors where the dining coach had been across from the chartspace ive taken the liberty of rearranging the greatcabins to accommodate you onpassage my lord he said once hed sat down himself ive shifted my sleeping space and my desk forrud nearer the quarterdeck and given you and count levotchkin my old space there aft on the starboard side with a hanging bedcot each the ah necessary is on the larboard side yonder and we must share sorry there might be room left for your servants to sleep in hammocks do you require them to be at hand at all hours the new arrangements had looked cramped before with all the chests and trunks and leather portmanteaus coming aboard lewrie began to wonder if thered be room in which to swing a cat did fyodor and that huge sasha sleep aft along with pettus and whitsell speaking of toulon and chalky intrigued yet frightened of all the bustle darted with their bellies scraping the deck to their one secure place lewries lap you will sleep here with us count levotchkin asked as if the very idea was insulting with those filthy little beasts pah he is kapitan of the ship anatoli rybakov gently reminded levotchkin we are his guests the kapitan must sleep near the helm and his watch officers so he may respond to the slightest change or emergency it will only be a few weeks after all rybakov said with a grin and cats are not as noisy as that damned parrot who shrieked the night through at our hotel last evening surely the pet of some sailor or a fiend it is not dignified count levotchkin groused removing his nose from his glass of whisky just long enough to say would you require your servants to bunk here my lord lewrie asked again no said rybakov da said levotchkin nyet rybakov insisted glaring the sulky young man to surrender the point they are not necessary after we retire kapitan lewrie he stated settling the matter and we both understand the constraints placed upon us and our usual comforts when travelling by ship by a warship not one built for their passengers pleasures do we not anatoli it was not a question but a pointed warning to which the young man had to nod agreement though his face and ears went a bit redder as he swallowed his bile mr mountjoy entered the greatcabins sidling past two sailors lugging yet another bloodygreat leather roundtopped trunk and made his bows to the nobles before leaning down to lewrie it would seem that lieutenant ricks will not be available sir why not mister mountjoy lewrie said with a frown he ah was taken up for debts the morning our party left london sir mountjoy mournfully said and is now mostlike held in the fleet prison til hes repaid his creditors well damme lewrie groused cant admiralty pay em for him so hes available they are his personal debts sir mountjoy explained and not any sums he might have run up in active british commission recall he was on halfpay to admiralty the last three years and was in russian service til late last autumn so and i spose theres no one else available lewrie asked and answered his own question no of course there isnt not in time tdo us any good might take a week twhistle up anotherun and hell take the best part of the next week tcome join us here in yarmouth well sir with the russian baltic fleet iced up in harbour mountjoy pointed out looking for the best face on things there may not be all that great a need for immediate expertise on their navy we must delay our sailing count rybakov asked a tad agitated upon hearing of it i think not my lord lewrie told him puffing out his cheeks and lips in frustration though putting the best face on it himself mister mountjoy is correct does the ice keep your baltic fleet in port a month or so longer its slim odds well run into any of them at sea before we land you at the nearest icefree port to saint petersburg so lieutenant ricks presence would make no difference to us i expect soon as the winds come westerly to set sail perhaps as soon as tomorrow dawn i am gratified to hear it kapitan lewrie count rybakov said with relief our diplomatic mission and the hope of a reconciliation between our two great nations before a war can be set in motion from which no one can prosper but the odious french tyrant bonaparte must not be hindered no wonder everybody likes him lewrie thought most gratifying to the foreign office as well mountjoy said with an open relieved grin by dawn we could be on our way anatoli rybakov cheerfully said does that not sound pleasing da yes it does count anatoli agreed sitting up a little straighter showing his first sign of any emotion other than boredtotears urrrah he cried right after tossing his drink down in one gulp it did not help his welcome aboard though that right after he had drunk he threw the glass at the pierced metal grate door of the stove where it shattered and no wonder everyone despises you lewrie thought wincing at the mess and the loss of one of his better glasses he keeps that up hell be drinkin from cupped hands we all will id wager he has hosts o people lined up waitin tslap him silly count levotchkin smirked at their reactions to his action and tossed off a small shrug that was all they would get by way of apology he rose to go to the winecabinet for a fresh glass perhaps a taste of something else more pleasing while his kinsman count rybakov looked at lewrie and rolled his eyes as if to say what may one do with these youngsters while nodding and blinking a silent apology for him whitsell lewries runty cabin boy went for a broom and dustpan one of our customs kapitan lewrie rybakov said whenever an oath is pledged or a toast of significance to us we break the glasses in the hearth or on the floor to seal its importance so that no one may reuse those glasses and renege later that is how urgent our peace mission is to us to anatoli you must understand lewrie looked over his shoulder to the young man in question to see him opening another decanter and sniffing it and young whitsell by his side as if to deter him from causing any more mayhem anatoli levotchkin were one not aware of his cruelty and perversity really did appear as a handsome wellsetup fellow tall slim and with the build of a courtier or a light cavalryman he had closecropped dark blond hair with the typical blue slavic eyes in a lean scholars face framed by sideburns to below his earlobes and brushed forward almost in frenchified fashion lewrie imagined he was rich as croesus or the walpoles but levotchkin was dressed in scholars drab a black doubledbreasted coat over a grey waistcoat with the collars of his shirt turned up to his jaws with a bright yellow neckstock at his throat dark buff snuglycut trousers and topboots completed his suiting lawyers dressed more colourfully levotchkin might be taken for a welloff young student about to take his final exams and blues for brilliance or an offleave cavalry officer in a fashionable regiment he could be mistaken for a typical merry andrew yet cavalry for certain lewrie decided to himself only cavalrys that toplofty and dim lord make this a short voyage he turned back to look at rybakov again and stroked his cats who had each taken a thigh on which to sprawl and knead his waistcoat for attention and comfort tea sir pettus announced returning from the galley with a large pewter pot held in folded towels boiling hot as you requested ah tea count rybakov exclaimed clapping chilled hands capital lewrie heartily agreed as pettus set the pot on the stove top and went for a tray of cups and saucers urrrah was levotchkins sneer back to the laconic sulker hed been when hed first come aboard ill not shove him overboard th first dark night lewrie vowed ill not chapter thirty as if in answer to lewries prayer for a short voyage the wind came round more sutherly by sunset prompting him to send word ashore for a harbour pilot to attend thermopylae at first light in the expectation that the prevailing westerlies would be in full force by dawn he also directed lt ballard to dismantle and stow away the stoves by eight bells of the middle watch at am when the crew was roused out to swab decks stow hammocks and bedding and clear away sir sir a sleepy pettus said tapping the wood side of his hanging bedcot eight bells sir very well pettus lewrie said with a grunt the quilts and furs really had made a pleasingly snug and warm cocoon and coming up from it was like a dive into cold water clothes quick pot of coffee is on your sideboard sir pettus told him as he left the small partitionedoff sleeping space closing the slat door hed left a lit lanthorn over which lewrie warmed his fingers once he had donned his thickest wool stockings a set of underdrawers a pair of sloptrousers and his tasselled boots two shirts his neckstock and waistcoat quickly followed topped with his heaviest old uniform coat hastily doubled over and buttoned against the chill over that he threw a dressing robe to hoard his bodys warmth til the very last second before he would have to appear on the quarterdeck some hasty attention to toulon and chalky who seemed glad that they could nestle together on the furs once hed gone and he was out with the lanthorn in his hand to light his way to the diningcoach for a welcome cup of coffee which pettus had already sugared for him christ lewrie snapped as one booted foot thumped against one of his passengers chests first offcah sah the marine sentry by the outer door announced in a loud thunderous basso with the requisite thud of a musket butt on the deck come lewrie bade glad for at least one friendly face good morning sir lt ballard said hat in hand the wind is come round to westsouwest once the hands have eat the ship is ready for sea in all respects very good mister ballard lewrie said coffee most welcome sir ballard agreed as pettus poured him a cup ballard gazed about the greatcabins may i say sir that your quarters now more resemble the hold of a coasting brig barely enough room tswing a cat aye lewrie agreed grumbling over the rim of his cup which he held between both hands how i am expected tland all this flotsam and jetsam with em i dont know heard from the pilot have we arthur we have sir ballard replied all grim business as was his wont when on duty for a moment lewrie could almost imagine that lt ballards tone of voice held a note of reproof for the casual use of his christian name he assures us that his boat will be alongside at six and suggested in his note of reply that our best course would be to depart through the saint nicholas gat channel which will lie to leeward of the winds and is mostrecently rebuoyed and marked sir id dig a channel through the shoals and bars does it get us on our way soonest lewrie said back lord what a chore they are our livelumber i take it that you mean sir ballard said with only the faintest smirk one a talkative windbag tother a gloomy drunken sponge lewrie griped before mister mountjoy departed us he told me it was part of my diplomatic duty to dine em proper play the tactful host hah id rather have the other officers and mids in and get a feel for em but i cant do that with our passengers attable at the same time i can have a few of em in each meal but only for their amusement he said jerking his head aft in the direction of his sleeping guests he spoke low as well so as not to wake them no matter for the sounds of hundreds of sailors opening and slamming sea chests their shoes thundering on the decks and companionway ladders and the thuds and squeaks of washdeck pumps being set up and drawing sea water followed by the rasp of holystones and bibles on those decks for the mornings scrubdown to pristine whiteness which could be conjured as the wheezing breath of a great dragon at times was sure to awaken them sooner or later even levotchkin who had been poured into his swaying bedcot by his servant sasha as drunk as a lord the stoves stowed away lewrie asked pouring himself half a cup of coffee to warm up the rest in his mug no fuel added since the start of the middle watch sir and the embers are now in the process of being cast overside lt ballard replied they shall be dismantled and stowed away on the orlop directly very well lewrie said with a sigh damned shame really i fear the people will be halffrozen by the time were under way top up your coffee mister ballard pettus offered aye thank you pettus ballard agreed whaa came a strangled cry from aft and the creak of a swaying cot as its occupant sat up too quickly stop that noise at once you disturb my chort yob tvoyemat followed by thud as whichever of the nobles fell out and hit the deck god damn you theyre such a joy mister ballard lewrie said in a sarcastic drawl i will join you on deck dye need your manservant sir he called aft in a louder voice da send sasha to me so bulack count levotchkin yelled just before all the liquor and wine hed taken aboard rearose and he cast his accounts to neptune lewrie hoped he had enough wit to find a handy bucket get a mop sir pettus asked with distaste and trepidation no get his bloody manservant lewrie said i expect his man has bags of experience cleanin up after him ill breakfast once we are through the gat and made our offing pettus a stale roll with some jam and a lot more coffee will serve til then aye sir pettus replied with a relieved grin once through st nicholas gat past the barely awash barrier isles and shallow belt of shoals and bars ghosting along under jibs topsls and wingedout driver and about four miles offshore the harbour pilots singlemasted cutter came alongside and their guide departed leaving hms thermopylae free to make her own way make her fly mister ballard lewrie bade with a broad grin elated beyond all measure to be back at sea show me what our ships capable of all but the fore course tkeep her bow lifted ayeaye sir ballard was happy to agree and began bawling out orders through a brass speakingtrumpet lieutenants farley and fox with wolfish grins cheered the hands on to lay aloft and trice up with half the midshipmen scampering up the ratlines with the topmen to cast off harbour gaskets and brails and loose canvas half an hour later at seven bells of the morning watch all plain sail had been set and thermopylae was pounding roughly to the noreast over a finewrinkled steelgrey sea flecked with rollers and sea horses topped with white spume eight and threequarter knots sir midshipman privette the dullish one cried from the taffrails where he and two men of the afterguard had plied the minute glass and the chiplog how does she steer off the wind lewrie asked the quartermaster of the watch who with one of his mates manned the large helm sweet capm sir beasley replied shifting his tobacco quid to the other side of his mouth away from lewrie shes a lady at any point o sail almost mister lyle lewrie asked the sailing master dye think we could free the last reef line of the tgallants or does your experience with the weather in the north sea suggest against it tis a fine morning sir and no hint of storm mr lyle replied looking as if he relished speed as well after a long spell in harbour i see no problem with such full tgallants mister ballard lewrie ordered strolling to the starboard bulwarks to take hold of the aftermost mizen mast stays and the caprail of the bulwark with mittened hands with the winds almost right up the stern there was no windward side at present to be reserved for him alone he leaned far out to look forward beaming a foolish grin of pleasure to eye thermopylaes wake as it creamed along her hull a great kerfuffle of white spray where her cutwater and forefoot sliced ocean a churning whitefoamy waterfall curving back and upwards in a slight swell from the bows to almost amidships where it sloughed downwards to bare a glittering peek at her coppered quickwork before rising and spreading further aft where it grew out into a broad bridal train of pale green and white that pointed astern towards the coast as straight as an arrow so disturbed that it lingered long after the frigate had created it the ship thumped thudded and drummed as it met each oncoming roller flinging short columns and curtains of spray as high as the anchor catheads and the forecastle bulwarks misting aft in a shivery cold rain that dappled the quarterdeck like the first fat drops of a storm and it was glorious eight bells chimed from the forecastle belfry in four twin tings to end the morning watch and begin the forenoon almost in unison to the last doubleding midshipman privettes last cast of the log and his last official act of his watch was to call out nine and a quarter knots sir nine and a quarter well reef tgallants should the wind come fresher mister ballard lewrie called out over the loud bustle of the sea and the sounds of creaking masts timbers and the groan of standing rigging but does it ease well go all to the royals very good sir lt ballard soberly answered though lewries last thought seemed to please the officers and hands who manned the quarterdeck they had a captain who was willing to press if weather allowed and let their frigate of which they were justifiably proud run like a thoroughbred whos the lucky devil wholl stay here and freeze lewrie asked with a merry smile on his face and tongue in his cheek me sir lt farley piped up ive the forenoon stay warm mister farley god help ye lewrie japed i will be below is there need for a pot of coffee round four bells do you send for it tkeep the people of your watch thawed out practice on the guns at two bells weather permitting mind ayeaye sir lt farley replied looking eager and thankful for the kind offer pettus helped him shed his hat muffler mittens and heavy fur coat once hed taken one last look about the decks with an experienced if rusty eye before trooping down the starboard gangway ladder to the upper deck then aft to the greatcabins he found one of his passengers count rybakov still seated at the dining table sipping tea which in the chilly cabins was visibly steaming he had been up on deck once theyd gotten the anchors up and stowed and had made their way into the st nicholas gat standing well aft by the taffrail lanthorns and flag lockers out of the way of working sailors to experience the departure his servant fyodor was fussing about him with some sweet biscuits from his personal stores a good beginning kapitan lewrie rybakov jovially enquired a splendid beginning sir my lord lewrie told him as he took a seat at the other end of the table another cup of coffee was set before him along with a plate of scrambled eggs speckled with bacon crumbles diced onion and melted cheese with it was a pipinghot heap of shredded fried potatoes and a goodly slice of the roast beef on which theyd dined the night before on a separate smaller plate lay two thick slices of buttered toast and the jam pot was close by lewrie rubbed his hands together to warm them as much as welcome his breakfast before spreading jam on his bread he took a first bite tastebuds tingling in anticipation and looked up at rybakov for a second dammit thisll get tryin lewrie thought feeling irked that anyone shared his table captains of his majestys warships were by dint of authority required to live apart from the rest of their crews and officers inviting them in for a meal only so often and spending the bulk of their time at sea in enforced isolation frankly there were times that one could relish such isolation and this was one of them it was rare that lewrie had anyone in for breakfast and he was used to eating by himself as the ships day began now here was this interloper that admiralty and foreign office had foisted off on him a sip of very hot coffee a forkful of eggs then a bite of the roast beef sauced with a bit of potatoes a second bite of bread and he could almost dismiss the noblemans presence if he made it plain he was concentrating on his victuals and wanted to be left in peace i was just thinking kapitan lewrie rybakov began to say burn in hell lewrie silently fumed i am hungry count levotchkin complained emerging at last from his sleeping space and stumbling towards the table he looked like deaths head on a mopstick and his elegant clothing was rumpled bonjour cher cousin count rybakov cheerily greeted him reverting to a russian aristocrats preferred french you ate without me levotchkin petulantly groused as he reeled into a chair with a dizzy thump we are moving at sea damn you boy he said snapping fingers at pettus i will have what the kapitan is having first fetch me tea pettus got a squinty clenchmouthed look and lewrie recalling why hed been sacked by his last employers worried that the tea might end in levotchkins hair he gave pettus a warning look you rose late anatoli rybakov gently chid him yes we are at sea on our way at last you slept through it amazing ill send word to the galley lewrie offered though i fear therell be a delay if the galley firesve been curbed and youll have to supply my cook with the makings whitsell run tell nettles hes another breakfast to prepare and the goods are on the way aye sir my tea levotchkin demanded head in both hands he looked round for his manservant sasha tea davai vite vite he snapped the big burly bald manservant went to the sideboard poured a cup and placed it before his master but just before he did so he peered long and hard at lewrie as if undergoing an epiphany not a glad one from the way he frowned as count levotchkin was having his first restorative sip sasha bent down to whisper in his ear all the while with his eyes glued on lewrie who was irked with such effrontery and put down his utensils to glare back mumble mumble london argeybargey panton ooleetsa lewrie could barely make out hisshisswhisper chi magazeena ooleetsa thats street chi thats tea lewrie translated from his thin stock of russian words in his head but what the hells a magazeena buzzlemuzzle strand sasha imparted in a raspy whisper as count levotchkin stiffened and sat up straighter da ya oovyerin the bruiser assured his master whatever the devil that last meant count levotchkin turned his head to glower at lewrie as well eyes as wide as a firstsaddled colt just before his face turned to stone and his eyes slitted the sides of his fine nose pulsed in and out to each audible angry breath as his visage paled his cheeks reddened panton street the strand tea whatever oh shit lewrie at last put together the little bastards set his beast tlurkin after tess and put two and two tgether saw us at the tea and pastry shop maybe thats what a magazeena is count levotchkin set his cup down in the saucer both rattling to the shaking of his hands but what is the matter anatoli count rybakov asked him in sudden concern you are ill should the ships doctor levotchkin answered him in a babbling flood of furious russian and french mixed neither of which lewrie could follow rybakov had difficulty too so rushed did the younger mans plaint spew out shto rybakov asked as levotchkin paused for breath viy oovyeryeni tojeh samayeh dyevooshka da ya oovyerin levotchkin replied snarling this time and glaring daggers at lewrie sasha is certain for he saw them him levotchkin accused lifting his chin to point up the table to his host my honour has been insulted and he must answer for it i must kill him he rose with a napkin in his right hand and began to advance on lewrie who shot his own chair back and stood ready to punch the fellow in the face if he dared issue a challenge with a napkin not a glove stoi rybakov barked i forbid this anatoli sit down do nothing remember our mission rybakov then launched into a tirade in russianno french which might be shared with anyone else this timeand went so far as to lay a restraining hand on levotchkins right arm obey me in this anatoli obey me levotchkin uttered a growl of frustration shaking off his kinsmans hand he threw the napkin at lewrie missing wide then to the astonishment of everyone gave out a howl an inarticulate bellow akin to the sound a hound might make over the corpse of its master i refuse to share these rooms with the man levotchkin vowed i will not dine with him drink with him breathe the same air thatll save my spirit store lewrie inanely thought anatoli that would be imposs rybakov chid him damn him damn him to hades levotchkin cried spinning on his heels and stomping aft to his partitionedoff bedspace slamming the louvred slat door and making the flimsy deal and canvas partitions come nigh to collapsing like a tent well rybakov softly said in the immense silence kapitan i must apologise for my cousins manners but he feels that you give him great insult over a young lady not quite a lady no my lord lewrie said with a wry grin as he sat back down to resume his cooling breakfast the girl in questions adenizen of mother batsons brothel in panton street for whom he took a fancy a prostitute rybakov asked looking appalled as he sat down in his own chair at the other end of the table a common whore well i wouldnt call her common no my lord lewrie said and laid out for count rybakov the entire scenario from meeting tess to the last morning in the strand perversions included he was not set upon by thieves rybakov mused aloud eyebrows up in wonder no wonder he explained his wounds differently but he really treated the poor girl so badly afraid so my lord lewrie told him dabbing his lips with a napkin after hed eaten his last morsel and asked pettus for another cup of coffee she was afraid for her life had she known had i known that his man sasha was lurking to discover who else might be sporting with her or meeting her outside the establishment i doubt shed have ever dared step out the door til she was sure that count levotchkin had left england but hes so devout rybakov insisted anatoli never misses a service even in london at the few orthodox churches no matter how mean the neighbourboods hes a pure son of mother russia or so i thought lord what will his mother say or the young lady to whom he is affianced in saint petersburg a young lady of one of the finest families in our aristocracy he has such a promising future a colonelcy in one of the most distinguished cavalry regiments assured of a place at the tsars court as soon as we return knew it lewrie told himself devout and a cavalryman theyre sure tbe secret bastards every time happens in the best of families lewrie commented just look at our own aristocracy the earl of sandwich for instance simply brilliant first lord of the admiralty but a founding member of the hellfire club orgies in the old undercroft of his restored abbey at medmenham then preached in dominee clothes of a sunday to hundreds of cats his farm workersd round up and herd into the chapel mostly against fornication he added with a droll expression lewrie knew all there was to know about the hellfire club his father sir hugo st george willoughby had been a member too i will speak to him rybakov offered as if that might mollify the young hothead now i know the circumstances i will point out to him the ludicrous cause for his grudge even so for a few days arrangements can be made to limit your contact with him if he wishes to take the air on the quarterdeck hell have to wait til im below lewrie said calmly stirring sugar into his cup if he doesnt wish to dine with me he can take his meals aft in his little sleepingspace ill not give up my cabins my table my chartspace or my desk or daycabin settee does he loathe me that much he will just have to take pains to avoid me my lord you will not duel him rybakov said not a request that will be up to him my lord lewrie evenly replied as he laid aside his spoon and lifted his cup does he not heed you and accost me issue a formal challenge then my own honour is put in question and there can be but one answer sadly i understand kapitan lewrie count rybakov mournfully said his face twisted up as grievous as a hanged spaniel outta the fryin pan into the fire lewrie queasily thought as he took another sip of coffee all outward calm to an impartial observer mine arse on a bandbox hell challenge me before we reach russia sure as fate too damned proud an arrogant tdo else christ am i tdie over a whore he allowed a wee grin to lift his mouth for a second evrybody said id come to a bad end he reminded himself midshipman o th watch sah the marine sentry by the door barked come lewrie bade the second officers duty sir midshipman furlow announced hat under his arm and im to tell you that the winds come more westerly fine on our larboard quarter and he requests permission to alter course a point northerly my compliments to mister farley and inform him to do so i will come to the quarterdeck just for the air mister furlow he formally replied grinning as he uttered his last thought as he dressed for the cold lewrie could not help thinking that could thermopylae fly with the wings of hermes the messenger and get to russia by the next dawn this voyage this mission of his would still feel like an eternity da ya oovyerin yes im sure shto what viy oovyereni tojeh samayeh dyevooshka you are sure the same young woman chapter thirtyone four days in blustery grey weather with the winds whipping cold and occasionally spitting rain sleet or fat flakes of snow and hms thermopylae bowling along like a cambridge coach and they were shaving a lowlying coast to starboard which emerged as ephemeral as mist just round dawn quite good for dead reckoning lewrie told mr lyle the sailing master as the shore of the danish island of jutland appeared solid at last they had not been able to take sunsights to determine their position or their progress but just how far along mister lyle i do believe we are beyond the cape east of thisted sir lyle cautiously allowed a mittened finger pointing along the chart pinned to the traverse board by the binnacle cabinet do you concur captain hardcastle indeed i do mister lyle captain lewrie the experienced merchant master said bustling closer to the chart to employ his own finger that long coast yonder is called the jammerbugt and the port of hirstals lies beyond our starboard bows no more than fifty or sixty miles next day will see us off the skaw does the wind cooperate he added moving his finger on to the mouth of the kattegat and the entrance to the baltic where we turn south lewrie said beyond that sirs what is your estimate of the time itll take to reach the narrows twixt denmark and sweden well thatll take much longer than the crossing sir capt hardcastle was quick to say perhaps to take temporary precedence over a navy sailing master the baltic has no tides but the currents and when an outflowing current coincides with a sutherly wind sirmr lyle was just as quick to trample his way back to dominanceyou face a dead muzzler and might as well anchor til one on the other changes not so bad in the kattegat sir hardcastle rejoined as we would be in open waters but more noticeable as we close with the narrows tween helsingшr the bards elsinore and the swedish side and the forts at helsingborg thats where the outflowing current will be strongest and the very worst place to be reduced to a crawl lewrie said with a grumble rubbing a mittened hand on his unshaven chin which rasped against the wool or come to anchor damme but thats really narrow lewrie thought he borrowed a divider from the binnacle cabinet and set its needlesharp points upon the charts distance scale then walked the divider from the swedish side of the narrows to the danishhe came up with a width of only two miles plus eight hundred yards this bloody shoal right in the middle sirs lewrie asked his sailing master and civilian adviser jabbing a finger at the long and skinny northtosouth shallows indicated smackdab down the centre of the passage the ah disken shoal he made out from the smallish letters on the chart might it force us to choose which side of the narrows to take oh no sir capt hardcastle chuckled for though it can be a bother to the biggest deepestladen ships in the baltic trade when the winds been blowing for a week or longer stiff mind outta the south most times even a first rate could sail right down the middle of the narrows right atop it ye only draw about seventeen or eighteen foot so you should have no problem with it uhm perhaps sir mr lyle cautioned almost by reflex or just to be contrary with a civilians opinion as he says sir with a following wind several days of norwesterlies there should be more than sufficient depth cross the disken shoal uhum was lewries terse comment to that information though he still fretted about the forts on the swedish side and the massive kronborg castle on the danish side of the narrows both built at the very narrowest points designed to cooperate to close the strait with their artillery it wouldnt do lewrie thought to voice open concerns about how heavy were the cannon on each shore not before any of his officers or men for now well just have to hope for northerly winds and steer a diplomatic course right down the centre of the narrows gentlemen favouring neither side hmm will both you men join me below in my cabins for a moment mister fox you have the deck ayeaye sir the third officer replied now about these damned forts lewrie said in the relative warmth of his cabins all three of them crowded into the small chartspace to pore over his own recently purchased copy of the chart theyd studied on deck have you ever had cause to visit kronborg castle captain hardcastle seen their armaments oh ive anchored under its foot a time or two sir but ive never had a tour of the place hardcastle admitted warming his hands round a china mug of hot coffee which pettus had produced for them all townfolkll tell anyone who asks though that theyve over eighty or ninety heavy guns right proud of them they are an odd measure of metal though sir i believe they said they were thirtysix pounders not thirtytwos praps the danish pound is greater than anyone elses or they just cast them to their own tastes lets assume theyre roughly equal to a thirtytwo pounder lewrie allowed picking his own divider from its velvetlined box of navigational tools rangetorandomshot for a thirtytwo is about a mile and a half he muttered as he scribed two halfcircles on the chart assume the swedes mount much the same calibre guns too so damme that aint pretty he thought for right in the middle of the narrows the overlap from kronborg castle and its swedish equivalent formed a long sharppointed oval where roundshot perhaps even heated shot could hammer thermopylae from both sides and no frigate ever launched was built to withstand a pummelling that massive a lone frigate as good as opposed by an entire squadron of ships of the line turning the dividers upanddown the narrows instead of righttoleft he stepped off the distance from the northern end of the overlapping fire to the southern one and threequarter miles all told average speed of the outflowing current captain hardcastle he asked uhm anywhere from two to four knots sir depending on the winds from the south or thereabouts hardcastle guessed so with a followin wind and two knots of current say we could make six knots over the ground lewrie puzzled out stepping off that assumed crawl whichd mean wed be under fire for at least twenty minutes do the swedes and the danes refuse us passage cant assume more than six knots altogether as anything more than whistlin in the wind well do the swedes not cooperate with the danes sir mister lyle contributed we could sidle over towards helsingborg and limit our exposure to the danish guns have to assume the worst there too mister lyle so lets say we barge down the narrows atop the disken shoal equidistant from either shore and endure the fire from both forts twenty minutes or more of it captain hardcastle he suddenly asked sir the fort at helsingborg looks much smaller than the danes lewrie said with a sly rise of a brow ever anchor under their guns or put in there to wait for a good wind home a time or two aye sir hardcastle told him and it is a smaller place with fewer guns i gathered never thought to ask how heavy they were for the swedes are a peaceful sort mostly dull as ditchwater folk for the most part too fair but sharp traders when it come to dickering over stores and victuals why the last war they had with russia i dont even think helsingborg ever had to fire one shot most of the war took place much further east in the baltic on swedens eastern coast poor bastards and when you anchored close to kronborg castle lewrie eagerly pressed did you ever see them practicing with their artillery why i cant say that i have captain lewrie hardcastle said with a hesitant smile and a shake of his head i been sailing the baltic trade man and boy nigh on thirty years and but for watching them fire salutes to passing warships i cant recall them ever practicing after all the danesve been at peace with the world for over eighty years slap down the middle itll be then gentlemen lewrie said amazing lyle and hardcastle by the broad smile that accompanied his decision and devil take the hindmost eighty years dye say captain hardcastle why they couldnt hit westminster cathedral if it was anchored in midstream between em a frigates a small moving target to gunners who havent fired anything more than salutin charges since well i cant rightly recall which historical event and rangetorandomshot with us in midchannel would be about sixteen hundred and fifty yards then are you correct mister lyle and the swedish forts dont chime in we can edge over closer to their shores making things even more difficult for danish guns at maximum elevation mine arse on a bandbox gentlemen things might get noisy but i doubt if they score a single hit before were past their reach nobody shared his enthusiasm of course no one huzzahed or for that matter looked inspired and relieved well the cats did as they leapt atop the chart on the angled desk drawn by the sounds of people engaged in something useful and determined to take part or put a stop to it the much spryer chalky sprang to the middle of the chart in one go and began sniffing about toulon ever more awkward even as a kitten took a couple of tries before he alit on the edge of the table and sprawled to expose his belly for a petting at once mr lyle stepped back a pace though capt hardcastle reached out to stroke toulons fur with a fond smile lewrie put the dividers back into the box with the rest of his brass instruments with chalky pouncing on busy hands for a playfight always been fond of ships cats hardcastle told them keep the ships rats in check mr lyle dourly allowed then whatd the midshipmen eat lewrie japed rolling chalky over to give him belly rubs and engage in a contest to see which was faster his hand or sharp little teeth and halfsheathed claws crash went something made of glass from aft of the greatcabin droogoy shampanskayeh sasha count levotchkin demanded ya hachoo bolsheh davai sasha davai christ lewrie swore under his breath by my reckonin its his third bottle since breakfast must live on champagne of a certainty the number of crates scattered round the cabins had diminished noticeably since departing yarmouth roads most of them filled with an assortment of bottles from sherry to schnapps to vodka another for mister eadess marines for target practice sir mr lyle said with distaste and the woods welcome in the galley lt eades had snapped up any bottle he could find from their guests and the gunroom to hang at the end of the topsl yardarms and let his marines try their eye at them with single shots not volleys at practice at small arms even with a smoothbore short navy pattern tower musket lt eades had proved himself to be a fine shot and expected every one of his marines to be as well or else its been my experience sir that russians have a grand capacity for spirits capt hardcastle said intent upon the pleasant chore of stroking toulon the bigger blackandwhite tom who was now purring loud enough to beat the band and squirming in utter delight it keeps em warm in winter id imagine lewrie jested or too addled to notice the cold mr lyle added smirking that young counts man that sasha capt hardcastle said i seen his sort before a real russian peasant the sort who boasts he never buttons his coat to the throat no matter how cold it gets and like all of em meaner than a den full of bears when in drink a run ashore in russia during the trading season is done warily captain lewrie and polite smiles to one and all else some raging drunk takes umbrage and rips your liver out dont imagine well have that pleasure this voyage lewrie said back putting the box of navigation instruments away hark i think lieutenant eades is already at practice sure enough overhead on the quarterdeck came a ragged volley fired from the taffrails at something tossed overboard and bobbing in the frigates wake by the sound of it second rank level eades cried and they could hear the shuffling of booted feet as the front rank of ten fell back to reload and reprime whilst the second rank of ten stepped forward to take aim second rank fire dammit if their russian guests private quarters did not take up most of the after portions of the greatcabins lewrie might have been tempted to dash to the transom sashwindows to see how they were doing evidently none too well by the exasperation in lt eadess voice lets go on deck and watch the show lewrie suggested third rank present level and dont shoot like youve emptied the bottle first ready fire eades was snapping ten brown bess muskets barked and a flurry of small waterspouts erupted within a couple of feet of the empty bottle now slowly bobbing further astern almost out of accurate range of a musket which even on solid ground ashore could not attain much more surety of shot than fifty or sixty yards damn lt eades spat again brought up his own musket took quick aim and fired the dogs jaws holding the flint snapped against the frizzens raspy surface the powder in the priming pan went pop and an eyeblink later the fire in the pan transmitted down the tiny hole to the barrel where the main charge exploded with a louder bang eadess lead ball plunked only inches to the right of the empty bottle damn he muttered in frustration though that sort of accuracy from a moving ship at a moving target so small would have allowed lt eades to hit an enemy anywhere he wished in chest bowels or the head in musket shot range between ships therell be another bottle coming mister eades lewrie drolly assured him courtesy of our russian gentlemen damned close shootin by the by thankee sir though i shouldve made allowance for the wind lt eades said pulling his lowered musket to halfcock to reload for himself captain sir midshipman tillyard said doffing his hat as he approached them at the taffrails mister foxs duty and he asks may count rybakov come to the quarterdeck sir lewrie turned to look forrud and spotted the elegantly warmly dressed count rybakov just peeking over the deck edge a few steps up the larboard gangway ladder with an expectant smile on his face brows up in query and a long firearm slung over one shoulder my compliments to mister fox and aye count rybakov may mount the quarterdeck lewrie told him good morning kapitan lewrie count rybakov cheerfully said as he reached them rightaft i hear the shooting and i cannot resist the wish to practice i may be allowed but of course my lord lewrie agreed lieutenant eades is exercising his men ten at a time so i hope you dont mind firing as they reload tween volleys ah but i must reload myself kapitan at leisure for i am not drilled to speed as are your marines rybakov graciously admitted and my rifled piece takes more time i would be delighted to observe the slight delay ah ha lewrie and eades marvelled over the rifled weapon that rybakov took down from his shoulder and let them paw over it was based upon a german jaeger hunting rifle though made by one of the most skilled gunsmiths in paris the barrel was a highly polished blue octagon of almost four feet length with gilt inlays and a gold bead for aiming the barrel bands the ramrod and the lock plate the pan frizzen and dogs jaws were bright steel also elaborately engraved and inlaid with gold and all was set into a stock of highly polished and glossy burlwood with a steel patchbox built into the righthand side of the butt a most handsome piece of work sir lt eades said in awe and with a hint of severe envy what calibre may i ask sixtynine calibre the same as a french musket the merry count replied beaming with pride of ownership sadly most of my hunting at home in russia does not involve a rifle except for bears wild boar is our main quarry and that is done on horseback with the lance with the sword for the coup de grвce and a pair of large pistols does the boar unhorse me ha ha there are not as many of the great stags as there were before in my youth and with them i must use the rifled hunter frenchmade you say sir eades asked one hopes that they do not become enamoured of rifled weapons for general issue to their armies theres not an army in the world can afford them lewrie said slow to load as the good count says might mean only one volley per minute and to rifle an hundred thousand barrels would make them too expensive and slow their delivery to the troops in the field think of my own breechloading ferguson riflemusket you have one sir lt eades openly gawped in wonder why i doubt there were a thousand ever made my late fatherinlaw in north carolina and major patrick ferguson were acquaintances and mr chiswick bought enough to equip a regiment more like a halfbattalion really of north carolina loyalist volunteers i got mine at yorktown during the siege he told them you have it here aboard ship sir eades asked in lust aye i do lewrie said mister tillyard he called to the senior midshipman of the watch pass word for my coxn desmond for him to fetch up my ferguson rifle and all the necessaries in the meantime though lieutenant eades count do continue with target practice ill jump in when desmond brings mine up over the taffrails went another empty bottle of champagne mostlike count levotchkins latest dead soldier along with a wee barrel not much larger than a mopbucket now drained of an ordinary wine first rank level lt eades ordered as the targets bobbed astern to about thirty yards take aim fire much better he congratulated as the small barrel was bracketed by balls and set to spinning by two actual hits ahem count rybakov announced as he raised his jaeger to his shoulder took careful aim and squeezed the surelylight trigger a split second later the flash in the pan and the explosion of the powder charge went popbang almost together and the wood barrel leaped as it was hit one narrow stave driven completely in huzzah the marines and onlookers could not help exclaiming at the old fellows accuracy oh it is no great thing rybakov modestly said as he lowered the rifle and drew the lock back to halfcock at fourty yards that is still an easy shot now when the little barrel is further away that is the challenge nestce pas not so yer rifle an things sor desmond announced as the second rank of marines tried their eye at the receding barrel carry on mister eades lewrie urged wishing them to continue whilst the bottle and barrel were still within range and not waste any precious time gawking over his ferguson lewrie pulled the lock back to halfcock and tore the top foldover flap of a paper cartridge with his teeth to sprinkle a small amount into the pan one turn round went the trigger guard and handgrip rotating the large screw below the end of the barrel into which he crammed the paper cartouche the ballend first another single turn to raise the screw upwards and the barrel was sealed and ready for firing the second rank of marines had fired at the barrel now bobbing and rocking about sixty yards astern lewrie brought the ferguson up to his cheek pulled the lock to fullcock took aim drew one breath and slowly let it out then gently squeezed the trigger hoping for the best in point of fact for it had been months since he had fired a single shot at practice and nigh a year since he had even thought of using the ferguson popbang and his shot was in the wind goodun sir eades enthused for lewrie had clipped the barrel right on the top raising a tiny cloud of wood splinters encouraged and in a mood to show off lewrie went through the loading process again showing how a breechloader could get off at least three or four rounds a minute within fifteen seconds his second shot went off with the barrel over seventyfive yards astern this time and he hit it again pardon count rybakov cried stepping up to the taffrails for a shot of his own almost at once and clipping the barrels lid driving a large visible hole in the thin slab of wood ah ha were forgettin the bottle sir lewrie said rapidly loading for a third shot its what an hundred yards by now one of your guineas kapitan rybakov teased going red in the face as he primed his pan poured powder down the barrel and set a lead ball atop a paperthin oiled leather patch at the muzzle of his jaeger and strained to drive it down to rest against the powder why the devil not lewrie asked himself ready to fire again i can afford a little flutter and plead navypay poverty if hes as good as i think he is a guinea dye say my lord done and done lewrie replied with a grin and a shrug first honours to you when youre ready ha count rybakov laughed with glee for his wager to be accepted as he stepped to the taffrails and brought his jaeger rifle up to his shoulder once more over one hundred yards now so count rybakov seemed to mutter cautions to himself in french taking his own sweet time before barely touching that oversensitive trigger popbang and a tiny feather of spray arose barely a foot or so short of the champagne bottle grazing over the neck and clipping the mouth of the bottle off my stars sir what a shot lt eades whooped your turn kapitan rybakov said quite pleased with himself and his moment of adulation well all right then lewrie said frowning in concentration as he stepped to the taffrails and took aim rybakovs shot had set the bottle rocking like a lunatic duck and it was nigh yards astern by then he held a touch high loosening his knees to spring with the motion of the ship and absorb all the uncertainties in his lower body here goes my guinea he told himself firing at last dead on my word lt eades shouted shot the neck not the body clean off sir well i was aimin for the biggest part lewrie said in seeming modesty though secretly amazed that hed hit it at all another bottle my lord lewrie asked the count no kapitan lewrie rybakov guffawed i cede the field to a sharper eye than mine he said digging into a waistcoat pocket for a coin and handing over a golden guinea did we continue i imagine you would end up winning even my jaeger rifle when i am reduced to a sad state of poverty urrah he cried taking lewrie in a bear hug and dancing him round the deck another bottle da someone snarled i have it here will you match shots with me angliski kapitan count levotchkin had come on deck had mounted to the quarterdeck despite lt foxs cautions to not do so without permission and had shoulderbludgeoned his way past the afterguard and the rear ranks of marines instead of a rifle he held a bottle of champagne in each hand and his man sasha behind him carried two polished wood boxes of pistols empty are they lewrie asked with one brow up in mockery does not matter lovotchkin snapped swaying more than necessary to the motion of the ship one bottle was open and he raised it to his lips to drink from the neck no one ever drinks spirits on deck my lord lewrie told him with sterness and most especially never in front of the crew when theyre limited to their rum rations at set times count rybakov do oblige me to inform your compatriot that he is violating the discipline of my ship and should take himself and his champagne below at once whatever count rybakov urgently angrily said to his younger relative mattered no more than water to a ducks back for levotchkin just sneered swayed and took another deep drink pistol sasha he demanded reaching behind his back without looking his manservant handed him a sleek duelling pistol taking the offhand champagne bottle in exchange so levotchkin could cock it with the back of his wrist then throw the bottle from which hed drunk high into the air with a feral cry the young count rushed to the taffrails shoving people out of his way frankly making everyone scamper to avoid the cocked pistol which he handled so breezily and dangerously he looked astern then took a duellists stance feet wide apart one hand on his hip body turned sideways to make the slimmest target for an opponent and fired the bottle about twenty yards astern was hit of course and count levotchkin turned to look at lewrie with triumph on his face cruelly smiling to make his drunken point he raised the empty pistol to his mouth and blew across the muzzle then pointed it directly at lewrie and barked pom to imitate the bark of a pistol now see here you lt eades shouted put him in irons sir threaten our captain will you a bottle sasha lewrie said raising a hand to still the ire of his crew and a pistol he looked at the brute who glared back neath heavy beetled brows snorting at the effrontery sasha looked to his master matching levotchkins toplofty sneer seechas yob tvoyemat lewrie barked in a fair approximation of eudoxias father now fuck your mother he added in english so everyone would know what hed said in poor russian lewrie jerked his gaze from sasha to levotchkin savouring the looks of utter surprise on their faces the manservant looked again to his master for instruction the count shrugged and nodded sure of himself or too drunk to care with a growl of displeasure the servant opened the box and handed lewrie the mate to levotchkins pistol it too was french lewrie took note as he quickly examined it longbarreled and slim and worth a fortune in its own right the mouth of the barrel revealed the crispcut rifling lewrie drew the lock back to halfcock freed the frizzen and pan cover and saw that it was already primed you keep loaded weapons in my cabins sir he asked in a voice loud enough to carry to every curious ear from officer to cabin boy that is something else i will not tolerate from a guest count levotchkin hear me plain do ye sir he demanded that was met by yet another sneer bottle if you please he said to sasha no dont hand it to me toss it high and hard as you can understand ponyimayu and for gods sake dont fuck this up lewrie chid himself as the brute drew his arm back hed always been a betterthanaverage wingshot and when up the mississippi to spy out spanish new orleans hed reaped his share of wild ducks with a musket had even tried his eye at potting turtles resting on logs on the banks and shooting offhand at thrown bottles with that trading fellow with the panton leslie and company throw it lewrie snapped sasha gave a great heave worthy of a weighted messenger line or a grapnel tween ships the bottle soared aloft and astern tumbling endforend lewrie raised his pistol and took aim leading it as it fell and pabang as the pistol bucked in his hand and the ball hit the bottle shattering it ten feet above the ships wake and at least ten to twelve yards astern and just thankee jesus lewrie thought as the ship erupted in cheers so long as i dont have tdo that twice in the same day or year he brought the pistol to his face blew across the muzzle and smiled at count levotchkin who had gone about crosseyed in disappointment then opened the pan and blew the last smoke and soot out of it as well lewrie cocked one brow then tossed the emptied pistol to the stunned young nobleman who all but lost it overside before snagging a finger in the trigger guard lieutenant eades ill thankee to discharge the rest of his pistols for me lewrie said turning to his marine officer and i must request count rybakov that any other firearms in my greatcabins are to be unloaded and locked away my lord id dislike for an accident to occur but of course kapitan lewrie count rybakov gravely replied taking a second to glare at his drunken young relation you have my utmost assurance that it will be done well then lewrie said clapping his hands together thatll do me for the day carry on with small arms practice mister eades ayeaye sir droogoy shampanksayeh ya hachoo bolsheh davai another champagne sasha i want another quickly chapter thirtytwo hms thermopylae passed the long narrow point of the skaw in a light snowstrom and altered course for the sound under reduced sail even so with the wind blustering and shifting to the nornorwest she still scudded along at a good eight knots all that next day and night with the wind from out of the arctic pressing her onwards into a grey swirling mystery with the horizon blanketed out from view aloft from the masttoplookouts or the extra lookouts posted in the bows icycold sailors manned the lead lines casting from the foremast channels for the shoaling water that would warn them of their nearness to the eastwest lying island of laeso which they hoped to pass well clear to the eastrd of it but in the swirling snow as thick as a fog in the thames estuary at times then clearing for tantalising minutes before closing down again like heavy window drapes the best warning of anything ahead was limited to mere hundreds of yards thermopylaesteered roughly sousoueast by dead reckoning of course as if in a phantasmical christmas village a ship sailing off the wind could rarely go any faster than the wind itself so there was little of the usual keening and rushing from the running and standing rigging in the smothering blanket of snow even the usual sounds of the working hull or the hissroar of her passage through the sea was muffled and the frigate was regularly dusted with fat and heavy wet flakes that softened her warlike nature even her bruteiron artillery bore an inch or more piled atop the barrels and wood carriages best we dont let it pile up mister ballard lewrie told his first officer id admire did ye break out brooms and such and sweep her down every hour i will see to it directly sir lt ballard replied gravely sombre and fo rmal as usual a snowball came flying aft from the starboard gangway near the foremast stays and splatted midshipman pannabaker square in the chest midshipman plumb their cheekiest whooped with glee over his aim you may reply with one round mister pannabaker lewrie said mister plumb sir yes you sir i saw that now stand still and prepare to receive pannabaker quickly stooped to scoop up a heaping handful packing and shaping it round and round in his mittened hands much like a guncaptain would select the roundest and smoothest roundshot from the shotracks or rope garlands for his first longrange broadside this shot would be a tad slushy lewrie noted as pannabaker drew back to throw he got his fourteenyearold catercousin plumb just beneath the chin nigh staggering him and knocking his hat off the next throwll put the thrower at the masttop til i feel like lettin him come down lewrie loudly warned in a softer voice he said to pannabaker good shot young sir and tipped him a wink no bottom tthis line the starboard leadsman cried out as he began to haul in his icywet coils of line and the plumb weight as lt ballard and the bosun called for sweepers lewrie turned to walk to the large doublewheel and the binnacle cabinet and chart pinned to the traverse board where both mr lyle the sailing master and capt hardcastle fretted and ahummed no landfall yet sirs lewrie prodded them nossir hardcastle commented and im not sure why even by both our dead reckonings we should be close to laeso but it might be prudent sir to alter course to east soueast mr lyle suggested the kattegat is both wide and deep enough for us to have searoom all the way to the swedish coast which has enough depth for a third rate quite close to shore in that way we could skirt well clear of this island in all this snow or do like the vikings did in their day hardcastle said as he pulled a large red calico handkerchief from a pocket and blew his nose quite loudly and what was it that the vikings did captain hardcastle mr lyle asked a dubious brow up in case he was being twitted oh they lowered their sail slowstroked the banks of oars and put a fellow in the bows ahollering odin til they got an echo off the shore hardcastle told him with a grin mister ballard lewrie said bring us round two points more to the east and mister pannabaker go below and pass word for the master gunner mister tunstall he is to fetch up a swivel and powder charges only to mount up forrud ayeaye sir midshipman pannabaker replied eyes wide in wonder at what his captain might have in mind as he dashed for the starboard gangway ladder to the main deck he almost collided with count rybakov swathed in his heaviest furs scarf gloves and felt hat permission to take the air on the quarterdeck kapitan lewrie he asked come up my lord lewrie bade him with a grim smile intent on peering forrud as if he could squint hard enough to pierce the swirls of snow and wondering who aboard had the stoutest lungs should they be reduced to crying god bless king george from the bows before mr tunstall was ready a thick day my lord lewrie commented to rybakov oh this is nothing compared to a russian winter kapitan count rybakov said with a laugh and a deprecating shrug there the winds howl days on end and the snow comes down so quickly that a man who stands still for a minute or two can be buried in it ha ha uhm do you think it would permissible for me to smoke kapitan rybakov asked reaching deep into a side pocket of his sleek fur coat to pull out a cigar dont think theres much of a fire risk today my lord do go ahead lewrie told him you will join me kapitan lewrie rybakov offered never developed the habit thankee lewrie replied watching as mr tunstall with two more gunners and a powder monkey emerged from the midships companionway ladder with a swivel stanchion mount and gun tools rybakov snapped bare fingers to summon his manservant fyodor who produced a tinderbox flashed the flint to raise sparks til the rag took light then offered it to the tip of his masters cigar once it was afire fyodor bobbed a bow and scampered away you will sound for the shore of laeso island yes rybakov enquired happily puffing away and producing a flavourful cloud of tobacco smoke that only slowly drifted forward towards the crossdeck quarterdeck nettings and hammock storage the baltic is quite often foggy in all seasons so i recognise what you intend louder than shoutin odin as captain hardcastle tells me the vikings of old did my lord lewrie agreed who became the russ kapitan rybakov breezily babbled on for it was vikings who entered the rivers from the baltic and founded my country who brought the trade goods from all round the world which they sailed mister tunstalls duty sir and he says he is ready to fire midshipman pannabaker reported uhm at what sir at the snow off the starboard bows mister pannabaker lewrie told him slow and steady and hes to listen close for an echo off the land a round every two minutes tell him with my compliments oh ayeaye sir pannabaker said whirling away still befuddled to bear the order to the master gunner once mister tunstall is ready to fire mister ballard lewrie further instructed have the bosun pipe the still so there will be no extraneous noises very good sir ballard answered sounding even stiffer than normal as if he wished to sniff at the oddness damme hes a good friend was lewrie thought with a brief flush of irritation so whats bitin him ready sir tunstall cried aft bosun pipe still lt ballard snapped and the crew froze in place eyes turned aft in query as mr dimmock tweetled the short call which was a rarity aboard thermopylae other ships in the navy might be run by martinets who demanded utter silence during every evolution and manoeuvre with twitched lines and singlenote peeps from bosuns calls to relay orders but so far thermopylae had not been one of them not under good old capt speaks god bless him and not under their new captain who was beginning to win them over carry on mister tunstall lewrie ordered the swivel gun barked like a lap dog in the relative silence huffing a thick cloud of yellowgrey powder smoke over the starboard catheads the aftermath seeming to roll off into soft steady snow like a departing spook but there was no echo i have taken charge of all our firearms kapitan lewrie the genial older aristocrat told him in a stage whisper leaning close to wreathe both of them in cigar smoke for a second good was lewries muttered comment my apologies rifled duellings pistols count rybakov went on face twisted with a grimace of distaste and an exaggerated shiver i did not know such is pah explains my lucky shot lewrie said grimly shrugging trying to make light of it though appalled as was count rybakov lt eades and every other man aboard who aspired to the title gentleman the code duello of every civilised country even the irish where honour was defended with swords or pistols abhorred rifled weapons as a sign of a coward seeking unfair advantage there were gunsmiths in england who would rifle the back three or four inches of an eightinch barrel for a customer deep enough so that even a mans seconds or the judges were fooled usually only one of a matched pair with the coward armed for accurate murder and his unsuspecting foe reduced to the limited accuracy of a proper smoothbore it wasnt strictly against the lawyetbut it was the social ruin of any socalled gentleman who tried i do not wish to admit my family produces a coward then say no more of it my lord lewrie whispered back do recall the old british adage the least said the soonest mended spassiba kapitan lewrie count rybakov replied thank you ready again capm sir tunstall shouted fire away mister tunstall and everyone perk yer ears up the pounder swivel gun yapped again wreathing tunstall and his assistants in a slowmoving belch of sour rottenegg stench the report rolled away fading fading like a hardsought whisper and thumumum came the faint reply there sir lt farley said in a harsh urgent whisper one hand cupped behind his right ear and pointing off about three points off the starboard bows seemed to come from there a point more easterly mister ballard lewrie snapped fire another mister tunstall quickly bottom at twenny fathom the starboard leadsman cried twenny fathom tthis line there which produced a brief scramble over the chart mr lyle and capt hardcastle almost knocking their heads together to trace the fathom lines for the closest to twenty bark from the swivel gun a shorter pause this time then the slightly louder thumum echoing back more like four points off the starboard bows this time sir lt farley cheered hark he added head cocked in confusion do i hear seals mister farley lewrie face split in a broad grin even as an eldritch shiver went up and down his spine the barking of seals easternmost tip of laeso then sir the sailing master was first to tumble out for most of the islands shore is steepto and the eastern tip is the onliest place where the twentyfive fathom line lies close ashore shallows to rock and sand beaches it does sir hardcastle was quick to add and with so few poor fisherman livin on the isle tis always been a haunt for seals haunt indeed sir lewrie said snatching up a day glass from the binnacle cabinet and stepping to the starboard bulwarks damme but i like seals he added lifting the telescope to his right eye as if on orders from on high from lir the old celtic sea god and the ancient pagan pantheon the snow squall thinned of a sudden revealing a rocky lowlying shore bleak and snowdusted with only a few dark green patches of pine and stunted bush and a dark taupe beach filled by sleek darkfurred seals ripplerunning on fins into the sea thirty fathom there the leadsman hallooed unmistakable relief in his voice thirty fathom tthis line secure mister tunstall lewrie shouted forward shuddering with secret delight and laughing weve found our unknown island wouldnt have believed it had i not just seen it lt farley could be heard to mutter and shared a meaningful glance with the others on the quarterdeck behind lewries back small as his entourage was when hed come aboard as irish and mythridden as liam desmond and patrick furfy were and as inclined to talk about the new captains exploits the arcane details of capt ramcat lewrie had been passed in whispers belowdecks first among the hands then filtered aft among the warrants and officers lewrie and seals selkies and the blessing of his doings by their appearances such as the time he stole all those black slaves in the west indies and the seals had swum out alongside the liberated and their liberators the warnings that had come to commander lewrie about the serbian pirates in the adriatic the geas the good cess that west country and irish sailors said had been bestowed upon a lucky ship a lucky captain and his defence of the right the captains seals midshipman pannabaker managed to squeak from a tight throat as the seals flooded like a dark brown carpet into the faint surf and swam swiftly out towards thermopylae small heads bobbing up then diving under uttering houndlike harks some of them leaping clear of the water like flying fish and it was so uncanny he felt like tearing up were they summoned to us he had to wonder lewrie lowered the telescope and compacted it back into itself stuck it in a pocket of his fur coat then leaned on the bulwarks most lubberlylike as thermopylae cleared laeso by a wider and wider margin and still the seals came on off the starboard quarter almost to amidships off the beam with a stronger few swimming and leaping almost against the bows and the outer edge of the bow wave and wake sailors now released from the still crowded the gangways to peer down at the seals who now raised a chorus of barks that put everyone in mind of a pack of pups glad to see their owner return up the cottage lane after a days absence at his labours great brown eyes wetly ashine under long lashes peered up at the frigate whiskers on muzzles twitched in what seemed like joy as they barked and most eerily a few of them halfrolled onto their sides to wave flippers at them all eyes went to the new captain who was smiling fit to bust as he waved back to them a long moment more and thermopylae began to outdistance them and leave them behind to gambol and leap in their wake and the seal pack turned away towards their rock beach a gust of icy arctic wind arose keening in the rigging as the frigate now on a broad reach instead of a landsmans breeze from right aft like the shriek of fast flying spirits the rising wind brought a blizzard of thicker fatter softer snowflakes that blotted out the decks for another long minute and when it thinned and the gust faded there were no seals to be seen as if theyd never been their barks from the beach on laeso could still be heard but give it one turn of the halfhour glass mister ballard then come about to sousoueast again lewrie ordered still half lost in reverie and pleasure theres still the small isle of anholt ahead but we should be able to leave it well clear off our starboard it is much smaller is it not mister lyle captain hardcastle easier to miss pray god lewrie japed in happy takings of a sudden after days of tension and reinedback strife the sound and the narrows round dawn tomorrow do you gentlemen believe aye sir mr lyle said while capt hardcastle could only nod and gulp still too awed to trust his voice and lewrie turned away to pace over to the larboard rails now the windward side and his alone for as long as he was on deck seals dont do that hardcastle muttered i been past laeso hundreds of times and whenever the seals are present they usually go ashore tget away from a ship passing too close to them this was a rare occurrence gentlemen count rybakov enquired having enjoyed the seals appearance as only a pleasing happenstance oh rare aye capt hardcastle quickly affirmed drawn out by the captain and his good cess by kapitan lewrie rybakov said puzzled with his brow knitted and what is this cess a goodluck blessing so the tale goes the sailing master began to relate though sounding dubious a funeral at sea aboard the captains first command in hundreds of miles offshore in the bay of biscay just after the battle of the glorious first of june capt hardcastle stuck in more superstitious than lyle seals came alongside from nowhere tis told by his coxn and took back the soul of the only lad killed a selkie and one of theirs cursed by lir the old celtic sea god who turned folks into seals cause they denied him and doomed to live in the sea til they scream tbe people again swim ashore and shed their hides on stormy nights then live as men or women til they scream for a return to the sea til the end of time seals seem to turn up in captain lewries career and some deem their appearances most fortunate mr lyle faintly scoffed likely it is only coincidence sir coincidence and mythmaking about a man who has had extreme good fortune by superstitious sailors uncanny luck hardcastle insisted one cant deny that the hands do they believe their captain is blessed his ship and his crew that serves him shares in the blessing well whos to talk em out of that i ask you mister lyle might as well say that nelson is just having a string of dumb luck and will let them down soon as they put their trust in him hah hardly the same thing sir mr lyle said with a sniff well it is nice to imagine that the appearance of those seals whatever the reason for it harbingers a successful voyage for us the bemused count rybakov said with a cheerful shrug pray god indeed sir capt hardcastle agreed ah but to which god mr lyle said with a mild snicker the great jehovah or old lir count rybakov tipped his beaver hat to them and paced slowly aft to the taffrails puffing away on his cigar and squinting against the snow that swirled around him as urbane and cosmopolitan as he appeared to the world as educated and refined and trained from birth to fit easily into any royal court in the world yet he was russian a child of the orthodox church and still able to be mesmerised by the rituals the incense and the grandeur of its chants and hymns superstition in signs and omens lurked close under his polished cynically witty skin and the significance of the seals uncanny eagerness to swim out to the frigate to greet one of their own put a shiver up his spine he turned his back to the blowing snow hunched deep in his furs and drawing on his cigar finding himself hoping that the seals omen meant a swift and safe return to russia and the tsars court chort he muttered frowning of a sudden if this englishman lewrie was blessed by seals protected what would these angliski sailors selkies do to anyone who threatened their favourite and what fur was anatolis overcoat and shapka seal chapter thirtythree the ship is at quarters sir lt ballard reported once the last noisy rumbles and thuds had died away decks were sanded water butts between the guns were full seamens chests and stowage bags had been struck down to the orlop along with all the deal and canvas partitions captains and officers furniture the misdshipmens mess on the orlop had been converted to a surgery the pounders of both batteries had been run in unbowsed from the gunport sills and the ports ready to be lowered captains and quartergunners had selected the truest roundest shot from among the balls stowed in the thick rope shotgarlands or the shotracks by the hatchways tompions had been removed from the muzzles and powder charges had been rammed down to the breeches followed by shot and wadding gun tools had been fetched up from the racks over the tables in the mess the tables swung up against the overheads and flintlock strikers fetched from the magazines the arms chests had been opened and muskets pistols and cutlasses were ready to hand the boarding pike racks round the bases of the masts had been unlocked and unchained making them ready to grab sailors serving the guns had bound their neckerchiefs over their ears to preserve their hearing and most had stuffed oakum into their ears as well officers and warrants had dressed in the wee hours of the predawn in their cleanest clothing exchanging their usual linen or cotton shirts and stockings for silk which was easier to draw from wounds hms thermopylae was ready for battle no matter how outgunned they might be by the monster cannon of kronborg castle ready to sell their lives dearly should thermopylae be dismasted crippled and captured she would not go down without a fight very well mister ballard lewrie replied fingers of his left hand flexing on the hilt of his hanger sorry sir they dont care much for their basket pettus apologised as he emerged from the greatcabins with both cats bagged at last on his way to the orlop where he would assist the surgeon mr harward and his mates should it come to it theyll get used to you pettus lewrie called down to him from the crossdeck hammock nettings of the quarterdeck and let you shove em in as meek as baalambs he thumped the top of the nettings to assure himself that they were tightpacked with rolledup sailors hammocks and bedding passed through the ringmeasure that required them to be as snug as sausages cross the forrud edge of the quarterdeck down the bulwarks from bow to stern on each beam the snugly packed iron stanchions and nettings might stop lighter shot grape and langridge or fleshflaying clouds of wood splinters from hits the marines in full red kit for a rare once unless posted as sentries could shelter behind them and fire their muskets at enemy sea soldiers not out in the open like the army did and shouldertoshoulder the night before thermopylae had come to anchor in swedish waters bows pointing northerly to best and second bower just a bit south of the long narrow peninsula that marked the deep inlet named the koll for lewrie had no wish to try to skulk through the narrows in the dark and he wished to measure the rate of the outflow from the baltic that they would face in the morning after nigh a week of northerly winds to slow it he had pored over his charts once more in private without hardcastle or lyle and scribbling on a blank sheet of paper estimating the strength of the next days winds and thermopylaes possible speed over the ground in varying circumstances and how long his frigate would be under fire in that oneandthreequartermile oval of vulnerability with the ship safely anchored the chiplog streamed from the bow had shown only a twoknot current that night and with any luck and his fingers crossed lewrie estimated that they might make at least five or six knots south the simple mathematics was stark though that meant seventeen to twenty minutes under fire if the danes were feeling particularly bellicose if the swedes decided to join in as they had vowed to when the armed neutrality was formed as they had so long ago when denmark sweden and danish norway had been referred to as the three crowns the mood of the ship had been sombre the crew on the gundeck singing to the accompaniment of fiddle and fife or the strains of liam desmonds uilleann lappipes admiral hosiers ghost the false young sailor spanish ladies one morning in may all the lachrymose and sad dirges they knew oh desmond had struck up some lively tunes but it hadnt sounded as if they rise to them not fullvoiced and eager as they usually might there was no rhythmic thud of dancing to the hornpipes chanteys or stamp and goes wonder if theres any hornpipes of gloom lewrie had wondered supper with count rybakov had been a sullen affair too thankfully without count levotchkins presence for both of them had more on their minds than sparkling and witty conversation count rybakov had pressed him for more lore about selkies lir and the particular instances when seals had appeared to him but that subject was simply too eerie a matter on the possible eve of battle the highlight if one could call it that occurred when rybakov had expressed curiosity about lewries kentucky bourbon whisky and lewrie had in turn had to taste several varieties of vodka including a polish version flavoured with buffalo grass neither had come away with a favourable opinion of the others tipple and do you believe in this cess of yours kapitan lewrie count rybakov had finally asked believe lewrie had gloomed no not really my lord that would make me a heathen though i will admit that thereve been times that the presence of seals made me wonder eerie as it is whenever theyve turned up ive been thankful for the warning theres an host of mysteries that happen at sea so he had concluded with a shrug by the first bell of the evening watch at pm both of them were more than ready to turn in thankfully again count levotchkin had dined alone in his sleepingspace had picked over the reconstituted portable vegetable soup the roast chicken and boiled potatoes and the last of the freshbaked bread and had washed it all down with more wine more champagne and at least half a bottle of vodka and had babbled muttered fumed and fussed himself to an early slumber matching their own sparing everyone but for his manservant sasha two bells of the forenoon chimed from the focsle belfry a terse dingding as thermopylae sailed along with a steady breeze from the eastnoreast on her larboard quarters the snow gales gone and replaced by a mostly cloudy morning with only a brief glimmer of sunlight now and then she was under all plain sail with two reefs in her forecourse to aid the fore topsl in lifting her bows so she did not snuffle too deeply and slow her progress her main course was fully spread a peaceful thing to an outside observer for a main course sail would only be brailed up for combat so it would not catch fire from the discharge of her own guns if fully deployed not that it could not be fully reefed in a moment should it prove necessary lewrie looked up to assure himself that the antiboarding nets were rigged but not yet hauled aloft and to assure himself that all yards had been reenforced with chain slings to hold them aloft should halliards and lifts be shot away to keep them from plunging down to the deck and smothering the gun crews cannon and ports in canvas and rope rigging looking forrud then aft he noted that their largest flags of the new union pattern were flying one from the truck of the foremast and the largest aft from the spanker the danes could not mistake her nationality nor accuse them of trying to sneak past kronborg castle by employing a dishonourable false flag eight knots sir midshipman privette cried from the taffrail eight knots and an eighth really six knots over the ground then lt ballard commented as he rocked on the balls of his boots morelike mooed in a grimlipped way seventeen minutes lewrie muttered under his breath very well mister privette he called out in a louder voice to an unsuspecting world the epitome of calmness theres elsinore sir capt hardcastle pointed out as the old royal residence of danish kings loomed up on their starboard bows beyond thatll be kronborg castle thats a fortress by god lewrie marvelled i expected something grimmer kronborg castle formidable though it must be looked more like a fairy castle the sort of thing illustrated in a childrens book or a large toy to spur the imagination of the kiddies in their playroom it had four large square bastions with stout walls spanning the distances between them all of red brick not granite or limestone lightercoloured windowlike apertures below the bastions and along the walls revealed a lowerstorey casemate yet kronborg sprouted spires and towers more like those rising from muslim mosques like minarets and every steep roof was of copper mostly gone verdigris green but here and there as bright as a newminted penny it sat at the end of a long low peninsula atop a builtup earthen base with shallowangled embankments that led straight into the sea to the beach all covered in grass as green as the criquet pitch at lords and overall looked more like the country mansion of some incredibly wealthy and eccentric viscount earl or duke for what were about to receive mr simms the seniormost quartermaster at the doublehelm whispered the old saw for steeling oneself to stand manful under the enemys first broadside receive hell mister simms lewrie scoffed what ye think its christmas ship off the starboard bow dye hear there a lookout in the mainmast crosstrees shouted down she be a brig anchored by the fort everyone with access to a telescope raised it to look the brig over lewrie included she lay quite near the shore about a quartermile off from a substantial stone quay and landing anchored from the bows and a single kedge astern and though there was a thin skein of smoke from her it was a single source not the general haze arising from burning slowmatch galley smoke i make it sir lt ballard said ah ha lewrie exclaimed as a fluke of wind close inshore at last swung round to match their own baring the nature of the flag at her stern the postboy by god one of our mail packets sure enough the brig flew a red flag with a union insignia in the canton and the bulk of the fly covered by a large white square in which a postboy with a long trumpet astride a galloping horse was depicted were still talkin with the danes it seems lewrie explained to the quarterdeck mister fox mister farley he shouted down to the waist over the hammock nettings draw shot from the starboard battery quick as you can mister tunstall prepare to fire a salute to the castle how many guns anyone he asked in a quandary twentyone for their king sir midshipman sealey their eldest guessed with his fingers crossed i doubt hes there in the castle lewrie chuckled and their crown prince aint either theres a colonel stricker in command of kronborg castle sir capt hardcastle supplied whatd a colonel rate uhm fifteen sir midshipman privette meekly piped up i do believe that a colonel does merit fifteen guns in salute sir lt ballard gravely intoned though there was at last some merriment in his dark eyes fifteen it is then lewrie agreed hoping that was the right number mister tunstall fifteengun salute to the colonel of the bloody fort soon as were abeam ayeaye sir the master gunner cried back beyond puzzled by then to fire a salute with blank charges would be to cede the enemy first honours the carefully aimed first broadside should the fortress open upon them you will permit us to come to the quarterdeck kapitan count rybakov asked from the foot of the starboard gangway ladder he had a somewhat sober count levotchkin with him swaying like a scarecrow in a stiff breeze in a grain field and looking pastysick safest place tbe id imagine my lord lewrie japed back as safe as any should the danes be surly this morning if you will not go to the orlop then on your heads be it he said waving them up too excited by what might come to pay them much mind forgive us our curiosity should the danes attempt to deny us passage kapitan but count rybakov said with a deprecating shrug as he extended an expensivelooking telescope of his own one chased in gilt and its tubes overlaid with ivory look there anatoli is it not fascinating shall we be among the living an hour from now ha ha oh the danes count levotchkin said with a sickly sneer upon his face at least some colour was coming back to his cheeks from his first exposure to fresh air and the chill in nigh two days as dull as hamburg traders with no spines they would not dare damme whats his coat and hat made of lewrie took a moment to ponder is that seal skin dirty bastard mustve taken four or more hides tkeep his skinny arse warm they mostlike will not my lord lewrie said his attention on rybakov not the wheyfaced irritation do ye look close youll see one of our packet brigs at anchor under the fort were the danes of a mind tshoot at us theyd have given her twentyfour hours to be gone or taken her as good prize so the diplomats still correspond count rybakov said looking bemused and the danish court and your foreign office still attempt to find a mutually pleasing compromise it very well could be my lord lewrie said with an impish grin ready sir mr tunstall announced carry on mister tunstall lewrie shouted back number one gun fire the master gunner barked and an pounder far up forward bellowed and jerked back to the limit of the breeching ropes if i werent a gunner i wouldnt be here number three gun fire tunstall intoned pacing slowly aft from the first discharged cannon boom went the second and tunstall jerked his right hand jutting out his middle finger to go alongside his index finger ive left my wife and all thats dear number five gun fire and ring finger joined its mates on down the deck he paced chanting the old timing cadence lyrics over and over with pinky then thumb of his right hand extended he clenched that fist and began on the left hand as he reached sixth through the tenth round of the salute clenching the left fist at last and returning to the right working his way right aft to the break of the quarterdeck into that nowempty covered space where lewries cabins usually stood as soon as the fourteenth starboardside cannon had discharged tunstall showed a remarkable turn of speed to dash forward to the reloaded first gun of the salute a gunner i wouldnt be here number one gun fire the final crash and bellow the last gush of gunpowder and the echo of salute faded away ghosting with the haze of sickly yellowwhite smoke that was whisked beyond the frigates bows by the wind on their quarter reload mister tunstall lewrie ordered in the sudden silence powder and shot just in case more flags were flying from kronborg castles towers plain red flags with a white cross extending to all four edges offset towards the seam closest to the poles from which they flew thankfully there was no smoke rising from the forts chimneys to indicate that roundshot was quickly being heated boom came a far off bellow from the nearest square bastion and a matching eruption of spent powder smoke ten seconds later there came a second lewrie tucked his tongue in one side of his mouth and listened for the deep wail of approaching iron but heard none with a quick glance about he could not see any feathery water spouts from rounds fired short or the skip of first graze and certainly not the secondgraze as if guncaptains were dapping a flat stone til it hit their intended target boom came a third followed ten seconds later steady as a metronome on a young misss harpsichord or the clapping of a dancing masters hands by a fourth a fifth a sixth theyre returning our salute the sailing master mr lyle exclaimed well just damn my eyes well of course they are mister lyle lewrie hooted with glee the danesre a civilised lot cant just begin a war does your breakfast not suit takes reams o scribblin stern diplomatic overtures and warnins like postin the banns stead o runnin off tmarry its the done thing eleven and twelve lt ballard counted but there were no more shots fired from kronborg castle twelve for a postcaptain they didnt know the dignity of our honoured guests mister ballard lewrie replied feeling like laughing out loud snapping his fingers under ballards nose and doing a little dance how long at this speeed to copenhagen mister lyle uhm twenty more miles sir lyle answered after a moment say uhm does the wind stay out of the eastnoreast another three and a half hours four at the outermost does it prove necessary to reduce sail or work our way though any merchant traffic just about my dinnertime then lewrie jested desmond a lively tune there secure the hands from quarters mister ballard i doubt well face anything to match us at sea not til we near the trekroner forts above copenhagen the three crowns batteries theyll know of our coming no rider can gallop that fast anatoli levotchkin scoffed in better fiddle than when he first appeared on deck perhaps gunpowder agreed with him he was back to a livehuman pallor and back to his usually haughty self evincing an air of part disinterested boredom about the activities of the frigates operation and the gun salutes and part simmering resentmentmost of it directed at lewrie in sidelong sneers and slitted eyes no galloper no my lord lewrie countered pointing ashore theyve a semaphore tower which this minute is whirlin away like a dervish ah count rybakov realised chuckling the wonders of technology warnin the trekroner fort above copenhagen of our arrival lewrie told him which is reputed tbe even more formidable than the kronborg well take the holland deep of course youre familiar with copenhagen and the other narrows there the holland deep lies on the swedish side with a very shallow middle ground where im told many ships have gone aground dividin the narrows from the kings deep which might as well be copenhagens main harbour well even sail to the eastrd of saltholm island very far out of the reach of danish artillery do they not have any warships ready for sea yet we should be fairly safe liam desmond on his lappipes with the ships fiddler and the marine fifer struck up a jaunty reel and of a sudden thermopylaes crew began to clap cheer and dance about the decks from relief that kronborg had not opened fire on them perhaps from by jingo pride that perhaps the danes did not dare match their weight of metal versus a british frigate their frigate some men now freed from the secured guns scampered atop the starboard sailtending gangway to mock and jeer the kronborg now receding astern to shake their fists and hoot belated bravery and some began to bark to extend their arms stiffly out in front of them and clap their hands together palms turned outward in emulation of the laeso island seals along with those who hoisted index and middle fingers of their right hands in the ageold fuck you mate gesture uhm mister ballard lewrie called for his first officer sir ballard replied looking a bit piqued by such a crude display exuberant enthusiastic displays of emotion had never been to his taste there was no fear that lt arthur ballard would ever become a leaping methodist he was a staid high church man lets let em have about a minute more o that then rein em back to discipline lewrie ordered i will be below ayeaye sir good cess indeed count rybakov whispered to himself shaking his head in genial wonder such an odd thing he thought that a single eerie incident could be the making of this mercurial angliski kapitan so new to this ship and its crew which could have resented his arrival and his new ways of doing things yet could it be that the laeso seals had blessed him in command for it appeared that the seals fey actions combined with the peaceful passing of kronborg castle and its gigantic cannonso easily explainable to civilised rational people who understood the diplomatic niceties and the mores of behaviour between nationstateshad won lewrie the trust and affection of his men a good cess indeed ah ha what is cess count anatoli levotchkin asked snapping in impatience with the foolish antics of peasants and quietly approving of lt ballard and the officers and midshipmen as they called the men back to duty and to stop all that noise something british anatoli rybakov told him said of a man with more luck than usual luck awarded by god well an ancient god upon one of his champions his blessed kapitan lewrie here his men believe has received a good cess from the seals we encountered who came at the bidding of an ancient irish sea god to welcome him to bless his new ship and his voyage our voyage superstitious nonsense anatoli gravelled these angliski sailors are as stupid as our serfs seeing signs and portents in the yolks of eggs or imagining that their grandfathers live on in the body of a lightfurred wolf before we leave this ship that bastard will have no luck left i must see to it levotchkin insisted with his chin lifted in longsimmering anger then i think anatoli that you will be the one to die all for your lust for a whore rybakov warned him with sadness a whore whom anyone can have as your elder kinsman i stand for your father and mother and warn you to let it go once our mission is finished you will have a golden future ahead of you do not throw it away for so little the world is full of pretty whores if they are what you desire though i wish you aspired to better things think long and hard anatoli rybakov pressed his pleasant and merry face grim and inches from the youngers for i do believe that kapitan lewries cess will prevail now who is the superstitious one count levotchkin rejoined with a sneer of cold amusement taking one step backwards and striking a noble stance he has wronged me and insulted me and i will not abide it he must die i have sworn it if anything counts as a blessing uncle the holy mother of kazan will uphold me against any pagan god i am a loyal son of the true church while this lewrie is of the degraded protestant church of england which we both know is a joke even to the british observed only once or twice a year by rote i doubt lewrie even adheres to that he is as faithless as the tsar anatoli rybakov barked a hand raised in warning this must not be done before you try i will ask the kapitan to put you in irons and chain you below i will keep the keys until we set foot ashore all the way to saint petersburg if i have to until you come to your senses and obey me too much is riding on our arrival and i will not allow anything to prevent our success ya paneemayu uncle i count levotchkin stammered looking strangled swear to me you will swallow your pride over such a trivial matter and obey me in all things rybakov demanded drawing attention from the quarterdeck officers and men of the afterguard who did not understand their russian but thought the obvious argument odd you pledged your wholehearted aid to me in london what a gentleman of the aristocracy will go back on his word he sneered uncle for the love of god please nyet i will seek him after count levotchkin stated you cannot deny me that after count rybakov puzzled head cocked to one side what do you mean after once all is done and there is peace i will return to london and confront him levotchkin vowed in all seeming earnestness after your marriage to the countess ludmilla vissaroninova count rybakov enquired a wry brow raised and how will you explain that to her her family or yours pah anatoli once ashore on our own holy soil your little whore in london will mean nothing to you nor will your grudge against kapitan lewrie once in command of a regiment of guards cavalry wellmarried and welcome in every rich house in saint petersburg or moscow and with a guaranteed place in the new court this will seem to you nothing a quibble but levotchkin tried to explain his imagination flooded with images of the delectable the biddable tess swear to uphold me in all things and obey me in this matter and after a long moment count anatoli levotchkin mind still asquirm with fantasies of bloody revenge acceded and swore though he did cross the fingers of one hand behind his back book quaeritor belli exitus non causa of war men ask the outcome not the cause lucius annaeus seneca hercules furens chapter thirtyfour blessed hms thermopylae seemed indeed to be for no danish vessel larger than a fishing smack stood guard in the holland deep as she sailed tranquilly on past saltholm island far beyond the range of the forts protecting copenhagen the trekroner the castellet the amager the lynetten or the bastions that anchored the citys walls even so thermopylae could espy from the very masttops that the navy yard girded by those walls did not yet contain all that many warships with masts set up and yards crossed those yards that were in place looked bare of sails as well oh on the danish side in the copenhagen roads and in the kings deep officers and lookouts aloft could count the number of warships and oddlooking floating batteriesbulwarked rafts with stumpy masts meant for signalling and to fly their national ensign onlyarrayed from the trekroner fort down to the city proper to guard the northern entrance to the roads but oddly none of them stirred as thermopylae passed on the other side of the middle ground shoals as if they were bewitched and blinded some fearfully whispered south of copenhagen tween the danish town of dragor on amager island and the swedish coast and the town of malmц lay the grounds where captain hardcastle and sailing master lyle both cautioned that a steady wind for several days could reduce the depth by as much as three feet over the shallow throat of the baltic and the largest vessels of the deepest draught might have to anchor and lighten themselves of cargo water butts or guns to get over with several days of northerly winds though the leadsmen swinging their leads from the forechains found sufficient depth for thermopylae even drawing eighteen feet she passed over the grounds with at least two fathom to spare and did not even feel the brush of sand silt or mud under her false keel by twilight the frigate on a steady course of south by east with perhaps only half a point of southing rounded the lattermost tip of swedish territory at the point of falsterbo and stood out into the frigid baltic itself at last it was only at midnight and the beginning of the middle watch that lewrie ordered course altered to due east sail taken in and speed reduced to a scant four knots and extra lookouts posted to spot any drifting fields of ice with the dawn came a shift in wind at last starting to back round am an hour before all hands was piped to wake the ship for another day of seafaring of stowing hammocks topside sweeping and mopping decks and going to quarters to guard against any foe revealed by the dawning sun it changed to norwesterly then quickly westerly and by four bells of the morning watch had swung round to souwesterly by the time lewrie came to the quarterdeck for the third time of a sleepless night so swathed in fur and undergarments that he resembled an greenland eskimo it was from south by west sweeping over the coastal plains of prussia that lay to the south and it felt just a tad warm though none too strong well not be able to pass between sweden and the danish island of bornholm sir mr lyle reported as they pored over the chart upon the traverse board by my reckoning weve made twentyfive nautical miles since weathering falsterbo last night and no chance of sunsights of course capt harcastle stuck in no of course not not in this eternal overcast mr lyle agreed though through clenched teeth to be interrupted id suggest we alter course to the soueast and leave bornholm broad to larboard sheltered waters twixt sweden and bornholm dye see sir hardcastle continued between sips of hot tea from his battered old pewter mug calmer waters more chances for ice floes to form no one chances that passage past november yeve seen the drift ice that we encountered during the night captain lewrie not really lewrie replied it was reported to me but rotten capt hardcastle declared thin and looking as if rats had been gnawing at the few pieces i saw close enough aboard for me to judge damned near soft as pie crust id imagine do we espy more this morning it might not be a bad idea to put down a boat and row out to give it a closer looksee the thaws set in for certain then lewrie said wondering how soon it might be that thermopylae encountered swedish or russian warships at sea or danish had they despatched one or two in chase of them oh tis still too early for karlskrona or the other swedish ports to have clear passage hardcastle assured him with a smile and a wink and the russian ports up the gulf of finland well theyre weeks behind the swedes but were getting there sir believe you me and with this warm wind outta the mainland he said turning his face to it for a second before shrugging his inability to give an exact estimate mayhap the thaw will come even earlier this season were i back in england id be loaded and stowed just waiting for a favourable wind to start the first trading voyage of the spring oh joy lewrie griped looking up from the chart to peer over the bows and the hobbyhorsing jibboom and bow sprit for the island of bornholm still lost in the overcast and winter haze by mr lyles reckoning it lay perhaps twenty seamiles east he was tempted to go as close as he dared to the passage between the isle and sweden but there were his passengers and their diplomatic mission to consider hardcastles assurance that the passage would not be usable for a few more weeks would have to do for now very well he reluctantly said looking about for the officer of the watch then trying to determine which of the swathed and muffled individuals that might be mister fox sir aye sir the woolcovered figure in a bright red muffler and knit wool cap replied lowering the scarf to ba b a scarf tore all his face we will alter course to soueast and make more sail lewrie directed all plain sail first then all to the royals perhaps directly captain lt fox crisply replied bosun pipe all hands then stations to come about by midday as the last of eight bells chimed they stood with sextants and slates ready hoping for a peek at the sun but that orb refused to appear clearly veiling itself as a bright vague smudge in a sky solidly clouded over the best they could do was agree that the various chronometers still kept the same time within half a minute of each other and that it was noon indeed when the day officially began aboard a ship at sea not at midnight but at noon sights at least we see bornholm sir lt farley said lowering his telescope after a peek over the larboard beam and can reckon by its presence just where we are its southernmost tip yonder twixt ah aakirkeby and ah nekso and who picks the names for foreign towns i ask you cant pronounce the half of em he muttered do you concur captain hardcastle lewrie asked the civilian merchant master that it be sir hardcastle told them chuckling bless me sirs but you think theyre hard to say you ought to see how theyre spelled in swedish or danish all sorts of umlauts and hyphen strokes through the odd vowels in russian waters its even worse for they use the cyrillic alphabet the old greek and thank god for anglicised british charts ice cried a mainmast lookout from the crosstrees do ye hear there broken ice two points off the larboard bows a mile or more off you still wish to examine the ice captain hardcastle lewrie asked him we must sir hardcastle assured him mister fox well fetchto and lower a boat for captain hardcastle pass word for my coxn and boat crew lewrie ordered thermopylae had been able to post about six or seven knots on the sutherly winds but now it was tossed away as the helm was put over and the sails trimmed to turn the frigates bows about into the wind with squaresls backed to check her forward motion and with foreandaft sails cupping and drawing wind to counter any sternward drive a rowing boat the cutter was seized up and with the employment of the main course yard for a crane hoisted off the crossdeck boattier beams and carefully lowered overside then manned below the starboard entryport captain hardcastle and midshipman tillyard joined the boat crew and began to row off towards the ice floes now clearly visible from the decks lewrie paced the quarterdeck from taffrail to the hammock nettings and back again stopping now and then to peer out and drum impatient mittened fingers on the caprails knowing that such was as slow as church work as the saying went pardons sir midshipman plumb said by his side what lewrie impatiently snapped uhm your man pettus begs tell you that your dinner is ready sir the boy reported looking a tad daunted my pardons mister plumb lewrie apologised but the state of the ice in the baltic matters a great deal for admiral parker and admiral nelson and im anxious tknow what they discover he added jutting an arm at the slowly moving cutter dinner dye say hmm proper postcaptains did not fret not where people could see them they didnt they were to show the world glacial serenity even in hurricanes he chid himself mister fox you have the deck lewrie called out over his shoulder as he tramped for the larboard gangway i will be dining in my cabins til the boat returns send word when it does ayeaye sir a nice slab of last nights seapie sir pettus told him as he helped him disrobe his winter garb pity the russian gentlemen didnt fancy it much but more for you there is a scaldinghot soup beef broth diced onion melted cheese and crumbled biscuit and nettles fried you some lovely potato patties with lots of crumbled bacon the cats have got their share of that sir no fear pettus cheerfully chattered away as lewrie sat down at the table a moment later and there was a rumlaced sweetened and milked mug of coffee before him even if it was goats milk wine too sir think ill wait til supper for wine today pettus lewrie decided as he dug in with his fork his hunger was alive clawing at his innards but he forced himself to go slow as hed forced himself to come below and pretend to ignore the boat and the ice one very good reason to dally over his victuals was the absence of both of the russian counts and their servants they had dined earlier together with count levotchkin coming out of his selfenforced exile aft and thus avoiding having to dine with lewrie in proper manner for once the brief spell of privacy free of rybakovs evercheerful prattle was splendid did nettles whip up anything for dessert pettus he asked once the last morsel had gone down his gullet and the last warm sip of rumlaced coffee had been drunk nought for dinner sir pettus answered removing his plate said hes saving his best efforts for supper but theres jam and extrafine biscuit i could fetch out sounds fine lewrie told him requesting a refill of coffee minus the rum this time all the while keeping one ear cocked for a call from the deck the sound of the cutter bumping back alongside of the hull and the ticking of the carriage clock that he kept on the sideboard fretting and frowning now he was in private lewrie went over to his desk and pretended to immerse himself in the minutiae of ships paperwork finally midshipman plumb sah the sentry called enter lewrie replied a tad too eagerly and loudly even to his ears mister foxs respects sir and he says that the cutter is plumb began tell mister fox i will come to the quarterdeck mister plumb lewrie cut him off going quickly for his furs he trotted up the gangway ladder to the starboard entryport where capt hardcastle and midshipman tillyard stood over a large wooden bucket well sirs lewrie asked striving for at least a shred of idle interest its rotten sir hardcastle said kneeling down to lift out a slab about the size of a serving platter and about eight inches thick the edges crumbled at his touch lewrie reached out to touch it giving it a squeeze at first it felt solid enough but even as he applied moderate pressure he could feel it flaking away as if he could compress it into a slushy snowball did he try harder get a lot of it together sir and itll slow a ship down hardcastle told him where the floes are solid not like these bits thatve broken off youll still have unbroken ice about three feet or more thick though therell be air bubbles underneath where itll be half the thickness where itll first begin to break up sir i thought it would be flat and smooth top to bottom lewrie speculated aloud putting out both hands to take the slab from captain hardcastle it was still quite heavy though as he turned it over he saw that the bottom of the slab was pebbly and pitted without warning the slab broke in half split right down the middle and shattered on the oak decks of the starboard gangway well damn he muttered up north on the swedish coast sir hardcastle told him up at karlskrona itll still be solid and three or four feet thick as i said but wont be long before its half that and breaking up and kronstadt and reval lewrie asked of the russian ports two or three weeks behind the swedes sir hardcastle speculated with a grim expression its melting fast even so mister fox get way on her again all to the royals and wring the last quarterknot from this wind long as it lasts lewrie told him soon as the cutters back on the tiers ayeaye sir get these russians ashore soonest lewrie grimly told himself as he kicked some larger chunks of ice down the gangway reconnoiter reval for certaindont think we can get all the way tkronstadt if it melts out lastthen dash back to karlskrona tsmoak them out and report to the fleet if we can get back past copenhagen and the narrows if the danes let us getting in was the easy part he realised getting out of the baltic would be the really tricky part chapter thirtyfive what am i doin up here lewrie asked himself for the tenth time in five minutes as he steadied his most powerful telescope on the ratlines of the upper shrouds in the mainmast fighting top swaddled in his furs he was certain he resembled a shaggy cocoon wherein a larva slept glued to a sturdy twig it was certainly cold enough for him to adhere to any metal did he grasp any without his woolen mittens going aloft had never been one of his favourite activities not since his first terrors as a midshipman who was naturally expected to spend half his waking hours in the rigging chearly yohohoing and scrambling about with the agility of an ape damn his dignity but he had eschewed the backwardsleaning final ascent of the futtock shrouds and taken the lubbers hole instead of clinging upside down like a fly on the overhead all to take a gander at kronstadt he didnt know quite what hed expected when first learning his destination arctic glaciers and the entire gulfs of bothnia and finland completely covered with vast sheets of ice several yards thick littered with upwellings of ice like a boulder field or a plain full of celtic dolmens a titanic stonehenge but the fact of the matter was that the baltic sea was fairly open boisterous and rolling as much an ocean as the atlantic or the north sea with the ice confined to still protected waters harbours and short friezes along the beaches thermopylaehad scouted quite close to reval within a league of the naval port and its breakwater batteries two days before and had spotted the russian navy preparing for war they had counted the number of lineofbattle ships and frigates still locked in the ice seen how many already had their masts set up and yards crossed and the smoke from forges barracks shipwrights manufacturies and what both count rybakov and capt hardcastle had identified as the bakeries and smokehouses where rations were being prepared even more ominously they had all seen the hundreds thousands of peasant workers out on the ice sheets afoot chopping and chipping a channel wide enough for two large warships abreast seen and heard the explosions as kegs of gunpowder were used to blast the thickest of the iceor at least blow deepenough craters which the men with axes and shovels could attack after now here was the principal naval harbour of russias baltic fleet not three miles away and it was the same story every now and then an explosion spurted a dirty cloud of powder smoke aloft along with a shower of ice chips sometimes a serf along with it behind the breakwater mole or in the roads near the harbour entrance the sound coming seconds later as a soft pillowthump and a tremor in the sea that thrummed through the frigates bones but just as at reval no one had tried a shot at them from those heavy pounder cannon along the mole or the harbour entrance bastions no matter how infuriated the russians might be by the sight of a british frigate all flags flying lying just beyond maximum range it was uncanny as if stiff final diplomatic letters declaring a state of belligerence had to be exchanged first or whenever the russians could finally get those ships of the line to sea sail west and announce a state of war with their first broadsides lewrie tugged a mitten off with his teeth reached into a pocket of his furs for pencil and paper and quickly made notes on all he could see then steeled himself for the descent to the deck once more why am i doin this he asked himself again as he went through the lubbers hole with his booted heels fumbling for firm purchase on stiff icy ratlines many ships sir lt ballard enquired once he was down rum first lewrie demanded nighboilin if gods just settle for tea or coffee long as its hot his teeth chattered and his words slurred from the stiffness of his jaws ah thats better thankee pettus he said after a welcome swig of coffee from the everpresent black iron kettle the russians main fleet is back at reval mister ballard he said reading from his notes here i saw two unrigged liners third rates i make em but theres nine frigates with their masts and yards set up and what looks tbe five or six bombs along with god knows how many floating batteries for harbour defence useless at sea oh theres several more third rates and larger in the graving docks or on the stocks under construction or would be if it werent so bloody cold but the real threats back west of here they are chopping and blasting lanes through the ice here as well sir lt ballard commented with a faint grunt of puzzlement and a frown even though there is not much to get out to combine with the reval ships odd they mostlike want those frigates out lewrie decided aloud gulping down more hot coffee i would in reval theyd seen twelve third rate s three gunned vessels of the second rate and one huge first rate which the naval list had named the blagodat of guns there were also three more warships slightly smaller than third rates more of the sort of vessel employed by baltic powers and the dutch which might mount anywhere from sixty to seventy guns still mercifully iced in so solidly that horsedrawn sledges and workingparties on foot had done the ferrying and stowing instead of barges sheer hulks and hoys not as dire as i thought arthur lewrie said with a relieved smile and a quick glance upward to where he had clung in shuddery terror he looked back just quick enough to see lt ballard wince at the use of his christian name and purse his lips in distaste what is his problem lewrie thought vexed and that too was for the hundredth time this voyage he keeps that up ill start considerin him in the hate lewrie club mister lyle sir lewrie said turning away to consult with the sailing master where might we land our live lumber best soon be rid of em lewrie exulted inside thankee jesus well it appears theres less than a halfmile to a quartermile of ice off the shores hereabouts sir mr lyle opined as he and lewrie bent over the smallerscale chart of the kronstadt and st petersburg approaches we could row them to the edge have them send for a coach too close to kronstadt lewrie objected and weve trailed our colours to em already i expect their armys astir like an anthill uhm what about here on the north shore this little port town of sestroretsk i doubt its ten miles from saint petersburg by road he said pinching fingers together against the distance scale of the chart and placing them against the map theres even a road from there to the capital and if peter the great left anything behind its probably a goodun too mister ballard sir get us underway course noreast for this piddlin wee town here on the chart lewrie ordered well land our diplomats there and be shot of em lewrie went below to his greatcabins and found that his guests had already packed up their essentials and looked eager to leave his company as well off reval lewrie had considered dropping them off at another wee place on the coast called paldiski but count rybakov damn his genial urbane soul had demurred saying that it would be more than a week before they could reach st petersburg by troika and that he must seek out someplace closer ah kapitan count rybakov exclaimed upon seeing him there is good news you have chosen a place to land us sestroretsk cross the bay on the north shore my lord lewrie told him stripping his furs off for a while they stank like badgers and had begun to itch him something sinful far away from any of your countrys forts or garrisons but within mere miles of your destination i know of it and the road to saint petersburg is quite good even by troika rybakov replied as pleased as if lewrie had presented him with king georges keys to the tower of london and all of its treasures no wolves either ha ha he laughed snapping fingers in glee we are within hours of home anatoli is it not splendid at last count levotchkin agreed with the first sign of any real enthusiasm hed evinced since first coming aboard hed dressed for the occasion in a new bottlegreen suit topboots and a striped yellow waistcoat and ambergold neckstock and for the first time since hed come aboard thermopylae he even looked sober we must express our gratitude to kapitan lewrie for our swift and safe passage anatoli count rybakov insisted looking round the greatcabins at their separate piles of luggage and chests over which their manservants fyodor and sasha still fussed there were three piles lewrie noticed the third the largest by far and mostly made up of crates and middlingsized kegs we bought far too much before sailing kapitan lewrie what is the sense of taking vodka or russian brandy ashore with us like how you angliski say carrying coals to newcastle ha ha the nobleman chortled most cheerfully caviar pickled delicacies all so available in saint petersburg and for much less we leave it to you as our gift kapitan he said with his arms wide and a smile on his phyz worthy of a doting papa in recognition of the great service you do us in the cause of peace for all our peoples well dont know as i can rightly lewrie began to object wondering how many jots and tittles in the articles of war he would be violating did he accept charging passage aboard a kings ship taking a bribe for services rendered breaking bulk cargo for his own use extortion what could an attorney make o that he wondered do we take it with us kapitan it would take hours longer to unload and row ashore count rybakov reminded him putting you and your ship in greater danger really we insist dont we anatoli it is as count rybakov says kapitan count levotchkin seconded sporting a smile upon his phyz which put lewrie in mind of the expression shiteating it is a small expression of gratitude well if ye wont land it and wont take it with you lewrie said at last then i accept though its hardly necessary then it is settled count rybakov cheered beaming it was midafternoon by the time hms thermopylae came to anchor off the small coastal town of sestroretsk the small harbour inlet was iced up solidly of course its larger fishing boats locked immobile its smaller rowboats drawn up on the shingle upside down for the winter and the floating stages of its pier resting on the ice off the beach and solid ground there was at least two hundred yards of dingy white ice the depth in which thermopylae could swim restricted her to lay off another quartermile all three ships boats were hoisted off the tiers and oversidethe cutter launch and captains gigthen manned with a midshipman and six or eight oarsmen apiece as the main course yard dipped swung and deposited stout rope nets of dunnage into the two larger boats the gig was sent ashore immediately right to the edge of the ice floe with count rybakovs servant fyodor and capt hardcastle who was the only other man aboard somewhat fluent in russian to arrange for transport carriage and dray waggons or sledges the gig could not reach the pier of course and spent many minutes at the outermost edge of the ice with two men in the bows using a boarding axe and a gaff pole to smash through the thinnest rottenest parts til the boat could go no further and there was enough thickness for a man to trust his life upon it lewrie watched fyodor and capt hardcastle gingerly step out of the gig and tap their way shoreward pace by wary pace pausing to see if the ice would hold their weight and listening to the ominous creaks groans and crackles mostlikely lewrie lifted his telescope to scan the town sestroretsk looked sleepy filthy and smokeshrouded from its many chimneys it was a place mostly of wood construction half the residences made of logs with shakeshingled steep rooves its one church looked more like a barn with the grain silo replaced by a bell tower on one end and an oniondomed second tower at the other the dome and its oddshaped cross the only spot of real colour in town evidently lewrie imagined paint was at a premium in russia tall drifts of snow lay hard against every building driven by the prevailing winds or their last blizzard and the people there were only a few civilians about who sported europeanstyle suits or dresses the bulk of them wore an assortment of shapkas or ushankas with huge earflaps tall felt boots men and women both and extremely baggy pantaloons or pyjammy trousers all smothered of course in rough hide coats lined with wool piling mangy furs or blankets and quilts for extra warmth and to lewries continuing edginess most of them stood gazing dulleyed at the strange foreign frigate as if they were so many cattle or sheep with about as much curiosity it is a great pity that what little you see of my country is a poor village count rybakov said from lewries side come up to the quarterdeck unbidden amid all the shifting of cargo our great tsar peter changed us in one generation from an asian country to a european nation and blessed ekaterina catherine contributed more to awakening us from barbarism to civilisation but so much remains to be done before we truly become as neat and pastoral as your rural shires kapitan lewrie as well ordered as villages in france or our cities as impressive as london paris or even dover or yarmouth but we are patient rybakov mused and those things will come in time as long as we do not spend our blood and treasure on useless wars yes ha look at it so close to saint petersburg yet no one tries to make it even a potemkin village what a hovel potemkin lewrie asked one of catherine the greats court one of her lovers in fact rybakov admitted with a worldlywise shrug whenever she wished to travel to see her people by river or by coach potemkin made sure that good roads were laid out if only a single day of travel before the tsarinas entourage villages on the routes were remade and painted just for her passing she always stayed overnight with great landowners at their country mansions or palaces you see if great catherine went by river potemkin erected false villages just the faзades back from the banks as her ship went by we russians we are very capable of deluding ourselves ha to seem but not quite to be expect yer vodka helps ye there lewrie smugly thought ah fyodor has reached the pier at last count rybakov exclaimed clapping gloved hands in glee and i believe i see horses and carriages at the inn carriages and sledges in their stables atleetchna excellent if the ice will bear the weight of horses and waggons and if they can get up and down off the ice ashore aye lewrie said wary of risking his ships people at the thinnest rottenest edge of that ice sheet to unload the boats and bear the cargo to the sledges we shorten the trip kapitan count rybakov assured him with an easy wry grin after all there are many peasants there and for twenty kopeks each perhaps five pence in your money they will chop and saw a way for your boats to ice which will bear the weight it is winter they have nothing better to do fyodor has more than enough coin to arrange this i saw to it indeed after a long palaver perhaps a harangue from fyodor villagers came flooding off the shore down the stairs to the landing stages with axes and saws and came out to the edge of the ice where the gig waited to begin their labours ashore three sledges emerged from the stables on their runners and horses were put into harness to pull them lets get the launch and cutter under way mister ballard lewrie ordered pass word for the gig to return and stand ready to bear our passengers ashore once the sleds are loaded and warn the lookouts aloft to keep their eyes peeled for any sight of infantry or cavalry on the road sestroretsk might look isolated and without a garrison of its own but it was damned close to st petersburg and god only knew how many regiments it was surrounded by scrubby winterfallow fields and a massive swath of pine forest in which a brigade could lurk the serf labourers made quick work of cutting an inlet through the ice sheet wide enough for a royal barge and about thirty yards or so deep their breath steamed in the frigid air but they grinned and stamped their booted feet and pounded or jabbed their tools on the ice to show that it was safe sure enough by the time the first boat poled its way into the tiny manmade inlet the first sledge was there about fifteen yards back from the new edge and the serf labourers in a flurry of arms and legs and strong backs toted the cargo from boat to troika as quickly as thermopylaes people could manhandle it out russia has so many strong backs and hands kapitan lewrie count rybakov told him as the last of his light luggage was fetched to the gangway and entryport by two sailors millions of them that is why no one will ever begin a war with us it may not be modern nor is brute strength and numbers elegant but it will suffice i spose my lord lewrie pretended to agree though thinking of what a modern army with muskets and artillery could do to medieval peasant levies poorly trained and led or what the british navy could do to what hed seen so far of russias best at sea almost almost count levotchkin muttered to himself with rising anticipation as he joined them by the entryport pachtee vryemya sasha pachtee vryemya da da his hulking manservant grunted back sideparty to assemble for departing honours mister ballard lewrie ordered thermopylae was at quarters with at least half the guns of the larboard battery which faced the shore and half of the starboard battery facing the sea manned and ready marines were in full kit and under arms and all officers but lewrie wore swords on their left hips and theres the last of the second boats cargo on the sledges at last he exulted i say dosveedanya kapitan lewrie count rybakov said offering his bared hand for a departing shake that is goodbye adieu and may god keep his eyes upon you and grant you and your ship a safe and swift passage back to england it is a grand thing you do for our countries might i even say a holy thing to keep peace between russia and england before lewrie could do a thing about it count rybakov clasped his arms round him bussed him on both cheeks and danced lewrie about the deck jostling him like a child with his boots in the air well now my lord uhm lewrie spluttered to the amusement of his watching crew rybakov at last set him back down a safe journey short though it may be to saint petersburg yourself my lord lewrie offered after hed gotten most of his dignity back and his hat resettled on his head well then it is time count rybakov said in conclusion as he stepped to the lip of the entryport and looked down at the gig waiting at the bottom of the boardingbattens and the main channels ships compny off hats and salute lt ballard barked in his surprisingly deep carrying voice doffing his own cocked hat by example as the marines stamped their boots and presented muskets and the bosun mr dimmock and his mate mr pulley piped a departing call the count turned inwards back to the sea and seized hold of the manropes to begin his cautious descent once rybakovs hat was below the lip of the entryport count levotchkin went to the edge and turned to face inboard as the call continued and the crew stood to attention doffing their flat tarred hats dosveedanya kapitan levotchkin said giving lewrie a final mocking sneer as pleased with himself it seemed as a cat who lapped the cream enjoy your journey count levotchkin added his blue eyes alight whats he mean by that lewrie asked himself as he stood there doffing his own hat though abhoring the required honour and caught a faint shift in levotchkins gaze over his shoulder at something seechas sasha levotchkin snapped his face going feral just as he began a spry descent down the frigates side seechas now now what lewrie wondered as he recognised the word feeling an odd prickle up his spine that forced him to begin to turn to look behind him bloody hell marine lt eades cried the first loudest voice of alarm as the bosuns calls squealed to a sudden stop midshipman tillyard grasped lewries left arm and pulled hard sending him stumbling towards the nearest marine private by the entryport who didnt try to catch his captain but was busy bringing his musket down from present arms to poise lowering the muzzle in rough aim behind lewrie it was a second marine who caught him before he stumbled through the open entryport to fall overside and drown for like most british tars lewrie could not swim ya bastard lt eades snarled swinging with his already drawn sword from ceremony to combat making somebody howl sasha the shavepated burly manservant was grasping his hand and roaring with both sudden pain and frustration the dagger he had whipped out of his left overcoat sleeve was falling from his grip its hilt bloodied from his thumb halfsevered by lt eadess blade murder someone shouted in the din not done yet sasha let out another bullroar and shouldered his way forward towards lewrie halfknocking midshipman tillyard off his feet and taking hold of the young mans halfdrawn dirk with his good hand weapon lewrie demanded of the marine whod kept him from going overboard ripping the brown bess musket from the fellows shocked and nerveless grasp it wasnt loaded but the bayonet was fitted marine sgt crick and the first private met sasha first with readied bayonets sgt crick getting his blade in though sashas pilelined hide coat blunted cricks thrust lt eades slashed at his back but the coat acted like armour it was the marine private who jabbed at sashas eyes then reversed his musket and delivered a forehead smash that finally brought the brute down to his knees swinging wildly with tillyards dirk and still trying to rise and finish his masters orders lt eadess next slash connected alongside the russians bald head clipping off the top of his right ear followed by a brassbound musket butt right in the teeth from sgt crick that sprawled sasha on his back spitting teeth and blood half senseless so he could be disarmed get up you son of a bitch lewrie snarled edging round inboard of the entryport he lowered the musket to level the bayonet at sashas chest as he groggily got back to his knees halfcrawling to face lewrie as if only death would dissuade him sasha failed levotchkin lewrie shouted to the boat alongside he let you down are you man enough tcome back up here and do your own dirtywork or are ye the same drunken buttfucker ye were in london hmmm bet that needs some explainin lewrie thought hearing the buzz of confusion among his ships people ye just couldnt use a fetchin whore like tess the right way could ye levotchkin lewrie taunted your sort likes tterrify em and make it hurt make it vile what ye get your first practice on sheep or pigs levotchkin ye prefer the windward passage in the gig below count levotchkin howled in rage cursing back in russian french and english so rapidly and heatedly that only a few choicer words could be made out get on your feet ye murderin scum lewrie urged sasha with the glittering point of the bayonet put im in irons sir marine sgt crick asked bristling no not yet lewrie said ive something else in mind hoy levotchkin he shouted overside again tess told me she damned near puked her guts out evry time ye showed up at the brothel she hated evrything about you ye frightened her said for all she got out of it ye might as wellve stuck your puny prick down the neck of a wine bottle all the way cross the room from her so disgusted by ye she couldnt even feign it with you come up here and face me ye little poltroon oh lord sir youll not lt ballard exclaimed sounding primly appalled not again it isnt i said get on your feet you ya idysodar charochko he spat at sasha jerking the bayonet tip upwards there was another strangled cry from the gig and a hissing argument twixt rybakov and levotchkin along with threats from lewries coxn liam desmond and stroke oar his mate patrick furfy whether to sit where he was or be a man and scale the ships side to face the consequences it was hard to tell in all the shouting sasha shook his head to clear it spitting a couple more teeth and blood swiping his rough hide coat sleeve to clear his eyes from his freely bleeding head wound and managed to stagger and sway to his feet still defiant with an arrogant pugnacious sneer on his face breathing heavily through his nose like a bull in a spanish fighting arena still game to charge the cape sir you cannot intend to simply kill him lt ballard protested its not within our jurisdiction not just rid the ship of trash mister ballard lewrie flippantly said with a shrug of his shoulders though his eyes usually a merry blue had gone as grey and cold as ice he took a step forward with the bayonet levelled at sashas chest not coming levotchkin he shouted he stamped forward another pace driving sasha backwards mister rybakov wont let im sor coxn desmond shouted back were thold im fore ye kill im sure says he and so i would were he man enough lewrie loudly responded after all hes the one whos been talkin so long about challengin me to a duel for his own putrid honour but too much a coward to face me direct had tsic his pet dog on me instead hoy anatoli tess liked bein with me wanted tbe under my protection in a wee place of her own and never see or hear of you again lewrie stamped forward once more jabbing with the bayonet and making sasha back up towards the entryport well if ye wont come up and pay the piper ye spineless backgammoning little souse i spose ye wont lewrie shouted a final time looking disappointed ill send your brute back to ya sasha understood some english and a smattering of proper laws the angliski kapitan would rid the ship of trash that irked but he was surrounded by levelled bayonettipped muskets and officers with drawn swords and could only swallow his rage at being bested someday he would have a second chance he sends him back to count anatoli as well because what the other angliski officer said that they did not have the legal right his shattered mouth would heal the cut on his head would heal to match the other scars on his body it was good get off my ship sasha lewrie growled jabbing the bayonet at the mans eyes and swiping that smug look from his face at last and putting anger and caution in its place lewrie forced him to the very lip of the entryport facing inwards as the others had done their descents sashas hands groped back behind him for the edge of the opened bulwark fumbling on the caprails in search of the upper knots of the manropes i said get off my ship stamp forward with the left foot reversing the musket to smash the brass butt plate into sashas broad nose making him spout claret in a fresh red stream and go crosseyed before his hands could get a grip on the manropes the stout rope stays of the mainmast shrouds or the bulwarks sasha teetered on the lip of the entryport arms flailing backwards in circles for balance one foot behind him hoping for something solid that was not there he overbalanced and went over the side backwards roaring like a bear that had lost its grip in a tall tree and was crashing to earth through the branches head and shoulders down boot heels brushing the hull there was a meaty thud then a great splash as sasha hit the gig then the icy sea yob tvoyemat count levotchkin shrieked oh my lord lt eades croaked as he and many others dashed to the bulwarks to peer over lewrie took out his pocket handkerchief and swung the marines musket barreldown he dipped the handkerchief into a guntub of slushy halficedover water and thorougly cleaned sashas blood from the buttplate and buttstock then went to the marine from whod hed taken it and handed it back thankee for the loan private leggett is it he said in much calmer takings almost as casually as if hed merely taken it to inspect it and had found no fault uh aye sir leggett sir the stunned marine stammered uhm thankee fer cleanin it sir get him there he is haul him in quick there a babble of voices cried instructions and encouragements to which lewrie paid no heed as he rinsed his handkerchief in the frigid water butt once somewhat clean and wrung out lewrie looked up to see lt ballard goggling at him deeply frowning what mister ballard lewrie asked the son of a bitch tried tmurder me at his lilylivered masters orders youve a problem with that where might one begin sir arthur ballard gravelled almost too disgusted to speak his normally placid features atwist in a grimace and untypical emotion in his voice as if he gazed upon a rotting pile of entrails and offal aswarm with fat flies it was murder on your part sir and i arthur he had it coming lewrie pointed out do not presume to excuse me sir ballard said choking back whatever objections he had before he became openly insubordinate to a senior officer his face turned stony his eyes indifferent and hooded ill say no more for now captain lewrie he said turning away to return to the quarterdeck from the gangway bastards a goner sir lt farley came back from the bulwarks to report with a hasty doff of his hat bashed his head in when he struck the stempost of the gig then went under drowned it appears sir that or the icecold water finished his business serves him right might i say sir god only knows what treachery foreigners are capable of get your dirk back mister tillyard lewrie enquired looking about the deck to his saviours stout lad and quick thinkin ttug me out of his reach thankee my pleasure sir midshipman tillyard said trying to come over all modest as befitted british heroes lieutenant eades sir my commendations to private leggett sergeant crick and private him there lewrie continued with his praise private degan aye and your quick actions sir lopped off his thumb was it aye sir lt eades replied more prone to preening than tillyard and all but buffing his fingernails on his red coat fellow was perspiring as cold as it is i should have twigged to that but put it down to his efforts to carry the last of our passengers dunnage no matter lieutenant eades you did for him lewrie said with a grin thankee mister ballard sir the first officer replied from the quarterdeck turning to face lewrie with his hands behind his back soon as the gigs back alongside well rig the boats for towing astern lewrie instructed weve spent enough time close ashore what might soon become a hostile country once everyone is inboard haul us in to short stays and get the ship under way i wish us tbe as far west of kronstadt as possible by the end of the first dog very good sir lt ballard crisply replied as though nought had passed between them lewrie went to the shoreward bulwark to watch the gig pull for the town count rybakov sat sullen and slumped on a thwart looking deeply sad count levotchkin sat on another with sashas soggy body resting against his shins and could have been weeping with his failure wish itd been him not his man lewrie thought feeling that the affair twixt him and that young fool would have to be finished sometime in the future without count rybakov around the next time or someone else as levelheaded and there would be no stopping that arrogant shit lewrie raised his gaze it was rapidly growing dark as it did in such high latitudes not even five bells of the day watch and dusk was gathering and with it the cold and the wind a wind from out of the noreast a fleshfreezing wind from the north pole it felt like an icy wind that perfectly matched captain lewries mood well that was an exciting hour or so lt farley muttered as he and the other officers conferred forward of the binnacle cabinet as thermopylae sprinted westward from the gulf of finland in the darkness lt farley was about to conclude his stint of watchstanding and his good friend lt fox was about to take over at the end of the second dog watch lt eades was there as well for one of the gifts count rybakov had left behind was several boxes of cigars which the captain had passed on to the gunroom though they couldnt smoke them below wonder who this tess they spoke of is lt fox said with a roll of his eyes a cut above your runofthemill seaport doxy im bound one might say she comes highly recommended what a russian aristocrat and the captain hmm is he not married though lt farley pointed out when did that ever stop a fellow lt fox chuckled back now you are being crude sir lt ballard standing with them cautioned one may only hope mister ballard the irrepressible lt fox rejoined to be crude sir ballard snapped to wangle an introduction sir fox cheekily explained my word but so far this voyage has been bags more exciting than the whole past year entire under poor old captain speaks lt farley said changing the subject to something less risky just going to say lt fox was quick to agree puffing happily on his cigar uncanny this the sailing master mr lyle said by way of greeting after a peek at the compass and a report from the chiplog aft shes clapping on seven and a half knots even under reduced sail by dawn we should be well west of reval and exiting the gulf of finland may we imagine that the captains seals whistled up this fortunate wind for us gentlemen for i cannot think of a better and at just the right time too uncanny indeed mister lyle marine lieutenant eades agreed so many things about this voyage have been just saying lt farley stuck in quick thinking sir lyle said to eades thought youd hack that russian in half for a moment not for want of trying mister lyle lt eades was happy to explain again that hide coat of his though might as well have been plate steel like knights of old else i wouldve laid his backbone open all over a whore mr lyle sourly commented well lyle slyly added quickly glancing between his fellow officers i believe captain lewries name of ramcat in the fleet is not for his choice of pets alone hmm must be hellishfetching lt fox most wistfully said ahem from the brooding lt ballard your pardons mister ballard lyle said but i was merely speculating that our new captain is a man of many parts just so mister lyle lt farley chimed in a man of many parts indeed lt arthur ballard coughed into his mittened fist and cleared his throat in a pointed way to silence further speculations discussing rumours about senior officers was simply not done not even in the privacy of the gunroom for it led to insubordination and undermined a commanding officers authority dignity and proper discipline you served under him before mister ballard lyle continued undaunted i thought you said you had dear god above has he always been so bold that was a safer word than the one lyle had first composed gentlemen ballard said in the darkness turned away from the dim illumination in the compass binnacle so they did not see how his face clouded i will say this and no more and let there be an end to such he paused for a long moment carefully choosing his words so he would not be guilty of the same violation captain lewrie has ever had a mercurial streak you sirs have no idea of how many parts is captain lewrie made p b q almost time ya idysodar charochko roughly you son of a whore mother chapter thirtysix uncannily the winds perhaps the sea gods turned perverse to thermopylae once clear of the gulf of finland a souwesterly gale sprang up and blew for days of spitting snow sleet icy rains and stinging spray forcing the frigate to tack away sutherly to claw off the maze of isles and shoals of southwest finland shortboarding to the westnorwest for a single watch to gain enough searoom for a long board on the opposite tack round south by east for two watches each leg bashed out closehauled under reduced sail with the coasts of the russianoccupied provinces of latvia lithuania and poland a dreaded risk before the bows even after the storm blew itself out they still relied on deadreckoning with no clear idea of where they were and the sun hidden behind a continual low overcast even capt hardcastle experienced as he was in the baltic could not even hazard a guess and when all concurred that they might be near the th line of latitude and could finally steer west a westerly wind arose that smacked them square in the face forcing them to shorttack their way along the th latitude perhaps with the rocky coast of sweden off their starboard side somewhere out there in the haze and morning fogs to everyones amazement the wind at last went round to the norwest and the skies cleared so that a little after dawn of the twentyeighth of march they found themselves within two leagues of a tiny archipelago of wee barren islets off sweden capt hardcastle was beside himself in joy for he recognised them we are at the soueast corner of sweden sir capt hardcastle exclaimed just about to enter the hanцbukten that means were not fifteen miles from the main channel to their naval port of karlskrona he said with an urgent jab at the chart pinned to the traverse board lets stand in closer ashore then mister ballard and smoak em out lewrie exulted do what we came for by god which they did fetchingto within two miles of the entrance to look the place over with their strongest telescopes discovering that the swedes too had readied their fleet for war with masts set up and yards crossed with sails bent on well part of their fleet for they could only espy ten ships of worth that appeared ready for sea none of the powerful first or second rates with all but one looking as short and bluff as older third rate s and three of the readied ships were frigates dont seem to have their hearts in it do they sir lewrie commented to lt ballard after hed come down from the fighting top of the mainmast the swedes couldve put over twentyfive ships to sea were they of a mind so i heard from earlier accounts of naval action in the baltic im sure i do not know why so few sir ballard replied his lips pursed he showed a remarkable lack of curiosity in the matter i suppose we should be grateful theyre still iced in lewrie informed him good sir from ballard no ones blastin burnin or choppin them a channel out lewrie further said must be a lack o peasants yonder arthur ballard nodded feeling prompted to respond somehow a lot of iceskatin bears in the entrance channel though sir lt ballard asked with a raised brow as if hed only been halflistening never mind mister ballard lewrie said with a wave of his hand though he was fuming inside do you launch the cutter and send them to the edge of the ice for samples perhaps captain hardcastle may employ his expertise with such and tell us how much longer they will be cooped up in harbour very good sir ballard said perking up with a clear order and a duty to perform and damn yer eyes arthur ballard lewrie thought highly irked and just about ready to call his conduct mute insubordination whats got into him he asked himself for the thousandth time from then on the fickle weather and winds turned more benign as they stood away from karlskrona the westerlies backed norwesterly so they could run with the wind on thermopylaes starboard quarter to sail south of bornholm island and once they had bornholm abeam the winds swung right round to the north allowing them a long beam reach towards denmark even closereaching at west by north then beating to weather at westnorwest as they closed the coast and the sun made its appearance just often enough over the next four days to give them a much more accurate position to plot each noon towards sundown of that last evening both mr lyle and capt hardcastle could agree that the land that smeared the forrud horizon was the point below kioge bay a large anchorage below copenhagen so now well see if the wars started while we were away lewrie grimly told himself lowering his telescope and compacting it segment by segment with slow clicks and if well get out of the baltic back to the fleet wherever the devil they are in one piece time to tack sir the sailing master prompted aye lewrie decided aloud though theres not much room for us to make a board over towards sweden well not weather the holland deep on short tacks might have to come to anchor and wait for a wind shift dont see us towing the ship up the sound with our boats aye sir mr lyle said with a glimmer of dry humour hands in the small of his back and rocking on his shoe heels not if the danes object to us tweaking their noses a second time perhaps captain hardcastles twoknot current to carry us along but against a northerly deck there a lookout shouted down through cupped hands with a phlegmy rasp from too many days of foul weather and evenings below decks in damp sodden clothing clammy bedding and the close airless fug of close quarters ships ahead warships three points off the starbd bows anchored with ridin lights an taffrail lanthorns lit god help us if the danes have got their ships out mr lyle whispered scrambling for a telescope mister furlow lewrie called for one of the midshipmen of the watch aloft with you and report ayeaye sir furlow replied dashing for the weather shrouds of the mainmast lewrie extended his own glass and crossed over to the starboard side to the mizenmast stays and clambered atop one of the quarterdeck carronades then to the top of the bulwarks with one arm lopped through the stays yes there were ships to the north near what he took for the entrance to the kings deep east of amager island and perhaps sheltering under the danish batteries there one or two of them stood out like whales compared to the rest big towering threedeckers of the first or second rates most definitely warships no lewrie told himself not under amager island theyre just off the lower tip of the middle ground outside the reach of the guns ashore whose dammit do the danes have that many do they own any first rate threedeckers sir midshipman furlow shouted down from his perch atop the crosstrees above the main mast fighting top our flags sir blue ensign on the biggest red on another theyre our fleet sir very good mister furlow lewrie shouted upwards collapsing his telescope again and hopping down as spryly as he suddenly felt mister ballard stations to come about to the larboard tack and we will shorttack to join our ships yonder have my gig and boat crew ready soon as we come to anchor ill row over to the flagship and report ayeaye sir chapter thirtyseven lewrie where the devil have you sprung from capt thomas foley of hms elephant the third rate that flew viceadmiral lord nelsons flag exclaimed in wonder as hms thermopylaes captain gained the starboard gangway and took his salute greenland by the look of it foley wryly commented as he took in lewries swaddling furs i was amazed when you made your private signal and number joining us from the south captain foley sir lewrie replied with a sheepish smile and doff of his cocked hat which was one of the few items visible marking him as an officer of the royal navy or an englishman for that matter just returned from a reconnaisance of the russian and swedish harbours sir and some diplomatic tosh the admiral is aboard elephant last i heard at yarmouth roads he was to have a first rate shifted his flag to a vessel of lesser draught for this danish business sir foley said thankfully feeling not a whit insulted that lewrie might be making a backhanded disparagement of his ship i must report to him captain foley is he busy lewrie asked frightfully foley replied lord nelson even now is dictating the orders for our attack on the danes then i dont spose what well face once weve settled them is done matters that much at the moment lewrie said slumping with disappointment hed imagined a grand welcome with hearty congratulations all round a toast drunk in his honour perhaps even some light applause upon his dashing entrance and his lessthandire discoveries dye think i should call upon sir hyde he asked wondering if hed get a better reception there after only getting a new active commission by the skin of his teeth lewrie had hoped that his duties up the baltic might turn at least a few heads and restore his reputation with admiralty oh lord dont do that lewrie capt foley cynically scoffed admiral parker has quite enough on his plate at the moment worrying about the danes i gather foley said leaning closer to impart his inside information that whenever the subject of the russians arises sir hyde is like to come down with the ague and the vapours hmm lewrie gawped his head cocked over in confusion in any event it would take you the better part of the night to reach hms london foley breezed off for admiral parker with eight ships of the line is now anchored off the northern end of the middle ground above copenhagen and the three crowns fortress lord nelson with rearadmiral graves in defiance command here were to sail in against the danes and take them on from the south as soon as we get a favourable slant of wind weve twelve of the line altogether with captain riou and the frigates and lesser ships best we forward your written report to sir hyde and your frigate remain here sir every warship is welcome and i am bound that captain riou will find your fifth rate and its artillery doubly welcome i have a copy for admiral parker with me lewrie told foley groping into the canvas despatch bag slung over his shoulder if you would be so kind as to have it sent on captain foley ive another for lord nelson though none for rearadmiral graves youll need your orders from lord nelson in any event sir capt foley decided summoning a lieutenant to his side and ordering that he should signal an officer from one of the lighter vessels to come aboard and bear the report to the viceadmiral will you come aft with me to lord nelsons quarters for something warming sir foley kindly offered once that business was done most thankfully sir lewrie eagerly responded in hms elephants greatcabins under the poop deck lewrie was shown into the presence of viceadmiral of the blue lord nelson who at that moment was lying in his bedcot propped up by several pillows and dictating to several clerks and lieutenants all scribbling away as he spoke a cabin servant with unruly black hair and pugface features was scuttling round like a mother hen offering another quilt to spread atop the other bed covers and nelsons chequered overcoat hot drink steamed on a brazier for the sideboard and every stick of furniture but for the bedcot and some portable writing desks had been struck to the orlop already and in contrast to lewries frigate where those franklin stoves had been rerigged and stoked now she was securely at anchor elephants greatcabins were perishing cold and but dimly lit captain lewrie of the thermopylae frigate is come my lord foley said in a soft voice unwilling to intrude too loudly lewrie that scoundrel lord nelson exclaimed in his squeaky high voice peering querulously at the new arrivals with his one good eye and a slim almost girlish hand over the blind one as if it yet pained him yours is the fifth rate that came to anchor just after full dark sir it is my lord lewrie replied fresh come from the baltic the russians nelson snapped looking ill and impatient you were the one lord saint vincent ordered to scout them out how many one first rate three second rates and twelve third rates at reval along with three more i took for sixtyfours or lesser sir lewrie rattled off from memory nine frigates two third rates still stripped to a gantline and bomb vessels at kronstadt my lord and as of a week ago still iced in though the russians have thousands of people choppin burnin and blastin a single channel its the same with the swedes at karlskrona my lord three frigates only one third rate and six sixtyfours or fiftyeights with their masts set up and yards crossed and theyre still iced in too ah lord nelson said with a long pleased sigh reclining on the pillows and looking up at the overhead with a smile if he aint halfdead aready hes doin a hellishgood imitation lewrie thought as he undid his fur coat in his brief experience with nelson in the mediterranean in and at the battle of cape st vincent in the man had always struck him as a frail sort as pale and wan as a consumptive most of the time he was barely a couple of inches over five feet tall damned near as short as the reverend william wilberforce and it was only combat or the prospect of coming action that livened nelson up like an old horse feagued with a plug of ginger up its fundament to fool an unwary buyer some more hot tea acomin sir the illfeatured manservant fussed all but lifting his masters shoulders and putting the mug to his lips like an invalid he cast lewrie a ferocious scowl as if he had barged his way into the privacy of the sickbed nighboilin hot from the brazier sir drink it down now fore it cools damme it must be a midget reunion lewrie thought figuring the cabin servant was not a quimhair taller than nelson a copy of captain lewries written report has just this minute been sent along to viceadmiral parker my lord captain foley said oh lord thatll put the wind up him nelson moaned between sips of his steaminghot tea dont i get any lewrie silently groused its freezin in here sir hyde simply will not contemplate their existence nelson petulantly griped or that meeting them in battle and defeating them is the principal aim of this expedition of our orders it was all i could do to convince the man to enter the sound at all and dare the guns of kronborg castle for days we dithered sir hyde thinking we should come at copenhagen through the great belt passage which would have taken weeks most dilatory when the main thing is to go right at them before any of the baltic powers get their entire fleets out to sea and combined now dont fret yourself sir the wee manservant gently chid him for were here and ready tsettle the danesis hash thomas you cosset me like a mother cat with her kittens the viceadmiral said with a fond smile relenting from his brief rant a rant that had put colour in his cheeks thomas allen lewrie my longtime man nelson explained tea for captain lewrie thomas aye sir allen said though he still kept a wary eye on the eskimolooking interloper your weight of metal lewrie nelson demanded looking healthier than he had a couple of minutes before thermopylaes an eighteenpounder thirtyeight my lord capt lewrie crisply responded where do you wish us under captain riou to reenforce his group of frigates lord nelson replied his amazon is also a thirtyeight simply one hell of a fellow is riou and a man after mine own heart ive put blanche under captain hamond captain sutton and alcmene captain bolton and his arrow and captain devonshires dart under rious command along with the fox and otter cutters to assist the liners assigned to the van of the line a brace of thirties a thirtysix and a thirtytwo now a pair of thirtyeights as well adding your frigate to the amazon might be best before the evenings done lewrie nelson said as he awkwardly cradled his mug of tea with his one remaining hand to be rowed over to amazon and speak with captain riou he rearadmiral graves and i formulated the general plan for taking on the danes so riou will be able to explain the salient points all thats wanting is word from captain hardys reconnoiter into the kings deep weve had to survey and rebuoy the holland deep capt foley explained so thats sure now as for the kings deep splendid fellow hardy lord nelson interrupted demanded him as captain of the saint joseph then the saint george when the first one wouldnt do he and several others are out even now in all this cold charting and marking the deepwater passage into the kings deep and copenhagen roads what charts we have are next to useless and the civilian masters and pilots we brought along are asses they tell us that the deep channel is along the middle ground yet we have noted large danish warships anchored in deep water close to the city on the land side the nearest one the provensteenen we know is a cutdown threedecker not two miles off from us well she might be sittin in the mud my lord lewrie said as the promised mug of tea at last arrived even so thatd mean at least four fathom and a bit perhaps five fathoms close by in which the danes moved her into position he took a sip and it was nowhere near the nighboilin hot that the steward thomas allen had promised there was no sugar and no milk either allen all but smirked at him with an affronted so there expression and a go away instanter to boot passed kronborg castle did ye say captain foley lewrie said the danes didnt score a single hit sir foley told him with a chuckle and the swedish batteries cross the sound did not join in either his bright blue eyes were agleam with amusement it was but a short noisy passage sound and fury signifying nothing we exchanged salutes when i sailed down lewrie told him with a matching grin he had to look up slightly for capt thomas foley was six feet tall perhaps the only humansized man in the cabins besides lewrie an impressivelooking fellow with curly darkbrown hair first thing lewrie lord nelson piped up from his blankets and cot be sure to pass a cable out from a stern port and be ready to come to anchor by your stern opposite the foe i choose for you i intend should the winds come sutherly to sail in in lineahead and match broadsides til the danes have had enough i shall my lord lewrie answered and took another big gulp of his tea it was now tepid so he drained it off completely well ill be on my way sir lewrie began refastening his furs by the by lewrie nelson enquired your legal troubles they are quite behind you completely exonerated my lord lewrie replied though taking note of the viceadmirals dubious expression and the toplofty tone to his voice as though he thought very little of naval officers stealing slaves even to man their ships for englands vital service such passionate beliefs as abolition captain lewrie nelson sternly intoned are best left to civilians who argue the matters in parliament our sovereigns privy council or the parlours of the dogooders sea officers holding active commission may espouse opinions on such matters but not act upon them nelson relented and lewrie could breathe again for the viceadmiral would not tear a strip of hide from his arse nelsons mouth cocked up in a wry little grin you were lucky very lucky i was indeed my lord lewrie agreed grinning himself as are you the nation believes my irish tars even think you are possessed of a beannacht a good cess superstitious tripe nelson snapped turning stern once more we make our own good fortune through boldness and courage perhaps by dawn tomorrow we will prove fortunate gainst the danes without blindly depending on mumbojumbo amulets and charms or slivers of the true cross like spaniards and irishmen courage boldness and audacity will win the day that and the steadiness of our tars lewries little stab at toadying of pissing down his back which nelson found tedious shut him up he answered with a firm and determined nod spend your passion and your cess on the danes lewrie nelson said with a piercing look i shall sir lewrie promised bowing his way out of the after part of the cabins in the forward part midshipmen were gathered round several lanthorns or candlesticks painfully scribbling away at sheafs of paper copying out nelsons dictates as they came page by halting page from nelsons mind and lips edgar will anchor abreast of number five a lieutenant was slowly reading off the latest page to them a sixtyfour gun ship or hulk the ardent got that all of you good ah ardent to pass edgar and anchor abreast of numbers six and seven lewrie heard as he stepped out into the icy cold of a clear moonless night britainmight love him but lord he can be a tartar lewrie thought as he stuffed his muffler higher round his throat hed been on the receiving end of nelsons temper in the mediterranean when in command of hms jester and though nelson might look like the most inoffensive minnikin ever born a natural merry andrew when rowed beyond all temperance mad enough to kick furniture his tongue could peel paint and varnish melt tar and ignite oakum spose i got off easy lewrie imagined though a man as much in love with glory and praise as he should be easier to kiss up winds coming about he heard one of hms elephants officers comment to his fellows who were gathered by the larboard bulwarks in a small shivering knot its come more westerly perhaps with just a touch of southing stand in on a beamreach then another muttered back my pardons sirs lewrie said going to join them might i enquire where captain rious amazon is anchored uhm yonder sir one of them pointed over to starboard closer to the southwest tip of the middle ground just past bellona sir and a hands breadth astern of her from where we stand ah yes lewrie said with a nod as he followed the officers outstretched arm thankee kindly ill have to row over to her and speak with riou before midnight he turned back to grin his thanks to them and noted the lights cross the way off the larboard bows that sparkled like faint amber glims against the darkness of amager island and ran northerly up the coast of sjжlland the much larger island on which copenhagen stood up to the city then far beyond it the line of sparkles ran mine arse lewrie said realising that he was looking at the danish fleet anchored in a long protective line they arent all of em ships of the line are they a great many floating rafts sir one officer replied with a chuckle razeed and dismasted old hulks or just big rafts turned into gun batteries aboukir bay snickered another just like the french at the battle of the nile anchored close ashore no more than a cable off the land some of them another of them opined so we maynt sail round their off sides as the admiral did at the nile yet yet not close enough together in lineahead to be able to support each other as were the french a third chuckled foolish they aim and shoot as poorly as did the gunners at kronborg on our way here well two hours pounding should finish em the first imagined hellish lot of em though lewrie thought frowning thisun could be a real bugger twenty or more and it struck him just how odd it was for two navies to lie anchored just out of maximum range of each otherfrom the west edge of the middle ground shoal where the british fleet sat it wasnt over two miles to the closest of the danish hulks with the loan of one of the officers telescopes he could clearly see the scurry on the old cutdown threedecker as danish sailors prepared their defences for the morning should the wind come fair like ancient armies he muttered returning the glass night before julius caesar took on the gauls or somebody two camps fires lit tkeep warm and eat and the battlefield between very like sir indeed one of elephants lieutenants agreed seems rather eerie dont it it dont seem naval at all sir lewrie stamped his cold feet and shrugged deeper into his furs luck tye all sirs he said in parting touching the brim of his cocked hat in casual salute before heading for the entryport and his shivering waiting boat crew im off chapter thirtyeight maundy thursday thermopylaes third officer said half to himself as he blew on his gloved hands to warm them second of april in the year of our lord eighteen ohone hmm marine lt eades idly asked tis maundy thursday eades lt fox said louder we came in on the first and now its maundy thursday grim back home in england churches would be stripping down all the decorations draping crosses in mourning cloths and divine services would be conducted without music or hymns in sombre grief following the crucifixion and their saviours death on golgotha must we fight the danes on a holy day id much prefer one more hopeful like tomorrow good friday fox added his voice cautious as he sidled closer to the immaculately turnedout marine officer even easter sunday would be ah well he trailed off looking aloft to the comissioning pendant atop the mainmast which streamed towards the danish fleet on a wind that had come sou easterly during the dawn it could be deemed a lack of courage to express doubts or fears too openly ah lt eades replied with a wry bark resurrection just so lt fox said with a nod but heres the wind and here we are so i suppose well be going in get it over with lt eades said chin up and determined even if his mittened fingers continually flexed on the hilt of his sword in nervousness waitings the rum part though our captain seems to be coping they both looked aft to see capt alan lewrie turned out in his bestdress uniform with both his medals swaddling furs traded for his grogram boatcloak at last capt lewrie was sipping a last hot mug of tea and chewing on a thick fattybacon sandwich between bites he was chatting with the second officer lt dick farley and looking as unperturbed as the royal navy wished of its officers mmm lt ballard the first officer wryly commented having caught part of foxs and eadess conversation perhaps the captains seals will look after us sirs he seemed to scoff it was such an odd departure from ballards usual taciturn nature that both officers gawped in surprise unsure whether ballard was making a subtle jape or being slyly insubordinate boat ahoy midshipman tillyard called to the approaching gig though all could see that it was their sailing master mr lyle along with their civilian adviser capt hardcastle returning midshipman sealey their eldest and the captains coxn liam desmond could be seen in the sternsheets as they conned the gig smartly alongside the ships side desmond and the boat crew had had a busy night and an equally busy morning at am the flagship had signalled captains of the fleet are to come to the admiral requiring lewrie to be rowed out to elephant for final instructions barely had lewrie returned when the flagship had hoisted a signal to summon all masters and pilots alls in order mister lyle capt lewrie asked once the man was back on the quarterdeck alls not sir lyle spat the spineless puling lotta the merchant masters and pilots have refused to conn our ships in captain lewrie capt hardcastle supplied demurred i think the kindest word would be should be flung in irons flogged keelhauled mr lyle fumed were they navy masters they would be i dont know where admiralty dredged up the fools sir capt hardcastle stuck in they insist the deep channels alongside of the middle ground and the shore side of the kings deep is too shoal but we can all see thats wrong equidistant of the shoal and the foe and well have five six fathom sure sir hoist from the flag sir midshipman furlow shouted its a special number fourteen he looked quickly through his slim ledger book for the sheet of addendums of nelsons own devising prepare for battle with springs on the anchors and the end of the sheet cables taken in by a stern port sir he translated very well mister furlow lewrie replied mister ballard bring the ship to quarters if ye please furniture seachests and personal belongings deal partitions and temporary bulkheads had been struck to the orlop hours before as had the franklin stoves once their fires had been staunched and their embers and ashes cast overside chain slings and antiboarding nets had been rigged while lewrie had been aboard the flag soon after the hands had stowed their hammocks and breakfasted the galley fires had been extinguished half an hour before with lewries last mug of tea warmed in hot sand in the brick fireboxes below the cauldrons and the spring and kedge anchor cable had been laid out just after the hands had finished sweeping sanding and scrubbing the decks so hms thermopylae had just been waiting for vice admiral nelsons order bosuns calls piped all hands and dimmock and pulley roared orders the marine drummer began the long roll with the aid of the fifer and thermopylae shuddered as hundreds of men spilled up companionway ladders from the faint warmth of their berthdeck to the guns bowsings were cast off cold barrels and truckcarriages tackle was laid out for free running and the guns run in to the extent of the breeching ropes rams spongers and worms appeared from stowage over the mess tables which themselves were now hinged up and lashed out of the way crowlevers were laid out to help shift the carriages and guncaptains were issued the removable flintlock strikers the trigger lines and priming wires used to puncture powder cartridges once seated in the breeches along with powder quills should the strikers fail decks were sanded and wetted for traction and the water tubs between the guns were topped up for sponging between shots and slowmatch was issued to be coiled about the tubs with the lit end trapped in a notch hanging over the water to ignite the quills the old way barefoot powder monkeys went below to queue up before the felt and leather screens at the door of the magazine the screens properly wetted and weighted at the bottoms to keep out sparks which could send the tons of gunpowder stored within off in a titanic blast inside the magazine the master gunner mr tunstall his mate shallcross and the yeoman of the powder bohanon in list slippers and leather aprons passed out the first sewn cartridge bags which the powder monkeys put into their leather or wooden cylinders tompions were removed from the muzzles and guncaptains chose the roundest truest shot from the rope garlands or hatchway racks for the first broadsides turning them over and over in their hands until satisfied load and the powder monkeys darted forward from the centreline of the deck and handed cartridges to the loaders then once more dashed below for another while loaders shoved cartridge down the iron throats of the guns and the rammer men thumped them home roundshot came next to be thumped in place too followed by damp waddings up ports and the gunport lids were lowered their blood red inner faces making a chequerboard against the wide pale yellow horizontal hull stripe run out and gun crews threw themselves on the tackles heaving til the truckcarriages thudded against the bulwarks the wooden wheels and their ungreased axles rumbling and sqealing the runout tackles blocked to the ring bolts set into the deck were overhauled as were the recoil tackles and guncaptains and senior quarter gunners stuck one hand in the air to show that they were ready and which was first the powder monkeys returned with their second cartridges and knelt amidships where they would bide til the artillery fired and a further supply of propellant charge was needed marines at quarters sir lt eades reported with a doff of his hat sharpshooters were in the fighting tops of each mast a file of marines were posted down both sailtending gangways and seasoldiers with bayonetted muskets stood guard at each companionway hatch to make sure that from that moment only officers powder monkeys midshipmen or the surgeons loblolly boys with their stretchers to fetch wounded to the orlop surgery could go below or come up arms chests opened and weapons ready to hand as well very good sir lewrie replied the ship as at quarters sir lt ballard reported a moment later capital mister ballard now heave us in to short stays and ready to upanchor lewrie bade him wiping his fingers of fattybacon and mustard smears then his mouth on his pocket handkerchief hoist from the flag sir midshipman furlow piped up the preparative sir by god were really goin tdo it lewrie marvelled wondering why he was so calm for a rare once total lack o sleep last night i spose his cabin steward pettus took away his tin plate and pewter mug and headed below take good care of the catlings pettus aye i will sir two reefs in the topsls tbegin with mister ballard lewrie said offhandedly scowling at the sky the pendant and the state of the waters of the kings deep new signal sir midshipman furlow cried number sixtyeight were right here mister furlow lewrie chid him with a laugh were not gundeaf yet so theres no need tshout save your lungs for later when its really noisy watch for the preparative to be struck down calmly does it else you set a bad example for the men hmm came from lt ballard almost a snort of disbelief mister ballards your model mister furlow lewrie chuckled quite unlike me but im a postcaptain and allowed my eccentricities shout and cheer do i feel like it do i not lieutenant ballard he asked sidling up to the first officer oh of old sir ballard gruffly replied staring forward always have been enthusiastic lewrie prosed on pacing til he was before ballards vision and peering at him prettymuch like lord nelson over yonder it works for him right sir with no experience serving under that worthy sir i cannot in good conscience say one way or the other lt ballard intoned the preparative is down sir midshipman furlow announced in calmer takings though he was up on his tiptoes with excitement weigh the outer or leeward ships first sir weigh mister ballard lewrie snapped and in the din of the capstan clacking round the stamp of sailors breasting to the bars and the groan of the cable of the best bower coming in through the hawseholes lewrie stepped even closer to ballards right ear i swear i dont know what your problem seems to be with me btcab mister ballard but you come over mutely insubordinate you sneer at me one more time and i will see you below in irons sir he harshly whispered lt arthur ballard halfturned his head towards lewrie swallowing what bile had sprung to the base of his throat what reply he would have made then grimly nodded his sundarkened seaweathered face going red as he stamped to the hammock nettings to be about his duties sails sprang aloft even as the best bower was rung up catted and fished and thermopylae paid off the breeze from her anchorage a faint wake beginning to form as she gained a bit of steerageway among the many warships preparing for battle slowly threading her way to join up with capt rious hms amazon a tune there lewrie yelled desmond gather the lads and carry us in a moment later and the marine drummer lad the fifer desmond and his uilleann pipes and the ships fiddler began one misty moisty morning a gay uplifting tune sailors began to stamp their feet in time and several bellowed out the brief repeating chorus of and how dye do and how dye do and how dye do again whenever it came round flags flying from every masthead reefed topsls forecourses and jibs standing the squadron of twelve lineofbattle ships stood on towards the kings deep channel and the waiting danish guns sorting themselves out into lineahead formation with bomb vessels falling in trail their seamortars prepared to throw shells into the quintus and sixtus bastions either side of the entrance to copenhagens main naval harbour and the arsenal with six frigates and several armed cutters accompanying them with barges full of army troops idling out of gunrange awaiting the call to land and assault copenhagen itself uhm viceadmiral sir hyde parkers squadron sir hardcastle said with a worried look on his face last i heard from the civilian masters when we convened aboard the flagship his part of the fleet was anchored above the middle ground far above the trekroner fort aye captain hardcastle lewrie asked well sir it strikes me that a favourable wind for us will be a dead muzzler for him and the other eight ships of the line so he was to sail the same time as us aye lewrie said with a faint grin though itll take his ships hours to cover the distance before they can be brought to action the danes wont even pay him the slightest bit of attention somehow id wager that admiral nelson had that in mind sir the greater the glory the fewer to share it god help us capt hardcastle said with a shudder he could have left the ship his duty done and been safely a witness aboard sir hydes flagship hms london as safe as houses but hed decided to stay and see a naval battle once in his life hardcastle had a pair of pistols in his overcoat pockets and a borrowed cutlass slung on a baldric over his shoulder but they felt of a sudden the frailest pretension and he found himself suppressing an nighuncontrollable shudder in his lower limbs and stomach ye really think captain riou told me that parker and nelson despise each other by now lewrie told him with a wink and that nelson is sure that sir hyde shouldve stayed in bed with his sheetanchor his wee batterpudding than be trusted with a battle fleet dont know really but ive seen nelson in action before and if anyone can pull this off then hes your boy mad as a hatter he is as a march hare god help us capt hardcastle muttered again as thermopylae came level with hms cruizer anchored off of the very end of the middle ground to act as a marker which all other ships would leave well to starboard the frigates impromptu band struck up an even livelier tune staines morris a village dancing song that most knew from the spring maypole performances incongruous yet uplifting aboard hms glatton guns capt william bligh of the mutiny fame scowled and snapped who is in command over there lewrie sir his first officer replied the ramcat fie on such false enthusiasms bligh grumbled thats no way to take a ship into battle or anywhere else of course sir his first lieutenant pretended to agree and why the devil are they barking capt bligh fumed chapter thirtynine this could quickly go tshit lewrie told himself agamemnon had gone aground on the middle ground shoal early on requiring hasty signals from elephant to reorder the line of battle a moment after that the nearest danish ships hulks and floating batteries opened fire great belching clouds of powder smoke erupted to leeward from heavy pieces upwards of pounder guns and the roar of the broadsides crashed as loud as a summers lightning and thunder storm shot moaned past and overhead as deepvoiced as a chorus of bassos and baritones and the shallow waters of the kings deep were speckled with geysers and feather plumes as iron shot dapped across the surface in first and second graze then to make things even worse both hms bellona and the hms russell third rate s down for the task of hammering the trekroner forts took the ground on an uncharted spur of sand and mud shoal about halfway to their anchorages and could not be got off either signal from amazon sir midshipman furlow said with a gulp our number and conform on me sir half a point to starboard mister ballard and fall in trail of amazon lewrie snapped at the earlymorning conference aboard elephant nelson had given capt riou the liberty of acting as he saw fit with his small squadron of frigates but what the devils he aimin at lewrie wondered as thermopylae closed on amazons larboard quarter about two cables astern of her our number again sir and the signal is make more sail shake one reef from the topsls mister ballard lewrie ordered as topmen scrambled aloft and out on the topsl yards he took a look to the west where hundreds of guns perhaps a thousand guns were hammering away with a speed hed never seen from the french or the spanish thermopylae had sailed past eight danish ships by then coming level with the ninth a corvettesized th rate blasting away with some impossibly heavy guns for such a small warship and another even larger north of her a hulked twodecker with only a stump mast amidships yet flying an admirals flag hurriedly firing what looked to be pounders and pounders it felt as if every shot was aimed at thermopylae for the continuous rumbles and howls of shot passing overhead of splashes in the water between their frigate and the danes there was a crash aloft as the main tgallant yard was smashed in two like a pencil to come screeching and snarling down in pieces and a shower of ropes blocks and ravelled sail not so bad so far lewrie said with a grin he did not feel see to it mister ballard he looked astern and found support in the form of twodeckers in rough lineahead behind them not all of them for the sternmost were lost in a thick pall of spent gunsmoke but he could make out the edgar and ardent just coming to anchor by the stern as ordered with blighs glatton rightastern off the starboard quarter bellona and russell though still hard aground on the shoals unseen spur were firing deliberate broadsides at long range back westward they were just coming level with elephant and capt hardys ganges with riou in amazon leading the frigates round monarchs starboard quarters to pass them and go on further north shall we fire sir lt ballard asked none of em are our pigeons sir lewrie told him though he was impatient to let loose not swan on by without responding do we fire i want the first broadside tbe a smasher at a target thatll matter a few minutes more let the damned danes guess which of em will feel our sting lewrie wished he could fancy that thermopylaes aloof silence might unnerve whichever danish ship she took under fire but from the sound of it the danes were too busy to be unnerved as in all seabattles where over an hundred guns bellowed and roared the shock of gunfire seemed to smash the very wind to nothing and thermopylae slowed as amazon led them to the starboard side of the defiance now anchored and duelling it out with one of those floating gunrafts a twodecker still shiprigged with three masts and yet another of those older twodecker hulks with a single stump mast almost all the others have come to anchor sir mr lyle said all our twodeckers are now in action leaving us christ lewrie spat as the trekroner fort the three crowns behemoth loomed up off their larboard bows riou cant be serious surely he thought appalled at the very idea of frigates engaging a stone fort belching fire and smoke from an hundred or more cannon upon which their pounder shot would merely bounce or harmlessly shatter come to anchor by the stern sir midshipman furlow cried well anchor three cables astern of amazon mister ballard lewrie said ready to let go the kedge when i call ayeaye sir ballard said his voice steady stolid and as stoic as ever the jolly thresher and hey johnny cope strained to rise above the earshattering din of gunfire as hms thermopylae eased to a stop at last spare hands aloft to take in sail and bind it to the yards desmond thankee lads but were in business lewrie called take your posts range to the fort mister ballard i would estimate it to be eight hundred yards sir ballard decided sounding emotionless though his full lips were tautpursed and his left hand quivered on the scabbard of his sword that stumpmasted twodeckers much closer lewrie said with a grunt of how useless it would be to waste their fire on the fortress and its stonework well engage her hands to the springs sir and place her square abeam a long minute or so and the danish warship was on a line with thermopylae that put her directly amidships mister farley lewrie shouted down to the waist leaning over the hammock nettings at the break of the quarterdeck broadsides on that big bastard yonder ayeaye sir lt farley eagerly replied ordering prime your pieces to quartergunners and guncaptains wire prickers were stuck down the touchholes to pierce the cartridge bags quills filled with fine priming powder were jammed down next flintlock strikers were set at full cock and the guncaptains raised their free fists in the air to show their readiness the trigger lines of the strikers as taut as bowstrings in their other hands by broadside fire farley cried the larboard pounder bow chaser and fourteen pounders of the larboard battery lit off together spewing quick yellow and amber sparks through sudden surges of powder smoke wreathing the frigate in a spectral reeking fog though the range was a bit too great for the pounder carronades on the quarterdeck they erupted too at their maximum safe elevation if only to add great threatening shot splashes somewhere close to the danish hulk and make them wonder fired with their muzzles lifted the carronades heavy shot behaved more like seamortars arcing slightly up then down in shallow ballistic paths to crash into the waters of copenhagen roads to throw up great towering plumes of silty water and foam that only slowly collapsed on themselves but about three hundred yards short of the danish warship god help me but i do love the guns lewrie told himself taking a deep whiff of powder smoke his ears already ringing despite the wee wads of candle wax hed stuffed in them after giving the order to open fire lt farley nigh amidships and lt fox nearer the bows already had the gun crews at the tackles to run out their swabbed and reloaded cannon for a second broadside as the smoke cleared just enough to see their target the danish warship responded her lowerdeck pounders lighting off first and her upperdeck s scant seconds later for what were about to receive mr lyle muttered may the good lord make us grateful heavy shot moaned overhead close enough to the upper masts to set them thrumming their shrouds quiver splashes between both ships showed where roundshot fired a bit too low skipped in first graze but dead in line with thermopylae to thud into her hull travelling about or feet per second after the grazes with enough force to make the frigate stagger and smash stout scantling planks one fired but a bit higher crashed through the sailtending gangway bulwarks with a loud parrot rwark creating a cloud of broken oak splinters as big as a mans forearm cutting a marine on the gangway in half at the waist and spraying a cloud of his blood over the gunners on the deck below two sailors on the gangway spun away shrieking as they were quilled by wood splinters surgeon mr harwards team of loblolly boys carrying a messtable for a stretcher mounted the gangway bearing one man away to the midships companionway hatch but shoving the ruin of the second over the side through the blownopen gap in the bulwarks the dead those horribly dismembered and splattered or the ones who seemed to be sleeping and whole were to be gotten out of sight quickly was a hand too grievously wounded for the surgeon and his mates to waste time dealing with him it was considered a mercy to deliver a skullsmashing blow with a maul and pass the unconscious sufferer out a gunport to drown and sink out of sight before the pain of his wounds set in and his screams unnerved his mates mourning was for later thisll be hot work today lewrie said watching the wounded man disappear down the companionway ladders then returned his attention to their foe straining to see what damage if any their fire had caused he raised a telescope to peer at the danish ship soaks it up like a bloody sponge lewrie griped finding but little damage to cheer him so far that frigate of theirs mr lyle pointed out jutting an arm over the larboard bows to the last northerly ship in the danish line is getting a drubbing sir as is our target amazon blanche and the rest of the frigates share their fire twixt her and this one before thermopylae could fire another broadside shot from the other frigates did splash round the stumpmasted twodecker off their beam and flay her scantlings and upper works with iron by broadside fire lt farley howled and hms thermopylae belched out another great gush of smoke and thunder as the smoke from that fresh broadside slowly thinned mr lyle lifted an arm to point at the fortress beyond the embattled ships i do believe the trekroner the three crowns has opened upon us sir indeed the middle and southern faces of the great stone works were alive with gushes of powder reddish flashes as heavy guns upwards of pounder fired know why the danes call it the three crowns mr lyle asked as phlegmatically as if they were on a daytour in search of quaint sights recall the bard of avon capt hardcastle piped up sounding squeakier at the end of hamlet the last of the tragedy is the seizure of denmark by the prince of norway wasnt it norway way back then denmark sweden and he stopped his gob briefly ducking as a heavy roundshot hummed close over the quarterdeck sweden denmark and norway were allies with three kings so they named it the three crowns mr lyle completed for him unwilling to let the civilian get the last word on anything and its a bugger capt hardcastle said straightening up were well within her greatest range lewrie noted lifting his telescope once more same as the guns of kronborg castle up the narrows their ramparts are whatbout a thousand yards or so to loord theyve at least five hundred yards range over us the fortresss gunners dont seem that well drilled though sirs lt ballard contributed to the conversation his demeanour the required cool and unruffled sangfroid that british sea officers were to display and no more accurate than the gunners of the kronborg were when the fleet passed them without a single hit sound and fury signifying nothing hey mister ballrd mr lyle japed to quote shakespeare wrong play capt hardcastle quipped the first lieutenant is correct captain lewrie the fortresses are manned by the danish army and i cannot recall seeing them practice with live powder and shot in all my years passing through the narrows well theyre getting some practice today lewrie said with a smirk hello well shot mister farley hammer the bitch again he cheered as iron shot pummeled the danish twodecker smashing scantling planks and stoving in her bulwarks in showers of splinters for good measure there was an explosion aboard her fire stabbing upward and powder smoke jutting skyward a sure sign of a burst gun a second later though the danish gunners responded their side erupting in a staggering stuttering series of explosions as her guns went off no longer in controlled broadsides but as quickly as gunners could swab out reload and run out balls shrieked overhead passing closeaboard the frigates bow and stern the roundhouse atop the forecastle was blown open with a roundshot that went clean through it the larboard anchor cathead was shattered with another parroty screech and the best bower anchor its cat and fish lines shot away dropped free to splash into the harbour lost forever most likely yet a third ball perhaps an pounder buried itself in the trunk of the foremast below the fighting top and made the mast and the ship sway to starboard so that sailors and marines in the tops had to hold on for dear life well the danish army may be halfblind dodderers but it seems their navy knows their business lewrie said see to it mister ballard aye sir by broadside fire lt farley in the waist was yelling his voice gone hoarse and raspy on smoke and excitement and thermopylae rocked to starboard a few degrees settling an inch or two in the water to the massive recoil as the guns slammed backwards from the ports the truckcarriages squealing and the breeching ropes and recoil tackle and ring bolts groaning the guns were hot now and pounders weighing nearly two tons altogether were leaping from the deck as they lit off thundering back down at the full extent of the breeching ropes at odd angles sure enough there came a howl from a tackle man struck in the shins by an erratically recoiling carriage and a scream as the heavy wood carriage and sizzlinghot gun rolled over one of his ankles loblolly boys here lt fox yelled spare man from starboard take his place quick now lad overhaul tackle swab out oh poor fellow lt ballard calmly said returning from up forward the foremast sound mister ballard lewrie asked him i would not trust it with more than forecourse and the fore topsl sir lt ballard gloomily replied the ball is halfburied in the trunk fourty feet above the deck it will need fishing and banding do we get the chance cold shot i take it lewrie asked with a wry grin not sizzlin cold shot aye sir not heated shot lt ballard replied with almost an impatient expression as though he found lewries attempt at humour disagreeable weve no fear of bursting aflame sir by broadside fire lt farley yelled and the guns roared and thundered yet again rewreathing the frigate in a dense cloud of spent powder smoke adding to the acrid rottenegg cumulus that stood above and to leeward from their first broadsides muffling thermopylae in a whiteyellow mist that made it hard to see the forecastle from the quarterdeck lewrie paced aft to the taffrails past the larboard carronades to the taffrail lanthorn to see how the rest of the battle was going but even his telescope could not pierce the palls of smoke towering over the british and danish lines he could make out the lynetten a smaller version of the trekroner to the westsouwest and only the nearest warships in the opposing lines of battle now and again as the guns fired or the smoke pall cleared he could espy a few danish gunboats anchored with their bows pointing east behind the larger danish vessels great bowmounted pairs of guns erupting and seamortars huffing upwards with even more massive shot dead astern lay hms defiance rearadmiral gravess flagship belching broadsides at the furious rate of three rounds per gun every two minutes the desired standard of the royal navy with gravess red ensign flying along with signal number engage the enemy more closely there came yet another broadside from the danish twodecker as lewrie turned to pace back forward this one was even more irregular than the last not quite as ordered and regimented and was it his imagination or was it not quite as powerful as the ones that had come before fool lewrie spat grinning as he realised that the danish captain had split his fire his upperdeck guns directed at his ship his lowerdeck pounders angled in the ports to engage amazon and blanche which were pummelling her hard overhaul tackle lt farley cried almost wheezing on smoke swaab out from lt fox came were latherin em lads lewrie paused to dig into his waistcoat pocket for his watch and flipped open the lid amazingly the action had been going on for an hour and a half theyd weighed a little after am and here it was nigh crash came a ball right through the larboard bulwarks of the quarterdeck just forrud of the first carronade and a chorus of yells of alarm splinters the size of pigeons the size of bedslats flew in a whirling vicious cloud the ball continued cross the deck then exited by clanging off an idle starboardside carronade barrel darting skyward as a jagged blur of dark metal good christ the civilian capt hardcastle cried aloud struck dumb by the sudden carnage that had like the plague of egypt that had taken the firstborn and spared the israelites sprung up all about him oh my good god he yelped just before staggering away to heave his stomachs contents the captain of the afterguard and two men of the mizen mast crew were down gobbling fear and pain over their hurts or lying dazed in sudden shock midshipman privette was sprawled on the deck his head and face completely covered in blood and the first officer lt ballard was down his head and his chest propped up on the sailing masters lap what are his lewrie began to ask then clamped his mouth shut as he saw that arthur ballard no longer had a left leg the heavy pounder ball had taken it off at midthigh loblolly boys to the quarterdeck now damn yer eyes lewrie bellowed mister tillyard do you go below and warn the surgeon the first officer is comin down to him aye sir tillyard said with a gulp his face as pale as new laundry he staggered to his feet recovered his hat and headed for the larboard gangway ladder rapidly at first then more slowly as he recalled that his actions could cause panic and despair christ why him lewrie asked the aether pass word for lieutenant farley lewrie snapped forced by grim duty to continue as before my compliments to him and he is to assume the duties of first officer pass word to midshipman sealey and inform him he is to replace lieutenant fox up forrud and consider himself an actinglieutenant for the time being aye sir marine corporal frye replied heading off quickly helps coming arthur lewrie said more gently as he took time to kneel beside ballard who was rolling his head back and forth his agony already clawing at him his weathered face gone whitishgrey as he bit his lips to keep from howling and jibbering lewrie took his hand as mr lyle whipped out a length of smallstuff rope to bind about ballards leg near his groin to staunch the heavy bleeding helps on the way stay with us arthur lewrie repeated feeling helpless and holding out but the slimmest hope that his old friend would survive his horrid wound damn you lt ballard hissed you lucky bastard you always were ahah he had to pause as a wave of pain hit him dumb blind luck always get what you want not aahh walk through shit with nought stickin to christ ballard loudly howled as the loblolly boys arrived with a messtable stretcher to fetch him to the surgery on the orlop and whats all that about lewrie helplessly wondered as he let go ballards hand the hand snatched from his grasp morelike by ballard himself not from a need to writhe in pain or lewrie got back to his feet dusting the knees of his breeches and his fingers came away bloody with ballards gore which had spread in a wide pool very well then gentlemen carry on he ordered reaching out to help the sailing master to his feet here sir lt farley reported himself dashing two finger to the brim of his hat in a casual salute mister fox has taken over my place and midshipman sealey now commands the foredeck the dane yonder is mistakenly dividing his fire tween us and amazon and blanche mister farley lewrie icily told him his eyes gone arctic grey twixt the three of us we should give her a hellish good pounding keep up the rate of fire sir i shall sir farley firmly declared though his eyes rolled in horror of the bodies being borne off and all the blood soaking in the snowwhite plankings and the tarred oakum between lewrie forced himself to pace to the larboard bulwarks by the head of the larboard gangway ladder quite near the place the danish pounder shot had entered and took out his pocketwatch again it was almost noon of maundy thursday and the day showed no sign of ending runout your guns lt fox was bellowing in farleys stead prime take aim by broadside fire and the chief of the loblolly gang paused snapped his fingers as if remembering something then bent over to lift lt ballards leg shoe and what was left of his silk stocking and breeches and tossed them over the starboard side chapter forty pace fret set a brave example lewrie chid himself as the hours crawled by for there was little for a captain to do once his ship was engaged at such long range it was all up to the skill and the speed of his gunners the steadiness of his crew look at your watch he reminded himself finding that it was now half past one in the afternoon which made him shake his head in wonder not too strongly for the continual roar of the guns had given him a headache and rendered him halfdeaf despite the candle wax in his ears we seem to be gaining the upper hand sir lt farley said as lewrie paced near his post at the forrud edge of the quarterdeck the danish fire is slackening has been for some time now even that three crowns fort is firing slow umphf was lewries comment on that not quite sure if he had heard the acting first officer correctly he returned to the bulwarks with his telescope laid it through the stays and ratlines of the larboard shrouds to steady it and looked about the old twodecker on which theyd directed their fire was now mostly silent only a gun here and there still firing with most of her gunports devoid of blackiron barrels the frigate anchored north of her shes struck her colours lewrie shouted look there he insisted jabbing his arm at her theyre abandonin her see the frigate was surrendered the danish flag meekly draped over her transom and a white bedsheet hoisted aloft in her damaged rigging rowboats were departing her unengaged side heading for the shore lewrie spun about to look south eyes wide in wonder to note how much the dense pall of gunpowder smoke had thinned to see several of the danish warships nighdismasted and slowly drifting into the mudflats without controlling hands on their helms they too were being abandoned the rowboats that had fetched out a continous supply of powder and shot and fresh volunteers were now busy bearing away survivors coming out to the silent warships empty but for their oarsmen almost all of those pesky little gunboats to leeward of the danish main line had drifted away too smoke billowed from a couple of larger danish liners and older s and s and while they had not yet struck their national colours or hoisted white flags of surrender their guns were silent for the most part it was the forts the lynetten and three crowns that continued the fight damned if it dont look as if were beatin em mister farley lewrie exulted as he lowered his glass beatin em like a rug by broadside fire lt fox yelled yet again and the pounders barked and roared recoiling inboard it was ragged and it was slower than desired practice after all this time but thermopylaes teeth could still bite and were just as sharp as they had been hours before lewrie looked down into the waist at his gunners despite a cold day men were now stripped barechested streams of sweat coursing pale as winter creeks through a coaldust grime of blackpowder and gunsmoke and their white duck sloptrousers had gone grey and grimy some shook their heads to clear their hearing vainly protected by neckerchiefs bound round their heads to cover their ears they served their guns by weary rote by then idle gunners from the silent starboard battery spelled their larboard mates long enough for weary hands to go to the scuttlebutts for water and to lean on their knees and gasp for air for a precious minute or two the powder monkey lads no longer dashed up from the magazine with their cylinders but seemed to bellycrawl up the steep companionway ladders mouths agape and panting oh lovely shootin there lewrie shouted for all to hear as their latest broadside smashed into the stumpmasted danish twodecker their main target all morning chunks of wood flew fightingtop high as bulwarks and sides were struck more shotholes punched through her hull planking some low on her weedfouled waterline and there was no reply by god i think weve done it lewrie cried again now the smoke was thinned lewrie could ascertain that she was not a third rate gunner but an older or with not a gun firing yes he exulted rising on his boot toes as the danish flag which had been shot away at least three times fluttered down a halliard to disappear behind what was left of her poop deck bulwarks and a minute later as thermopylae drilled yet another broadside into her a white flag took its place about time too the sailing master muttered well the danes are a stubborn lot mister lyle marine lt eades quipped oh not them sir lyle countered i mean them yonder sir hydes squadron here at last cease fire on the twodecker mister fox lewrie shouted to the waist quoins out and be ready to engage the fortress parkers come did ye say mister lyle aye sir yonder still about four miles northrd sure enough lewrie could espy at least three british liners ever so slowly creeping to the mouth of the harbour entrances shorttacking ponderously and mostlike making no more than a mile per hour but they were making their presence known at long last damn my eyes capt hardcastle yelped as a pounder shot from the trekroner fortress howled close overhead isnt it over and done yet he sounded more affronted than frightened captain rious frigate amazon and the other ships under his command were shifting their fire onto the three crowns fortress as futile as that seemed to be though the army gunners over there had begun the day unpracticed and raw they had learned a few lessons in gunnery over the hours and though firing very slowly were becoming more accurate signal from london sir midshipman tillyard barked in a professional manner the excitement drubbed out of him by then its number thirtynine discontinue the action cant be he gawped as he reread the signal through his telescope comparing it to his illustrated signals book discontinue mine arse lewrie snapped lifting and extending the tubes of his own glass to confirm it dammit dammit to hell he spun about to look astern to defiance to monarch ganges and lord nelsons flagship the elephant number sixteen was still flying at their signal halliards peaks number thirtynine with two guns sir the general for all ships midshipman tillyard reported weve won this battle whats that man yonder thinking is he blind lewrie blustered well ill be damned if we will not til i see nelson repeat the signal we wont open fire on the fortress mister farley pin their ears back elephant has hoisted acknowledged sir but still has number sixteen aloft tillyard reported mystified by this turn of events defiance still flies number sixteen too the signal is general though sir lt farley pointed out it was not directed to nelson in elephant sir hyde parkers signal was speaking to every ship under his command his own squadron up to the north and nelsons and gravess and capt rious too for any ship any captain to disobey would mean a courtmartial the signal is dog shite sir lewrie snapped back a steamin pile o horse turds sir hyde cant see weve got the danes beaten uhm sir signal from defiance midshipman tillyard called out sounding nervous now shes hoisted number thirtynine to her main topsl yardarm but shes still number sixteen aloft at the mainmast head by broadside fire lt fox rasped behind the guns even as shot from the lynetten and three crowns forts still howled overhead and a fresh squadron of danish warships anchored in the merchantman channel behind the forts began to fire lewrie turned his back on defiance and her contradictory flags looking to amazon and the sturdy capt riou mine arse on a bandbox he said with a groan to see hms alcmene then the blanche frigate acknowledge hms londons signal and hoist number thirtynine as well alcmene and blanche appear to be cutting their kedge anchor cables sir lt farley gravelled really isnt much we could hope to do against stone forts i suppose so lewrie stood and stared hands on his hips and glaring at the amazon waiting to see what riou would do did he not acknowlege the damned signal and continue the action his mind was made up that he and thermopylae would stand by him to the last oh for the love o lewrie despaired his heart sinking at the sight of amazon suddenly ceasing fire and almost shamefacedly hoisting number thirtynine even riou was daunted cease fire mister farley he spat in anger hands aloft to make sail and just cut the damned kedge cable mister tillyard ill thankee tfind that bloody number thirtynine in the flag lockers and hoist it very well sir lt farley said with a weary sigh hoy fox cease fire and secure your guns cease fire dye hear there bosun pipe hands aloft to make sail mister pulley do you fetch boarding axes and cut the stern cable save the spring mind within ten minutes hms thermopylae was once more under way for the north end of the middle ground shoals the southerly wind on her starboard quarters fine bound to join viceadmiral sir hyde parker and his squadron as ordered it was galling especially given the fact that the lineofbattle ships anchored astern of her still fought despite their commanderinchiefs signal and the danish line was now a ragged string of silenced warships grounded and dismasted hulks or half sunk with one of them spectacularly ablaze the foremast trunk wont take much sail sir lt farley cautioned i expect well have need of a yard refit to replace it for now theres a spare main course yard we can use to splint it sir as you say mister farley lewrie glumly agreed massaging his aching forehead and clawing the wax plugs from his ears perhaps sir hyde thought to bring along spare masts and spars and will give us one no matter how disputatious and insubordinate it was lt farley heaved a loud sarcastic snort of derision concerning sir hyde parker even though rious small squadron had cut and made sail both the lynetten and the trekroner forts and the undamaged danish ships in the faroff merchants channelwhich showed absolutely no indication that they would upanchor make sail or sally out from their protected positionsstill conducted a desultory fire drumming the frigates out of the battle they were now smaller targets with their sterns pointed at the forts but their fragile transoms were exposed to longrange raking fire thermopylaeslowly gained on amazon coming up to within two hundred yards of her starboard quarters lewrie went to his larboard side looking for capt riou he saw him the same instant that riou spotted him and they both shrugged at each other shaking their heads at the futility of it all riou lifted a brass speakingtrumpet as if to shout something across just as a fresh salvo from the trekroner fort arrived raising great shot splashes round both frigates howling overhead like baritone harpies no lewrie cried as one of those heavy pounder shot struck amazon on the quarterdeck snatching capt riou from sight was riou slain a long minute later as thermopylae slowly crawled abeam of amazon a lieutenant appeared with the speakingtrumpet hoy thermopylae captain lewrie aye lewrie shouted back through cupped hands what is the date of your posting sir april of ninetyseven lewrie shouted back mystified why lieutenant quilliam here sir captain riou has fallen i am to pass squadron command to the next senior officer present perhaps to captain sutton in alcmene then rious fallen lewrie shouted shocked and suddenly saddened cut in half by a roundshot sir lt quilliam shouted back his voice shaky with emotion said let us all die together my brave lads and not a quarterhour later sir a damned good man sir lewrie told him with a speakingtrumpet of his own this time my condolences to you and all your amazons and by god may he not have fallen in vain the next salvo from the danes fell short by two cables as they finally stood out of range still creeping slowly ahead of hms amazon secure from quarters mister farley lewrie ordered slumped wearily uncaptainlike on the hammock nettings fresh water butts are tbe fetched up for our people aye sir lewrie plodded back towards the binnacle cabinet and doublehelm but the ships surgeon mr harward was slowly dragging himself up to the quarterdeck by the starboard gangway ladder his breeches and his shirt cuffs still stained with gore despite the long leather apron he wore when at his grim trade beg to report sir harward wearily said weve seven killed and eighteen wounded four seriously midshipman privettes regained consciousness but hes taken a hard knock and must be counted on light duties for a few days may you spare him and mister ballard lewrie had to ask passed over sir sorry harward replied idly wiping hands on a damp towel that thankfully did not bear too many blots of blood we succeeded in seizing his femoral artery the great artery found in a mans leg and cauterised it staunching the loss of blood and we managed to neaten up his thigh bone for a stump with enough flesh as a covering for later lewrie held up a hand to shush him damning surgeons for being so enamoured of their learning that they just had to prose on about the arcana of their trade well the loss of blood was too massive in the end sir he is gone sorry i know he was an old friend and shipmate of yours harward told him he reached into an inside pocket of his unbuttoned waistcoat and produced a letter he surely must have had a premonition sir for he pressed me to deliver this to you thankee mister harward lewrie said taking it and turning it over and over for wont of something better to do i know you did your best for him for all our brave lads thankee for saying so sir harward said bowing himself away to the starboard side for a breath of fresh air after hours cooped up in the foetid horror of the cockpit surgery lewrie looked up at the signal halliards on the mainmast and saw number thirtynine still flying mister tillyard now weve ackknowledged it haul that shameful thing down sir chapter fortyone full darkness at last after an eerily red and gold sunset that silhouetted copenhagens spires castle towers and bastioned walls in warlike colours as if a battle still raged though by midafternoon the guns had fallen silent the mild winds had long before blown away the last wisps of gunsmoke arisen in impenetrable thunderheads from ships and shore batteries and now only a few faint mists from burning or sunken danish floating batteries or warships remained hms thermopylae lay peacefully at anchor among her sister ships by the north end of the middle ground shoal near hms london and her consorts about three miles off the trekroner fort and well out of range of its cannon though there was little expectation that the danes would resume the contest they were beaten after all seventeen of the eighteen warships anchored hulks or floating batteries had been taken burned or sunk in action and the enemy commanders ship dannebrog had taken fire and blown up with stupendous loss of life well after the artillery duel had ended nelson and his squadron had persisted despite the general signal to discontinue the action and had won though at great cost in men the rest of thermopylaes day had been spent repairing reroving and splicing cutup rigging replacing shattered yards and upper masts the entire ship needed scouring to erase the stains of gunpowder residue and blood vinegar had been used to ease the odours of rotten eggs from the guns discharges the coppery reek of splattered gore and the foetid stench from mr harwards surgery on the orlop when the foremast had been fished and banded the weather decks had had to be resanded with bears and bibles after that the cannon had to be thoroughly swabbed out and washed down from muzzles to breeching rope cascabels the truckcarriages touched up with a little paint and the recoil and runout tackles replaced in some cases after all the strain and fraying placed upon them on top of that all the ships boats had been led round from being towed astern and had spent the entire time since the ceasefire at rescuing danish sailors from the wrecks of their vessels taking prisoners then cooperating with the crews of danish rowboats in transferring their dead and wounded ashore to the hospitals in the city alan lewrie had been busy too visiting aboard hms amazon to attend capt rious brief funeral then conduct his own rites for the seven officers and men who had died from thermopylaes complement then see to his wounded some of them in a bad way after amputations and sure to join the great majority and their slain shipmates in a few days in his gig he had had to report to lord nelson aboard elephant then to sir hyde parker aboard london and there had been no time for food or drink or a chance to catch his breath it seemed since they had dropped anchors finally finally the sun was down and there were no more demands upon him or his crew a harbour watch was set on deck with the usual lookouts posted at bow stern and both gangways marines in full freshly cleaned kit stood sentry posts to prevent desertion though it made no sense given a threemile swim to a hostile shore it was simply what the royal navy did when anchored captain alan lewrie touched the brim of his hat in casual salute and nodded with a grin to marine private leggett who stood guard by the door to his greatcabins receiving a musket salute and a shy hint of a grin in reply as he entered his quarters thank god he breathed in relief as he shut the door on care and worry and grief and the demands of duty he hung up his own hat and sword belt not waiting for pettus to serve him and almost limped on weary legs and slightly sore feet to the starboard side settee a glass of something sir pettus asked looking as clean and natty as if the day had never been as wellturnedout as a civilian servant in a london club god yes lewrie enthused its been a long dry day and as pettus fetched him a refreshing glass of white wine as toulon and chalky happily resettled amid their familiar environs with the terrifying din of battle long over leaped into his lap and made glad mews of joy to be stroked and cossetted in peace lewrie could relish the homeyness of his cabins returned to normalcy with every piece of furniture every chest chair and framed picture put back in the right places and after a long drymouthed sip of the light white wine he could even allow himself a long happy sigh of near bliss pettus had the bottle and topped him back up for a slower more meditative drink galleys up and nettles will be fetching your supper in half an hour sir pettus told him no hope of fresh vegetables or bread from shore id suppose sir but hes putting together a celebratory meal he said to say anything i may do in the meantime sir id admire did you help me get my boots off pettus and fetch out that old sloppy pair o shoes lewrie decided and a fresh pair of cotton stockings i fear the silk ones ive worn nigh two days in a row are quite ruined by now of course sir pettus said and went to hunt up the shoes and stockings once back he straddled lewries calves and tugged off the boots sure enough the silk stockings were laddered with tears they were fine for formal occasions and for battle silk shirts and stockings could be drawn from wounds more cleanly than linen or wool limiting the risk of anything left in ravaged flesh to fester or go gangrenous but such protection was too delicate to wear with boots and too costly once in fresh clean stockings and comfortable old loosely buckled shoes lewrie slumped into one corner of the settee throw pillows and cushions rearranged for comfort he threw one leg up atop the seat the other resting on the low brass traytable hed brought back from calcutta so many years before and let out another blissful sigh on the smaller side traytable stood the wine bottle and lewrie poured himself a third glass all but smacking his lips in anticipation yet as he reached over then leaned back something crinkled in his coats inside chest pocket oh lewrie sadly thought arthurs letter he withdrew it and broke the wax seal thinking that the letter was just like arthur ballard folded evenly meticulously and the seal forming a perfectly circular blob of wax covering all four corners of the folds which met at almost mathematical exactitude sir it began i would beg that you keep this in the strictest of confidences i find myself in the very worst sort of personal contretemps and for want of a better solution and at the considerable risk to my career must inform you that i find it impossible to serve under you as first lieutenant it is my intention to request of admiralty to be relieved of my position lewrie furrowed his brows in surprise wondering just what the fellow might have gotten into gambling debts the risk of debtors prison by overspending hed gotten some young woman in trouble none of these even remotely seemed likely not with such a straightlaced prig as arthur ballard he could quickly dismiss though we established a somewhat compatible cooperation aboard alacrity in the bahamas as time went by i found myself loath to call it true friendship and by the end of our joint commission felt quite relieved to go our separate ways truthfully sir i hold that you are reprehensible and wish most devoutly to have as little to do with you and your character as naval service will admit in bloody hell lewrie gawped in a very small voice arthur ballard laid it all out in precise terms he despised captain alan lewrie just as he had come to despise lieutenant alan lewrie in the late s ballard cited his many reasons recklessness being one of them a lewd lascivious and adulterous nature another he blasphemed freely hed shot that captured kneeling pirate in the head at close range with a pistol in front of the cave on middle caicos to urge the rest and that foul billy bones doyle out and free their captivesjust as hed all but murdered count levotchkins servant not a fortnight before the theft of a dozen black slaves to man his ship ballard knew it was a crime despite what the court and all the newspapers and tracts in praise of him said he got that prettymuch right lewrie admitted to himself but it was lewries rakehellish adulterous streak that ballard found the most despicable why he even recalled the name of the free black woman lewrie had rutted with at clarence town on long island one sultry and boring afternoon after all these yearseven if lewrie didnt wyannie slocum of course lewrie thought surprised and just for a bit remembering rather fondly the rumours of lewrie quickening a bastard son on a rich greek widow in the currant trade the rumour of a mistress in the mediterranean earlier in the war the scandal of associating with a painted circus wench and how shamefully lewrie had ignored and abused and been unfaithful to his wife caroline lo these many years betraying the betraying the trust of one of the finest women it has ever been my honour to know ballard wrote damme it couldve been ballard wrote those bloody letters not theoni if i didnt know better lewrie thought rereading what ballard had penned about caroline one more time then leaning back on the settee and taking another long sip of his wine he never wed lewrie recalled turned up his nose at every promisin lass we introduced to him betsy whatsername he thought her all of em too fly and flibbertygibbet the way arthur writes of caroline though mine arse on a bandbox he was in love with her all these years he realised with a start lewrie had always fancied that caroline could coax ballard out of his grave and aloof manner and for several hours loosen up in her and his own presence ashore arthur would even laugh and smile at a subscription ball or party at nassau ballard would actually dance with carolineno more than two in an evening lewrie recalled and oh hed be gracious enough to ask other women and girls to dance as well in the course of the night the dutiful sort of thing one did with the older ladies with fellow officers wives or the unmarried damsels and daughters yet hed never followed through do i go through his seachests do i find a shrine to caroline lewrie wondered the unattainable the unrequited paragon of womanhood this lights the poor sad unloved bastard yes there was his affair with tess cited as the last straw for ballard that lewrie would stoop to associating with common trollops no matter their feminine charms and imagine such a sordid item reason for a duel of honour well and why was he not home in anglesgreen in his wifes company anyway how could he be so dismissive and beastly towards such a splendid lady ballard had demanded no arthur ballard hadnt had a premonition as surgeon mister harward had imagined hed expected to survive the action request a posting aboard another ship perhaps after a brief spell of leave for medical reasons and put lewrie in his place for good and all coach to anglesgreen and place his heart in carolines hands as he always wished he could lewrie mused surely in fiften bloody years he mustve met somebody else given some proper girl a go poor sad lonely deluded prig lewrie finished his glass of wine and stuffed ballards letter into a side pocket of his coat wondering what to do with it now that he had read it toulon butted his head against lewries thigh while chalky came trotting from back aft with his tail up to rejoin them and mewing for more pets too from the litterbox of dry sand stowed in the larboardside quarter gallery with a firm nod lewrie rose and headed for the quarter gallery himself in need of relief after three glasses of wine he shut the door lifted the lid of the jakes and undid his breeches buttons for a long easing piss down the metal tube that led past the tuck of the transom directly to the sea with his buttons refastened he turned to stare out the window panes at the riding lights of the anchored fleet and the lanthornglades upon the waters dancing and sparkling in the dark meditatively lewrie withdrew the letter once again and shredded it into tiny bits letting the fingernailsized pieces drop into the cats litterbox with the small longhandled fireplace shovel he stirred the pieces in deep as if turning grass under a fallow field before spring planting hoping that no seeds would ever sprout from that epistle best leave lt arthur ballard rn a brave and honourable memory to his family his associates and everyone else courageously lost in the kings name and not a jealous lovesick and ascetic fool ah there you be sir pettus gaily said as lewrie came back to the cabins your supper is here sir cant speak for the quality of the boiled carrots but the potato hash with bacon is fresher and theres half one of the gunrooms chickens with some of your good cheshire cheese rolled in biscuit crumbles and toasted claret with it sir capital pettus lewrie said with genuine eagerness for food though feeling a pang of conscience to sound too eager after the death and ravaging of some of his men of ballards passing he sat down at his solitary place at the head of his dining table and scooted up to his place setting whipping the napkin cross his lap just as a bowl of portable soup was put before him he caught a strain of music from up forward on the gundeck they sound in decent spirits considerin lewrie commented oh aye sir pettus agreed pouring a new glass of good aged claret for him earlier well you cant keep our tars gloomy for very long after all sir once theyre done grieving that is earlier desmond had played the dirgelike johnny faa while the funeral service had been read and the corpsesthose that had not been slipped out a gunport during combatwere slid overside from beneath the union flag wrapped in canvas and weighted with shot for seaburial as lewrie had come back aboard round dusk and the labours to repair the ship had ended and the crew gathered idle during what was left of the second dog it had been admiral hosiers ghost an old american air katy cruel and other gloomy tunes now though once the hands had eat and the messtables had been cleared away lewrie could recognise a gayer minuet tune called constancy the livelier flannagans favourite and the tune played as theyd stood into action in the morning the jolly thresher and by the time that lewrie finished his soup and started in on his entrйewith two smaller saucers of everything for the famished cats the crewmen had launched into one misty moisty morning again one misty moisty morning when cloudy was the weather i met up with an old man he was clothed all in leather he wore no shirt unto his back but wool upon his skin singing howdyedo and howdyedo and howdyedo again i went a little farther and there i met a maid as it had been in the morning perhaps only three or four hands took the main verses whilst everyone else roared out the short refrain pounding their fists on the messtables stamping their feet on the oak decks hard enough to make the frigates timbers shudder this maid her name was dolly twas in a gown of grey i was feeling somewhat jolly and persuaded her to stay and many kind embraces there i stroked her little chin singing howdyedo and howdyedo amazin really lewrie mused aloud after dabbing his lips and taking a sip of wine after all theyve gone through today the mates theyve lost like i said sir pettus reminded him the life of a sailor or so ive learned in my short time aboard is hard misery and short commons most of the time theyll take what joy they can when theres a reason for it and time enough after all sir it isnt every day theyre in a real battle and win it theyll miss their shipmates but not for all that long not so long as theyre still alive sir and able to brag about it amen lewrie agreed perking up at the notion and how apt it was when applied to the late arthur ballard amen to that epilogue sir valentine these banishd men that i have kept withal are men endud with worthy qualities forgive them what they have committed here and let them be recalled from their exile they are reformed civil full of good and fit for great employment worthy lord william shakespeare the two gentlemen of verona act v sceneiv chapter fortytwo the danes had thrown in the towel withdrawing from the league of armed neutrality for a day or two the british fleet had lain at anchor in kioge bay below copenhagen then departed for the baltic to confront the swedes but that was anticlimactic they had gotten to sea with their small squadron but as soon as theyd learned how the danes had been beaten they returned to port at karlskrona pointedly warned by lord nelson that it would be better did they remain there if they knew what was good for them that left only the russian fleet to deal with and there were signs that the confrontation would be at sea for the amount of drift ice had been greatly reduced by the arrival of spring surely the thaw had reached reval and kronstadt and the tsars warships were now free a swift frigate had caught up with the fleet fresh from great yarmouth bearing orders and mail to the flagship hms london just as soon as the signal flags had been hoisted every ship had sent a boat to her to collect it midshipman furlow returned in the launch with a large canvas bag and scampered up the side with it holding it aloft like a freshkilled fox at the end of a thrilling hunt as the officers gathered round him and cheered as happy as the pack of hounds would round the master of the hunt lewries clerk the unfortunately named mr george georges the purser mr pridemore and his yeoman took hold of it and quickly sorted it out for distribution at seven bells of the forenoon when gunnery practice had ended just before clear decks amp up spirits was piped for the rum ration aft lewrie quickly pawed through his own small pile of correspondence the official letters first victualling board sick amp hurt board general bumf to all ships lewrie muttered as he tore them open and quickly scanned them laying them flat in a shallow wood box on his desk once read not in any particular order to be dealt with later there was nothing of urgent import regarding him just the ship no orders direct from admiralty he could turn to the rest ooh shit he hissed inward through his teeth there was actually a letter from his wife caroline she had broken her bitter and aloof silence wonder of wonders and written him naturally he would leave that one for the very last sure it was yet another of her acidic screeds the sort sure to curdle his midday meal whether he read it before or after dinner tentatively holding it at two of its corners lewrie laid it back down on his desktop the rest of his personal mail there was one from his eldest son sewallis and one from the younger hugh there was a bill from a yarmouth chandler and one from a london tailor eudoxia durschenko had written himleave thatun for the very last he mutteredand one from his solicitor mr matthew mountjoy he was about to open it when he caught sight of the senders of a pair of others christopher cashman his old friend whod moved to wilmington north carolina and had become an american whod provided a thoroughly false affidavit for his trial had sent him a letter he was about to pounce on that one when the last really caught his eye his barrister mr andrew macdougall esquire had written him oh shit lewrie muttered again sure that the combination of letters from his solicitor and his attorney portended another dreadful stint in a courtroom with a grimace on his phyz he opened it in neat spencerian copperplate calligraphy macdougall told him glad tidings sir i take pen in hand to deliver unto you the most amazing turn of events of which i but lately heard events sure to elicit within you the greatest joy and sense of relief for your former accuser mr hugh beauman is no more the packet in which he and his wife and coterie embarked for portugal to escape the folly of their suit against you missed the landmarks when attempting to enter the tagus river and the port of lisbon in a great gale in late january just weeks after your acquittal and was driven aground not half a mile from shore with great loss of life principal of whom was mr hugh beauman himself and it couldnt happen to a better person lewrie whispered feeling like leaping to his feet and dancing a little jig of mourning barely containing a whoop and a guffaw of laughter perishing along with him were several of his perjurious witnesses among his followers though his wife was rescued and as macdougall had heard it that icily imperious beauty now sole heir to the lions share of the beauman richesrivalling the wealth of the famous walpoles or so it was saidbeyond what profits that went to the elder mr beauman and his wife now retired in the english countryside was of no mind to bother with trifles like her late husbands pursuit of capt alan lewries life and honour no mrs beauman is reputed to delight in her widowhood and the salubrious clime of lisbon in particular and in the society of the english colony in portugal in general purchasing a substantial house in lisbon as well as a country retreat rather than leasing and i have it on the best firsthand authority from one of our senior benchers kc of my lodge greys inn who now represents her interests in london that all beauman holdings on jamaica are now put on the market mrs beauman having absolutely no desire to return to the fever isles nor so it is rumoured any desire to have any further association with the quality of society found there my bencher also informs me that she hopes to invest in the wine and spirits trade in portugal lewrie did let out a whoop of glee at that point slapping his desktop for good measure loud enough to startle the cats awake from their nap on the settee cushions and make whitsell his little cabin boy jump and gawk and gulp good news from home sir pardon for asking pettus enquired from the diningcoach where he was setting out dinner things the very absolute best pettus lewrie exclaimed imagining that someday he could drink a toast to his freedom and continued life without fear of further litigation in a fine madeira from a beauman vineyard and savour its taste doubly well and why wait pettus id admire did ye fetch me a wee glass o port while i go through the rest of my mail aye sir the last halfpage of macdougalls letter was chatty folderol about london doings the spring season and hints that the addington government was seriously considering negotiating a treaty of peace with republican france and its first consul napoleon bonaparte of all the insane things just as adm duckworth had taken guadeloupe lastly by the by your solicitor mr matthew mountjoy has told me that you may find news regarding a certain lady in the currant trade of interest he tells me he shall write you with all the particulars but it seems that her recent scandal the details of which escape me has found it necessary to remove herself her children and household to dublin to avoid the acrimony allow me last of all to congratulate you on the complete ending of your legal problems anent the beaumans et al if i may ever be of service in the future do consider me your most obdt srvt well well well lewrie chortled wondering if dame fortune could be any kinder to him he was about to request a larger glass of port but before pettus could even pour the first two faint thumps in the distance could be heard which thumps caused a stir on the quarterdeck overhead which he could hear through the partlyopen windows of the coachtop a moment later and his marine sentry was bellowing the arrival of midshipman plumb lieutenant foxs duty sir and he bids me inform you that the flagship has made general signal for all ships of the fleet to send a boat to her again plumb announced very well mister plumb lewrie replied my compliments to mister fox and hes to despatch a fresh crew of his choosing keep me informed what its all about ayeaye sir just after his dinner and with all but carolines letter left to readhe was still fearful of thatunthe launch returned alongside not a minute later lewrie could hear another excited stir on the quarterdeck the scamper of feet on one of the gangway ladders and the sharp rap of his marine sentrys musketbutt on the deck as he called midshipman privette tsee th capm sah a note for you from the flag sir privette began coming to the dining table to hand it over puppyeager george who conned the launch midshipman pannabaker sir sorry heard a lieutenant on london say it was something about the tsar sir lewrie cocked a wry brow at the lad with his hat under his arm midshipman privettes head still sported a gauze bandage where he had been struck unconscious at copenhagen the lad was all but panting in excited curiosity calm as does it mister privette lewrie chid him you arent to overexert yourself our surgeon tells me not quite yet fluster over this surely cant be good for holy fuckin shit lewrie cried after hed broken the soft wax seal and read the singlepage note and rose so quickly from his chair that he upended it tell the officer of the watch whos on actinglieutenant sealey sir privette supplied that ill come up lewrie ended going for his hat once on the quarterdeck he could see that midshipman pannabaker fresh from the flagship had already imparted his rumour to one and all for he could see a sea of expectant wolfish smiles summon all hands sir actinglieutenant sealey asked not just yet mister sealey lewrie countered for we dont know if the situation has changed all that much what we do know is gentlemen that early this morning one of our scouting cutters spoke a prussian trading brig which gave them a copy of a german newspaper in which it was reported that the tsar the mad despotic bugger has been assassinated he had to hold up a cautioning hand to still the officers glee the new emperor of all the russias is crown prince alexander a lad not much older than mister furlow here lewrie went on and we know what a fireeater is furlow so the new tsar may be even worse god only knows will he continue his late fathers nonsense of an armed league of the north now weve thrashed the danes and run the swedes back to port with their tails tween their legs i assume hes heard o those events by now same as weve had news of his fathers demise how sir lt farley pressed when accordin tthis he was strangled in his bedchambers lewrie told him in the grand palace at saint petersburg the night of he referred to the note the night of the twentyfourth of march not two days after we landed those russian emissaries by god lt fox marvelled my word what a turn of events deuced favourable turn of events for us sirs the sailing master mr lyle chortled damme it was lewrie realised stunned oh christ have we have i been part of regicide rybakov levotchkin and twigg why else had it been so important for count rybakov that shit levotchkin to hasten to yarmouth in such a tear escorted down from london by thomas mountjoy his old clerk sent by the foreign office mountjoy whose mentor in secret branch was who had been recruited and trained by zachariah twigg whod once said that to spare europe of russian imperial ambitions would ignite class warfare and terror civil war and peasant serf rebellion no matter how many millions of people died and how best tforce the russians out of the league of armed neutrality but tscrag the insane bastard behind it all the tsar he furiously thought furious at himself for being fooled into a role in it if it indeed was an english scheme a peace mission mine arse ye wish peace kill the leader who wants a war lewrie thought he shook his head in mute anger as he paced the deck he had always been zachariah twiggs gundog for bloody years and in all of his dealings with the bloodyhanded schemer had never been told all the truth there was the possibility that it was the russians who had approached the foreign office not the other way round and asked for help which would explain why it was that thomas mountjoy had been so eager to foist his emissaries off on lewrie and wash governments hands not even taking the risk of unofficial presence in the baltic a simple task oh and drop these people off why dont you on yer way countin me too simple tpuzzle it out til much too late the arrogant old schemin bastard and i didnt he ruefully thought he couldnt imagine the new prime minister addington hatching such a plan not if he was so henheaded as to contemplate negotiating a peace treaty with france right after smashing denmark and capturing the last frenchheld outpost in the caribbean no it smacked more of the former prime minister william pitt the younger or henry dundas the former secretary of state for war once set in motion though and if addington didnt know about it lewrie realised the current crop of buffoons the earl of elgin the duke of portland lord hawkesbury at the foreign office itself or lord hobart would never have had the nerve so perhaps england hadnt had a hand in it whos tsay the old tsar was such an insane terror the russians did him in lewrie f jits happened to tsars before and its not like he didnt give em hellishgood cause tbe rid of him like the old sayin uneasy rests the head that wears the crown pipe all hands then sir lt farley prompted my pardons mister farley but i was just composin my thoughts on how best to phrase it lewrie lied forcing himself to perk up and sound eager pipe all hands aye capt alan lewrie rn took himself a contemplative pace about the deck head down and his hands in the small of his back as the bosun mr dimmock and his mate pulley fweeped away on their silver calls and thermopylaes people not on watch came boiling up from below in a thunderous roar of feet both shod and bare on companionway ladders lewrie hitched his shoulders before turning to go forward to the break of the quarterdeck to overlook his men in the frigates waist the hands assembled on the sailtending gangways the sun was shining in a mostly clear blue sky and the baltic glistened and heaved slowly and peacefully a glittering steelblue with only here and there any specks of rotting ice the wind stood in the souwest and for once actually felt almost temperate there would be no more need for his reeky furs except as a place for his cats to romp and nap ships compny off hats and stand easy lt farley bellowed all hands assembled sir thankee mister farley lads lewrie began with expectant faces looking back at him from hms thermopylaes sailors petty officers warrants and boys weve gotten a bit of good news afterword as one may see weve come a long way in the conduct of trials since alan lewries appearance in court as his barrister andrew macdougall esq told him in troubled waters before his first court appearance the first trial that lasted more than a single day didnt occur til and yes there was no such thing as crossexamination allowed nor were there government prosecutors a barrister could go both ways depending on the wishes of his brief not client defence counsel for one trial then be hi j the identity of alan and carolines anonymous tormentor it was a retired nypd detective living in florida who was the only one who nailed theoni kavares connor as the culprit years ago for which i congratulate him and i hope when he reads this hell enjoy a drink with his friends buying to reward his shrewdness and insight into human nature hes so sharp they ought to throw in appetisers too the baltic gambit depended heavily on three sources of research two of which my friend bob enrione at cbs sent me the great gamble nelson at copenhagen by dudley pope and to a lesser extent naval wars in the baltic by r c anderson both of which unfortunately are long out of print and its a trusting soul who loaned them to me for over a year once id mentioned that lewrie might be going to the baltic in the winter of the third providing all the dirt on the king of denmark his queen the unfortunate caroline matilda the daughter of king george iii and that earnest nutjob her lover and father of her bastard daughter johann struensee oh i know people now prefer love child but they took bastardy and illegitimacy very seriously in those days so bastard itll be as i said before id rather be historically accurate than politically correct i bought royal affair george iii and his scandalous siblings by stella tillyard locally its a very fun read the prissiness of jane austens novels bedamned the eighteenth century and the first part of the nineteenth was warts and all balls to the wall and pretty randy right through the regency before all of wilberforces moralising and the influence of jeremy bentham hannah more priestley and all the other do good reformers led to the reigns of king william iv and queen victoria even jane austen commented on how radically morals and mores had changed in her own life what was tacitly accepted without a roll of anyones eyes in her youth had become crude lewd and common in her adulthood viceadmiral sir hyde parker and that infamous signal number all newspaper quotes i cited were real culled from dudley popes the great gamble what lewrie did not witness since he did not stay in yarmouth roads with the rest of the gathering fleet was sir hydes complete lack of urgency the allotment of warships to lord nelson or rearadmiral graves and the order of sailing had to be wrung out of him bare hours before the expedition set sail indeed it took a very stiff note what harry potter would call a howler from the earl st vincent old jarvy at admiralty in london to get the man to board his flagship hms london leave his bride frances his little batter pudding at the wrestlers arms and pull his bloody finger out the voyage from yarmouth roads to the skaw the top of denmark took longer than lewries voyage with a few odd unnecessary jogs at sir hyde parkers orders with no communication between nelson graves or sir hyde about how theyd go at the danes or what was to be done with the fleet did they get into the baltic it was only after they anchored in the koll on the swedish coast above the narrows that all three commanders of the van main body and rear divisions even clapped toplights on each other and both nelson and graves came away with not a clue to sir hydes intentions then came the dithering as to whether they could sail down the narrows past kronborg castle with both danes and swedes firing at them as lewrie dreaded or whether it would be safer to take the long way round through the great belt and come at copenhagen from the south which might delay the decision for battle a week or more they tacked back and forth for at least a day before nelson got the man to commit to the narrows viceadmiral sir hyde parkers favourite colour could safely be called plaid and if asked whether he ever had trouble making a decision his likely answer would have been well yes and no sir hyde was surely in dread of the russian fleet big as it was reputed to be and even if he successfully engaged the danes feared that his ships would be so cutup and damaged that they could never risk a fresh battle he was certainly one of those historical figures who could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and if left on his own could screw up a twocar funeral it seems certain that lord nelson finagled sir hyde out of the way with the winds of april dead against him as captain hardcastle realised his squadron could have no effect on the battle and it was nelsons alone to manage as he wished with no interference ah but sir hyde did interfere didnt he his signal to discontinue the action number made absolutely no sense he couldnt see from his distant vantage point through the pall of gunsmoke that most of the danish ships below the trekroner fort were surrendering fallen silent afire or drifting out of the battle already horatio nelson upon seeing sir hydes signal put his telescope to his blind right eye and told capt foley that he really couldnt see iti have a right to be blind sometimes he said he acknowledged it since number with two guns was general to all ships but he kept his own number aloft to engage the enemy more closely knowing that he was winning nelson arranged the terms of the truce on his own too there was a bit of a scandal within the fleet after the battle too when sir hyde heaped praise on his favourites from his own distant squadron which had hardly fired a gun in anger the whole day his old favourite swashbuckling prizemoney reaping capt otway in particular and ignoring the accomplishments of those of nelsons and gravess squadron it is unlikely that capt alan lewrie will be mentioned in despatches in the gazette no medals were awarded for copenhagen to sir hyde parker horatio nelson was a whippersnapper too famous for his own good too young promoted over the heads of stolid conventional menperhaps too infamous for his scandalous dismissal of his wife fanny and his affair with emma hamilton which by the by resulted in another bastard daughter horatia just as nelson went down to plymouth to board his first flagship to the respectable solid sir hyde nelson might have seemed such a little pipsqueak of a man so prone to flattery so in love with fame glory and honours that he was quite put off which made things even worse for adm parker later in the spring when he was relieved of command and ordered home whilst viceadmiral lord nelson was given command of the british fleet in the baltic where it would cruise for the rest of the summer did great britain zachariah twigg at foreign office and alan lewrie really have a hand in the assassination of tsar paul for all you conspiracy nuts there were no black helicopters in those days so stifle yourselves take a deep breath and remind yourselves its only a novel its only a novel though it was a thing devoutly to be wished an act that did destroy the league of armed neutrality and its prime sponsor it appears that it was homegrown how else could one explain how all the devoted cossack guards were somewhere else at the moment the night of march and how the conspirators gained such easy access to the tsars bedchambers the tsarinas apartments were cross the passageway and from her own open doors she witnessed the deed done through the open doors of the tsars apartment without too much in the way of complaint it seems later on that summer once tsar alexander had taken the throne peace and free commerce was returned to the baltic and all of those british merchant ships and their crews had been freed capt thomas fremantle of hms ganges one of nelsons old stalwarts and a fellow whom lewrie knew from in the mediterranean buy a kings commanderplease made an official visit to st petersburg and the russian court he wrote his wife betsy that at several official soirйes he was introduced to many of the conspirators who were as gay as so many magpies none suffering any recriminations and prospering nicely this may be bad news for lewrie if count rybakov and count anatoli levotchkin were part of the homegrown conspiracy and had finagled hm government and the foreign office to find a swift way home in time to participate and benefit from the deed though its long odds that he and that arrogant murderous lad anatoli levotchkin will cross hawses there are some who keep grudges a whole lot better than most and one can never tell russia after napoleon bonapartes invasion in will become a british ally once again and should alan lewrie ever have to go back to the baltic so heres capt alan lewrie rn once more secure in command of a hellishfine frigate sooner or later though hell have to return to england and caroline what was it she wrote in that letter he dreaded to open had twiggs visit and explanations mollified her to yet another wary reconciliation come to think ont what was it that eudoxia durschenko wrote him has she become one more of florizelsthe prince of walesspassing fancies or did she rebuff his advances and precious gifts more to the point did her papa arslan artimovich take umbrage and a hopeful daggerslash at the idiot and what of the delectable tess has she become the mistress of peter rushton viscount draywick or does she pine for lewrie and with his new fame glory and the possibility of respectable renewed congress with his wife would alan lewrie be so huge a fool as to hmmm faithful readers by now should have a clue as to what idiocy alan lewrie can get up to if ever allowed idleness ashore i promise that all shall be unveiled soon in king ship and sword
