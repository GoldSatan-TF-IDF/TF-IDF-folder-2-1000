into pine cove like a creeping christmas thing dragging garland ribbon and sleigh bells oozing eggnog reeking of pine and threatening festive doom like a cold sore under the mistletoe pine cove her pseudotudor architecture all tarted up in holiday quaintage twinkle lights in all the trees along cypress street fake snow blown into the corner of every shops windows miniature santas and giant candles hovering illuminated beneath every streetlight opened to the droves of tourists from los angeles san francisco and the central valley searching for a truly meaningful moment of christmas commerce pine cove sleepy california coastal village a toy town really with more art galleries than gas stations more winetasting rooms than hardware stores lay there as inviting as a drunken prom queen as christmas loomed only five days away christmas was coming and with christmas this year would come the child both were vast and irresistible and miraculous pine cove was expecting only one of the two which is not to say that the locals didnt get into the christmas spirit the two weeks before and after christmas provided a welcome wave of cash into the towns coffers touriststarved since summer every waitress dusted off her santa hat and clipon reindeer antlers and checked to make sure that there were four good pens in her apron hotel clerks steeled themselves for the rage of lastminute overbookings while housekeepers switched from their normal putrid babypowder air fresheners to a more festive putrid pine and cinnamon down at the pine cove boutique they put a holiday special sign on the hideous reindeer sweater and marked it up for the tenth consecutive year the elks moose masons and vfws who were basically the same bunch of drunk old guys planned furiously for their annual christmas parade down cypress street the theme of which this year would be patriotism in the bed of a pickup mainly because that had been the theme of their fourth of july parade and everyone still had the decorations many pine covers even volunteered to man the salvation army kettles down in front of the post office and the thriftymart in twohour shifts sixteen hours a day dressed in their red suits and fake beards they rang their bells like they were going for dogspit gold at the pavlov olympics give up the cash you cheap son of a bitch said lena marquez who was working the kettle that monday five days before christmas lena was following dale pearson pine coves evil developer through the parking lot ringing the bejeezus out of him as he headed for his truck on his way into the thriftymart hed nodded to her and said catch you on the way out but when he emerged eight minutes later carrying a sack of groceries and a bag of ice he blew by her kettle like she was using it to render tallow from building inspectors butts and he needed to escape the stench its not like you cant afford a couple of bucks for the less fortunate she rang her bell especially hard right by his ear and he spun around swinging the bag of ice at her about hip level lena jumped back she was thirtyeight lean darkskinned with the delicate neck and finely set jawline of a flamenco dancer her long black hair was coiled into two princess leia cinnabuns on either side of her santa hat you cant take a swing at santa thats wrong in so many ways that i dont have time to enumerate them you mean to count them dale said the soft winter sunlight glinting off a new set of veneers hed just had installed on his front teeth he was fiftytwo almost completely bald and had strong carpenters shoulders that were still wide and square despite the beer gut hanging below i mean its wrong youre wrong and youre cheap and with that lena put the bell next to his ear again and shook it like a redsuited terrier shaking the life out of a screaming brass rat dale cringed at the sound and swung the tenpound bag of ice in a great underhanded arc that caught lena in the solar plexus and sent her backpedaling across the parking lot gasping for breath thats when the ladies at bulges called the cops well cop bulges was a womens fitness center located just above the parking lot of the thriftymart and from their treadmills and stairclimbing machines the bulges members could watch the ins and outs of the local market without feeling as if they were actively spying so what had started as a moment of sheer glee and a mild adrenaline surge for the six of them who were watching as lena chased dale through the parking lot turned quickly to shock as the evil developer thwacked the latin santaette in the breadbasket with a satchel of minicubes five of the six merely missed a step or gasped but georgia bauman who had her treadmill cranked up to eight miles per hour at that very moment because she was trying to lose fifteen pounds by christmas and fit into a redsequined sheath cocktail dress her husband had bought for her in a fit of sexual idealism bowled backward off her treadmill and landed in a colorful spandex tangle of yoga students who had been practicing on the mats behind her ow my ass chakra thats youre root chakra feels like my ass did you see that he nearly knocked her off her feet poor thing should we see if shes all right someone should call theo the exercisers opened their cell phones in unison like the jets flicking switchblades as they gaily danced into a west side story gangfight to the death why did she ever marry that guy anyway hes such an asshole she used to drink georgia are you all right honey can you get theo by calling that bastard is just going to drive off and leave her there we should go help ive got twelve more minutes on this thing the cell reception in this town is horrible i have theos number on speed dial for the kids let me call look at georgia and the girls it looks like they were playing twister and fell hello theo this is jane down at bulges yes well i just glanced out the window here and i noticed that there might be a problem over at the thriftymart well i dont want to meddle but lets just say that a certain contractor just hit one of the salvation army santas with a bag of ice well ill look for your car then she flipped the phone shut hes on his way theophilus crowes mobile phone played eight bars of tangled up in blue in an irritating electronic voice that sounded like a choir of suffering houseflies or jiminy cricket huffing helium or well you know bob dylan anyway by the time he got the device open five people in the produce section of the thriftymart were giving him the hairy eyeball hard enough to wilt the arugula right there in his cart he grinned as if to say sorry i hate these things too but what aw you gonna do then he answered constable crowe just to remind everyone that he wasnt dickmg around here he was the law in the parking lot of the thriftymart okay ill be right there wow this was convenient one thing about being the resident lawman in a town of only five thousand people you were never far from the trouble theo parked his cart on the end of the aisle and loped by the registers and out the automatic doors to the parking lot he was a denim and flannelclad praying mantis of a man sixsix oneeighty and he only had three speeds amble lope and still outside he found lena marquez doubled over and gasping for breath her exhusband dale pearson was stepping into his fourwheeldrive pickup right there dale wait theo said theo ascertained that lena had only had the wind knocked out of her and was going to be okay then addressed the stocky contractor who had paused with one boot on the running board as if hed be on his way as soon as the hot air cleared out of the truck what happened here the crazy bitch hit me with that bell of hers did not gasped lena i got a report you hit her with a bag of ice dale thats assault dale pearson looked around quickly and spotted the crowd of women gathered by the window over at the gym they all looked away heading for the various machines they had been on when the debacle unfolded ask them theyll tell you she had that bell right upside my head i just reacted out of selfdefense he said hed donate when he came out of the store then he didnt lena said her breath coming back theres an implied contract there he violated it and i didnt hit him shes a fucking nutcase dale said it like he was declaring water wet like it was just understood theo looked from one of them to the other hed dealt with these two before but thought it had all come to rest when theyd divorced five years ago hed been constable of pine cove for fourteen years hed seen the wrong side of a lot of couples first rule in a domestic situation was separate the parties but that appeared to have already been accomplished you werent supposed to take sides but since theo had a soft spot for nutcases hed married one himself he decided to make a judgment call and focus his attention on dale besides the guy was an asshole theo patted lenas back and loped over to dales truck dont waste your time hippie dale said im done he climbed into his truck and closed the door hippie theo thought hippie hed cut his ponytail years ago hed stopped wearing birkenstocks hed even stopped smoking pot where did this guy get off calling him a hippie hippie he said to himself then hey dale started his truck and put it into gear theo stepped up on the running board leaned over the windshield and started tapping on it with a quarter hed fished from his jeans pocket dont leave dale tap tap tap you leave now ill put a warrant out for your arrest tap tap tap theo was pissed now he was sure of it yes this was definitely anger now dale threw the truck into park and hit the electric window button what what do you want lena wants to press charges for assault maybe assault with a deadly weapon i think youd better rethink leaving right now deadly weapon it was a bag of ice theo shook his head affected a whimsical storytellers tone a tenpound bag of ice listen dale as i drop a tenpound block of ice on the courtroom floor in front of the jury can you hear it cant you just see the jury cringe as i smash a honeydew melon on the defense attorneys table with a tenpound block of ice not a deadly weapon ladies and gentlemen of the jury this man this reprobate this redneck this if i may clumpfilledcatboxofaman struck a defenseless woman a woman who out of the kindness of her heart was collecting for the poor a woman who was only but its not a block of ice its theo raised a finger in the air not another word dale not until i read you your rights theo could tell he was getting to dale veins were starting to pulse in the contractors temples and his bald head was turning bright pink hippie huh lena is definitely pressing charges arent you lena lena had made her way to the side of the truck no lena said bitch theo said it slipped out before he could stop himself hed been on such a roll see how she is said dale wish you had a bag of ice now dont you hippie im an officer of the law theo said wishing he had a gun or something he pulled his badge wallet out of his back pocket but decided that was a little late for id since hed known dale for nearly twenty years yeah and im a caribou dale said with more pride than he really should have had about that ill forget all about it if he puts a hundred bucks in the kettle lena said youre nuts woman its christmas dale fuck christmas and fuck you hey theres no need for that kind of talk dale theo said going for the peace in peace officer you can just step out of the truck fifty bucks in the kettle and he can go lena said its for the needy theo whipped around and looked at her you cant pleabargain in the parking lot of the thriftymart i had him on the ropes shut up hippie dale said then to lena youll take twenty and the needy can get bent they can get a job like the rest of us theo was sure he had handcuffs in the volvo or were they still on the bedpost at home that is not the way we forty lena shouted done dale said he pulled two twenties from his wallet wadded them up and threw them out the window so they bounced off of theo crowes chest he threw the truck in gear and backed out stop right there theo commanded dale righted the truck and took off as the big red pickup passed theos volvo station wagon parked twenty yards up the lot a bag of ice came flying out the window and exploded against the volvos tailgate showering the parking lot with cubes but otherwise doing no damage whatsoever merry christmas you psycho bitch dale shouted out the window as he turned onto the street and to all a good night hippie lena had tucked the wadded bills into her santa suit and was squeezing theos shoulder as the red truck roared out of sight thanks for coming to my rescue theo not much of a rescue you should press charges im okay hed have gotten out of it anyway he has great lawyers trust me i know besides forty bucks thats the christmas spirit theo said not able to keep from smiling you sure youre okay im fine its not the first time hes lost it with me she patted the pocket of her santa suit at least something came of this she started back to her kettle and theo followed you have a week to file charges if you change your mind theo said you know what theo i really dont want to spend another christmas obsessing on what a complete waste of humanity dale pearson is id rather let it go maybe if were lucky hell be one of those holiday fatalities were always hearing about that would be nice said theo now whos in the christmas spirit in another christmas story dale pearson evil developer selfabsorbed woman hater and seemingly unredeemable curmudgeon might be visited in the night by a series of ghosts who by showing him bleak visions of christmas future past and present would bring about in him a change to generosity kindness and a general warmth toward his fellow man but this is not that kind of christmas story so here in not too many pages someone is going to dispatch the miserable son of a bitch with a shovel thats the spirit of christmas yet to come in these parts ho ho ho chapter the local girls have a way about them the warrior babe of the outland steered her honda station wagon down cypress street stopping every ten feet or so for tourists who were stepping into the street from between parked cars completely oblivious of any automobile traffic my kingdom for a razorblade cowcatcher and cuisinart wheel covers to cut my path through this herd of ignorant peasant meat she thought then whoa i guess i really do need the meds so she said they act like cypress street is the midway at disneyland like no one actually has to use the street to drive on you guys wouldnt do that would you she glanced over her shoulder at the two damp teenage boys who were huddled in the corner of the backseat of the car they shook their heads furiously one said no miss michon no wed never no her real name was molly michon but years ago as a bmovie queen shed done eight movies as kendra warrior babe of the outland she had a wild mane of blond hair shot with gray and the body of a fitness model she could pass for thirty or fifty depending on the time of day what she was wearing and how deeply medicated she was fans agreed that she was probably somewhere in her early to midforties fans the two teenage boys in the backseat of the car were fans theyd made the mistake of taking part of their christmas break to go to pine cove in search of the famed cultfilm star molly michon and get her autograph on their copies of warrior babe vi revenge of the savage skank just released on dvd with neverbeforeseen outtakes of mollys boobs popping out of her gunmetal bra molly had seen them skulking around the outside of the cabin she shared with her husband theo crowe shed snuck out the back door and ambushed them on the side of the house with a garden hose sprayed them down good chased them through the pine forest till the hose reeled out of its cart then she tackled the taller one and threatened to snap his neck if the other one didnt stop in his tracks realizing at that point that she might have made a public relations error molly invited her fans to come along to help pick out a christmas tree for the santa rosa chapel christmas party for the lonesome she had been making more than a few minor misjudgments lately as shed stopped taking her meds a week ago in order to save money for theos christmas present so where are you guys from she said cheerfully please dont hurt us said bert the taller thinner of the two kids she had been thinking of them as bert and ernie not because they really looked like the puppets but because they had the same relative shapes except for the big hand up their bottoms of course im not going to hurt you its great to have you along the guys at the christmastree lot are a little wary of me since i fed one of their coworkers to a sea monster a few years ago so you guys can sort of act as a social buffer damn she shouldnt have mentioned the sea monster shed had so many years of obscurity between the time shed been pushed out of the movie business until the revival to cult status of her movies that shed lost most of her people skills and then there was that fifteenyear disconnect with reality when shed been known as pine coves crazy lady but since shed hooked up with theo and had stayed on her antipsychotics things had been a lot better she turned into the parking lot of pine cove hardware and gift where a half acre of tarmac was corralled off for the christmastree lot upon spotting her car three middleaged guys in canvas aprons quickstepped their way into the store threw the bolt and turned the open sign to closed shed thought this might happen but she wanted to surprise theo prove that she could handle getting the big christmas tree for the chapel party now these narrowminded minions of black decker were foiling her plans for a perfect christmas she took a deep breath and tried to exhale herself into a calm moment as her yoga teacher had instructed well she did live in the middle of a pine forest didnt she maybe she should just go cut a christmas tree herself lets just go back to the cabin guys i have an ax there that will work noooooooo screamed ernie as he reached across his damp friend threw the latch on the hondas door and rolled them both out of the moving car into a pallet of plastic reindeer okay then molly said you guys take care ill just see if i can cut a tree out of the front yard she swung around in the parking lot and headed back home slick with sweat lena marquez slid out of her santa suit like a baby lizard emerging from a fuzzy red egg the temperature had risen into the high seventies before shed finished her shift at the thriftymart and she was sure shed probably lost five pounds in water in the heavy suit wearing only her bra and panties she padded into the bathroom and jumped on the scale to enjoy the surprise bonus weight loss the disk spun and settled on her usual preshower weight perfect for her height light for her age but dammit shed fought with her ex been pounded with ice rang out good cheer for the less fortunate and endured the jolly heat of the santa suit for eight hours she deserved something for her efforts she took off her bra and panties and hopped back on the scale no discernible difference dammit she sat peed wiped and jumped back on the scale maybe a third of a pound below normal ah she thought brushing her beard aside so she could read the scale more clearly this could be the problem she pulled off the white beard and santa hat flung them into the nearby bedroom shook out her long black hair and waited for the scale to settle oh yeah four pounds she did a quick tae bo kick of celebration and stepped into the shower she winced as she soaped up hitting a sore spot there by her solar plexus there were a couple of purple bruises developing on her ribs where the ice bag had hit her shed had more pain after doing too many crunches at the gym but this pain seemed to shoot on through to her heart maybe it was the thought of spending christmas alone this would be her first since the divorce her sister whom shed spent the last few christmases with was going with her husband and the kids to europe dale total prick that he was had involved her in all sorts of holiday activities from which she was now excluded the rest of her family was back in chicago and she hadnt had any luck with men since dale too much residual anger and mistrust he hadnt just been a prick he had cheated on her her girlfriends all of them married or paired up with semipermanent boyfriends told her that she needed to be single for a while spend some time getting to know herself that of course was total bullshit she knew herself liked herself washed herself dressed herself bought herself presents took herself out on dates and even had sex with herself from time to time which always ended better than it used to with dale oh that gettoknowyourself stuff will send you fullblown batshit said her friend molly michon and believe me i am the uncrowned queen of batshit last time i really got to know myself it turned out there was a whole gang of bitches in there to deal with i felt like the receptionist at a rehab center they all had nice tits though i gotta say anyway forget that go out and do stuff for someone else thats much better for you get to know yourself what good is that what if you get to know yourself and find out youre a total harpy sure i like you but you cant trust my judgment go do something for other people it was true molly could be uh eccentric but she did make sense occasionally so lena had volunteered to man the salvation army kettle shed collected canned food and frozen turkeys for the pine cove anonymous neighbors food drive and tomorrow night as soon as it got dark she was going to go out and collect live christmas trees and drop them off at the homes of people who probably wouldnt be able to afford them that should take her mind off herself and if it didnt work shed spend christmas eve at the santa rosa chapel party for the lonesome oh god there it was it was christmastime and she was in the christmas spirit she was feeling lonesome to mavis sand the owner of the head of the slug saloon the word lonesome rang like the bell on a cash register come christmas break pine cove filled up with tourists seeking smalltown charm and the head of the slug filled up with lonesome disenfranchised winners seeking solace mavis was glad to serve it up in the form of her signature and overpriced christmas cocktail the slow comfortable screw in the back of santas sleigh which consisted of well fuck off if you need to know whats in it mavis would say im a professional bartender since your daddy flushed the condom that held your only hope of havin a brain so get in the spirit and order the goddamn drink mavis was always in the christmas spirit right down to the christmastree earrings that she wore yearround to give her that newcar smell a sheaf of mistletoe the size of a moose head hung over the order station at her bar and throughout the season any unsuspecting drunk who leaned too far over the bar to shout his order into one of maviss hearing aids would find that beyond the fluttering black nylon whips of her mascaraplastered pseudo lashes behind the mole with the hair and the palette knifeapplied cakes of red seduction lipstick past the tareyton s breath and the clacking dentures mavis still had some respectable tongue action left in her one guy breathless and staggering toward the door claimed that she had tongued his medulla oblongata and stimulated visions of being choked in deaths dark closet which mavis took as a compliment about the same time that dale and lena were having their goround down at the thriftymart mavis perched on her stool behind the bar looked up from a crossword puzzle to see the most beautiful man shed ever lain eyes on coming through slugs double doors what had once been a desert bloomed down under where for years lay a dusty streambed a mighty river did now flow her heart skipped a beat and the defibrillator implanted in her chest gave her a little jolt that sent her sluicing electric off her bar stool to his service if he ordered a wallbanger shed come so hard her tennis shoes would rip out from the toe curl she knew it she felt it she wanted it mavis was a romantic can i help you she asked batting her eyelashes which gave the appearance of spastic wolf spiders convulsing behind her glasses a halfdozen daytime regulars who had been sitting at the bar turned on their stools to behold the source of that oily courtesy there was no way that voice had come out of mavis who normally spoke to them in tones of disdain and nicotine im looking for a child said the stranger he had long blond hair that fanned out over the rain flap of a black trench coat his eyes were violet his facial features both rugged and delicate finely cut and yet with no lines of age or experience mavis tweaked the little knob on her right hearing aid and tilted her head like a dog who has just bitten into a plastic pork chop oh how the pillars of lust can crumble under the weight of stupidity youre looking for a child asked mavis yes said the stranger in a bar on a monday afternoon youre looking for a child yes a particular child or will just any child do ill know it when i see it said the stranger you sick fuck said one of the daytime regulars and mavis for once nodded in agreement her neck vertebrae clicking like a socket wrench get the hell out of my bar she said a long lacquered fingernail pointed the way back out the door go on get out what do you think this is bangkok the stranger looked at her finger the nativity is approaching am i correct yeah christmas is saturday mavis growled the hell does that have anything to do with anything then ill need a child before saturday said the stranger mavis reached under the bar and pulled out her miniature baseball bat just because he was pretty didnt mean he couldnt be improved by a smack upside the head with a piece of earnest hickory men a wink a thrill a damp squish and before you knew it it was time to start raising lumps and loosening teeth mavis was a pragmatic romantic love correctly performed she believed hurts smack im mavis cheered one of the daytime regulars what kind of perv wears an overcoat in seventyfivedegree weather said another i say brain him bets were beginning to be exchanged back by the pool table mavis tugged at an errant chin hair and peered over her glasses at the stranger think you might want to move your little search on down the road some what day is it asked the stranger monday then ill have a diet coke what about the kid asked mavis punctuating the question by smacking the baseball bat against her palm which hurt like hell but she wasnt going to flinch not a chance i have until saturday said the beautiful perv for now just a diet coke and a snickers bar please thats it mavis said youre a dead man but i said please said blondie missing the point somewhat she didnt even bother to throw open the liftaway through the bar but ducked under it and charged at that moment a bell rang and a beam of light blasted into the bar indicating that someone had come in from outside when mavis stood back up leaning heavily on her back foot as she wound up to knock the strangers nads well into the next county he was gone problem mavis asked theophilus crowe the constable was standing right where the stranger had been damn whered he go mavis looked around behind theo then back at the daytime regulars whered he go got me they said a chorus of shrugs who asked theo blond guy in a black trench coat said mavis you had to pass him on the way in trench coat its seventyfive degrees out said theo id have noticed someone in a trench coat he was a perv someone shouted from the back theo looked down at mavis this guy flash you their height difference was nearly two feet and mavis had to back up a step to look him in the eye hell no i like a man who believes in truth in advertising this guy was looking for a child he told you that he came in here and said he was looking for a kid thats it i was just getting ready to teach him some youre sure he hadnt lost his kid that happens christmas shopping they wander away no he wasnt looking for a particular kid he was just looking for a kid well maybe he wanted to be a big brother or secret santa or something said theo expressing a faith in the goodness of man for which he had little to no evidence do something nice for christmas goddammit theo you dumbfuck you dont have to pry a priest off an altar boy with a crowbar to figure out that hes not helping the kid with his rosary the guy was a perv well i should probably go look for him well you probably oughta should theo started to turn to go out the door then turned back im not a dumbfuck mavis theres no need for that kind of talk sorry theo said mavis lowering her baseball bat to show the sincerity of her contrition why was it you came in then cant remember theo raised his eyebrows daring her mavis grinned at him theo was a good guy a little flaky but a good guy really nah i just wanted to check with you on the food for the christmas party you were going to barbecue right i was planning on it well i just heard on the radio that theres a pretty good chance of rain so you might want to have a backup plan more liquor i was thinking something that wouldnt involve cooking outdoors like more liquor theo shook his head and started toward the door call me or molly if you need any help it wont rain said mavis it never rains in december but theo was gone out on the street looking for the trenchcoated stranger it could rain said one of the daytime regulars scientists say we could see el niño this year yeah like they ever tell us until after half the state has washed away said mavis screw the scientists but el niño was coming el niño the child chapter hosed for the holidays tuesday night christmas was still four days away and yet there was santa claus cruising right down the main street of town in his big red pickup truck waving to the kids weaving in his lane belching into his beard more than a little drunk ho ho ho said dale pearson evil developer and caribou lodge santa for the sixth consecutive year ho ho ho he said suppressing the urge to add and a bottle of rum his demeanor more akin to that of blackbeard than saint nicholas parents pointed children waved and frisked by now all of pine cove was abuzz with expat christmas cheer every hotel room was full and there wasnt a parking space to be found down on cypress street where shoppers pumped their chestnuts into an open fire of creditcard swipeandspend denial it smelled of cinnamon and pine peppermint and joy this was not the coarse commercialism of a los angeles or san francisco christmas this was the refined sincere commercialism of smalltown new england where a century ago norman rockwell had invented christmas this was real but dale didnt get it merry happy oh eat me you little vermin dale grinched from behind his tinted windows actually the whole christmas appeal of their village was a bit of a mystery to the residents of pine cove it wasnt exactly a winter wonderland the median temperature in the winter was sixtyfive degrees fahrenheit and only a couple of really old guys could remember it ever having snowed neither was it a tropicalbeach getaway the ocean there was bitterly cold with an average visibility of eighteen inches and a huge elephant seal rookery at the shore through the winter thousands of the rotund pinnipeds lay strewn across pine cove beaches like great barking turds and although not dangerous in themselves they were the dietary mainstay of the great white shark which had evolved over million years into the perfect excuse for never entering water over ones ankles so if it wasnt the weather or the water what in the hell was it perhaps it was the pine trees themselves christmas trees my trees goddammit dale grumbled to himself pine cove lay in the last natural montereypine forest in the world because they grow as much as twenty feet a year monterey pines are the very trees cultivated for christmas trees the good news was you could go to almost any undeveloped lot in town and cut yourself a very respectable christmas tree the bad news was that it was a crime to do so unless you obtained a permit and planted five trees to replace it the monterey pines were a protected species as any local builder could tell you because whenever they cut down a few trees to build a home they had to plant a forest to replace them a station wagon with a christmas tree lashed to the roof backed out in front of dales pickup get that piece of shit off my street dale scrooged and merry christmas to all you scumbags he added in keeping with the season dale pearson quite unwillingly had become the johnny appleseed of the christmas tree having planted tens of thousands of seedlings to replace the thousands that he had chainsawed to build rows of tract mansions across pine coves hills but while the law stated that the replacement trees had to be planted within the municipality of pine cove it didnt say that they had to go in anywhere near where they had actually been cut down so dale planted all of his trees around the cemetery at the old santa rosa chapel hed bought the land ten acres years ago in hope of subdividing it and building luxury homes but some hippie meddlers from the california historical society stepped in and had the old tworoom chapel declared a historic landmark thus making it impossible for him to develop his land so in straight rows with no thought for the natural lay of a forest his construction crews planted monterey pines until the trees became as thick around the chapel as feathers on a birds back for the last four years during the week before christmas someone had gone onto dales land and dug up truckloads of live pine trees he was tired of answering to the county about having to replace them he didnt give a damn about the trees but hed be damned if hed put up with someone siccing the county watchdogs on him over and over hed fulfilled his duty to his caribou buddies of passing out joke gifts to them and their wives but now he was going to catch a thief his christmas present this year was going to be a little justice thats all he wanted just a little justice the jolly old elf turned off cypress and headed up the hill toward the chapel patting the thirtyeight snubnose revolver hed stuffed into his wide black belt lena hefted the second christmas tree into the bed of her little toyota pickup and snuggled it into one of the tengallon cedar boxes that shed nailed together herself just for that purpose the underprivileged were only getting fourfooters this year maybe a foot or so taller once in the box it had rained only once since october so it had taken her nearly an hour and a half to dig the two saplings from the hard dry ground she wanted people to have live christmas trees but if she went for full sevenfooters shed be out here all night and only get a couple this is real work lena thought by day she did property management for vacation rentals at a local realtor sometimes putting in ten or twelvehour days during the peak seasons but she realized that hours spent and actual work were two different things she realized it every year when she came out here by herself and got behind her bright red shovel sweat was pouring down her face she wiped her hair out of her eyes with the back of a chamois work glove leaving a streak of dirt on her forehead she shrugged off the flannel shirt shed put on against the night chill and worked in a tight black tank top and olive drab cargo pants with her red shovel in hand she looked like some kind of christmas commando there at the edge of the forest she sank the shovel into the pine straw about a foot from the trunk of the next tree shed targeted and jumped on the blade pogoing up and down until the blade was buried to the hilt she was swinging on the handle trying to lever up the forest floor when a bright set of headlights swept across the edge of the forest and stopped with a stereo spotlight on lenas truck theres nothing to worry about she thought im not going to hide im not going to duck she wasnt doing anything wrong not really well sure technically she was stealing and breaking a couple of county ordinances about harvesting monterey pines but she wasnt really harvesting them was she she was just transplanting them and and she was giving to the poor she was like robin hood no one was going to mess with robin hood just the same she smiled at the headlamps and did a sort of oh well i guess im busted shrug that she hoped was cute she shielded her eyes with her hand and tried to squint into the headlights to see who was driving the truck yes she was sure it was a truck the engine sputtered to a stop a slight nausea rose in lenas throat as she realized that it was a diesel truck the trucks door opened and when the light went on lena caught a glimpse of someone in a redandwhite hat behind the wheel huh santa was coming out of the blinding light toward her santa with a flashlight and what was that in his belt santa had a gun dammit lena i should have known it was you he said josh barker was in big trouble big trouble indeed he was only seven but he was pretty sure his life was ruined he hurried along church street trying to figure out how he was going to explain to his mom an hour and a half late home long after dark and he hadnt called and christmas just a few days away forget explaining it to his mom how was he going to explain it to santa santa might understand though since he knew toys but mom would never buy it hed been playing barbarian georges big crusade on the playstation at his friend sams house and theyd gotten into the infidel territory and killed thousands of the rackies but the game just didnt have any way to exit it wasnt designed so you could ever get out of it and before he knew it it was dark outside and hed forgotten and christmas was just going to be ruined he wanted an xbox but there was no way santa was going to bring it with a home long after dark and a didnt even bother to call on his list sam had summarized joshs situation as he led him out the door and looked at the night sky dude youre hosed im not hosed youre hosed said josh im not hosed sam said im jewish no santa we dont have christmas well youre really hosed then shut up i am not hosed but as sam said it he put his hands in his pockets and josh could hear him clicking his dreidel against his asthma inhaler and his friend did indeed appear to be hosed okay youre not hosed said josh sorry id better go yeah said sam yeah said josh realizing now how the longer it took him to get home the more hosed he was going to be but as he hurried up church street toward home he realized that perhaps he would receive an emergency reprieve on his hosing for there at the edge of the forest was santa himself and although santa did appear to be quite angry his anger was directed at a woman who was standing kneedeep in a hole holding a red shovel santa held one of those heavy black maglite flashlights in one hand and was shining it in the womans eyes as he yelled at her these are my trees mine dammit said santa aha josh thought dammit was not bad enough to get you on the naughty list not if santa himself said it hed told his mom that but shed insisted that dammit was a list item im only taking a few said the woman for people who cant afford a christmas tree you cant begrudge something that simple to a few poor families the fuck i cant well josh had been sure the fword would get you on the list he was shocked santa pushed the flashlight in the womans eyes she brushed it aside look she said ill just take this last one and go you will not santa shoved the flashlight in the womans face again but this time when she brushed it away he flipped it around and bopped her on the head with it ouch that had to hurt josh could feel the blow rattle the womans teeth all the way across the street santa certainly felt strongly about his christmas trees the woman used the shovel to brush the flashlight out of her face again santa bopped her again with the flashlight harder this time and the woman yowled and fell to her knees in the hole santa reached into his big black belt and pulled out a gun and pointed it at the woman she came up swinging the shovel in a wide arc and the blade caught santa hard in the side of the head with a dull metallic clank santa staggered and raised the pistol again the woman crouched and covered her head the shovel braced blade up under her arm but as he aimed santa lost his balance and fell forward onto the upraised blade of the shovel the blade went up under his beard and suddenly his beard was as bright red as his suit he dropped the gun and the flashlight made a gurgling noise and fell down to where josh could no longer see him josh could barely hear the woman crying as he ran home the pulse in his ears ringing like sleigh bells santa was dead christmas was ruined josh was hosed speaking of hosed three blocks away tucker case moped along worchester street trying to exercise off his dinner of bad diner food with a brisk walk under the weight of a large measure of selfpity he was pushing forty trim blond and tan the look of an aging surfer or a golf pro in his prime fifty feet above him a giant fruit bat swooped through the treetops his leathery wings silent against the night so he could sneak up on peaches and stuff without being detected tuck thought roberto do your business and lets get back to the hotel tuck called into the sky the fruit bat barked and snagged an overhead limb as he passed his momentum nearly sending him in a loop around it before he pendulumed and settled in upsidedown attitude the bat barked again licked his little doggy chops and folded his great wings around himself to ward off the coastal cold fine tuck said but youre not getting back into the room until you poop hed inherited the bat from a filipino navigator hed met while flying a private jet for a doctor in micronesia a job hed only taken because his us pilots license had been yanked for crashing the pink mary jean cosmetic jet while initiating a young woman into the milehigh club drunk after micronesia hed moved to the caribbean with his fruit bat and his beautiful new island wife and started a charter business now six years later his beautiful island wife was running the charter business with a sevenfoot rastafarian and tucker case had nothing to his name but a fruit bat and temporary gig flying helicopters for the dea spotting marijuana patches in the big sur wilderness area which put him in pine cove holed up in a cheap motel room four days before christmas alone lonesome hosed tuck had once been a ladies man of the highest order a don juan a casanova a kennedy sans cash yet now he was in a town where he didnt know a soul and he hadnt even met a single woman to try to seduce a few years of marriage had almost ruined him hed become accustomed to affectionate female company without a great deal of manipulation subterfuge and guile he missed it he didnt want to spend christmas alone dammit yet here he was and there she was a damsel in distress a woman alone out here in the night crying and from what tuck could tell by the headlights of a nearby pickup truck she had a nice shape great hair beautiful high cheekbones streaked with tears and mud but you know exoticlooking tuck checked to see that roberto was still safely hanging above then straightened his bomber jacket and made his way across the street hey there are you okay the woman jumped screamed a bit looked around frantically until she spotted him oh my god she said tuck had had worse responses he pressed on are you okay he repeated you looked like you were having some trouble i think hes dead the woman said i think i think i killed him tuck looked at the redandwhite pile on the ground at his feet and realized for the first time what it really was a dead santa a normal person might have freaked out backed away tried to quickly extract himself from the situation but tucker case was a pilot trained to function in lifeanddeath emergencies practiced at grace under pressure and besides he was lonely and this woman was really hot so a dead santa said tuck do you live around here i didnt mean to kill him he was coming at me with a gun i just ducked and when i looked up she waved toward the pile of dead kringle i guess the shovel caught him in the throat she seemed to be calming down a bit tuck nodded thoughtfully so santa was coming at you with a gun the woman pointed to the gun lying in the dirt next to the maglite i see said tuck did you know this yes his name is dale pearson he drank i dont stopped years ago tuck said by the way im tucker case are you married he extended his hand to her to shake she seemed to see him for the first time lena marquez no im divorced me too said tuck tough around the holidays isnt it kids no mr uh case this man is my exhusband and hes dead yep i just gave my ex the house and my business but this does seems cheaper tuck said we had a fight yesterday at the grocery store in front of a dozen people i had the motive the opportunity and the means she pointed to the shovel everyone will think i killed him not to mention that you did kill him and dont think the media wont latch onto that its my shovel sticking out of his neck maybe you should wipe off your prints and stuff you didnt get any dna on him did you she stretched the front of her shirt out and started dabbing at the shovels handle dna like what you know hair blood semen nothing like that no she was furiously buffing the handle of the shovel with the front of her tank top being careful not to get too close to the end that was stuck in the dead guy strangely tuck found the process slightly erotic i think you got the fingerprints but im a little concerned about there where your name is spelled out in magic marker on the handle that might give things away people never return garden tools if you dont mark them lena said then she began to cry again oh my god ive killed him tuck went to her side and put his arm around her shoulders hey hey hey its not so bad at least you dont have kids you have to explain this to what am i going to do my life is over dont talk like that tuck said trying to sound cheerful look youve got a perfectly good shovel here and this hole is nearly finished what say we shove santa in clean up the area a little and i take you to dinner he grinned she looked up at him who are you just a nice guy trying to help out a lady in distress and you want to take me out to dinner she seemed to be slipping into shock not this minute once we get this all under control i just killed a man she said yeah but not on purpose right a man i used to love is dead damn shame too tuck said you like italian she stepped away from him and looked him up and down paying special attention to the right shoulder of his bomber jacket where the brown leather had been scraped so many times it looked like suede what happened to your jacket my fruit bat likes to climb on me your fruit bat look you cant get through life without accumulating a little baggage right tuck nodded toward the deceased to make his point ill explain over dinner lena nodded slowly well have to hide his truck of course okay then lena said would you mind pulling the shovel uh i cant believe this is happening i got it tuck said jumping into the hole and dislodging the spade from saint nicks neck call it an early christmas present tuck took off his jacket and began digging in the hard ground he felt light a little giddy thrilled that he wasnt going to have to spend christmas alone with the bat again chapter have yourself a nasty little christmas josh wiped the tears off his face took a deep breath and headed up the walk to his house he was still shaking from having seen santa take a shovel in the throat but now it occurred to him that it might not be enough to get him out of trouble the first thing his mom would say was well what were you doing out so late anyway and dumb brian who was not joshs real dad but moms dumb boyfriend would say yeah santa would probably still be alive if you hadnt stayed so long at sams house so there on the front step he decided to go with total hysteria he started breathing hard pumping up some tears got a good whimpering sob going then opened the door with a dieseling back sniffle he fell onto the welcome mat and let loose with a full firetrucksiren wail and nothing happened no one said a word no one came running so josh crawled into the living room trailing a nice fiberoptic string of drool from his lower lip to the carpet as he chanted a mucusy momma knowing that it would completely disarm her temper and get her all fired up to protect him from dumb brian for whom he had no magic manipulation chant but nobody called him nobody came running dumb brian was not sprawled across the couch like the great sleepy slug that he was josh wound it down mom just the hint of a sob there ready to go full bore again when she answered he went into the kitchen where the memo light was blinking on moms machine josh wiped his nose on his sleeve and hit the button hi joshy his mom said her cheerful overtired voice brian and i had to go out to eat with some buyers theres a stouffers mac and cheese in the freezer we should be home before eight do your homework call my cell if you get scared josh couldnt believe the luck he checked the clock on the microwave only seventhirty excellent latchkeyed loose like a magic elf yes dumb brian had come through with a business dinner he grabbed the stouffers out of the freezer popped it box and all into the microwave and hit the preset time you didnt really have to peel the plastic back like they said if you just nuke it in the box the cardboard will keep it from exploding all over the microwave when the plastic goes josh didnt know why they didnt just put that in the instructions he went back into the living room turned on the tv and plopped down on the floor in front of it to wait for the microwave to beep maybe he should call sam he thought tell him about santa but sam didnt believe in santa he said that santa was just something the goys made up to make them feel better about not having a menorah that was crap of course goys a jewish word for girls and boys sam had explained didnt want a menorah they wanted toys sam was just saying that because he was mad because instead of christmas they had snipped the tip of his penis off and said mazel tov wow sucks to be you said josh were the chosen said sam not for kickball shut up no you shut up no you shut up sam was joshs best friend and they understood each other but would sam know what to do about a murder especially a murder of an important person you were supposed to go to an adult in these situations josh was pretty sure of it fire an injured friend a bad touch you were supposed to tell an adult a parent a teacher or a policeman and no one would be mad at you but if you found your moms boyfriend lighting a giant chilidogandbeer fart in the garage workshop the police absolutely did not want to know about it josh had learned that lesson the hard way a commercial came on and joshs mac and cheese was still surfing the microwaves so he debated calling or praying and decided to go with the prayer like calling you werent supposed to pray for just anything for instance god did not care whether or not you got your bandicoot through the fire level on playstation and if you asked for help there there was a good chance that he would ignore you when you really needed help like for a spelling test or if your mom got cancer josh reckoned it was sort of like cellphone minutes but this seemed like a real emergency our heavenly father josh began you never used gods first name that was like a commandment or something this is josh barker sixseventyone worchester street pine cove california ninethreeseven fivefour i saw santa tonight which was great and thank you for that but then right after i saw him he got killed with a shovel and so im afraid that theres not going to be any christmas and ive been good which im sure youll see if you check santas list so if you dont mind could you please make santa come back to life and make everything okay for christmas no no no that sounded really selfish quickly he added and a happy hanukkah to you and all the jewish people like sam and his family mazel tov there perfect he felt a lot better the microwave beeped and josh ran to the kitchen right into the legs of a really tall man in a long black coat who was standing by the counter josh screamed and the man took him by the arms picked him up and looked him over like he was a gemstone or a really tasty dessert josh kicked and squirmed but the blond man held him fast youre a child said the blond man josh stopped kicking for a second and looked into the impossibly blue eyes of the stranger who was now studying him in much the same way a bear might examine a portable television while wondering how to get all those tasty little people out of it well duh said josh the christmas tree took a wide left onto cypress street finding that somewhat suspicious constable theophilus crowe pulled in behind it as he dug the little blue light out of the glove compartment of his volvo and stuck it on the roof theo was relatively sure that there was a vehicle under the christmas tree somewhere but all he could see right now were the taillights shining through the branches in the back as he followed the tree up cypress past the burger stand and brines bait tackle and fine wines a pinecone the size of a nerf football broke loose and rolled off to the side of the street bouncing and thumping into one of the gas pumps theo hit the siren one time just a chirp thinking hed better stop this before someone got hurt there was no way that the driver under the christmas tree could see the road clearly the tree was driving trunk first so the widest thickest branches were covering the front of the vehicle the trees tires chirped with a downshift it killed the lights and screeched around the corner on worchester street leaving a trail of rolling pinecones and pinefresh exhaust under normal circumstances if a suspect tried to elude theo he would have called it into the county sheriffs immediately hoping a deputy in the area might provide backup but hed be damned if he was going to call in that he was in hot pursuit of a fugitive christmas tree theo turned the siren onto full shriek and took off up the hill after the fleeing conifer thinking for the fiftieth time that day that life had seemed a lot easier when hed smoked pot boy you dont see that every day said tucker case who was sitting at a window table at hps café waiting for lena to come back from freshening up in the restroom hps a mix of pseudo tudor and country kitchen cute was pine coves most popular restaurant and tonight it was completely packed the waitress a pretty redhead in her forties glanced up from the tray of drinks she was delivering and said yeah theo hardly ever chases anyone that volvo was chasing a pine tree tuck said could be said the waitress theo used to do a lot of drugs no really tuck tried to explain but she had headed back to the kitchen lena was returning to the table she was still in the black tank top under an open flannel shirt but she had washed the streaks of mud from her face and her dark hair was brushed out around her shoulders to tuck she looked like the sexy but tough indian guide chick in the movies who always leads the group of nerdy businessmen into the wilderness where they are assaulted by vicious rednecks bears gone mutant from exposure to phosphate laundry detergent or ancient indian spirits with a grudge you look great tuck said are you native american what was the siren about lena asked sliding into the seat across from him nothing a traffic thing this is just so wrong she looked around as if everyone knew how wrong it was wrong no its good tuck said with a big smile trying to make his blue eyes twinkle in the candlelight but forgetting where exactly his twinkle muscles were located well have a nice meal get to know each other a little she leaned over the table and whispered harshly theres a dead man out there a man i used to be married to shh shh shh tuck shushed gently placing a finger against her lip trying to sound comforting and maybe a little european now is not the time to talk of this my sweet she grabbed his finger and bent it back i dont know what to do tuck was twisted in his seat leaning back to relieve the unnatural angle in which his finger was pointing appetizer he suggested salad lena let go of his finger and covered her face with her hands i cant do this what its just dinner said tuck no pressure he had never really dated much gone on dates that is hed met and seduced a lot of women but it was never over a series of evenings with dinner and conversation usually just some drinks and vulgarity at an airport hotel lounge had done the trick he felt it was time he behaved like a grownup get to know a woman before he slept with her his therapist had suggested it right before shed stopped treating him right after hed hit on her it wasnt going to be easy in his experience things went a lot better with women before they got to know him when they could still project hope and potential on him we just buried my exhusband lena said sure sure but then we delivered christmas trees to the poor a little perspective huh a lot of people have buried their spouses not personally with the shovel they killed him with you may want to keep it down a little tuck checked the diners at the nearby tables to see if they were listening but they all seemed to be discussing the pine tree that had just driven by lets talk about something else interests hobbies movies lena tossed her head as if she didnt hear him right then stared as if to say are you nuts well for instance he pressed on i rented the strangest movie last night did you know that babes in toyland was a christmas movie of course what did you think it was well i thought well now its your turn whats your favorite movie lena leaned close to tuck and searched his eyes to see if he might be joking tuck batted his eyelashes trying to look innocent who are you lena finally asked i told you but whats wrong with you you shouldnt be so so calm while im a nervous wreck have you done this kind of thing before sure are you kidding im a pilot ive eaten in restaurants all over the world not dinner you idiot i know youve had dinner before what are you retarded okay now everybody is looking you cant just say retarded in public like that people take offense because you know many of them are youre supposed to say developmentally disabled lena stood up and threw her napkin on the table tucker thank you for helping me but i cant do this im going to go talk to the police she turned and stormed through the restaurant toward the door well be back tuck called to the waitress he nodded to the nearby tables sorry shes a little highstrung she didnt mean to say retarded then he went after lena snatching his leather jacket off the back of his chair as he went he caught up with her as she was rounding the corner of the building into the parking lot he caught her by the shoulder and spun her around making sure that she saw that he was smiling when she completed the turn blinking christmas lights played red and green highlights across her dark hair making the scowl she was aiming at him seem festive leave me alone tucker im going to the police ill just explain that it was just an accident no i wont let you you cant why cant i because im your alibi if i turn myself in i wont need an alibi i know well i want to spend christmas with you lena softened her eyes going wide the swell of a tear watering up in one eye really really tuck was more than a little uncomfortable with his own honesty he was standing like someone had just poured hot coffee in his lap and he was trying to keep the front of his pants from touching him lena held out her arms and tuck walked into them guiding her hands inside his jacket and around his ribs he rested his cheek against her hair and took a deep breath enjoying the smell of her shampoo and the residual pine scent picked up from handling the christmas trees she didnt smell like a murderer she smelled like a woman okay she whispered i dont know who you are tucker case but i think id like to spend christmas with you too she buried her face in his chest and held him until there was a thump against his back followed by a loud scratching noise on his jacket she pushed him back just as the fruit bat peeked his little doggie face over the pilots shoulder and barked lena leaped back and screamed like a bunny in a blender what in the hell is that she asked backing across the parking lot roberto tuck said i mentioned him before this is too weird too weird lena began to chant and pace in a circle glancing up at tuck and his bat every couple of seconds she paused hes wearing sunglasses yeah and dont think its easy finding raybans in a fruitbat medium meanwhile up at the santa rosa chapel constable theophilus crowe had finally caught up to the fugitive christmas tree he trained the headlights of the volvo on the suspect evergreen and stood behind the car door for cover if hed had a publicaddress system he would have used it to issue commands but since the county had never given him one he shouted get out of the vehicle hands first and turn and face me if hed had a weapon he would have drawn it but hed left his glock on the top shelf of his closet next to mollys old nickedup broadsword he realized that the car door was actually only providing cover to the lower third of his body and he reached down and rolled up the window then feeling awkward he slammed the door and loped toward the christmas tree goddammit come out of the tree right now he heard a car window whiz down and then a voice oh my officer you are so forceful a familiar voice somewhere under there was a honda crv and the woman he had married molly he should have known even when she stayed on her meds as she had promised she would she could still be artistic her term the branches of the big pine tree shuffled and out stepped his wife wearing a green santa hat jeans red sneakers and a jean jacket with studs down the sleeves her hair was tied back in a ponytail that trailed down her back she might have been a biker elf she rushed out of the branches as if she were ducking the blades of a helicopter then ran to his side look at this magnificent son of a bitch she gestured to the tree put her arm around his waist pulled him close humped his leg a little isnt it great it certainly is uh large howd you get it on the car took some time i hoisted it up on some ropes then drove under it do you think therell be a flat spot where it dragged on the road theo looked the tree up and down back and forth watched the car exhaust boiling out of the branches he wasnt sure he wanted to know but he had to ask you didnt buy this at the hardware store did you no there was a problem with that but i saved a ton of money cut it myself completely totaled my broadsword but look at this son of a bitch look at this glorious bastard you cut it down with your sword theo wasnt so worried about what she had cut it down with but from where shed cut it he had a secret in the forest near their cabin yeah we dont have a chain saw that i dont know about do we no actually they did in the garage hidden behind some paint cans hed hidden it when her artistic moments had been more frequent thats not the problem sweetie i think the problem is that its too big no she said walking the length of the tree now pausing to jump through the branches and turn off the hondas engine thats where youre wrong observe double doors into the chapel theo observed the chapel did indeed have double doors there was a single mercury lamp illuminating the gravel parking lot but he could clearly see the little white chapel the shadows of gravestones showing dimly behind it a graveyard where theyd been planting pine covers for a hundred years and the ceiling in the main room is thirty feet tall at the peak this tree is only twentynine feet tall we pull it through the doors backward and stand that baby up ill need your help but you know you dont mind i dont molly pulled open her jean jacket and flashed theo exposing his favorite breasts right down to the shiny scar that ran across the top of the right one cocked up like a curious purple eyebrow it was like unexpectedly running into two tender friends both a little pale from being out of the sun a tad humbled by time but with alert pink noses upturned by the night chill and as quickly as they appeared the jacket was pulled shut and theo felt like hed been shut out in the cold okay i dont mind he said trying to buy time for the blood to return to his brain how do you know the ceiling is thirty feet tall from our wedding pictures i cut you out and used you to measure the whole building it was just under five theos tall you cut up our wedding pictures not the good ones come on help me get the tree off the car she turned quickly and her jacket fanned out behind her molly i wish you wouldnt go out like that you mean like this she turned lapels in hand and there they were again his pinknosed friends lets get the tree set up and then do it in the graveyard okay she jumped a little for emphasis and theo nodded following the recoil he suspected that he was being manipulated enslaved by his own sexual weakness but he couldnt quite figure out why that was a bad thing after all he was among friends sweetheart im a peace officer i cant come on it will be nasty she said nasty like it meant delicious which is what she meant molly after five years together im not sure were supposed to be nasty but even as he said it theo was moving toward the big evergreen looking for the ropes that secured it to the honda over in the graveyard the dead who had been listening all along began to murmur anxiously about the new christmas tree and the impending sex show theyd heard it all the dead crying children wailing widows confessions condemnations questions that they could never answer halloween dares raving drunksinvoking the ghosts or just apologizing for drawing breath wouldbe witches chanting at indifferent spirits tourists rubbing the old tombstones with paper and charcoal like curious dogs scratching at the grave to get in funerals confirmations communions weddings square dances heart attacks juniorhigh hand jobs wakes gone awry vandalism handels messiah a birth a murder eightythree passion plays eightyfive christmas pageants a dozen brides barking over tombstones like taffeta sea lions as the best man gave it to them dog style and now and again couples who needed something dark and smelling of damp earth to give their sex life a jolt the dead had heard it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah molly cried from her seat astraddle the town constable who was squirming on an uncomfortable bed of plastic roses a few feet above a dead schoolteacher they always think theyre the first ones ooooo lets do it in the graveyard said bess leander whose husband had served her foxglove tea with her last breakfast i know there are three used condoms on my grave from this week alone said arthur tannbeau citrus farmer deceased five years how can you tell they heard everything but their vision was limited the smell thats disgusting said esther the schoolteacher its hard to shock the dead esther was feigning disgust whats all the racket i was sleeping malcolm cowley antique book dealer myocardial infarction over dickens theo crowe the constable and his crazy wife doing it on esthers grave said arthur ill bet shes off her meds five years theyve been married and theyre still at this kind of thing since her death bess had taken a strong antirelationship stance postmarital sex is so pedestrian malcolm again ever bored with provincial smalltown death some postmortem sex thats what i could use said the late marty in the morning kgob radios top dj with a bullet a pioneer carjack victim back when hair bands ruled the airwaves a rave in the grave if you get my meaning listen to her id like to slip the bone to her said jimmy antalvo whod kissed a pole on his kawasaki to remain ever nineteen which one marty cackled the new christmas tree sounds lovely said esther i do hope they sing good king wenceslas this year if they do spouted the moldy book dealer youll find me justly spinning in my grave you wish said jimmy antalvo hell i wish the dead did not spin in their graves they did not move nor could they speak except to one another voices without air what they did was sleep awakening to listen to chat a bit then eventually to never wake again sometimes it took twenty years sometimes as long as forty before they took the big sleep but no one could remember hearing a voice from longer ago than that six feet above them molly punctuated her last few convulsive climactic bucks with i am so going to wash your volvo when we get home yes yes yes then she sighed and fell forward to nuzzle theos chest as she caught her breath i dont know what that means theo said it means im going to wash your car for you oh its not a euphemism like wash the old volvo wink wink nudge nudge nope its your reward now that they were finished theo was having a hard time ignoring the plastic flowers that were impressed in his bare backside i thought this was my reward he gestured to her bare thighs on either side of him the divots her knees had made in the dirt her hair played out across his chest molly pushed up and looked down at him no this was your reward for helping me with the christmas tree washing your car is your reward for this oh theo said i love you oh i think im going to be sick said a newly dead voice from across the woods whos the new guy asked marty in the morning the radio on theos belt which was down around his knees crackled pine cove constable come in theo theo did an awkward situp and grabbed the radio go ahead dispatch theo we have a twoohsevena at sixsevenone worchester street the victim is alone and the suspect may still be in the area ive dispatched two units but theyre twenty minutes out i can be there in five minutes theo said suspect is a white male over six feet long blond hair wearing a long black raincoat or overcoat roger dispatch im on my way theo was trying to pull his pants up with one hand while working the radio with the other molly was on her feet already naked from the waist down holding her jeans and sneakers rolled up under her left arm she extended a hand to help theo up whats a twoohseven not sure said theo letting her lever him to his feet either an attempted kidnapping or a possum with a handgun you have plastic flowers stuck to your butt probably the former she didnt say anything about shots fired no leave them theyre cute chapter the season for making new friends theo was doing fifty up worchester street when the blond man stepped from behind a tree into the street the volvo had just lurched over a patched strip in the asphalt so the grille was pointed up and caught the blond man about hiphigh tossing him into the air ahead of the car theo stood on the brake but even as the antilocks throbbed the blond man hit the tarmac and the volvo rolled over him making sickening crunching and thumping noises as body parts ricocheted into wheel wells theo checked the rearview as the car stopped and saw the blond man flopping to a stop in the red wash of the brake lights theo pulled the radio off his belt as he leaped from the car and stood ready to call for help when the figure lying in the road started to get up theo let the radio fall to his side hey buddy just stay right there just stay calm help is on the way he started loping toward the injured man then pulled up the blond guy was on his hands and knees now theo could also see that his head was twisted the wrong way and the long blond hair was cascading back to the ground there was a crackling noise as the guys head turned around to face the ground he stood up he was wearing a long black coat with a rain flap this was the suspect theo started backing away you just stay right there help is on the way even as he said it theo didnt think this guy was interested in any help the foot that faced backward came around to the front with another series of sickening crackles the blond man looked up at theo for the first time ouch he said im guessing that smarted theo said at least his eyes werent glowing red or anything theo backed into the open door of the volvo you might want to lie down and wait for the ambulance for the second time in as many hours he wished he had remembered to bring his gun along the blond man held an arm out toward theo then noticed that the thumb on the outstretched hand was on the wrong side he grabbed it with his other hand and snapped it back into place ill be okay the blond man said monotone you know if that coat drycleans itself while im watching ill nominate you for governor my own self theo said trying to buy time while he thought of what he was going to say to the dispatcher when he keyed the button on the radio the blond man was now coming steadily toward him the first few steps limping badly but the limp getting better as he got closer stop right there theo said you are under arrest for a twoohsevena whats that asked the blond man now only a few feet from the volvo theo was relatively sure now that a a was not a possum with a handgun but he wasnt sure what it was so he said freakin out a little kid in his own home now stop right there or i will blow your fucking brains out theo pointed the radio antenna first at the blond guy and the blond guy stopped only steps away theo could see the deep gouges cut in the mans cheeks from contact with the road there was no blood youre taller than i am said the blond man theo guessed the blond man to be about sixtwo maybe three hands on the roof of the car he said training the antenna of the radio between the impossibly blue eyes i dont like that said the blond man theo crouched quickly making himself appear shorter than the blond man by a couple of inches thanks hands on the car wheres the church im not kidding put your hands on the roof of the car and spread em theos voice broke like he was hitting second puberty no the blond man snatched the radio out of theos hand and crushed it into shards wheres the church i need to get to the church theo dove into the car scooted across the seat and came out on the other side when he looked back over the roof of the car the blond man was just standing there looking at him like a parakeet might look at himself in the mirror what theo screamed the church up the street youll come to some woods go through them about a hundred yards thank you said the blond man he walked off theo jumped back into the volvo threw it into drive if he had to run over the guy again so be it but when he looked up from the dash no one was there it suddenly occurred to him that molly might still be at the old chapel her house smelled of eucalyptus and sandalwood and had a woodstove with a glass window that warmed the room with orange light the bat was locked outside for the night youre a cop lena said moving away from tucker case on the couch shed gotten past the bat hed explained the bat sort of hed been married to a woman from a pacific island and had gotten the bat in a custody battle things like that happened shed gotten the house they were sitting in in her divorce from dale and it still had a black marble jacuzzi tub with bronze greek erotic figures inset in a border around the edge the jetsam of divorce can be embarrassing so you couldnt fault someone a bathtub or fruit bat rescued out of loves shipwreck but he might have mentioned he was a cop before he suggested burying her ex and going to dinner no no not a real cop im here working for the dea tuck moved closer to her on the couch so youre a drug cop he didnt look like a cop a golf pro maybe that blond hair and the lines around the eyes from too much sun but not a cop a tv cop maybe the vain bad cop who has something going on with the female district attorney no im a pilot they subcontract independent helicopter pilots to fly agents into potgrowing areas like big sur so they can spot patches hidden in the forest with infrared im just working for them here for a couple of months and after a couple of months lena couldnt believe she was worried about commitment from this guy ill try to get another job so youll go away not necessarily i could stay lena moved back toward him on the couch and examined his face for the hint of a smirk the problem was since shed met him hed always worn the hint of a smirk it was his best feature why would you stay she said you dont even know me well it might not be about you he smiled she smiled back it was about her it is about me yeah he was leaning over and there was going to be a kiss and that would be okay she thought if the night hadnt been so horrible it would be okay if they hadnt shared so much history in so short a time it would be okay if if he kissed her okay she was wrong it was okay she put her arms around him and kissed him back ten minutes later she was down to just her sweater and panties she had driven tucker case deeply enough into the corner of the couch that his ears were baffled with cushions and he couldnt hear her when she pushed back from him and said this doesnt mean that were going to bed together me too said tuck pulling her closer she pushed back again you cant just assume that this is going to happen i think i have one in my wallet he said trying to lift her sweater over her head i dont do this sort of thing she said wrestling with his belt buckle i had a test for my pilot physical a month ago he said as he liberated her breasts from their combed cotton yoke of oppression clean as a whistle youre not listening to me you look beautiful in this light does doing this so soon after you know does doing this make me evil sure you can call it a weasel if you want to and so with that tender honesty that frank connection the coconspirators chased away each others loneliness the smell of gravedigging sweat rising romantic in the room as they fell in love a little despite theos concern molly wasnt at the old chapel she was getting a visit from an old friend not a friend exactly but a voice from the past well that was just nuts he said you cant feel good about that shut up said molly im trying to drive according to the dsmiv the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders you had to have at least two of a number of symptoms in order to be considered as having a psychotic episode or as molly liked to think of it an artistic moment but there was an exception a single symptom that could put you in the batshit column and that was a voice or voices commenting on the activities of daily life molly called it the narrator and she hadnt heard from him in over five years not since shed gone and stayed on her medication as she had promised theo that had been the agreement if she stayed on her meds theo would stay off of his well more specifically theo would not have anything to do with his drug of choice marijuana hed had quite a habit going back twenty years before theyd met molly had stuck to the agreement with theo shed even gotten decertified by the state and gone off financial aid a resurgence in royalties from her old movies had helped with the expenses but lately shed started falling short its called an enabler said the narrator the drug fiend and the warrior babe enabler thats you two shut up hes not a drug fiend she said and im not the warrior babe you did him right there in the graveyard said the narrator that is not the behavior of a sane woman that is the behavior of kendra warrior babe of the outland molly cringed at the mention of her signature character on occasion the warrior babe persona had leaked off the big screen and into her own reality i was trying to keep him from noticing that i might not be a hundred percent might not be a hundred percent you were driving a christmas tree the size of a winnebago down the street you re way off a hundred percent darlin what do you know im fine youre talking to me arent you well i think ive made my point shed forgotten how smug he could be okay maybe she was having a few more artistic moments than usual but she hadnt had a break with reality and it was for a good cause shed taken the money shed saved on her meds to pay for a christmas present for theo it was on layaway down at the glass blowers gallery a handblown dichromatic glass bong in the tiffany style six hundred bucks but theo would so love it hed destroyed his collection of bongs and water pipes right after theyd met a symbol of his break with his pot habit but she knew he missed it yeah said the narrator hell need that bong when he finds out hes coming home to the warrior babe shut up theo and i just had an adventurous romantic moment i am not having a break she pulled into brines bait tackle and fine wines to pick up a sixpack of the dark bitter beer theo liked and some milk for the morning the little store was a miracle of eclectic supply one of the few places on the planet where you could buy a fine sonoma merlot a wedge of ripened french brie a can of w and a carton of night crawlers robert and jenny masterson had owned the little shop since before molly had come to town she could see robert by himself behind the counter tall with saltandpepper hair looking a little hangdog as he read a science magazine and sipped a diet pepsi molly liked robert hed always been kind to her even when she was considered the villages resident crazy lady hey robert she said as she came through the door the place smelled of egg rolls they sold them out of the back where they had a pressure fryer she breezed past the counter toward the beer cooler hey molly robert looked up a little startled uh molly you okay crap she thought had she forgotten to brush the pine needles out of her hair she probably looked a mess she said yeah im fine theo and i were just putting up the christmas tree at the santa rosa chapel you and jenny are coming to lonesome christmas arent you of course robert said his voice still a little strained he seemed to be making an effort not to look at her uh molly we kind of have a policy here he tapped the sign by the counter no shirt no shoes no service molly looked down oh my gosh i forgot its okay i left my sneakers in the car ill just run out and put them on that would be great molly thanks no problem i know its not on the sign molly but while youre out there you might want to put some pants on too its sort of implied sure thing she said breezing by the counter and out the door feeling now that yes it seemed a little cooler out than when shed left the house and yes there were her jeans and panties on the passenger seat next to her sneakers i told you said the narrator chapter be of good cheer they might have put a tree up your bum the archangel raziel found after some consideration that he did not care for being run over by a swedish automobile as far as things dirtside went he liked snickers bars barbecued pork ribs and pinochle he also enjoyed spiderman days of our lives and star wars although the concept of fictional film eluded the angel and he thought they were all documentaries and you just couldnt beat raining fire on the egyptians or smiting the bejeezus out of some philistines with lightning bolts raziel was good with weather but overall he could do without missions to earth humans and their machines in general and now volvo station wagons in particular his broken bones had knit nicely and the deep gouges in his skin were filling in even as he came upon the chapel but all things considered he could go a very long time not being run over by a volvo again and feel just dandy about it he brushed at the allweather radial tire print that ran up the front of his black duster and across his angelic face licking his lips he tasted vulcanized rubber thinking that it wouldnt be bad with hot sauce or perhaps chocolate sprinkles there is little variety of flavors in heaven and an abundance of bland white cake has been served to the heavenly host over the eons so raziel had fallen in the habit of tasting things while dirtside just for the contrast once in the third century bc he had consumed the better part of a bucket of camel urine before his friend the archangel zoe slapped it out of his hand and informed him that it was despite the piquant bouquet nasty this wasnt his first nativity mission no in fact he had been given the assignment of the very first nativity mission and due to having stopped on the way to play some pinochle hed shown up ten years late announcing to the prepubescent son himself that he would find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger embarrassing well yes and now some two thousand years later he was on another nativity mission and he was sure now that hed found the child that this one was going to go much more smoothly for one thing there were no shepherds to frighten hed felt bad about that back then no come christmas eve the mission would be accomplished hed grab a plate of ribs and head back to heaven licketysplit but first he needed to find the site for the miracle there were two sheriffs cruisers and an ambulance outside the barker house when theo arrived crowe where the hell have you been the sheriffs deputy was yelling before theo was even out of the volvo the deputy was the secondshift commander joe metz was his name he had a linebacker frame that he augmented with weight lifting and marathon beer drinking theo had encountered him a dozen times in as many years their relationship had gone from a mild disregard to an open disrespect which was pretty much theos relationship with everyone in the san junipero county sheriffs department i saw the suspect and made pursuit i lost him in the woods about a mile east of here theo decided he wasnt going to mention what hed actually seen his credibility was thin enough with the sheriffs department why didnt you call it in we should have units all over the area i did you do i didnt hear the call go in i called it in on my cell my radios broken why dont i know about it theo raised his eyebrows as if to say perhaps because youre a big nonecked dumbass at least thats what he hoped the gesture said metz looked at the radio on his belt then turned to disguise his action as he turned a switch immediately the voice of the dispatcher came on calling out for the shift commander metz keyed the mike clipped to the epaulet of his uniform shirt and identified himself theo stood by trying not to smile as the dispatcher reported the entire situation again theo wasnt worried about the two units that were headed to the woods up by the chapel he was sure they werent going to find anyone whoever the guy in black was he had a way of disappearing and theo didnt even want to think of the means by which he did it theo had gone back to the chapel where hed caught a glimpse of the blond man moving through the woods before he was gone again theo had called home to make sure that molly was okay she was can i talk to the kid theo asked when the emts are done looking at him metz said the mothers on the way she was out to dinner with the boyfriend in san junipero kid seems okay just real shaken up some bruises on his arms where the suspect picked him up but no other injuries i could see kid couldnt say what the guy wanted theres no property missing you get a description the kid keeps giving us names of characters from video games for comparison what do we know from mungfu the vanquished you get a good look at him yeah theo said forcing a lump out of his throat id say mungfu is pretty accurate dont fuck with me crowe caucasian long blond hair blue eyes cleanshaven six foot two oneeighty wearing a black duster that goes to the ground i didnt see his shoes dispatch has it all theo kept thinking of the deep gouges in the blond guys cheeks he had started to think of him as the ghostbot video games right metz nodded dispatch says hes on foot howd you lose him the woods are thick up there metz was looking at theos belt wheres your weapon crowe i left it in the car didnt want to scare the kid without a word metz stepped over to theos volvo and opened the passengerside door where pardon where in your unlocked car is your weapon theo felt the last of his energy flow out of him he just wasnt good at confrontation its at my house metz smiled now like the bartender had just announced pitchers all around on the house you know you might be the perfect guy to go after this suspect theo theo hated it when the sheriffs called him by his first name whys that joseph the kid said he thought the guy might be retarded i dont get it theo said trying not to grin metz walked away shaking his head he climbed into his cruiser then as he was backing past theo the passenger window whirred down write up a report crowe and we need to get a description of this guy to the local schools its christmas break dammit crowe theyll be going back to school sometime wont they so you dont think your guys will catch him then without another word metz whirred up the window and whipped the cruiser out of the driveway as if hed just received an urgent call theo smiled as he walked up to the house despite the excitement and terror and outright weirdness of evening he suddenly felt good molly was safe the kid was safe the christmas tree was up at the chapel and there was just no rush that compared to safely and successfully fucking with a pompous cop he paused on the top step and considered for a moment that perhaps after fifteen years in law enforcement himself he really should have matured past that particular pleasure nah did you ever shoot anybody asked joshua barker he was sitting on a bar stool at the kitchen counter a man in a gray uniform was fussing medical over him no im an emt said the emt he ripped the bloodpressure cuff off joshs arm we help people we dont shoot them did you ever put that bloodpressure thing around someones neck and pump it till their eyes bugged out the emt looked at theophilus crowe who had just entered the barkers kitchen theo frowned appropriately josh turned his attention to the lanky constable noting that he had a badge clipped to his belt but no gun you ever shoot anybody sure theo said josh was impressed hed seen theo around town and his mom always said hi to him but he never thought he actually did anything not anything cool anyway none of these guys ever shot anyone josh gestured to the two deputies and the two emts stationed around the small kitchen giving them a look that said the wussies with the full disdain his soft sevenyearold features could muster you kill the guy he asked theo yep josh didnt really know where to go now if he stopped asking questions he knew that theo would start asking questions just like the sheriffs had and he didnt want to answer any more questions the blond man had told him not to tell anyone the sheriff said that the blond man couldnt hurt him but the sheriff didnt know what josh knew your mom is on the way josh theo said shell be here in a few minutes i know i talked to her to the emts and deputies theo said guys can i talk to josh alone a minute were done here the lead medic said leaving immediately both the deputies were young and eager to be asked to do something even if it was to leave the room well be outside writing this up said the last one out sergeant metz told us to stay until the mother got home thanks guys theo said surprised at their congeniality they must not have been on the department long enough to learn to look down on him for being a town constable an archaic and redundant job if you asked most area cops once they were gone he turned to josh so tell me about the man who was here i told those other police i know but you need to tell me what happened even the weird stuff you didnt tell them josh didnt like the way theo seemed to be ready to believe anything he wasnt being too nice or talking baby talk like the others there wasnt any weird stuff i told them josh nodded as he spoke hoping hed look more convincing none of that bad touch stuff i know about that none of that i dont mean that kind of stuff josh i mean weird stuff you didnt tell them because its unbelievable josh really didnt know what to say now he considered crying did a test sniffle just to see if he could get things flowing theo reached out and took his chin lifted it so josh had to look him in the eye why did adults do that now hed ask something that would be really hard to lie about what was he doing here josh josh shook his head mostly to get out of theos grip to get away from that adult liedetector look i dont know he just came in and grabbed me and then he left why did he leave i dont know i dont know im just a kid because hes crazy or something or maybe hes retarded thats how he talks i know theo said you do he did theo leaned in close i saw him josh i talked to him i know he wasnt like a normal guy josh felt like hed just taken his first deep breath since he left sams house he didnt like keeping secrets sneaking home and lying about it would have been enough but witnessing the murder of santa and then that strange blond guy showing up but if theo already knew about the blond guy so so you saw him glow glow shit theo stood up and spun around as if hed been hit in the forehead with a paintball he glowed too shit the tall man was moving like a grasshopper locked in a running microwave not that josh would know what that was like because that would be a cruel thing to do and he would never do something like that but you know someone told him about it once so he glowed theo asked like he was trying to get this straight no i didnt mean that josh needed to back out of this theo was trippin hed had enough of adults trippin for one night soon his mom would come home to find a bunch of cops in her house and the trip to beat all trips would start i mean he was really mad you know like glowing mad thats not what you meant it isnt he really glowed didnt he well not constantly like for a little while then he just stared at me why did he leave josh he said he had what he needed now what was that what did he take i dont know josh was beginning to worry about the constable he looked like he might hurl any second youre sure you want to go with the glowing thing constable crowe i could be wrong im a kid we make notoriously unreliable witnesses whered you hear that csi those guys know everything they have the coolest stuff yeah said theo wistfully you dont get to use cool cop stuff like that huh nope theo was sounding really sad now but you shot a guy right josh said cheerfully trying to raise theos spirits i was lying im sorry josh id better go your mom will be home soon you just tell her everything shell look out for you the deputies will stay with you until she gets here see ya kiddo theo ruffled his hair and started out of the kitchen josh didnt want to tell her and he didnt want theo to go theres something else theo turned and looked back at him okay josh ill stick around someone killed santa claus tonight josh blurted out childhood ends too soon doesnt it son theo said putting his hand on joshs shoulder if josh had had a gun hed have shot him but being an unarmed kid he decided that of all of these adults the goofy constable might just be the one who would believe what he had seen happen to santa the two deputies had come into the house with joshs mother emily barker theo waited until she had hugged most of the breath out of her son then reassured her that everything was okay and made a quick escape as he came down the porch steps he saw something yellow shining by the front tire of his volvo he looked back to make sure that neither of the deputies was looking out then he crouched before the front tire and reached up into the wheel well and pulled out a hank of yellow hair that had caught in the black vinyl dent molding he quickly shoved it into his shirt pocket and climbed into the car feeling the hair throbbing against his chest like a living thing the warrior babe of the outland admitted that she was powerless without her medication and that her life had become unmanageable molly checked off the step in theos little blue narcotics anonymous book powerless she muttered to herself remembering the time when mutants had chained her to a rock in the den of the behemobadger in outland steel kendras revenge if not for the intervention of selkirk the rogue sand pirate her entrails would even now be curing on the salt stalagmites of the badgers cave that would sting huh said the narrator shut up that didnt really happen did it she remembered it like it did the narrator was a problem the problem really if it had just been a little erratic behavior she might have been able to wing it until the first of the month and go back on her meds without theo noticing but when the narrator showed up she knew she needed help she turned to the narcotics anonymous book that had been theos constant companion when he was battling his pot habit he talked about working the steps all the time and how he couldnt have done it without them she needed to do something to reinforce the rapidly blurring line between molly michon party planner cookie baker the retired actress and kendra mutant slayer head breaker the warrior temptress step two she read come to believe that a power greater than ourselves can restore us to sanity she thought for a moment and looked out the front window of the cabin for the lights from theos car she really hoped she could get through all twelve steps before he got home nigoth the worm god shall be my higher power she declared snatching her broken broadsword from the coffee table and waving it in defiance at the sony wega tv that mocked her darkly from the corner in nigoths name shall i sally forth and woe unto any mutant or sand pirate that crosses my path for his life shall be sacrificed and his bloody balls shall decorate the totem tree of my lodge and the wicked shall cower before the grandeur of your dirtstriped and wellshaped thighs said the narrator with robust enthusiasm goes without saying molly said okay step three turn your life over to god as you understand him nigoth requires a sacrifice cried the narrator a limb cut it from your body and impale it still twitching upon the worm gods fiery purple horn molly shook her head to rattle the narrator around a little dude she said molly seldom duded anyone theo had picked up the word on his patrol of pine coves skateboard park and now used it generally to express incredulity at the audacity of someones statement or behavior the correct inflection on the word would convey doood please youve got to be joking or hallucinating or both to even suggest such a thing lately theo had been doing some testing on yo dats wack yo but molly had forbade its use outside of the house for as she pointed out there is little more offputting than the sound of hiphop vernacular coming out of the mouth of a white fortysomething goony bird of a man albatross of a man yo theo had corrected thusly duded the narrator bid devotion down a finger then the severed finger of a warrior babe not a chance molly said a lock of hair nigoth requires i was thinking id light a candle to symbolize that im turning myself over to my higher power and to illustrate her sincerity she took a disposable lighter off the coffee table and lit one of the scented candles she kept on a tray at the tables center a snotty kleenex then tried the narrator but molly had moved on to step four in the book make a searching and fearless moral inventory of yourself i have no idea what that means well ill be fucked in the ear by a blind spider monkey if i get it said the narrator molly decided not even to acknowledge the narrator on that one after all if the steps worked like she hoped they would the narrator was not going to be around for much longer she dug into the little blue book in search of clarification upon further reading it appeared that you were supposed to make a list of all the things wrong with your character put down that youre fucking nuts said the narrator got it molly said then she noticed that the book recommended making a list of resentments she wasnt exactly sure what she was supposed to do with them but in fifteen minutes she had filled three pages with all variety of resentments including both parents the irs algebra premature ejaculators good housekeepers french automobiles italian luggage lawyers cd packaging iq tests and the fucktard who wrote the caution pastry may be hot when heated warning on the poptarts box she paused for a breather and was reading ahead to step five when headlights swept across the yard and raked the front of the cabin theo was home step five molly read confess to our higher power and another human being the exact nature of our wrongs as theo came through the door molly her broken broadsword in hand spun from the cinnamon candle of nigoth the worm god and said i confess i did not file taxes for the years ninetyfive through two thousand i have eaten the radioactive flesh of mutants and i resent the hell out of you for not having to squat when you pee hi honey theo said shut up grommet said the warrior babe so i guess im not going to get my volvo washed quiet im confessing over here ingrate thats the spirit said the narrator chapter morning is broken it was wednesday morning three days before christmas when lena marquez awoke to find a strange man in her bed the phone was ringing and the guy next to her made a moaning sound he was partially covered by the sheets but lena was pretty sure that he was naked hello she said into the phone she lifted the sheet to look yep he was naked lena theres supposed to be a storm on christmas eve and we were going to have mavis barbecue for lonesome christmas but she cant if its raining and i yelled at theo last night and went out and walked around in the dark for two hours and i think he thinks im crazy and you should probably know that dale didnt come home last night and his new uh the other uh the woman he lives with called theo in a panic and he molly yeah hi how you doing lena looked at the clock on the nightstand then back at the naked man molly its sixthirty thanks its sixtyseven degrees here i can see the thermometer outside whats wrong i just told you storm coming theo doubts sanity dale missing tucker case rolled over and despite being half asleep he appeared to be ready for action well would you look at that lena thought to herself then she realized shed said it into the phone what said molly tuck opened his eyes and smiled at her then followed her gaze south he pulled the sheet out of her hand and covered himself thats not for you i just have to pee sorry lena said pulling the sheet quickly over her head it had been a long time since shed had to worry about it but she suddenly remembered a magazine article about not letting a man see you first thing in the morning unless hed known you for at least three weeks who was that molly said lena made an eye tunnel in the sheet and looked out at tucker case who was getting out of bed totally unselfconscious totally naked his unit leading him into the bathroom waving before him like a divining rod she realized right then that she could always find new reasons to resent the male of the species unselfconsciousness was going on the list no one lena said into the phone lena you did not sleep with your ex again tell me you are not in bed with dale im not in bed with dale then the whole night came rolling back on her and she thought she might throw up tucker case had made her forget for a while okay maybe she could count that as a positive toward men but the anxiety was back shed killed dale she was going to jail but she needed to pretend she didnt know anything what did you say about dale molly so who are you in bed with dammit molly what happened to dale she hoped she sounded convincing i dont know his new girlfriend called and said he didnt come home after the caribou christmas party i just thought you should know you know in case it turns out that something bad happened im sure hes okay he probably just met some tramp at the head of the slug and sold her on his workingman charm yuck molly said oh sorry look lena they said on the news this morning that a big storm is coming in off the pacific were going to have el niño this year we have to figure out something for the food for lonesome christmas not to mention what to do if a lot of people show up the chapel is awfully small lena was still trying to figure out what to do about dale she wanted to tell molly if anybody would understand it would be molly lena had been around a couple of times when molly had gone through her breaks she understood things getting out of control look molly i need and i yelled at theo last night lena really bad he hasnt taken off like that in a long time i may have fucked christmas up dont be silly mol you couldnt do that theo understands meaning he knows youre crazy and loves you anyway just then tucker case came back into the room retrieved his pants from the floor and started pulling them on ive got to go feed the bat tuck said he pulled a banana partially out of his front pocket lena threw the sheets off her head and tried to think of something to say tuck grinned pulling the banana all the way out oh you thought i was just glad to see you uh i shit tuck stepped over and kissed her eyebrow i am glad to see you he said but i have to feed the bat too ill be right back he walked out of the room barefoot and shirtless okay he probably would be back lena who was that tell me lena realized that she was still holding the phone look molly ill have to call you back okay well figure something out for friday night but i have to make amends ill call you lena hung up and crawled out of bed if she was quick she could wash her face and get some mascara on before tucker got back she started zooming around the room naked until she felt someone watching her there was a big bay window that looked out on a forest and since her bedroom was on the second floor it was like waking up in a tree house but no one could possibly look in she spun around and there hanging from the gutter was a giant fruit bat and he was looking at her no not just looking at her he was checking her out she pulled the sheet off the bed and covered herself go eat your banana she shouted at the bat roberto licked his chops there had been a time during his bongrat years when theophilus crowe would have stated with little reservation that he did not like surprises that he preferred routine over variety predictability over uncertainty the known over the unknown then a few years ago while working on pine coves last murder case theo had gotten to know and fallen in love with molly michon the exscream queen of the bmovie silver screen and everything changed he had broken one of the cardinal rules never go to bed with anyone crazier than yourself and hed been loving life ever since they had their little agreement if he stayed off his drug pot shed stay on hers antipsychotics and consequently shed have his unmuddled attention and hed only get the most pleasant aspects of the warrior babe persona that molly sometimes slipped into hed learned to delight in her company and the occasional weirdness that she brought into his life but last night had been too much for him hed come through the door wanting nay needing to share his bizarre story about the blond man with the only person who actually might believe him and not berate him for being a stoner and she had chosen that precise moment to lapse into hostile batshit mode so hed fallen off the wagon and by the time he returned to their cabin that night he had smoked enough pot to put a rastafarian choir in a coma thats not what the pot patch hed been growing had been for not at all not like the old days when he maintained a small victory garden for personal use no the little forest of sevenfoot sticky bud platforms that graced the edge of their lot on the ranch was purely a commercial endeavor albeit for the right reason for love over the years even as the prospect of ever returning to the movies became more remote molly had continued to work out with her giant broadsword stripped to her underwear or dressed in a sports bra and sweatpants every day in the clearing in front of the cabin shed declare en garde to an imaginary partner and proceed to spin leap thrust parry hack and slash herself breathless beyond the fact that the ritual kept her incredibly fit it made her happy which in turn pleased theo to no end hed even encouraged her to get involved in japanese kendo and to little surprise she was excellent at it consistently winning matches against opponents nearly twice her size and indirectly all this had led to theos growing pot commercially for the first time in his life hed tried other means but banks seemed more than a little reluctant to lend him nearly a half years salary in order to purchase a samurai sword well not samurai precisely but a japanese sword an ancient japanese sword made by the master swordmaker hisakuni of yamashiro in the late thirteenth century sixty thousand folded layers of high carbon steel perfectly balanced and razor sharp even eight hundred years later it was a tashi a curved cavalry sword longer and heavier than the traditional katanas used later by samurais in ground combat molly would appreciate the weight during her workouts as its heft was closer to that of the theatrical broadsword shed brought with her as a legacy of her failed movie career she would also appreciate that it was real and theo hoped that shed see that it was his way of saying that he loved all the parts of her even the warrior babe he just liked rubbing up against some parts more than others the tashi was now wrapped in velvet and hiding at the back of the top shelf of theos closet where he used to keep his bong collection the money well an old friend of theos from the stoner days a big sur grower now turned wholesaler had been happy to advance theo the money against his crop it was supposed to have been a purely commercial venture get in get out and nobody gets hurt but now theo was showing up stoned for work for the first time in years and following a bad night he could just sense that this wasnt going to be a good day then the call came in from dale pearsons girlfriendwifewhatever and the descent into hell day started theo drowned his eyes in visine and stopped at brines bait tackle and fine wines for a large coffee before he headed over to lena marquezs house in search of her exhusband while it was clear from the incident at the thriftymart on monday and a dozen earlier incidents that their dislike for each other bordered on hatred it hadnt stopped them from hooking up from time to time for some familiar postdivorce sex theo wouldnt have even known about it except molly was good friends with lena and women talked about that sort of thing lena lived in a nice twostory craftsmanstyle house on a half acre of pine forest that butted up to one of pine coves many ranches it was more house than she would have been able to afford working as a property manager but then she had put up with dale pearson for five years of marriage and for five years since so it was the least she deserved theo thought he liked the sound of his hiking boots on the porch as he walked to the front door and he thought that he and molly should build a porch on their little cabin he thought they could maybe get a wind chime and a swing have a little heater so they could sit outside on cold evenings then he realized as he felt that vibration of footsteps coming to the door that he was totally and completely baked that they would know he was baked that no amount of visine or coffee was going to cover the fact that he was baked twenty years of functioning stoned was not going to serve him now hed lost his edge he was no longer in the game the eye of the tiger was bloodshot hi theo lena said opening the door she wore a mans oversize sweatshirt and red socks her long black hair which normally flowed down her back like liquid satin was all knotted up at the back of her head and there was a big tangle sticking out by one ear sex hair theo shuffled on the porch like a kid getting ready to ask the girl next door for a first date im sorry to bother you so early but i wondered if youve seen dale since monday i mean she seemed to fade away from the door like she was ready to faint theo was sure it was because she knew he was high no theo why well uh betsy called and said that dale didnt come home last night betsy was dales new wifegirlfriendwhatever she was a waitress down at hps cafe and over the years had become notorious for having affairs with a lot of married guys i was just uh why wouldnt she interrupt him he didnt want to say that he knew that she and dale got together for spite sex occasionally he wasnt supposed to know so uh i was just wondering hi whos this said a blond guy who had appeared shirtless behind lena in the doorway oh thank god theo said taking a deep breath im theo crowe im the town constable he looked at lena for an introduction this is tucker uh tuck she had no idea what this guys last name was tucker case said tucker case stepping around lena and offering his hand to shake i should have introduced myself to you sooner i guess since were in the same business what business is that theo never thought of himself as being a businessman but he guessed that he was now im flying helicopter for the dea said tucker case you know infrared finding growers and stuff clear his heart has stopped code blue five hundred milligrams of epinephrine direct shot to the pericardium stat hes flatlining people clear nice to meet you theo said hoping his heart failure wasnt showing well sorry to bother you ill just be on my way he let go of tucks hand and started walking away thinking dont walk stoned dont walk stoned for the love of god how did i do this all of those years uh constable tuck said why was it that you stopped by ouch theo turned lena had just punched the pilot in the arm evidently pretty hard he was massaging it uh nothing just a fellow didnt go home last night and i thought lena might have an idea where he went theo was trying to back away from the house but then stopped remembering that he might trip on the porch steps how would he explain that to the dea last night thats not even a missing person for what twentyfour fortyeight hours ouch dammit thats not necessary tucker case rubbed his shoulder where lena had punched him again theo thought that she might have violence issues with men lena looked at theo and grinned as if she was embarrassed about the punch theo molly called me this morning and told me about dale i told her i hadnt seen him didnt she tell you sure sure she told me i just you know i thought you might have some ideas i mean your friend is right dales not really missing officially for another twelve hours or so but you know its a small town and i you know have a job and stuff thanks theo lena said waving to him even though he was only a few feet away and wasnt moving away from the house the pilot was waving too smiling theo didnt like being around new lovers who had just gotten laid especially when things werent going that well in his own love life they seemed smug even if they werent trying to be he spotted something dark swinging from the ceiling of the porch right where the wind chime would have been on his and mollys porch if he hadnt just sacrificed their security by relapsing into dopefiendism it couldnt be what it looked like so thats a uh that looks like a bat said lena holy fuck theo thought that thing is huge a bat he said sure of course fruit bat tucker case clarified from micronesia oh right theo said micronesia was not a real place the blond guy was fucking with him well ill see you guys see you at lonesome christmas on friday lena said say hi to molly kay theo said climbing into the volvo he closed the car door they went inside he let his head hit the steering wheel they know he thought he knows lena said her back against the front door he doesnt know hes smarter than he looks he knows he doesnt know and he didnt look dumb he looked kind of stoned no he wasnt stoned that was suspicion dont you think if he was suspicious he might have asked where you were last night well he could see that with you walking out there with your shirt off and me looking so you know so satisfied no i was going to say disheveled she punched his arm jeez get over yourself ouch that is completely out of line im in trouble here lena said you can at least be supportive supportive i helped you hide the body in some countries that implies commitment she wound up to punch him then caught herself but left her fist there in the air just in case you really dont think he was suspicious he didnt even ask why you have a giant fruit bat hanging out on your porch hes oblivious just going through the motions why do i have a giant fruit bat hanging from the porch comes with the package he grinned and walked away now she felt stupid standing there her fist in the air she felt unenlightened dense silly unevolved all the things she thought only other people were she followed him into the bedroom where he was putting on his shirt im sorry i hit you he rubbed his bruised shoulder you have tendencies should i hide your shovel thats a horrible thing to say she almost punched him but instead trying to be more evolved and less threatening she put her arms around him it was an accident release me i have to go spot bad guys with my helicopter he said patting her on the bottom youre taking the bat with you right you dont want to hang out with him no offense but hes a little creepy you have no idea said tuck chapter holiday heartbreak christmas amnesty you can fall out of contact with a friend fail to return calls ignore emails avoid eye contact at the thriftymart forget birthdays anniversaries and reunions and if you show up at their house during the holidays with a gift they are socially bound to forgive you act like nothing happened decorum dictates that the friendship move forward from that point without guilt or recrimination if you started a chess game ten years ago in october you need only remember whose move it is or why you sold the chessboard and bought an xbox in the interim look christmas amnesty is a wonderful thing but its not a dimensional shift the laws of time and space continue to apply even if you have been avoiding your friends but dont try using the expansion of the universe as an excuse like you kept meaning to stop by but their house kept getting farther away that crap wont wash just say sorry i havent called merry christmas then show the present christmas amnesty protocol dictates that your friend say thats okay and let you in without further comment this is the way it has always been done where the fuck have you been said gabe fenton when he opened the door and saw his old friend theophilus crowe standing there holding a present gabe fortyfive short and wiry unshaven and slightly balding was wearing khakis that looked like hed slept in them for a week merry christmas gabe said theo holding out the present a big red bow on it sort of waving the box back and forth as if to say hey i have a present here youre not supposed to sandbag me for not calling for three years yeah nice said gabe but you might have called sorry i meant to but you were involved with val i didnt want to interrupt she dumped me you know gabe had been seeing valerie riordan the towns only psychiatrist for several years now not for the last month however yeah i heard about that theo had heard that val wanted someone who was a little more involved with human culture than gabe gabe was a behavioral field biologist who studied wild rodents or marine mammals depending on who was providing the funding he lived at a small federally owned cottage by the lighthouse with his hundredpound black labrador retriever skinner you heard and you didnt call it was nearly noon and theos buzz had mostly worn off but he was still thrown guys were not supposed to lament the lack of support from a friend unless it was backup in a bar fight or help in moving heavy stuff this was not normal behavior maybe gabe really did need to spend more time around human beings look gabe i brought you a present theo said look at how glad skinner is to see me skinner was in fact glad to see theo he was crowding gabe in the doorway his beefy tail beating against the open door like a snausage war drum he associated theo with hamburgers and pizza and had once thought of him as the emergency backup food guy gabe being the primary food guy well i suppose you should come in said gabe the biologist stepped away from the door and allowed theo to enter skinner said hi by shoving his nose into theos crotch im working in here so things are a little messy a little messy an understatement on a par with calling the bataan death march a nature hike it looked like someone had loaded all of gabes belongings into a cannon and fired them into the room through the wall dirty laundry and dishes covered every surface except for gabes worktable which except for the rats was immaculate nice rats theo said what are you doing with them im studying them gabe sat down in front of a series of fivegallon aquariums arranged around a center tank in a star pattern and linked by habitrail tubes with gates for routing rats from one chamber to another each of the rats had a silver disk about the size of a quarter glued to its back theo watched as gabe opened a gate and one of the rats rushed to the center tank and immediately tried to mount its occupant gabe picked up a small remote control and hit the button the attacking rat nearly did a backflip trying to retreat ha thatll teach im gabe shouted the female in the center cage is in estrus the rat backed away tentatively and did some sniffing then attempted to mount the female again gabe hit the button the male was jolted off of her ha now do you get it gabe said maniacally he looked up from the cages to theo there are electrodes on their testes the silver disks are batteries and remote receivers every time he gets sexually aroused im hitting his little nuts with fifty volts the rat made another attempt and again gabe hit the button the rat spazzed its way to the corner of the cage you stupid shit gabe shouted you think theyd learn ill hit each of them with the jolt a dozen times today but when i open the cage tomorrow theyll all run back in and try to mount her again you see you see how we are we us males see how we are we know theres going to be nothing but pain but we go back again and again gabe had always been so steady so calm so professionally detached scientifically obsessed so dependably nerdy theo felt as if he were talking to a whole different person like someone had scrubbed off all the intellect and had exposed the nerves uh gabe im not sure that we should equate ourselves with rodents i mean oh sure thats what you say now but youll call me and tell me i was right something will happen and youll call shell stomp your heart and youll finish the destruction she starts am i right am i right uh i theo was thinking about the graveyard sex followed by the fight hed had with molly last night so im going to change the association watch this gabe stormed over to a bookshelf threw aside a bunch of professional journals and notebooks until he found what he was looking for see see her gabe held up a recent victorias secret catalog the model on the front was wearing garments spectacularly inadequate in concealing her appeal she looked as if she just couldnt be happier about it beautiful right amazing right hold that thought gabe reached into the pocket of his khakis and pulled out a stainless remote just like the one on the rat table beautiful he said and he hit the button the biologists back arched and he suddenly became six inches taller all the muscles of his body seeming to flex at once he convulsed twice then fell to the floor the crumpled catalog still in his hand skinner lapsed into a barking fit dont die food guy my bowl is on the porch and i cant open the door by myself he was saying it was the same every time he was always glad when the food guy wasnt actually dead but the food guys convulsions made him anxious theo rushed to his friends aid gabes eyes were rolled back and he twitched a couple of times before he sucked in a deep breath and looked theo in the eye see you change the association wont be long and ill have that reaction without the electrodes glued to my scrotum are you okay oh yeah it will take hold i know it it hasnt worked with the rats yet but im hoping it will before they all die theyre dying of this well it has to hurt or theyll never learn gabe held up his remote again and theo snatched it out of his hand stop it i have another set of electrodes and receiver you want to try it ive been dying to try it out in the field we could go to a titty bar theo helped gabe to his feet then set him in a chair facing away from the rat table and pulled a chair around for himself gabe you are out of control im sorry i didnt call i know youve been busy its okay great now he has the appropriate christmas amnesty reaction theo thought these rats the electrodes all of it its just wrong youre just going to end up with either a bunch of paranoid misogynist males or a pile of corpses you make that sound like a bad thing you got your heart broken it will heal she said i was dull she should see this theo gestured around the room she wasnt interested in my work you guys had a good run five years maybe it was just time you told me yourself that the human male was not evolved for monogamy yeah but i had a girlfriend when i said that so its not true no its true but it didnt bother me when i had a girlfriend now i know that i am biologically programmed to spread the seed of my loins far and wide to as many females as possible a series of torrid meaningless matings only to move on to the next fertile female my genes are demanding that i pass them on and i dont know where to start you might want to shower before you start the seed spreading you dont think i know that thats why i was trying to reprogram my impulses tame the animus as it were because you dont want to shower no because i dont know how to talk to women i could talk to val val was a pro she was not she never turned a trick in her life listener gabe she was a pro listener a psychiatrist oh right do you think i should start with a prostitute or tutes for a broken heart yeah im sure that will work just as well as the electrodes on your scrotum but first i need you to do something for me theo thought maybe just maybe work nonfreakish work might bring his friend back from the brink he reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out the hank of yellow hair hed taken out of the volvos wheel well i need you to look at this and tell me about it gabe took the hair and looked at it is this crime stuff sort of where did you get it what do you need to know tell me everything you can about it before i tell you anything okay well it appears to be blond thanks gabe i was thinking maybe you could look at it under the microscope or something doesnt the county have a crime lab for that yeah but i cant take it to them there are circumstances like like they will think im stoned or nuts or both look at the hair theo said you tell me ill tell you okay but i dont have all that cool csi stuff yeah but the guys at the crime lab dont have batteries superglued to their gonads youve got them there ten minutes later gabe looked up from his microscope well its not human he said swell in fact it doesnt appear to be hair so what is it well it seems to have a lot of the qualities of optic fiber so its manmade not so fast it has a root and what appears to be a cuticle but it doesnt look like keratin id have to have it tested for proteins if its manufactured theres no evidence of the process it looks as if it was grown not made you know polarbear hair has fiberoptic properties channels light energy through to the black skin for heat so its polarbear hair not so fast gabe goddammit where in the hell did it come from you tell me just us okay this doesnt leave this cottage unless we get some confirmation okay of course are you okay theo am i okay youre asking me if im okay everything all right with you and molly the job youre not smoking dope again are you theo hung his head you say you have another one of those electrodes gabe brightened youll need to shave a spot can i open my present while youre in the bathroom you can use my razor no go ahead and open your present i have some stuff i need to tell you wow a salad shooter thanks theo he took the salad shooter molly said wow was that important to him lena asked it was a wedding present i know i gave it to you it was a wedding present to me and dale too see there was tradition molly was inconsolable she drank off half of her diet coke and slammed the plastic budweiser cup down on the bar like a pirate cursing over a schooner of grog bastard it was wednesday evening and they were at the head of the slug saloon to coordinate the replanning of the food for the christmas for the lonesome party lenas first reaction to mollys call to help was to beg off and stay at home but even as she was creating an excuse she realized that shed only sit home obsessing alternately on getting caught for killing dale and getting her heart broken by this strange strange helicopter pilot she decided that maybe meeting with molly and mavis down at the slug wasnt such a bad idea and she might be able to find out from molly if theo suspected her in dales disappearance yeah fat chance with molly obsessing on theos whatever it was that theo was supposed to have done wrong it sounded to lena like he had just taken a salad shooter to work with him you were supposed to empathize with your friends problems but they were after all your friends problems and lenas friends molly in particular could be a little wacky the bar was full of singles in their twenties and thirties and you could feel a desperate energy sparking around the dark room like loneliness was the negative and sex was the positive and someone was brushing the wires together over an open bucket of gasoline this was the fallout of the holiday heartbreak cycle that started with young men who lacking any stronger motivation toward changing their lives would break up with their current girlfriend in order to avoid having to buy her a christmas present the distraught women would sulk for a few days eat ice cream and avoid calling relatives but then as the idea of a solitary christmas and new year started to loom large they swarmed into the slug in search of a companion virtually any companion with whom they could pass the holidays full speed ahead and forget the presents pine coves male singles to display their newfound freedom would descend on the slug and avail themselves of the affections of dejected women in a game of smalltown sexual musical chairs played hungrily to the tune of deck the halls everyone hoping to have slipped drunkenly into someone more comfortable before the last fa was lalaed there might have been a bubble around lena and molly however for they were obviously not part of the game while both were certainly more than attractive enough to garner attention from the younger men they had about them a mystique of experience of having been there and moved on of unbullshitability essentially they scared the hell out of all but the drunkest of the slugs suitors and the fact that they were drinking straight diet coke scared the hell out of the drunks molly and lena despite their own personal distress had slain their own holiday desperation dragons which was how the lonesome christmas party had started in the first place now they were on to new individual anxieties sloppy joes said mavis a great cloud of lowtar smoke powering the announcement and washing over lena and molly it had been illegal to smoke in california bars for years but mavis ignored the law and the authorities theophilus crowe and smoked on who doesnt like his meat sloppy on a bun mavis its christmas lena said so far mavis had only suggested soupy or saucy entrées lena suspected that mavis had misplaced her dentures again and was therefore lobbying for a gummable feast with pickles then red sauce green pickles christmas theme i mean shouldnt we do something nice for christmas not just sloppy joes at five bucks a head i told her that barbecue was the only way to feed them mavis leaned in and looked at molly who was muttering malevolently into her ice cubes but everyone seems to think its going to rain like it ever rains in december molly looked up and growled a little then looked at the television screen behind mavis and pointed the sound was muted but there was a weather map of california about eight hundred miles off the coast there was a great blob of color whirling in jumpframe satellitephoto motion making it appear that a technicolor amoeba was about to consume the bay area aint nothin mavis said they wont even give it a name if that thing was crouched like that over bermuda theyd have given it a name two days ago know why cause they dont come onshore here that bitch will turn right a hundred miles off anacapa island and go down and dump all over the yucatan meanwhile we wont be able to wash our cars because of the drought the rain at least will stop any sandpirate attacks molly said crunching an ice cube huh said lena the hell did you say mavis adjusted her hearing aid nothing molly said what do you guys think about lasagna you know some garlic bread a little salad yeah we can probably do it for five bucks a head if we dont use sauce or cheese said mavis lasagna just doesnt seem very christmasy said lena we could put it in santa claus pans molly suggested no lena snapped no santas we can do a snowman or something but no friggin santas mavis reached over and patted lenas hand santa played a little grabass with a lot of us when we were little darlin once your mustache starts growing youre supposed to let go of that shit i am not growing a mustache do you wax because you cant see a thing said molly being supportive i do not have a mustache said lena you think its bad being a mexican romanian women have to start shaving when theyre twelve mavis said lena took that opportunity to plant her elbows squarely on the bar and grip two great handfuls of her hair which she began to pull slowly and steadily to make her point what said mavis what said molly and there was an awkward moment of silence among the three only the muted jukebox thumping in the background and the low murmur of people lying to one another they looked around to avoid talking then turned to the front door as vance mcnally pine coves senior emt came through it and let loose a long growling belch vance was in his midfifties and fancied himself a charmer and a hero when in fact he was a bit of a dolt he had been driving the ambulance for over twenty years now and nothing gave him pleasure like being the bearer of bad news it was the measure of his importance you guys hear that the highway patrol found dale pearsons truck parked up in big sur by lime kiln rock looks like he was fishing and fell in yep surf coming up from that storm theyll never find him theos up there now investigating lena stumbled back to her bar stool and climbed up she was sure everyone in the bar all the locals anyway were looking at her for a reaction she let her long hair hang down by her face hiding in it so lasagna it is said mavis but no fucking santa pans lena snapped not looking up mavis pulled both of their plastic cups off the bar normal circumstances youd be cut off but as it is i think you two really need to start drinking chapter the local guys they have their moments thursday morning it became official dale pearson evil developer was a missing person theo crowe was going over the big red truck parked by the pounding pacific at lime kiln rock in the big sur wilderness area above pine cove this was the area where half the worlds car commercials were filmed everything from detroit minivans to german luxocruisers was filmed snaking around the cliffs of big sur as if all you needed to do was sign the lease papers and your life would be an open road of frothy waves beating on majestic seawalls with nothing but leisure and prosperity ahead dale pearsons big red truck did look carefree and prosperous parked there by the sea despite the crust of salt forming on the paint and the appearance that the owner had been washed away in the surf theo wanted that to be the case the highway patrol who had found the truck had reported it as an accident there was a surfcasting rod there on the rocks conveniently monogrammed with dales initials and the santa hat hed been wearing was found washed up nearby and therein lay the problem betsy butler dales squeeze had said that dale had gone out two nights ago to play santa at the caribou lodge and had never come home who went fishing in the middle of the night while wearing a santa hat granted according to the other caribou dale had done some drinking and he was a little wound up from his confrontation with his exwife the day before but he hadnt lost his mind completely negotiating the cliffs by lime kiln rock to get down to the water during the day was risky business theres no way that dale would have tried it in the middle of the night theo had lost his footing and slid twenty feet before he caught himself wrenching his back in the process sure he was a little stoned but then dale would have been a little drunk the highway patrolman who had a crew cut and looked to be about twelve an escapee from one of the hygiene films theo had seen in sixthgrade health class why mary wont go in the water had theo sign off on his report then climbed in his cruiser and headed up the coast into monterey county theo went back and looked through the truck again all the things that should have been there some tools a black mag flashlight a couple of fastfood wrappers another fishing rod a tube of blueprints were there and all the things that shouldnt bloody knives shell casings severed limbs evidence of bleach from cleanup were not it was like the guy had just driven up here climbed down the cliff and washed away but that just couldnt be the case dale could be meanspirited crude and even violent but he wasnt stupid unless he knew the exact topography of these cliffs and had a good flashlight hed never have made it down in the dark and his flashlight was still in the truck theo wished that he had better training in crimescene investigation hed learned most of what he knew from television not at the academy where hed spent a miserable eight weeks fifteen years ago when the corrupt sheriff who had found his personal pot patch had railroaded him into becoming pine coves constable since the academy almost every crime scene hed encountered had been turned over to the county sheriff or highway patrol almost immediately he went over the truck cab again looking for something that might be a clue the only thing remotely out of order was some dog hairs on the headrest theo couldnt remember if dale had a dog he put the dog hairs in a sandwich bag and dialed betsy butler on his cell phone she didnt sound that broken up about dales disappearance no dale didnt like dogs he didnt like cats either he was kind of a cow man he liked cows did you guys have a pet cow could it be cow hair no he liked to eat them theo are you okay no sorry betsy he had been so sure that he didnt sound stoned so do i get the truck i mean are you going to bring it here i have no idea said theo theyll tow it to the impound yard i dont know if theyll release it to you id better go betsy he snapped the phone shut maybe he was just tired molly had made him sleep on the couch last night saying something about him having mutant tendencies he hadnt even known that she liked the salad shooter he was sure that she could tell that hed been smoking pot he flipped the phone back open and called gabe fenton hey theo i dont know what that stuff is you brought me but its not hair it wont burn or melt and its damn hard to cut or break good thing it was torn out by the roots theo cringed he had almost forgotten about the crazed blond guy hed run over he shuddered now thinking about it gabe i have some more hair id like you to look at oh my god theo did you run over someone else no i didnt run over anybody jeez gabe okay ill be here all day actually ill be here all night too its not like i have anywhere to go or anyone who cares whether i live or die its not like okay im coming over there were two men and three women including lena in the offices of properties in the pines when tucker case came through the door the women were immediately intrigued by him and the men immediately disliked him it had always been that way with tuck later if they got to know him the women would dismiss him and the men would still dislike him basically he was a geek in a cool guys body one feature or the other worked against him it was an open stable of desks and tuck went directly to lenas desk at the back as he went he smiled and nodded to the realtors who smiled back weakly trying not to sneer they were beat from showing properties to christmas vacation bebacks who wouldnt move here even if they could find employment in this toy town theyd just failed to plan any vacation activities and so decided to take the kids out for a rousing round of jerk off the realtor or so went the party line at the mls meetings lena met tucks gaze and instinctively smiled then frowned what are you doing here lunch you me eating talking i need to ask you something i thought you were supposed to be flying tuck hadnt seen lena in her business clothes a sensible skirt and blouse just a little mascara and lipstick her hair pinned up with lacquered chopsticks a few strands escaping here and there to frame her face he liked the look i flew all morning theres weather the edge of a storm coming he really wanted to pull the chopsticks out of her hair and throw her down there on the desk and tell her how he really felt which was somewhat aroused we could get chinese he added lena looked out the window the sky was going dark gray over the shops across the street theres no chinese place in pine cove besides im really swamped here i handle vacation rentals and its christmas eve eve we could go to your place for a quick lunch you have no idea how quick i can be if i put my mind to it lena looked past him to her coworkers who of course were now staring is that what you need to ask me oh no no of course not i wouldnt that would be well yes but theres something else now tuck was feeling the realtors watching him listening to him he leaned over lenas desk so only she could hear you said this morning that that constable guy your friend is married to lives in a cabin at the edge of a ranch it wouldnt be the big ranch north of town would it lena was still looking past him yes the beerbar ranch belongs to jim beer and theres an old singlewide trailer next to the cabin yes that used to be mollys but now they live in the cabin why tuck stood back and grinned then white roses it is he said a little too loudly for the benefit of the audience i just didnt know if theyd be appropriate for the holidays huh lena said see you tonight tuck said he leaned over and kissed her on the cheek then sauntered out of the office smiling apologetically at the exhausted realtors as he went merry christmas you guys he said waving from the door the first thing that theo noticed when he entered gabe fentons cabin was the aquariums with the dead rats the female was scampering around the center cage sniffing and crapping and looking rathappy but the others the males lay on their backs feet shot to the sky like plastic soldiers in a death diorama how did that happen they wouldnt learn once they associated the shock with sex they started liking it theo thought about his relationship with molly over the last few days he pictured himself in the deadrat display so you just kept shocking them until they died i had to keep the parameters of the experiment constant theo nodded gravely as if he understood completely which he didnt skinner came over and headbutted him in the thigh theo scratched his ears to comfort him skinner was worried about the food guy and he was hoping that maybe the emergency backup food guy might give him one of the tastysmelling white squirrels in the cages on the table now that it appeared that the food guy was finished cooking them this teasing was as bad as when that kid at the beach used to pretend to throw the ball then not throw the ball then pretend to throw the ball but not throw the ball skinner had to knock the kid down and sit on his face boy had he been baddogged for that nothing hurt like being baddogged but if the food guy kept teasing him with the white squirrels skinner knew he was going to have to knock him down and sit on his face maybe even poop in his shoe oh i am a bad bad dog no wait the emergency backup food guy was scratching his ears oh that felt good he was fine doggie xanax never mind theo handed gabe the sandwich bag with the hairs in it whats the oily substance in the bag gabe said examining the specimen potatochip flotsam the bag is from my lunch yesterday gabe nodded then looked at theo the way the coroner always looks at the cop on tv like you numbskull dont you know that youre contaminating evidence just by continuing to draw breath and id be a lot more comfortable with you if youd stop he took the bag over to the microscope on the counter removed a couple of the hairs and put them on a slide with a cover then fitted it into the microscope please dont tell me its polar bear theo said no but at least its an animal it seems to have a distinct sourcreamandonion signature gabe pulled back from the microscope and grinned at theo just fucking with you he gave theo a gentle punch to the arm and looked back into the microscope wow the medulla is absent and theres low birefringence wow echoed theo trying but not really feeling the lowbirefringence stoke that gabe was i have to check the hair database online but i think its from a bat theres a database for that what bat hair dotcom that was supposed to be the whole purpose of the internet you know to share scientific information not a viagra and porndelivery system theo said maybe gabe was going to be okay after all gabe moved to the computer at his desk and scrolled through screen after screen of microscope photos of mammal hair until he found one he liked then went back to the microscope and checked it again wow theo youve got yourself an endangered species here no way where the hell did you get this micronesian giant fruit bat out of a dodge pickup truck hmm thats not listed as their habitat it wasnt parked in guam was it theo fished his car keys out of his pocket look gabe i have to go meet at the slug for a beer tonight okay we can have beer now if you want i have some in the fridge you need to get out i need to get out okay theo was backing out the door okay ill meet you at six i have to go pick up some super glue solvent at the thriftymart bye theo jumped off the porch and loped to the volvo skinner barked at him in fourfour time hello tasty white squirrels still in the little box hello you forgot when theo pulled up to lena marquezs house there was a generic white economy rental car a ford mucus he thought parked out front he looked for the bat hed seen hanging from the porch ceiling but it wasnt there he hadnt even filed the experience of running over the apparently indestructible blond guy and now he was facing the possibility that he might actually be about to confront a murderer just in case hed stopped at home and gotten his gun off the shelf in the closet and his handcuffs off the bedpost where molly had last imprisoned him when they had still been speaking shed been in the yard out behind the cabin working out with a bamboo shinai kendo sword shed been using since breaking her broadsword hed snuck in and out without confrontation he unsnapped the glocks nylon holster that was clipped to the back of his jeans and rang the doorbell the door opened theo screamed and drew his gun as he jumped back on the other side of the threshold tucker case screamed and dove backward also shielding his face with his hands his hat made a little yelping sound hold it right there theo said he could feel his pulse beating in his neck im holding im holding jesus what the fuck is this about you have a bat on your head yeah and for that youre going to shoot me the bat his huge black wings wrapped around the pilots head gave the impression of a large leather cap with a mohawk crest of fur that culminated in a bigeared little dog face that was now barking at theo well uh no theo lowered the gun feeling a little embarrassed now he was still in his shooters crouch though which now with the gun lowered made him look like he was posing as the worlds skinniest sumo wrestler can i get up tuck asked sure i just wanted to talk to lena tucker case was exasperated and his bat had fallen over one eye well shes at her office look if youre going to get high maybe you ought to leave the gun at home huh what theo had been careful to use some visine and it had been hours since hed hit his sneaky pete pot pipe he said im not high i havent gotten high in years yeah right constable maybe youd better come in theo stood and tried to shake off the appearance that hed just had about five years of life scared out of him by a guy with a bat on his head he followed tucker case into lenas kitchen where the pilot offered him a seat at the table so constable what can i do for you theo wasnt sure hed planned on talking to lena or at least the two of them together well as you probably know we found lenas exhusbands truck up in big sur of course i saw it you saw it from the helicopter tucker case contract pilot for the dea remember you can check me out if you want to anyway weve been patrolling that area you have the bat was looking at theo and theo was having trouble following his own thoughts the bat was wearing tiny sunglasses raybans theo could see by the trademark in the corner of one lens im sorry mr uh case could you take the bat off your head its very distracting him pardon its a him roberto he no like the light pardon friend of mine used to say that sorry tucker case unwrapped the bat and put it on the floor where it spidered away walking on its wing tips into the living room god thats creepy theo said yeah you know kids what are you gonna do tuck dazzled a perfect grin so you found this guys truck not him though no it was made to look like he was washed into the ocean while fishing off the rocks made to look so you suspect foul play tuck bounced his eyebrows theo thought the pilot should be taking this more seriously it was time to drop the bomb yes first he never came home after the caribou christmas party tuesday night where he played the joke santa no one goes surffishing in the middle of the night wearing a santa suit we found the santa hat still in the truck and i found hairs from a micronesian fruit bat on the headrest well thats a coincidence jeez thats got to make you suspicious doesnt it tucker case got up and went over to the counter coffee i just made it theo stood up too just because he didnt want the suspect to get away or maybe to show that he was taller because it seemed like the only advantage he had over the pilot yes it is suspicious and i talked to a kid tuesday night who said he saw a woman killing santa claus with a shovel i didnt think anything of it then but now i think the kid might have actually seen something tucker case was busying himself with getting cups out of the cupboard milk out of the fridge so you did tell the kid that theres no santa right no i didnt now tucker case turned coffeepot in hand and regarded theo you know that there is no santa dont you constable this is not a joke theo said he hated this hated being the man he was supposed to be the smartass in the face of authority figures cream theo sighed sure and sugar please tuck finished preparing the coffee brought the cups to the table and sat down look i see where youre going with this theo can i call you theo theo nodded thanks anyway lena was with me tuesday night all night really i saw lena on monday she didnt mention you where did you meet at the thriftymart she was a salvation army santa i thought she was attractive so i asked her out we hit it off you make it a habit of hitting on the salvation army santas lena said that youre married to a scream queen called kendra warrior babe of the outland theo nearly shot coffee out his nose that was a character she used to play yeah lena says sometimes thats not so clear to her my point is love is where you find it theo nodded yeah that was true before he drifted into a wistful state of mind theo reminded himself that this guy was in an offhand way attacking the woman he loved hey theo said its okay who am i to judge i married an island girl who had never seen indoor plumbing until i brought her to the states didnt work out fruitbat hair in the truck theo interrupted yeah i knew youd come back to that well who knows roberto goes out on his own from time to time maybe he met this dale guy maybe they hit it off you know love is where you find it i doubt it though i hear that this dale guy was a real creep are you implying that your bat may have something to do with the disappearance of dale pearson no you nitwit im saying that my bat may have had something to do with bat hair which even you with your sherlock holmeslike powers of observation may have noticed he is all covered with i cant believe youre a cop theo said getting truly angry now im not a cop i just fly the helicopter for the dea they hire me by the season and this is close to the harvest season in big sur and surrounding areas so here i am flying around looking in the forest for dark green patches while the agents in the back look at it through infrared and record everything on gps so they can get specific warrants and man do they pay well vive la war on drugs i say but no im not a cop i didnt think so funny thing is i have learned to spot the right color of green from the sky and usually the infrared confirms my suspicions this morning i spotted about a thousandsquarefoot patch of marijuana growing just north of the beerbar ranch you know where that is theo felt a lump in his throat the size of one of gabes dead rats yes man thats a lot of pot even by commercial growers standards felony quantity i turned the helicopter steered away without calling it to the agents attention but weather permitting we could go back theres a storm coming in you know roberto and i drove by there this afternoon just to make sure i guess i can always show the agents tomorrow tucker case put down his coffee leaned on his elbows and turned his head sideways like he was a cute kid in a cereal commercial who was reaching sugar nirvana youre a very unlikable man mr case oh my god you should have seen me before i had my epiphany i used to really be an asshole im actually very charming now by the way i saw your wife working out in the yard at your house very nice the whole sword thing is a little scary but otherwise very nice theo got to his feet feeling a little dizzy even as he stood like hed been hit with a sock full of sand id better be going tucker case put his hand on theos shoulder as he walked him to the door you probably dont believe this theo but at another time im sure wed be friends and you have to understand i really really want things to work out with lena it was like we met just at the precise moment the exact second that i got over my divorce and was ready to love again and its so nice to have someone to bone under the christmas tree dont you think shes a great woman i like lena theo said but you are a psychopath you think tuck said ive really been trying to be more helpful chapter love kicked to the curb you did what lena said then adding and take that bat off your head its unnerving to have a hat looking at you like that like what tuck said dont change the subject you blackmailed theo crowe she was pacing her kitchen tuck sat at the counter wearing a gold oxfordcloth shirt that complemented the bat on his head while accentuating the sea blue of his eyes the bat for once wasnt wearing sunglasses not really it was only sort of implied hed figured out that id been in your exhusbands truck he knew now hell just forget it he may not he may have some integrity unlike some people hey hey hey lets not point the finger here my ex is still living well in the caymans on money that i rightfully stole from an organsmuggling doctor while yours need i remind you dales death was an accident everything since then all this craziness has been your doing you come into my life at the worst possible moment like you had a plan all along and things have gone more and more out of control now youre blackmailing my friends tucker are you insane sure sure just like that sure youre insane sure everyone is if you think anyone is sane you just dont know enough about them the key and this is very relevant in our case is to find someone whose insanity dovetails with your own like us he flashed what lena thought was supposed to be a charming grin which was somewhat defused by his trying to untangle one of robertos wing claws from his hair lena turned from him and leaned against the counter in front of the dishwasher hoping to steel herself for what she had to do unfortunately tuck had just run a load of dishes and the steam from the vent in front was streaming through her thin skirt and making her feel inappropriately moist for righteous indignation she spun around with resolve and allowed the dishwasher to steam her backside as she made her pronouncement look tucker you are a very attractive man she took a deep breath on the pause no way youre breaking up with me and i do like you despite the situation oh right you dont want to have anything to do with an attractive guy who you like heaven forbid would you shut up the bat barked at her tone you too fur face look in another time and place maybe but youre too im too you just accept things too easily i need your anxiety would you please let me finish sure go ahead he nodded the bat now on his shoulder nodded as well lena had to look away and your bat is freaking me out yeah well you should have been around when he used to talk out tucker i need you out of my life i have too much to deal with you are too much to deal with but the sex it was great it was i understand if you want to go to the authorities i may even go myself but this just isnt right tucker case hung his head roberto the fruit bat hung his head tucker case looked at the fruit bat who in turn looked at lena as if to say well i hope you re happy you broke his heart ill get my stuff tuck said lena was crying and she didnt want to be crying but she was she watched tuck pick up his things around the house and stuff them into a flight bag wondering how he had spread so much crap around her house in only two days men they were always marking territory he paused at the door and looked back im not going to go to the authorities im just going to go lena rubbed her forehead as if she had a headache but mainly to cover her tears okay then im going then goodbye tucker you wont have anyone to sex up under the christmas tree lena looked up jeez tuck okay im going now and he did lena marquez went into her bedroom to call her friend molly maybe crying over the phone to a girlfriend would bring a sense of normalcy back into her life sour nerds cinnamon geeks or gummy boogers sam applebaums mom was picking out a nice reasonably priced cabernet and sam was allowed one item of candy from the rack at brines bait tackle and fine wines of course the boogers would last the longest but they were all mundane greenapple finish while the nerds proffered a fruity variety and an impudent little top note of tang cinnamon geeks had a rich nose and a bit of a bite up front but their tiny certifiedpublicaccountant shape betrayed their bourgeois origins sam was learning wine words he was seven and he very much enjoyed unnerving adults with his wineword vocabulary hanukkah had just ended and there had been a lot of dinners at sams house over the last week with a lot of wine talk and sam had joyfully freaked out a whole table of his relatives by pronouncing after the blessing that the manischewitz blackberry the only wine he was allowed to taste was a tannacious little cunt of a red but not without a certain buttery geranium charm he finished dinner in his room over that one but it was tannacious philistines you are one of the chosen said a voice up and to the right of sam i destroyed the canaanites so your people would have a homeland he looked up and saw a man with long blond hair wearing a long black duster a jolt went through sam like hed just licked a battery this was the guy that had scared his friend josh so badly he looked around and saw his mom was in the back of the store with mr masterson the owner can i get these with this asked the man he had three candy bars in one hand and a small silver coin about the size of a dime in the other the coin looked very old thats a foreign coin i dont think they take it the man nodded thoughtfully and looked very sad at the news but nestles crunch is a fine choice said sam trying to buy time and keep the guy from going off on him a bit naive but an undergrowth of ambergris and walnut gives it legs sam looked around for his mom again she was still talking wine with mr masterson flirting about it sam could be cut up in pieces and put away in freezer bags and she wouldnt notice maybe he could get the guy to leave look they arent looking why dont you just take them i cant said the blond man why not because no one has told me to oh no this guy looked like a grownup but actually he had the mind of a dumb little kid inside like that guy in sling blade or the president then ill tell you to okay sam said go ahead take them youd better get going though its going to rain sam couldnt remember ever talking to an adult like this before the blond man looked at his candy bars then at sam thank you peace on earth goodwill toward men merry christmas im jewish remember we dont celebrate christmas we celebrate hanukkah the miracle of the lights oh that wasnt a miracle sure it was no i remember someone snuck in and put more oil in the lamp but i will grant a christmas miracle tomorrow i must go with that the blond man backed away hugging his candy bars to his chest shalom child and in an instant he was just gone great sam said just great throw that in my face kendra the warrior babe of the outland combat mistress of the hotoil arena slayer of monsters menace to mutants scourge of the sand pirates sworn protector of the cudbeast herdsmen of lan and intramural blood champion of the termite people mounds seven through twelve inclusive enjoyed cheese so it came to pass on that twentythird of december with her noodles wet and congealing in the colander that she did raise her wellmuscled arm to the sky and call the wrath of all the furies down upon her higher power nigoth the worm god for allowing her to leave the mozzarella at the thriftymart checkout counter but the gods do not concern themselves in the affairs of lasagna so the sky did not explode with vengeful fire or at least not that she could see from the kitchen window to incinerate the mingy god who would dare desert her in her most dire hour of cheese what happened was nothing at all curse be unto yon nigoth would that my blade was not broken i would track you to the ends of the outland and sever your thousand and one eyestalks just to make sure i got your favorite then i would feed them raw to the most heinous then the phone rang helloo molly sang sweetly molly lena said you sound out of breath are you okay quick think of something said the narrator dont tell her what you were doing the narrator had been with molly almost constantly for the last two days mostly an irritation except that he had remembered how much oregano and thyme to use in the red sauce nevertheless she knew that he was a sign she needed to get back on her meds asap oh yeah im fine lena just buffing the muffin you know gray afternoon storm coming in theos a mutant i thought id cheer myself up there was a long silence on the line and molly wondered if shed sounded convincing completely convincing said the narrator if i wasnt here id swear you were still doing it youre not here molly said pardon said lena molly i can call back if this is a bad time oh no no no im okay just making lasagna ive never heard it called that before for the party oh right hows it going i forgot the mozzarella paid for it then left it at the check stand she looked at the three cartons of ricotta sitting on the counter mocking her soft cheeses could be so smug ill go pick it up and bring it over no molly felt a jolt of adrenaline at the thought that shed have to push through a long girlfriend session with lena things were getting so blurry between pine cove and the outland i mean its okay i can do it i enjoy cheese shopping for cheese molly heard a sniffle on the other end of the line mol i really need to help you with the goddamn lasagna okay really well she sounds as nutty as you are said the narrator molly swatted at the air to shut him up did a fingertolip emphatic rocking shush mime shes a crisis junkie if i ever saw one i need to talk to someone lena said with a sniff i broke up with tucker oh im so sorry lena whos tucker the pilot i was seeing the guy with the bat you just met him didnt you take a bath eat some ice cream youve known him two days right we shared a lot cowboy up lena you fucked him and kicked him to the curb its not like he stole your design for a coldfusion reactor youll be okay molly its christmas youre supposed to be my friend molly nodded at the phone then realized that lena couldnt hear her true she wasnt being a very good friend after all she was sworn protector of the cudbeast herdsmen of lan as well as a member of the screen actors guild it was her duty to pretend she cared about her friends problems bring the cheese she said well be here we me bring the cheese lena theo crowe showed up at brines bait tackle and fine wines just in time to miss everything robert masterson the owner of brines had called him as soon as hed seen the mysterious blond man talking to sam applebaum and theo had rushed right over only to find that there was nothing to find the blond guy hadnt hurt or threatened sam and the boy seemed fine except that he kept babbling about changing his religion and becoming a rastafarian like his cousin preston who lived on maui theo realized midway through the interview that he was not the guy to enumerate the reasons why one should not spend his life smoking dope and surfing like sams cousin preston because he a had never learned to surf and b didnt have the foggiest idea how rastafarianism worked and c would eventually have to use the argument and look at what a complete loser i am you dont want that for yourself do you sam he left the scene feeling even more useless than he had after the verbal bitchslapping hed taken from the pilot at lena marquezs house when theo pulled into his driveway at lunchtime hoping he might be able to patch things up with molly and get some sympathy and a sandwich he saw lenas truck parked in front of the cabin and his heart sank he debated shuffling over to the commercial pot patch and smoking a sticky bud before going in but that sounded an awful lot like the behavior of an addict and he was simply on a little slide from grace not a blowout still he came through the door humbled not sure at all how he was going to handle lena who might be a murderer let alone molly traitor molly said from over a pan of noodles she was layering into a pan with sauce meat and cheese she had sauce on her hands up to her elbows and looked like shed been engaged in some very messy surgery the back door out of the kitchen had slammed shut as he came in wheres lena theo said she went out the back why are you afraid shell reveal your secret theo shrugged and approached his wife his arms out to the side in a gimme a break gesture why was it that when she was angry her teeth looked really sharp he never noticed that any other time mol i was just doing it so i could get you something for christmas i didnt mean to oh i dont care about that youre investigating lena my friend lena you just went to her house like shes a criminal or something its the radiation isnt it theres evidence molly and its not that i got high i found fruitbat hairs in dales truck and her boyfriend has a fruit bat and the little barker kid said theo heard a car start up outside i should talk to her lena wouldnt hurt anyone she brought me cheese for christmas for christs sake shes a pacifist i know that molly im not saying that she hurt anyone but i need to find out besides some fuckers just need killing did she tell you i think its the pot that makes you reveal your mutant self she had a lasagna noodle in her hand and was waving it at him it sort of looked like she was shaking a living creature but then he was still a little buzzed molly what are you talking about my mutant self are you taking your meds how dare you accuse me of being crazy thats worse than if you asked me if it was my time of the month which it isnt by the way but i cant believe that youd imply that i need to be medicated you mutant bastard she flung the noodle at him and he ducked you do need to be medicated you crazy bitch theo didnt deal well with violence even in the form of soggy semolina but after the initial outburst he immediately lost the will to fight im sorry i dont know what i was thinking lets just fine molly said she wiped her hands on a dish towel then tossed it at him in dodging it he felt like he was moving in blurred bullet time in the matrix but in truth he was just a tall guy who was a little baked and the towel would have missed him anyway molly stomped through the little house into their bedroom and dropped to the floor on the far side of the bed molly you okay she came up holding a package the size of a shoe box wrapped in christmas paper with a few dust bunnies clinging to it she held it out to him here take it and go i dont want to see you traitor go theo was stunned was she leaving him asking him to leave her how had this gone so wrong so fast i dont want to go im having a really bad day molly i came home hoping to find a little sympathy yeah okay here you go aw poor stoned theo im so sorry that you have to investigate my best friend the day before christmas eve when you could be out playing in an illegal pot patch that looks like the jungle plateau of the gibbon people she held out his present and he took it what the hell was she talking about so it is about the victory garden open it she said she didnt say a word more she put a hand on her hip and fixed him with that i am so going to kick your ass or fuck your brains out look that excited and terrified him as he wasnt always sure which way she would go with it only that she was going to get satisfaction one way or the other and he was going to be sore the next day because of it it was a warrior babe look and he realized fully then that she was having an episode she probably really was off her meds this had to be handled just right he backed away a few steps and tore the paper off the package inside was a white box with the silver seal of a very exclusive local glassblower and inside that wrapped in blue tissue was the most beautiful bong hed ever seen it was like something out of the art nouveau era only fashioned from modern materials bluegreen dichromatic glass with ornate silver branches running through it that gave it the appearance of walking through a forest as he turned it in his hand the bowl and handle which fit his hand perfectly appeared to be cast of solid silver with the same organic treebranch design seeming to leap right out of the glass this had to have been made just for him with his tastes in mind he felt himself tearing up and blinked back the tears its beautiful uhhuh molly said so you can see its not your garden that bothers me its just you molly i only want to talk to lena her boyfriend threatened to blackmail me i was only growing take it and go molly said honey you need to call dr val maybe see if shell see you get out goddammit you dont tell me to see the shrink get out it was no use not now anyway her voice had hit the warrior babe frenzy pitch he recognized it from the times hed taken her to the county hospital before theyd become involved as lovers when shed just been the towns crazy lady shed lose it if he pressed her any more fine ill go but ill call you okay she just gave him that look its christmas one last try maybe the look fine your present is on the top shelf in the closet merry christmas he dug some underwear and socks out of the drawer grabbed a few shirts out of the closet and headed out the front door she slammed it hard enough behind him to break one of the windows the glass hitting the sidewalk sounded like a summary of his whole life chapter a slug trail of good cheer he might have been made of polished mahogany except that when he moved he moved like liquid the stage lights reflected green and red off his bald head as he swayed on the stool and teased the strings of a blond stratocaster with the severed neck of a beer bottle his name was catfish jefferson and he was seventy or eighty or one hundred years old and not unlike roberto the fruit bat he wore sunglasses indoors catfish was a bluesman and on the night before the night before christmas he was singing up a forlorn twelvebar blues fog in the head of the slug saloon caught my baby boning santa underneath the mistletoe lawd have mercy caught my baby boning santa underneath the mistletoe used to be my christmas angel now she just a christmas ho i hear dat shouted gabe fenton shonuff shonuff true dat my brutha theophilus crowe looked at his friend just one in a whole line of awkward heartbroken men at the bar rocking almost in rhythm to the beat and shook his head could you possibly be any whiter theo asked i gots the blues up in me gabe said she shonuff did me wrong gabe had been drinking theo while not quite sober had not he had shared a toothpickthin spliff of big sur polio weed with catfish jefferson between sets the two of them standing in the back parking lot of the slug trying to coax fire out of a disposable lighter in a fortyknot wind didnt think you muthafuckas had weather here catfish croaked having sucked the joint so far down that the ember looked like the burning eye of a demon staring out of a cave of dark finger and lip the calluses on the tips of his fingers were impervious to the heat el niño theo said letting loose a blast of smoke say what its a warm ocean current in the pacific comes up the coast every ten years or so screws up the fishing brings torrential rains storms they think we might be having an el niño this year when will they know the bluesman had put on his leather fedora and was holding it fast against the wind usually after everything floods the wine crop is ruined and a lot of cliffside houses slide into the ocean and dat because the water too warm right no wonder the whole country hate your ass said catfish lets go inside fo my narrow ass gets blowed back to clarksville its not that bad said theo i think itll blow over winter denial theo did it most californians did it they assumed that because the weather was nice most of the time it would be nice all of the time and so in the midst of a rainstorm youd find people outdoors without an umbrella or when nights dipped into the thirties youd still see someone dippumping his gas in surfer shorts and a tank top so even as the national weather service was telling the central coast to batten down the hatches as they were about to get the storm of the decade and even though winds were gusting to fifty knots a full day before the storm made landfall the people of pine cove carried on with their holiday routine like nothing out of the ordinary could happen to them winter denial therein lay the key to california schadenfreude the secret joy that the rest of the country feels at the misfortune of california the country said look at them with their fitness and their tans their beaches and their movie stars their silicon valley and silicone breasts their orange bridge and their palm trees god i hate those smug sunshiny bastards because if youre up to your navel in a snowdrift in ohio nothing warms your heart like the sight of california on fire if youre shoveling silt out of your basement in the fargo flood zone nothing brightens your day like watching a malibu mansion tumbling down a cliff into the sea and if a tornado just peppered the land around your oklahoma town with random trailer trash and redneck nuggets then you can find a quantum of solace in the fact that the earth actually opened up in the san fernando valley and swallowed a whole caravan of commuting suvs mavis sand even indulged in a little california schadenfreude and she was a californian born and raised secretly she wished for and enjoyed the forest fires every year not so much because she liked watching the state burn down but because for maviss money there was nothing better than watching a burly man in rubber handling a hefty hose and during the fires there were plenty of those on the news fruitcake mavis said offering a suspicious slice on a dessert plate to gabe fenton who was drunkenly trying to convince theo crowe that he had a genetic predisposition toward the blues using some impressively large words that no one but he understood and periodically asking if he could get an amen and five up high which as it turned out he could not what he could get was fruitcake mercy mercy my momma done made a fruitcake look just like that gabe howled lawd rest her soul gabe reached for the plate but theo intercepted it and held it out of the biologists reach first theo said your mother was an anthro professor and never baked a thing in her life and second she is not dead and third you are an atheist can i get an amen gabe countered theo raised an eyebrow of accusation toward mavis i thought we talked about no fruitcake this year the prior christmas maviss fruitcake had put two people into detox shed sworn that it would be the last year mavis shrugged this cakes nearly a virgin theres only a quart of rum and barely a handful of vicodin lets not theo said handing the plate back fine mavis said but get your buddy off his blues jag hes embarrassing me and i once blew a burro in a nightclub and wasnt embarrassed so thats saying something jeez mavis theo said trying to shake the picture from his mind what i didnt have my glasses on i thought he was a hirsute insurance salesman with talent id better get him home theo said nudging gabe who had turned his attention to a young woman on his right who was wearing a lowcut red sweater and had been moving from stool to stool all night long waiting for someone to talk to her hi gabe said to the womans cleavage im not involved in the human experience and i have no redeeming qualities as a man me either said tucker case from the stool on the other side of the redsweater woman do people keep telling you that youre a psychopath too i hate that tucker case under several layers of glibness and guile was actually quite broken up over his breakup with lena marquez it wasnt so much that she had become a part of his life in the two days he had known her but that she had begun to represent hope and as the buddha said hope is merely another face of desire and desire is a motherfucker hed gone out seeking human company to help dilute the disappointment in another time hed have picked up the first woman he encountered but his manslut days had left him lonelier than ever and he would not tread that lubricious path again so tuck said to gabe did you just get dumped she led me on gabe said she tore my guts out evil thy name is woman dont talk to him theo said taking gabe by the shoulder and unsuccessfully trying to pull him off his bar stool this guys no good the young woman sitting between tuck and gabe looked from one to the other then to theo then at her breasts then at the men as if to say are you guys blind ive been sitting here all night with these and youre going to ignore me tucker case was ignoring her well except for inspecting her sweater cakes as he talked to gabe and theo look constable maybe we got off on the wrong foot wrong foot theos voice almost broke as upset as he appeared he appeared to be talking to the woman in the red sweaters breasts rather than to tucker case who was only a foot beyond them you threatened me he did said gabe angling for a better look down the red sweater thats harsh buddy theo just got thrown out of the house can you believe guys our age can still fall so hard tuck said to theo looking up from the cleavage to convey his sincerity he felt bad about blackmailing theo but much like helping lena hide the body sometimes certain unpleasantries needed to be done and being a pilot and a man of action he did them what are you talking about theo asked well lena and i have parted ways constable shortly after you and i spoke this morning really now theo looked up from the woolly mounds of intrigue really tuck said and im sorry things happened the way they did that doesnt really change anything does it would it make a difference if i told you that i absolutely did not harm this alleged dale pearson and neither did lena i dont think he was alleged said gabe slurring at the breasts im pretty sure he was confirmed dale pearson whatever said tuck would that change anything would you believe that theo didnt speak right away but appeared to be waiting for an answer from the decolletage oracle when he looked up at tuck again he said yeah i believe you tuck nearly aspirated the ginger ale he was drinking when he stopped sputtering he said wow you suck as a lawman theo you cant just believe a strange guy who tells you something in a bar tuck wasnt accustomed to being believed by anyone so to have someone take him at face value hey hey hey said gabe thats uncalled for well fuck you guys said the woman in the red sweater she jumped up from her stool and snatched her keys off the bar i am a person too you know and these are not speakerphones she said grabbing her breasts underneath and shaking them at the offenders her keys jingling cheerfully as she did completely defusing the effect of her anger oh my god said gabe you cant just ignore a person like that besides youre all too old and youre losers and id rather be alone on christmas than spend five minutes with any of you horn dogs and with that she threw some cash on the bar turned and stormed out of the bar because they were men theo tuck and gabe watched her ass as she walked away too old tuck said she was what twentyseven twentyeight yeah theo said late twenties maybe early thirties i didnt think we were ignoring her mavis sand took the money off the bar and shook her head you were all paying her proper attention womans got some issues when shes jealous of her own parts i was thinking about icebergs said gabe about how only ten percent of them show above the surface yet below lies the really dangerous part oh no i got the blues on me again his head hit the bar and bounced tuck looked to theo you want some help getting him to the car hes a very smart guy said theo he has a couple of phds okay do you want some help getting the doctor to the car theo was trying to get a shoulder under gabes arm but given that he was nearly a foot taller than his friend things werent working very well theo mavis barked dont be such a friggin wanker let the man help you after three unsuccessful attempts at hefting the bag of sand that was gabe fenton theo nodded to tuck they each took an arm and walkeddragged the biologist toward the back door if he hurls im aiming him at you theo said lena loved these shoes said tuck but you do what you feel like you need to i have no sex appeal a rumpapapum sang gabe fenton in spirit with the season my social skills are nil a rumpapapum did that actually rhyme asked tuck hes a bright guy said theo mavis creaked ahead of them and held the door so ill see you pathetic losers at the lonesome christmas party right they stopped looked at one another felt camaraderie in their collective loserdom and reluctantly nodded my lunch is coming up a rumpapapum sang gabe meanwhile the girls were running around the santa rosa chapel putting up decorations and preparing the table settings for a lonesome christmas lena marquez was making her third circumnavigation of the room with a stepladder some masking tape and rolls of green and red crepe paper the size of truck tires price club in san junipero only sold one size evidently so you could decorate your entire ocean liner without making two trips the act of serial festooning had taken lenas mind off her troubles but now the little chapel was starting to resemble nothing more than the nest of a colorblind ewok if someone didnt intervene soon the lonesome christmas guests would be in danger of being asphyxiated in a festive dungeon of holiday bondage fortunately as lena was moving the ladder to make her fourth round molly michon snaked a foot inside and pulled the chapels double doors open the wind from the growing storm swept in and tore the paper from the walls well fuck said lena the crepe paper swam in a vortex around the middle of the room then settled into a great wad under one of the buffet tables molly had set up to one side i told you a staple gun would work better than masking tape molly said she was holding three stainlesssteel pans of lasagna and still managed to get the oak double doors closed against the wind with her feet she was agile that way this is a historical landmark molly you cant just go shooting staples into the walls right like that matters after armageddon take these downstairs to the fridge molly said handing the pans to lena ill get you the staple gun out of my car what does that mean lena asked do you mean our relationships but molly had bounded back out through the double doors into the wind shed been making more and more cryptic comments like that lately like she was talking to someone in the room besides lena it was strange lena shrugged and headed back to the little room behind the altar and the steps that led downstairs lena didnt like going into the basement of the chapel it wasnt really a basement it was more of a cellar sandstone walls that smelled of damp earth a concrete floor that had been poured without a vapor barrier fifty years after the cellar had been dug and so seeped moisture and formed a fine slime on top in the winter even when the stove was cranked and an electric heater turned on it was never warm besides the old empty pews stored down there cast shadows that made her feel as if people were watching her mmmm lasagna said marty in the morning your drivetime dead guy in the am dudes and dudettes the little lady has certainly outdone herself this time get a whiff of that the graveyard was abuzz with moldy anticipation of the lonesome christmas party its highly inappropriate thats what it is said esther i suppose its better than that horrible mavis sand woman barbecuing again and how is it that shes still alive anyway shes older than i am than dirt you mean said jimmy antalvo whose faceprint was still embedded in a telephone pole on the pacific coast highway where hed hit it at age nineteen please child if you must be rude at least be original said malcolm cowley dont compound the tedium with cliche my wife used to put a layer of hot italian sausage between every layer of cheese and noodles said arthur tannbeau now that was some good eatin sort of explains the heart attack too doesnt it said bess leander being poisoned had left a bitter taste in her mouth that seven years of death could not wash away i thought we agreed not to talk about cod guilt said arthur didnt we agree on that cod was shorthand of the dead for cause of death we did agree said marty in the morning i do hope that they sing good king wenceslas said esther shut the fuck up about good king wenceslas would you no one knows the words to good king wenceslas no one ever has my my the new guy is cranky said warren talbot who had once been a painter of landscapes but after liver failure at seventy was fertilizing one well its gonna be a great party to listen to said marty in the morning did you hear the constables wife talking about armageddon shes definitely taking a cruise down the big nutty i am not shouted molly who had come down to the basement to help lena clear space in the two refrigerators for the salads and desserts that they had yet to unload who are you talking to said lena a little frightened at the outburst i think ive made my point said marty in the morning chapter the stupidest angels christmas miracle sundown christmas eve the rain was coming down so hard that there didnt appear to be any space between the drops just a wall of water moving almost horizontally on wind that was gusting to seventy miles per hour in the forest behind the santa rosa chapel the angel chewed his snickers and ran a wet hand over the tire tracks at the back of his neck thinking i really should have gotten more specific directions he was tempted to go find the child again and ask him exactly where santa claus was buried he realized now that somewhere in the woods behind the church wasnt telling him much to go back to get directions however would dilute somewhat the whole miraculousness of the miracle this was raziels first christmas miracle hed been passed over for the task for two thousand years but finally his turn had come up well actually the archangel michaels turn had come up and raziel ended up getting the job by losing in a card game michael had bet the planet venus against his assigned task of performing the christmas miracle this year venus although he wasnt really sure what he would have done with venus had he won it raziel knew he needed the second planet if for no other reason than that it was large and shiny he didnt like the whole abstract quality of the christmas miracle mission go to earth find a child who has made a christmas wish that can only be granted by divine intervention then you will be granted powers to grant that wish there were three parts shouldnt the job be given to three angels shouldnt there be a supervisor raziel wished he could trade this in for the destruction of a city that was so simple you found the city you killed all the people you leveled all the buildings even if you totally screwed it up you could track down the survivors in the hills and kill them with a sword which in truth raziel kind of enjoyed unless of course you destroyed the wrong city and hed only done that what twice cities in those days werent that big anyway enough people to fill a couple of goodsize walmarts tops now theres a mission thought the angel raziel go forth into the land and lay waste unto two goodsize walmarts slay until blood doth flow from all bargains and all the buildings are but rubble and pick up a few snickers bars for yourself a tree waving in the wind nearby snapped with the report of a cannon and the angel came out of his fantasy he needed to get this miracle done and be gone through the rain he could see that people were starting to arrive at the little church fighting their way through the wind and the rain the lights in the windows flickering even as the party was starting there was no going back the angel thought he would just have to wing it which considering he was an angel he really should have been better at he raised his arms to his sides and his black coat streamed out behind him on the wind revealing the tips of his wings folded underneath in his best pronouncement voice he called out the spell let he who lies here dead arise he sort of did a hand motion to cover pretty much the general area let he who does not live live again arise from your grave this christmas and live raziel looked at the halfeaten snickers he was holding and realized that maybe he should be more specific about what was supposed to happen come forth from the grave celebrate feast nothing nothing whatsoever happened there said the angel to himself he popped the last of the snickers bar into his mouth and wiped his hands on his coat the rain had subsided for a bit and he could see a ways into the woods nothing was happening i mean it he said in his big scary angel voice not a damn thing wet pine needles some wind trees whipping back and forth rain no miracle behold said the angel for i am really not kidding a great gust of wind came up at that second and another nearby pine snapped and fell missing the angel by only a few feet there its just going to take a little time he walked out of the woods and down worchester street into town wow im famished all of a sudden said marty in the morning all dead all the time i know said bess leander poisoned yet perky i feel really strange hungry and something else ive never felt this before oh my dear said esther the schoolteacher i can suddenly think of nothing but brains how bout you kid asked marty in the morning you thinking about brains yeah said jimmy antalvo i could eat for luck there is no chapter just this christmas photo album sometimes if you look closely at family snapshots you can see in the faces of the children portents of the adults they will become in the adults you can sometimes see the face behind the face not always but sometimes tucker case in this shot we see a welltodo california family posed in front of their lakeshore estate in elsinore california its an eightbyten color glossy embossed with the trademark of a professional photographers studio they are all tanned and healthylooking tucker case is perhaps ten years old dressed in a little sport coat with a yachting ensign on the breast pocket and little tasseled loafers he is standing in front of his mother who has the same blond hair and bright blue eyes the same smile that looks not as if she is presenting her dental work but as if she is just seconds from bursting out laughing three generations of cases brothers sisters uncles aunts and cousins look perfectly coiffed pressed washed and shined all are smiling except for one little girl down front who has an expression of abject horror on her face a closer look reveals the back of her red christmas dress is tossed up to one side and snaking in from the side from under his little blue sport coat is the hand of young tuck who has just stolen an incestuous squeeze of his cousin janeys elevenyearold bottom what is telling about this picture is not the surreptitious booty grope but the motive because here tucker case is at an age where he is much more interested in blowing stuff up than he is in sex yet he is precociously cognizant of just how much his advances will freak his cousin out this is his raison dêtre it should be noted that janey caserobbins will go on to distinguish herself as a successful litigator and advocate for womens rights while tucker case will go on to be a serially heartbroken horn dog with a fruit bat lena marquez the shot is taken in someones backyard on a sunny day there are children all around and its obvious that a big party is going on shes six wearing a fluffy pink dress and patentleather shoes she couldnt be any cuter with her long black hair tied up into ponytails with red ribbons and flying out behind her like silk comet tails as she pursues the piñata shes blindfolded and her mouth is wide open letting forth a burst of that high littlegirl laugh that sounds like joy itself because shes just made solid contact with the stick and shes sure that she has released candy and toys and noisemakers for all the children what she has in fact done has solidly smacked her uncle octavio in the cojones uncle octavio is caught in a magic moment of transition his face changing from joy to surprise to pain all at once lena is still adorable and sweet and unsullied by the disaster she has wrought feliz navidad molly michon its christmas morning postpresentopening storm tissue paper and ribbon are strewn around the floor and off to one side you can see a coffee table and on it an ashtray the size of a hubcap overflowing with butts and an empty bottle of jim beam front and center is sixyearold molly achevski she would change her last name to michon at nineteen on the advice of an agent because it sounds fucking french people love that molly is wearing a red sequined ballerina outfit red galoshes that hit her bare legs about midcalf and a giant cheeky grin with a hole in the middle where her front teeth used to be she has one foot propped up on a large tonka dump truck as if she has just conquered it in a grudge match and her younger brother mike four is trying to pry the truck out from under her tears are streaming down his cheeks mollys other brother tony five is looking up to his sister like she is the princess of all things good she has already poured him a bowl of lucky charms this morning as she does for both her brothers every morning in the background we see a woman in a bathrobe lying on the couch one hand hanging to the floor holding a cigarette that has burned itself out hours before the silvery ash has left a streak on the carpet no one has any idea who took this picture dale pearson this one was taken only a few years ago when dale was still married to lena its the caribou lodge christmas party and dale is once again dressed as santa sitting on a makeshift throne he is surrounded by drunken revelers all laughing all holding the various joke gifts that dale has passed out to them earlier that night dale is brandishing his own present a fourteeninchlong rubber penis as big around as a soup can hes waving it at lena with a leer and she dressed in a black cocktail dress and a single string of pearls looks quite horrified at what hes saying which is well put this rascal to good use later tonight huh baby the irony of it is that later that night he will don one of his vintage german ss uniforms everything but the jodhpurs anyway and what he asks lena to do with his new present is exactly what she told him he could do with it at the party she will never know if it was she who gave him the idea but it will be a milestone in her move toward divorce proceedings theophilus crowe at thirteen theo crowe is already six feet four inches tall and weighs a little over a hundred pounds it is a classic scene of the three kings following the star the seventhgrade music class is performing amahl and the night visitors originally cast as one of the three kings theo is now dressed as a camel his ears are the only parts of his body that are in proportion and he looks very much like a camel fashioned out of wire by salvador dalí his chance to play balthazar the ethiopian king was lost when he announced that the magi had arrived bearing gold frankenstein and myrrh later he the two other camels and a sheep will be suspended for smoking the myrrh they would have never been caught had the sheep not suggested that they play a quick game of kill the man with the baby jesus out behind the theater evidently the myrrh was prime smokage gabe fenton this one was taken just last year at the lighthouse where gabe has his cabin you can see the lighthouse in the background and windblown whitecaps out to sea you can tell its a windy day because the santa hat that gabe is wearing is streaming out to the side and hes holding the reindeer antlers on skinners head crouched next to them in a thousanddollar st john knit red and cut in the style of a napoleonic soldier with brass buttons and gold braid on the shoulders is dr valerie riordan her auburn hair is styled to curl behind her ears and accentuate her diamond hoop earrings shes done up in headline news prompter puppet makeup as if her face has been completely sanded off and then painted back on by a crack team of specialeffects people brighter better faster than a real human face shes trying really trying to smile for the camera she is holding her hair in one hand and appears to be petting skinner but is upon closer examination holding him at bay a racing stripe across the knee of her nylons betrays an earlier attempt by skinner to share a holiday leg hump with the food guys female gabe is scruffy in khakis and hiking boots theres a fine coating of sand on his pants and boots from where he was sitting astride elephant seals that morning gluing satellitetracking devices on their backs he has a great hopeful smile and not a clue that anything might be wrong with this picture roberto t fruitbat this picture was taken on the island of guam robertos birthplace there are palm trees in the foreground you can tell hes just a young fellow because he has not yet acquired a pair of raybans nor a master to bring him mangoes on demand hes curled up in a christmas wreath made from palm fronds and decorated with little papayas and red palm nuts he is licking papaya pulp from his little doggy face the children who found him in the wreath that christmas morning are posed on either side of the door where the wreath hangs they are both girls and have the long curly brown hair of their chamorro mother the green eyes of their irishcatholic father who is an american airman father is taking the picture the girls are in bright floral mission dresses with puffy sleeves later after church they will try to coax roberto into a box so they can later cook him and serve him with saimen noodles although he escapes the incident traumatizes the young bat and he does not speak for years chapter the camaraderie of the lonesome christmas theo wore his cop shirt to the lonesome christmas party not because he didnt have anything else to wear because there were still two clean flannels and a phish sweatshirt in the volvo that hed snagged from the cabin but because with the storm pounding the stuffing out of pine cove he felt as if he should be doing cop stuff his cop shirt had epaulets on the shoulders that are used for uh holding your paulets no for keeping your hat under for your parrot to stand on no that looked cool and military plus it had a little slot in the pocket where he could pin his badge and another one where he could stick a pen which could be really handy in a storm in case you wanted to take notes or something like pm still really fucking windy wow its really fucking windy theo said it was pm theo stood in the corner of the main room of the santa rosa chapel next to gabe fenton who was wearing one of his science shirts a khaki canvas utility shirt with many pockets slots buttons pouches epaulets zippers velcro loops snaps and vents so you could hopelessly lose everything you owned in it and essentially sand your nipples off while patting the pockets and saying i know i had it here somewhere yep gabe said it was gusting to a hundred and twenty when i left the lighthouse youre kidding a hundred and twenty miles per hour were all going to die theo said feeling suddenly better kilometers per hour gabe said stand in front of me shes looking he snagged theo by the epaulet aha and pulled him around to block the view from the other side of the room across the open hardwood floor valerie riordan in charcoal armani over red ferragamos was sipping a cranberry and soda from a plastic cup whys she here gabe whispered didnt she get a better offer from some country club or some business guy or something gabe said the word business like it was a putrid taste that he needed to spit out before it sickened him which was exactly how he meant it although gabe did not live in an ivory tower he did live next to one and it gave him a skewed perspective on commerce your eye is twitching really badly gabe are you okay i think its conditioning from the electrodes she looks so great dont you think theo looked over at gabes exgirlfriend considered the heels the stockings the makeup the hair the lines of her suit her nose her hips and felt like he was looking at a sports car that he could not afford would not know how to drive and he could only envision himself entangled in the wreckage of wrapped around a telephone pole her lipstick matches her shoes theo said by way of not really answering his friend that sort of thing didnt happen in pine cove well molly did have some black lipstick that matched a pair of black boots she had which she wore with nothing else but he really didnt want to think about that in fact this moment would only have any meaning at all when he shared it with molly which he realized he wasnt going to be doing which made him jealous of gabes twitch for a second the double doors to the chapel opened and wind whipped through the room rattling the few strands of crepe paper that still clung to the wall to this point and knocking a couple of ornaments off the giant christmas tree tucker case came in his bomber jacket dripping a little furry face sticking out through the v in the zipper in the front no dogs said mavis sand who was fighting to get the doors shut weve just let kids come the last couple of years and im not happy about it tuck grabbed the other door and pulled it shut then reached over mavis and caught the door she was battling hes not a dog mavis turned around and looked right into the face of roberto who made a little barking sound thats a dog not much of a goddamn dog ill give you that but a dog and hes wearing sunglasses so its dark moron get rid of the dog hes not a dog tuck said and to illustrate his point he unzipped his jacket took roberto by the feet and flung him at the ceiling the bat yelped opened his leathery wings and flew to the top of the christmas tree where he caught the star swung halfway around and settled upside down hanging there above the room looking despite his cheery nature and hot pink sunglasses a little creepy everyone in the place thirty or so people stopped whatever they were doing and looked lena marquez who had been cutting lasagna into squares over at the buffet table looked up made brief eye contact with tuck then looked away except for the boom box playing reggae christmas carols and the wind and rain thrashing outside there was not a sound what tuck said to everyone and no one in particular you people act like youve never seen a bat before looked like a dog mavis said from behind him you dont have a nobat policy then tuck said not turning around dont think so you got a great ass flyboy you know that yeah its a curse tuck said he eyed the ceiling for any mistletoe he might get trapped under spotted theo and gabe then made a beeline for the corner where they were hiding oh my god said tuck as he was approaching did you guys see lena shes so hot dont you think shes hot i miss her oh god not you too theo said that santa hat it does something to me that a pteropus tokudae asked gabe peeking out quickly from behind theo and nodding toward the christmas tree with the bat no thats roberto why are you hiding behind the constable my ex is here tuck looked over the redhead in the suit gabe nodded tuck looked at him back at val riordan who was now chatting with lena marquez then again at gabe whoa you were really crawling out of your gene pool huh let me shake your hand he reached around theo offering his hand to the biologist we dont like you you know theo said really tuck took his hand back he looked around theo at gabe really youre okay said gabe hes just cranky i am not cranky theo said but in fact he was a little cranky a little sad a little stoned a little out of sorts that this storm hadnt just blown over like hed hoped and a little excited that it might actually turn into a disaster secretly theophilus crowe loved a disaster understandable tuck said squeezing theos shoulder your wife was a biscuit is a biscuit corrected theo but then hey no its okay tuck said you were a lucky man gabe fenton reached up and squeezed theos other shoulder its true gabe said when molly isnt completely off her rocker she is a biscuit actually even when she is would you guys quit calling my wife a biscuit i dont even know what that means something we say in the islands tuck said what im saying is youve got nothing to be ashamed of you guys had a good run you cant expect her to lose her sense of judgment forever you know theo every now and then eraserhead will hook up with tinker bell or sling blade carl will marry lara croft that sort of thing gives us hope but you cant count on it you cant bet that way why guys like us would always be alone if some women didnt have a deepseated streak of selfdestruction isnt that right professor truth said gabe he made a sort of swearonthebible gesture theo glared at him eventually a woman will wise up tuck continued shes just gone off her meds whatever tuck said im just saying that its christmas and you should be grateful that you were ever able to fool someone into loving you in the first place im calling her theo said he pulled his cell phone from the pocket of his cop shirt and keyed the button for his home number is val wearing the pearl earrings gabe asked i bought her those diamonds studs said tuck checking over his shoulder dammit look at lena in that santa hat that woman has a talent with tinsel if you know what i mean no idea said gabe me either it just sounded kinky said tuck theo snapped the cell phone shut i hate both you guys do not said tuck no service asked gabe im going to see if the police radio in my car is working rain was pooling in the graveyard behind the chapel as the dead pulled one another from the muck this looked easier in the movies said jimmy antalvo who was waistdeep in a puddle and being pulled out by marty in the morning and the new guy in the red suit jimmys words were a little slurred and slurpy between the mud and a facial structure that was mostly morticians wax and wire i thought id never get out of that coffin kid youre better off than a couple weve pulled out said marty in the morning he nodded to a very feeble and mostly decomposed pile of animated meat that had at one time been an electrician the mushy thing made a moaning sound whos that asked jimmy the torrential rain had washed the mud out of his eyes thats alvin said marty all we can understand from him i used to talk to him all the time said jimmy its different now said the guy in the red suit now youre really talking not just thinking it his talking equipment is past warranty marty who had been portly in life but had slimmed down significantly since his death bent down and got a good grip on jimmys arm bending the elbow around his own then made a great straining lift to pull the kid out there was a loud pop and marty went over backward into the mud jimmy antalvo was waving around an empty leather jacket sleeve and yelling my arm my arm jeez they should have sewn that on better said marty holding the arm in the air even as the hand appeared to be doing a very jerky version of a parade wave this whole undead rigmarole is disgusting said esther the schoolteacher who was standing to the side with a few others who had already been dug up water was pouring off the shreds of her best church dress which had been reduced by time to calico tatters ill not have anything to do with it so youre not hungry said the new guy muddy rainwater streaming out of his santa beard hed been the first one out since he hadnt had to escape a coffin fine once we get the kid out well just push you back down your hole im not saying that said esther i would enjoy a snack something light mavis sand maybe that woman cant have enough brains to spread on a cracker then shut up and help us get everyone out nearby malcolm cowley was staring disapprovingly at one of the less articulate members of the undead who had been pulled from his grave and was showing lots of bare bone between the meat the dead book dealer was wringing out his tweed jacket and shaking his head at every comment suddenly we are all gluttons are we well i have always enjoyed danish modern furniture for its functional yet elegant design so once we have consumed the brains of these revelers i feel compelled to seek out one of these furniture boutiques i have heard so much about from newlyweds in the chapel first we feast then ikea ikea chanted the dead first we feast then ikea first we feast then ikea can i eat the constables wifes brain asked arthur tannbeau she sounds like shell be spicy get everyone out of the ground then we eat said the new guy who was used to telling people what to do who died and made you boss asked bess leander all of you answered dale pearson the man has a point said marty in the morning i think while you boys finish up here ill have a stroll around the parking lot oh my i dont seem to be walking very well said esther dragging one foot behind her and plowing a furrow in the mud as she moved but ikea does sound like a delightful aftersupper adventure no one knows why but second only to eating the brains of the living the dead love affordable prefab furniture across the parking lot theophilus crowe was busy having the water in his ears replaced with dog spit get down skinner theo pushed the big dog away and keyed the mike on the police radio he had been adjusting the squelch and the gain and getting little more than distant disembodied voices just a word here or there in the static the rain on the car was so loud that theo put his head down by the dash to better hear the little speaker and skinner of course took this as an invitation to lick more rain out of theos ears ack skinner theo grabbed the dog muzzle and steered it between the seats it wasnt the dampness or even the dog breath which was considerable it was the noise it was just too loud theo dug into the console between the seats and found half a slim jim in a folded over wrapper skinner inhaled the tiny meat stick and savored the greasy goodness by smacking his chops right next to theos ear theo snapped the radio off one of the problems with living in pine cove with the ubiquitous monterey pines was that after a few years the christmas trees stopped looking like christmas trees and started looking like giant upturned dust mops a great sail of needles and cones at the top of a long slender trunk and a pancake root system a tree especially adapted to fall over in high wind so when el niño cruised up the coast and storms like this came in first cell and cable tv repeater stations lost power soon the town lost its main power and finally phone lines would go down effectively cutting all communications theo had seen it before and he didnt like what it portended cypress street would be underwater before dawn and people would be kayaking through the realestate offices and art galleries by noon something hit the car theo turned on the headlights but the rain was coming down so hard and the windows were so fogged with dog breath that he could see nothing he assumed it was a small tree branch skinner barked deafeningly loud in the enclosed space he could go patrolling downtown but with mavis having closed the slug for christmas eve he couldnt imagine why anyone would be down there go home check on molly actually she was better equipped with her little fourwheeldrive honda to drive in this mess and she was smart enough to stay home in the first place he was trying not to take it personally that she hadnt come to the party trying not to take to heart the pilots words about not being worthy of a woman like her he looked down and there cradled in bubble wrap in the console was the artglass bong theo picked it up looked it over then pulled a film can of sticky green buds from his copshirt pocket and began loading the pipe theo was briefly blinded by the spark of the disposable lighter at the same time as something scraped against the car skinner jumped over into the front seat and barked at the window his hefty tail beating against theos face down boy down theo said but the big dog was now digging at the vinyl panel on the door knowing that it meant that hed have to deal with a lot of wet dog later but feeling that he really needed to get a buzz on in peace theo reached over and threw open the passenger door skinner bounded out the door the wind slammed it behind him there was a commotion outside but theo could see nothing and he figured that skinner was just frisking in the mud the constable lit the bong and lost himself in the scuba bubbles of sweet comforting smoke outside the car not ten feet away skinner was gleefully tearing the head off an undead schoolteacher her arms and legs were flailing and her mouth was moving but the retriever had already bitten through the better part of her decayed throat and was shaking her head back and forth in his jaws a skilled lipreader would have been able to tell you that esther was saying i was only going to eat a little of his brain this is entirely uncalled for young man i am so going to get baddogged for this skinner thought theo stepped out of the car into an ankledeep puddle despite the cold the wind the rain and the mud that had squished over the edge of his hiking boots theo sighed for he was sorely wistfully stoned and slipping into that comfortable place where everything including the rain was his fault and hed just have to live with it not a maudlin selfpity that might have come from irish whiskey nor an angry tequila blame nor a jittery speed paranoia just a little melancholy selfloathing and the realization of what a total loser he was skinner get over here come onboy back in the car theo could barely see skinner but the big dog was on his back rolling in something that looked like a pile of wet muddy laundry sort of snaking back and forth with his mouth open and his pink tongue whipping around in ecstatic dogasm probably a dead raccoon theo thought trying to blink some rain out of his eyes ive never been that happy i will never be that happy he left the dog to his joy and slogged back into the lonesome christmas he thought he felt a hand across his neck as he wrestled his way through the double doors then a loud moan when the doors slammed shut but it was probably just the wind it didnt feel like the wind had to be the wind chapter a momentary flash of molly by the purple horn of nigoth i command thee to boil screeched the warrior babe what good was a higher power after all if he wouldnt help you cook your ramen noodles molly stood over the stove naked except for a wide sash from which was slung the scabbard for her broadsword at the center of her back giving the impression that she had won honors in the miss nude random violence pageant her skin was slick with sweat not because shed been working out but because shed chopped up the coffee table with her broken broadsword and burned it along with two chairs from the diningroom set in the fireplace the cabin was sweltering the power hadnt gone out yet but it would soon and the warrior babe of the outland dropped into survival mode a little sooner than most people it was in her job description its christmas eve said the narrator shouldnt we eat something more festive eggnog how about sugar cookies in the shape of nigoth do you have purple sprinkles youll get nothing and like it you are but a soulless ghost that vexes me and stirs in my mind like spiders when my check arrives on the fifth you shall be banished to the abyss forever im just saying hacking up the coffee table screaming at the soup i think you could channel your energies in a more positive way something in the holiday spirit in a momentary flash of molly the warrior babe realized that there was a line she could cross when the narrator actually became the voice of reason as opposed to a niggling voice trying to get her to act out she turned the burner down to medium and went to the bedroom she pulled a stool over to the closet and climbed up on it so she could reach to the back shelf the problem with marrying a guy who was six foot six is you often find yourself scaling the counters to get to stuff that he placed there for convenience that and you needed a riding steam iron in order to press one of his shirts not that she did that very often but if you try to get a crease straight in a fortyinch sleeve once youre as likely as not to give up ironing altogether she was nuts already she didnt need help from trying to perform frustrating tasks after feeling around on the top shelf brushing over the spare holster for theos glock her hand closed on a velvetwrapped bundle she climbed down from the stool and took the long bundle to the couch where she sat down and slowly unwrapped it the scabbard was made of wood somehow it had been laminated with layers of black silk so that it appeared to drink the light out of the room the handle was wrapped in black silk cord and there was a cast bronze hand guard with a filigreed dragon design the ivory head of a dragon protruded from the pommel when she pulled the sword from the scabbard her breath caught in her throat she knew immediately that it was real it was ancient and it had to have been exorbitantly expensive it was the finest blade she had ever seen in person and a tashi not a katana theo knew she would want the longer heavier sword for working out that she would spend hours training with this valuable antique not lock it in a glass case to be looked at tears welled up in her eyes and the blade turned to a silver blur in her vision he had risked his freedom and his pride to buy her this to acknowledge that part of her that everyone else seemed to want to get rid of your soup is boiling over said the narrator you sentimental sissygirl and it was she could hear the hiss of the water hitting the hot burner molly leaped to her feet and looked around for a place to set the sword the coffee table had long since gone to ash in the fireplace she looked to the bookshelf under the front window and in that second there was a deafening snap as the trunk of a big pine gave way outside followed by lighter crackles and snaps as it took out branches and smaller trees on the way to the ground sparks lit up the night outside and the lights went out as the entire cabin shook with the impact of the tree hitting in the front yard molly could see the downed power lines out by the road arcing orange and blue through the night silhouetted in the window was a tall dark figure standing therejust looking at her although a lot of single people attended the lonesome christmas party was never supposed to have been a pickup scene an extension of the holiday musical chairs that went on at the head of the slug people did occasionally meet there become lovers mates but that wasnt the purpose originally it was just a gettogether for people who had no family or friends in the area with whom to spend christmas and who didnt want to spend it alone or in an alcoholinduced coma or both over the years it had become somewhat more an anticipated event that people actually chose to attend instead of more traditional gatherings with friends and family i cant imagine a more heinous horror show than spending the holidays with my family said tucker case as theo rejoined the group how about you theo there was another guy standing with tuck and gabe a balding blond guy who looked like an athlete gone to fat wearing a red star fleet command shirt and dress slacks theo recognized him as joshua barkers stepfathermoms boyfriendwhatever brian henderson brian theo said remembering the guys name at the last second and offering his hand how are you are emily and josh here uh yeah but not with me brian said we sort of had a fallingout tucker case stepped in he told the kid that there was no santa claus and that christmas was just a brilliant scheme cooked up by retailers to sell more stuff what else was it oh yeah that saint nicholas was originally famous because he brought back to life some children whod been dismembered and stuffed into a pickle jar the kids mom threw him out oh sorry theo said brian nodded we hadnt been getting along that well he sort of fits right in with us gabe said check out the cool shirt brian shrugged a little embarrassed its red i thought it would be christmasy now i feel ha gabe interrupted dont worry about it the guys in the red shirts never make it to the second commercial break he punched brian gently in the arm in a gesture of nerd solidarity well im going to run out to the car and grab another shirt said brian i feel silly i have all my clothes in the jetta everything i own really as brian walked toward the door theo suddenly remembered oh gabe i forgot skinner got out of the car hes rolling in something foul out there in the mud maybe you should go with brian and see if you can get him back in the car hes a water dog hell be fine he can stay out until the party is over maybe hell jump up on val with muddy paws oh i hope i hope i hope wow thats kinda bitter tuck said thats because im a bitter little man gabe said in my spare time i mean not all the time my work keeps me pretty busy brian had skulked away in his star trek shirt as he opened one side of the double doors the wind caught the door and whipped it back against the outside church wall with a gunshot report everyone turned to watch the big man shrug sheepishly and skinner muddy and wet to the core came trotting in carrying something in his jaws wow hes really tracking in a mess tuck said i never realized the perks of having a flying mammal as a pet before whats that hes carrying in his mouth asked theo probably a pinecone gabe said without looking then he looked or not there was a scream a long protracted one that started with valerie riordan and sort of passed through all the women near the buffet skinner had presented his prize to val dropped it on her foot in fact thinking that because she was standing near food and she was still the food guys female for who could think of food without thinking of the food guy she would therefore appreciate it and perhaps reward him she didnt grab him gabe yelled to val who looked up at him with the most articulate glare he had ever seen perhaps it was the weight of her m d that gave it eloquence but without a word it said you have got to be out of your fucking mind or not gabe said theo crossed the room and made a grab for skinners collar but at the last second the lab grabbed the arm threw a head fake then ducked out of theos reach the three men started to give chase and skinner frisked back and forth across the pine floor his head high and proud as a lippizaner stallion pausing occasionally to shake a spray of mud onto the horrified onlookers tell me its not moving shouted tuck trying to cut skinner off at the buffet table that hand is not moving just the kinetic energy of the dog moving through the arm said gabe having gone into a sort of wrestling stance he was used to catching animals in the wild and knew that you had to be nimble and keep your center of gravity low and use a lot of profanity goddammit skinner come here bad dog bad dog well there it was tragedy a thousand trips to the vet a grasseating nausea a flea you will never ever reach bad dog for the love of dog he was a bad dog skinner dropped his prize and assumed the tailtucked posture of absolute humility shame remorse and overt sadness he whimpered and ventured a look at the food guy a sideways glance pained but ready should another bd come his way but the food guy wasnt even looking at him no one was even looking at him everything was fine he was good were those sausages he smelled over by that table sausages are good that thing is moving tuck said no its not oh yes it is said gabe there was another series of screams this time a couple of manscreams among the women and children the hand was trying to crawl away dragging the arm along behind it how fresh does that have to be to do that tuck asked thats not fresh said joshua barker one of the few kids in the room hi josh said theo crowe i didnt see you come in you were out in your car hitting a bong when we got here josh said cheerfully merry christmas constable crowe kay theo said thinking fast or what seemed like it was fast theo took off his goretex cop coat and threw it over the twitching arm folks its okay i have a little confession to make i should have told you all before but i couldnt believe my own observations its time i was honest with you all theo had gotten very good at telling embarrassing things about himself at narcotics anonymous meetings and confession seemed to be coming even easier since he was a little baked a few days ago i ran into a man or what i thought was a man but was actually some kind of indestructible cybernetic robot i hit him doing about fifty in my volvo and he didnt even seem to notice the terminator asked mavis sand id fuck him dont ask me how he got here or what he really is i think weve all learned over the years that the sooner we accept the simple explanation for the unexplained the better chance we have of surviving a crisis anyway i think that this arm may be part of that machine bullshit came a shout from outside the front doors just then the doors flew open the wind whipped into the room carrying with it a horrid stench standing there framed in the cathedral doorway stood santa claus holding brian henderson in his red star trek shirt by the throat a group of dark figures were moving behind them moaning something about ikea as santa pressed a snubnose revolver to brians temple and pulled the trigger blood splattered across the front wall and santa threw the body back to marty in the morning who began to suck the brains out of dead brians exit wound merry christmas you doomed sons a bitches said santa chapter so so that sucked chapter he knows if youve been bad or good while she was horrified by what was going on in the doorway of the chapel with the gunfire and brainsucking and the threats lena marquez couldnt help but think oh this is so awkward both my exes are here dale was standing there in a santa suit mud and gore dripping onto the floor while he roared with anger and tucker case had immediately headed to the back of the room and dived under one of the folding buffet tables there was screaming and a lot of running but mostly people stood there paralyzed by the shock and tucker case of course was acting the consummate coward she was so ashamed you bitch dead dale pearson shouted pointing at her with the snubnose youre lunch he started across the open pine floor look out lena came a shout from behind her she turned just in time to sidestep as the buffet table behind her rose spilling chafing dishes full of lasagna onto the floor the alcohol burners beneath the pans spilled blue flame across the tabletops and onto the floor as tucker case stood up with the table in front of him and let out a war cry theo crowe saw what was happening and pulled an armload of people aside as tuck barreled through the room the tabletop in front of him toward the throng of undead dale pearson fired at the tabletop as it approached getting off three shots before tuck impacted with him crowe get the door get the door tuck shouted driving dale and his undead followers back out into the rain the blue alcohol flame climbed up dales white beard as well as spilling down tucks legs as he pushed out into the darkness theo loped across the room and reached outside to catch the edge of the door a onearmed corpse in a leather jacket ducked around the edge of tucks buffettable barrier and grabbed at theo who put a foot on the corpses chest and drove him back down the steps theo pulled the door shut then reached around and grabbed the other one he hesitated close the damned door tuck screamed his legs pumping losing momentum against the undead as he reached the bottom of the steps theo could see decayed hands clawing at tuck over the edge of the table a man whose lower jaw flapped on a slip of skin was screeching at the pilot and trying to drive his upper teeth into tucks hand the last thing theo saw as he pulled the door shut was tucker cases legs burning blue and steaming in the rain bring one of those tables over here theo shouted brace this door jam the table under the handles there was a second of peace just the sound of the wind and rain and emily barker who had just seen her exboyfriend shot and brainsucked sobbing what was that shouted ignacio nuñez a rotund hispanic who owned the village nursery what in the hell was that lena marquez had instinctively gone to emily barker and knelt with her arm around the bereft woman she looked to theo tucker is out there hes out there theo crowe realized that everyone was looking at him he was having trouble catching his breath and he could feel his pulse pounding in his ears he really wanted to look to someone else for the answers but as he scanned the room some forty terrified faces he saw all the responsibility reflected back to him oh fuck he said his hand falling to his hip where his holster was usually clipped its on the table at my house gabe fenton said gabe was holding the buffet table that was braced sideways under the double latches of the church doors pull the table theo said thinking i dont even like the guy he helped gabe pull the table aside and crouched in a sprinters stance ready to go as gabe manned the latches close it behind me when you hear me scream let me in well just then there was a crash behind them and something came flying through one of the high stainedglass windows throwing glass out into the middle of the room tucker case wet charred and covered with blood pushed himself up from the floor where he had landed and said i dont know who parked under that window but youd better move your car because if those things climb on it theyll be coming through that window behind me theo looked at the line of stainedglass windows running down the sides of the chapel eight on each side each about eight feet off the ground and about two feet across when the chapel had been built stained glass was at a premium and the community poor thus the small high windows which were going to be an asset in defending this place there was only one large window in the whole building behind where the altar used to stand but where now stood mollys thirtyfoot christmas tree a sixbytenfoot large cathedralshaped stainedglass depiction of saint rose patron saint of interior decorators presenting a throw pillow to the blessed virgin nacho theo barked to ignacio nuñez see if you can find something in the basement to board up that window as if on cue two muddy decaying faces appeared at the opening through which tuck had just dived moaning and trying to get purchase on the windowsill with their skeletal hands to climb in shoot them tuck screamed from the floor shoot those fucking things theo theo shrugged shook his head no gun something flashed by theo and he spun to see gabe fenton running hellbentforleather at the window holding before him a long stainlesssteel pan full of lasagna evidently intent upon diving through the window in a pastafarian act of selfsacrifice theo caught the biologist by the collar stopping him like a running dog at the end of his leash his arms and legs flew out before him and he managed to hang on to the pan but nearly eight pounds of steaming cheesy goodness sailed on through the window scorching the attackers and pollocking the wall around the window with red sauce thats it throw snacks at them thatll slow them up shouted tuck fire a salvo of garlic bread next gabe regained his feet and jumped right up in theos face or he would have if he had been a foot or so taller i was trying to save us he said sternly to theos sternum before theo could answer ignacio nunez and ben miller a tall extrack star in his early thirties called for them to clear the way the two men were coming to the broken window with another of the buffet tables gabe and theo helped ben hold the table against the wall while nacho nailed the table to the wall i found some tools in the basement nacho said between hammer blows animated dead fingernails clawed at the tabletop as they worked i hate cheese screamed the corpse who had enough equipment to still scream it binds me up the rest of the undead mob began pounding on the walls around them i need to think theo said i just need a second to think lena was dressing tucker cases wounds with gauze and antibiotic ointment from the chapels firstaid kit the burns on his legs and torso were superficial most of the alcohol fire having been put out by the rain before it could penetrate his clothing and while his leather bomber jacket had protected him somewhat from his dive through the window there was a deep cut on his forehead and another on his thigh one of the bullets that dale had fired through the table had grazed tucks ribs leaving a gash four inches long and a half inch wide that was the bravest thing ive ever seen lena said you know im a pilot said tuck like he did this sort of thing every day i couldnt let them hurt you really lena said pausing for a moment to look into his eyes im sorry i was you were actually you probably couldnt tell but that thing with the table just a really badly executed escape attempt tuck winced as she fastened the bandage over his ribs with some tape youre going to need stitches lena said any place i missed tuck held up his right hand there were tooth marks on the back of it welling up with blood oh my god lena said youre going to have to cut his head off said joshua barker who was standing by watching whose tuck said the guy in the santa suit right no i mean your head said josh theyre going to have to cut off your head or youll turn into one of them most everyone in the chapel had stopped what they were doing and gathered around tuck and lena seemingly grateful for a point of focus the pounding on the walls had ceased and with the exception of the occasional rattling of the door handles there was only the sound of the wind and rain the lonesome christmas crowd was stunned go away kid said tuck this is no time to be a kid what should we use asked mavis sand this okay kid she held a serrated knife that theyd been using to cut garlic bread that is not acceptable tuck said if you dont cut his head off said joshua hell turn into one of them and let them in what an imagination this kid has said tuck flashing a grin from face to face looking for an ally its christmas ah christmas the time when all good people go about not decapitating each other theo crowe came out of the back room where hed been looking for something they could use as a weapon phone lines are down well lose power any minute is anyones cell phone working no one answered they were all looking at tuck and lena were going to cut off his head theo mavis said holding out the bread knife handle first since youre the law i think you should do it no no no no no no said tuck and furthermore no no said lena in support of her man you guys have something you want to tell me theo said he took the bread knife from mavis and shoved it down the back of his belt i think you were onto something with that killerrobot thing tuck said lena stood up and put herself between theo and tuck it was an accident theo i was digging christmas trees like i do every year and dale came by drunk and angry im not sure how it happened one minute he was going to shoot me and the next the shovel was sticking out of his neck tucker didnt have anything to do with it he just happened along and was trying to help theo looked at tuck so you buried him with his gun tuck climbed painfully to his feet and stood behind lena i was supposed to see this coming i was supposed to anticipate that he might come back from the grave all angry and brain hungry so i should hide his gun from him this is your town constable you explain it usually when you bury a body they dont come back and try to eat your brains the next day brains brains brains chanted the undead from outside the chapel the pounding on the walls started again shut up screamed tucker case and to everyones amazement they did tuck grinned at theo so i fucked up ya think theo said how many you should cut his head off over the sink said joshua barker that way it wont make as big a mess without a word theo reached down and picked josh up by the biceps then walked over and handed him to his mother who looked as if she were going into the first stages of shock theo touched his finger to joshs lips in a shush gesture theo looked more serious more intimidating more in control than anyone had ever seen him the boy hid his face in his mothers breasts theo turned to tuck how many theo repeated i saw maybe thirty forty about that tuck said theyre in different states of decay some of them just look like theres little more than bone others look relatively fresh and pretty well preserved none of them seems particularly fast or strong dale maybe some of the fresher ones its like theyre learning to walk again or something there was a loud snap from outside and everyone jumped one woman literally leaping into a mans arms with a shriek they all fell into a crouch listening to a tree falling through branches expecting the trunk to come crashing through the ceiling beams the lights went out and the whole church shook with the impact of the big pine hitting the forest floor without missing a beat theo snapped on a flashlight hed had in his back pocket in anticipation of a power outage small emergency lamps ignited above the front door casting everyone in a deepshadowed directional light those should last about an hour theo said there should be some flashlights in the basement too go on what else did you see tuck well theyre pissed off and theyre hungry i was kind of busy trying not to get my brains eaten they seemed pretty adamant about the braineating thing then theyre going to ikea i guess this is ridiculous said val riordan the elegantly coiffed psychiatrist speaking up for the first time since the whole thing had started theres no such thing as a zombie i dont know what you think is happening here but you dont have a crowd of braineating zombies id have to agree with val gabe fenton said stepping up beside her theres no scientific basis for zombieism except for some experiments in the caribbean with blowfish toxins that put people in a state of near death with almost imperceptible respiration and pulse but there was no actual you know raising of the dead yeah said theo giving them an eloquent deadpan stare brains he shouted brains brains brains came the responding chant from outside the pounding on the walls resumed shut up tuck shouted the dead did theo looked at val and gabe and raised an eyebrow well okay gabe said we may need more data no this cant be happening said valerie riordan this is impossible dr val theo said we know whats happening here we dont know why and we dont know how but we havent lived in a vacuum all our lives have we in this case denial aint just a river in egypt denial will kill you just then a brick came crashing through one of the windows and thumped into the middle of the chapel floor two clawlike hands caught the window ledge and a beatup male face appeared at the window the zombie pulled up enough so that he could hook one elbow inside the window then shouted val riordan went down on the pimply kid who bags groceries at the thriftymart a second later ben miller picked up the brick and hurled it back through the window taking out the zombie face with a sickening squish as ben and theo lifted the last of the buffet tables into place to be nailed over the window gabe fenton stepped away from valerie riordan and looked at her like shed been dipped in radioactive marmot spittle you said you were allergic we were almost broken up at the time said val almost almost i have thirddegree electrical burns on my scrotum because of you across the room into lena marquezs ear tucker case whispered i dont feel so bad about hiding the body now how bout you she turned and kissed him hard enough to make him forget for a second that hed just been shot set on fire beaten up and bitten for years the dead had listened and the dead knew they knew who was cheating with whom who was stealing what and where the bodies were hidden as it were besides the passive listening those sneaking out for a smoke sideline conversations at funerals the walking and talking in the woods and the sex and scareyourself activities some of the living indulged in in the graveyard there were also those among the living who used a tombstone as some sort of confessional sharing their deepest secrets with someone who they thought could never talk saying things they could never say in life there were some things that people thought no one else the living or the dead could possibly know but they did gabe fenton watches squirrel porn screeched bess leander her dead cheek pressed against the wet clapboard siding of the chapel that is not porn thats my work gabe explained to his fellow partyers he doesnt wear pants squirrels doing it in slow motion pantsless just that one time besides you have to watch in slow motion gabe said theyre squirrels everyone turned their flashlights on something else like they really werent looking at gabe ignacio nuñez voted for carter came a call from outside the staunch republican nursery owner was caught like a deer in the flashlights as everyone looked at him i was only in this country a year id just become a citizen i didnt even speak english very well he said he wanted to help the poor i was poor theo crowe reached over and patted nachos shoulder ben miller used steroids in high school his gonads are the size of bbs that is not true exclaimed the track star my testicles are perfectly normal size yeah if you were seven inches tall said marty in the morning all dead all the time ben turned to theo weve got to do something about this the others in the room were looking from one to the other each with a look on his or her face that was much more horrified than when theyd been only facing the prospect of an undead mob eating their brains these zombies had secrets theo crowes wife thinks shes some kind of warrior mutant killer shouted a rotted woman who had once been a psych nurse at the county hospital everybody in the chapel sort of looked at one another and nodded shrugged let out a sigh of relief we knew that yelled mavis everybody knows that thats not news oh sorry said the dead nurse there was a pause then okay then wally beerbinder is addicted to painkillers wallys not here said mavis hes spending christmas with his daughter in la i got nothing said the nurse someone else go tucker case thinks his bat can talk shouted arthur tannbeau the dead citrus farmer who wants to sing christmas carols said tuck ill start deck the halls and so they sang loud enough to drown out the secrets of the undead they sang with great christmas spirit loud and offkey until the battering ram hit the front doors chapter your puny worm god weapons are useless against my superior christmas kung fu molly slipped out the back door of the cabin and around the outside wall until she could see the tall figure standing before her picture window the fallen wires had stopped sparking out by the street and the stars and moon barely cut through the darkness at all strangely enough she could clearly see the man by her front window because there was a faint glow shining around him radioactive molly thought he wore the long black duster favored by sand pirates why though would a desert marauder be out in a rainstorm she assumed the hasso no kamae stance back straight the sword held high and tilted back over her right shoulder the sword guard at mouth level her left foot forward she was three steps from delivering a deathblow to the intruder the sword balanced perfectly in her grip so perfectly that it seemed to weigh nothing at all she could feel the wet pine needles under her bare feet and wished that shed put on shoes before dashing out into the night the cold rain against her bare skin made her think that maybe a sweater would have been a good idea as well the glowing man looked toward the opposite corner of the cabin and molly made her move three soft steps and she stood behind him the edge of her blade lay across the side of his neck a quick pull and she would cut him to his vertebrae move and die molly said nuhuh said the glowing man the tip of mollys sword extended a foot beyond the strangers face he looked at the blade i like your sword want to see mine you move you die molly said thinking that it wasnt the sort of thing you should have to repeat who are you im raziel said raziel its not the sword of the lord or anything not for destroying cities just for fighting one or two enemies at a time or slicing cold cuts do you like salami molly didnt quite know how to proceed this glowing sand pirate seemed perfectly unafraid perfectly unconcerned in fact that she was holding a razorsharp blade against his carotid artery why are you looking in my window in the middle of the night because i cant see through the wooden part molly snapped her wrists back and smacked raziel in the side of the head with the flat of her blade ouch who are you and why are you here molly said she snapped her blade back to threaten another smack and in that instant raziel stepped away from her spun and drew a sword from the middle of his back molly hesitated just a second then approached and snapped her blade down this time in a real attack aimed at his shoulder raziel parried the blow and riposted molly swept his blade aside and came around with her blade for a cut to the left arm raziel got his sword around just in time to deflect her blade down his arm instead of across it the razorsharp tashi took a long swath of fabric from his coat as well as a thin slice of flesh down his forearm hey he said looking at his nowflapping sleeve there was no blood just a dark stripe where the flesh was gone he started hacking his sword describing an infinity pattern in the air before him as he drove molly back through the pine forest toward the road she quickstepped back parrying some blows dodging others stepping around trees kicking up wet pine straw as she moved she could only see her glowing attacker his sword shining now as well the darkness around her so complete that she moved only by memory and feel as she deflected one of the blows her heel caught on a root and she lost her balance she started to go over backward and spun as if to catch herself raziels momentum carried him forward his sword swinging for a target that a second before had been two feet higher and he ran right onto mollys blade she was bent over forward the blade extended back across her rib cage and through raziel extending another two feet out his back they were frozen there for a moment him bent over her back stuck together with her sword like two dogs who needed a bucket of water thrown on them from a crouch molly yanked the blade out then spun ready to deliver a coup de grace that would cut her enemy from collarbone to hip ouch said raziel looking at the hole in his solar plexus he threw his sword on the ground and prodded the wound with his fingers ouch he said again looking up at molly you dont thrust with that kind of sword youre not supposed to thrust with that kind of sword no fair youre supposed to die now molly said nuhuh said raziel you cant say nuhuh to death thats sloppy debating you poked me with your sword and cut my coat he held up his damaged arm well you came creeping around here in the middle of the night looking in my windows and you pulled a sword on me i was just showing it to you i dont even like it i want to get web slingers for my next mission mission what mission did nigoth send you he is no longer my higher power by the way this is not the kind of support i need fear not said raziel for i am a messenger of the lord come to bring a miracle for the nativity youre what fear not im not afraid you nitwit i just kicked your ass are you telling me youre an angel come to bring christmas joy to the child youre a christmas angel i bring tidings of great joy which shall be to all men well not really this time its just to one boy but i memorized that speech so i like to use it molly let her guard down the tip of her sword pointed at the ground now so the glowing stuff on you glory of the lord said the angel oh piss said molly she slapped herself in the forehead and i killed you nuhuh dont start with the nuhuh again should i call an ambulance or a priest or something im healing he held up his forearm and molly watched as the faintly glowing skin expanded to cover the wound why in the hell are you here i have a mission not here on earth here at my house were attracted to lunatics mollys first instinct was to take his head but on second thought she was standing in the middle of a pine forest in freezing rain and galeforce winds naked holding a sword and talking to an angel so he wasnt exactly announcing the advent she was a lunatic you want to come inside she said do you have hot chocolate with minimarshmallows said the warrior babe blessed are the minimarshmallows the angel said swooning a little come on then molly said as she walked away muttering i cant believe i killed a christmas angel yep you screwed the pooch on this one said the narrator nuhuh said the angel get that piano against the door theo yelled the bolts on the front door had completely splintered away and the masonite buffet table was flexing under the blows of whatever the undead were using for a battering ram the entire chapel shook with each impact robert and jenny masterson who owned brines bait tackle and fine wines started rolling the upright piano from its spot by the christmas tree both had been through some harrowing moments in pine coves history and they tended to keep their heads in an emergency anyone know how to lock these casters robert called well need to brace it just the same theo said he turned to ben miller and nacho nunez who seemed to have teamed up for the battle you guys look for more heavy stuff to brace the door where did they get a battering ram tucker case asked he was examining the big rubber coasters on the piano trying to figure out how to lock them half the forest has blown down tonight said lena monterey pines dont have a taproot they probably just found one that they could lift turn it on its back tuck said brace it against the table the ram hit the doors and they popped open six inches the table hooked under the heavy brass handles was bending and beginning to split three arms came through the opening half a face the eye drooling out of a rotted socket push tuck screamed they ran the piano up against the braced table slamming the doors on the protruding limbs the battering ram hit again popping the doors open driving the men back and rattling their teeth the undead arms pulled back from the gap tuck and robert shoved the piano against the door and it shut again jenny masterson threw her back against the piano and looked back at the onlookers twenty or so people who seemed too stunned or too scared to move dont just stand there you useless fucks help us brace this if they get in theyre going to eat your brains too five men pointed flashlights at each other in a me you us inspection then shrugged and ran to help push the piano nice pep talk said tuck his sneakers squeaking on the pine floor as he pushed thanks im good with the public jenny said waitress for twenty years oh yeah you waited on us at hps lena its our waitress from the other night nice to see you again jenny said lena just as the battering ram hit the door again knocking her to the floor i havent seen you at yoga class clear the way clear the way clear the way called theo he and nacho nuñez were coming across the floor from the back room carrying an eightfootlong oak pew behind them ben miller was wrestling a pew across the floor by himself several of the men who were holding the barricade broke ranks to help him cantilever these against the piano and nail them to the floor theo said the heavy benches went up on a diagonal against the back of the piano and nacho nuñez toenailed them to the floor the benches flexed a little with each blow of the battering ram but they held fast after a few seconds the pounding stopped again there was only the noise of the wind and the rain everyone played flashlights around the room waiting for whatever would come next then they heard dale pearsons voice at the side of the chapel this way bring it this way back door someone shouted theyre carrying it around to the back door more pews theo yelled nail them up in the back hurry that doors not as heavy as the front it wont take two hits like that cant they just come through one of the walls asked val riordan who was trying to join in the effort to hold the line despite the handicap of her fivehundreddollar shoes im hoping that wont occur to them theo said supervising the undead was worse than dealing with a construction crew full of drunks and cokeheads at least his living crews had all of their limbs and most of their physical coordination this bunch was pretty floppy twenty of the undead were hefting a broken pinetree trunk a foot thick and as long as a car move the goddamn tree dale growled what am i paying you for is he paying us asked marty in the morning who was hefting at midtree on a jagged broken branch are we getting paid i cant believe you ate all the brains warren talbot the dead painter said that was supposed to be for everyone would you shut the fuck up and get the tree around to the back door dale yelled waving his snubnose revolver the gunpowder gave them a nice peppery flavor marty said dont rub it in said bess leander im so hungry there will be enough for everyone once we get inside said arthur tannbeau the citrus farmer dale could tell this wasnt going to work they were too feeble they couldnt get enough strength behind the battering ram the living would be barricading the back door even now he pulled some of the more decayed undead off the tree and pushed in those who seemed to have much of their normal strength but they were trying to run up a narrow set of stairs carrying a thousandpound tree trunk even a crew of healthy living people wouldnt be able to get purchase in this mud the tree trunk hit the door with an anemic thud the door flexed just enough to reveal that the living had reinforced it forget it forget it said dale there are other ways we can get to them fan out in the parking lot and start looking for keys in the ignition of peoples cars drivethru snackage said marty in the morning i like it something like that dale said kid you with the wax face youre a motorhead can you hotwire a car not with only one arm jimmy antalvo slurred that dog took my arm it stopped lena said she was checking tucks wounds blood was seeping through the bandages on his ribs theo turned away from the pilot and looked around the room the emergency lighting was starting to dim already and his flashlight was panning them like he was looking for suspects no one left their keys in their car did they there were murmurs of denial and heads shaking val riordan had a perfectly painted eyebrow raised at him there was a question there even if it was unspoken because thats what id do theo said id get a car up to speed and crash it right through the wall that would be bad said gabe that parking lot had two inches of water and mud the last time i saw it tucker case said not every car is going to get up to speed in that look we need to get some help theo said someone has to go for help they wont get ten feet tuck said as soon as you open a door or break a window theyll be waiting what about the roof said josh barker shut up kid tuck said theres no way up to the roof are we going to cut off his head now said josh you have to sever the spinal column or they just keep coming look theo said playing his flashlight across the center of the ceiling there was a trapdoor up there painted over and latched but it was definitely there it leads to the old bell tower gabe fenton said no bell but it does open onto the roof theo nodded from the roof someone could tell where they all were before making his move that hatch is thirty feet up theres no way to get to it suddenly the high chirp of a barking bat came from above them a halfdozen flashlights swung around to spotlight roberto who was hanging upside down from the star atop the christmas tree mollys tree said lena it looks sturdy enough said gabe fenton ill go said ben miller im still in pretty good shape if i have to make a run for it i can right there that proves it said tuck an aside to lena no guy with tiny balls would volunteer for that see how the dead lie im driving an old tercel ben said i dont think you want me trying to make a run for help in that what we need is a hummer said gabe yeah or even a friendly hand job said tuck but thats later for now we need a fourwheel drive you really want to try this theo asked ben the athlete nodded ive got the best chance of getting out those i cant outrun ill just go through okay then said theo lets get that tree over to the middle of the room not so fast said tuck patting his bandages i dont care how fast micronads is santa still has two bullets in his gun chapter up on the rooftop click click click this is what its all been about thought ben miller as he climbed into the tiny bell tower atop the chapel it had taken ten minutes to saw through the paintedclosed seams of the hatch with the bread knife but finally hed made it thrown the latch and crawled from the top of the christmas tree into the bell tower there was just enough room to stand his feet on narrow ledges around the hatch thankfully the bell had been taken away a long time ago the bell tower was enclosed by louvered vents and the wind whistled through like there was nothing there at all he was pretty sure he could kick through the vents hundredyearold wood after all then make his way across the steep roof drop off whichever side looked safe and make it to the parking lot and the red explorer he was holding the keys for thirty miles south to the highwaypatrol post and help would be on the way all of the years after high school and college when he had continued to train all the hours of roadwork all the weights and swimming and highprotein diets it all came down to this moment keeping himself in shape all these years when no one really seemed to care would finally pay off anything out there that he couldnt outrun he could take out with a lowered shoulder hed played one season as a jayvee halfback in addition to his varsity track career you okay ben theo yelled from below yeah im ready he took a deep breath braced his back against one side of the bell tower then kicked at the louvered slats on the opposite side they broke away on the first kick and he was nearly launched out on the roof feetfirst he fought to get his balance turned around on his stomach and scooted backward out the opening onto the roof facedown he was looking down the length of the christmas tree at a dozen hopeful faces below hold tight ill be back soon with help he said then he pushed back until he was on his hands and knees on the peak of the roof cold wetness cutting everywhere he touched please bitch came a voice from right by bens ear he jumped sideways and started to slide down the roof something caught his sweater pulling him back then something hard and cold was pressed against his forehead the last thing he heard was santa saying pretty fucking tricky for a jock below in the chapel they heard the gunshot dale pearson held the dead track star by the back of the collar thinking eat now or save it for after the massacre below him on the ground the rest of the undead were begging for treats warren talbot the landscape painter had made his way halfway up the pinetree trunk that dale had used to climb up on the roof please please please please said warren im so hungry dale shrugged and let go of ben millers collar then gave the body a shove with his boot sending it sliding down the roof and off the side to the hungry mob warren looked behind him at where the body had fallen then at dale you bastard now ill never get any disgusting sucking sounds were rising from below yeah well the quick and the dead warren the quick and the dead the dead painter slid back down his tree and out of sight dale had some revenge to take he stuck his head inside the bell tower and looked down at the horrified faces below the wiry little biologist was climbing up the christmas tree toward the open hatch come on up screamed dale we havent even gotten to the main course dale spotted his exwife lena staring up and the blond guy who had charged them with the buffet table had his arm around her die slut dale let go of the edge of the bell tower and aimed the down the christmas tree at lena he saw her eyes go wide then something hit him in the face something furry and sharp claws cut into his cheeks and scratched at his eyes he grabbed for his attacker and in doing so lost his balance and fell backward he slid down the side of the roof and off the edge onto his feasting minions roberto tuck yelled get back in here hes gone said theo hes outside tuck started to climb up the christmas tree behind gabe ill get him let me come up and call him theo grabbed the pilot around the waist and pulled him back close and lock the hatch gabe no tuck said gabe fenton looked down briefly then his eyes went wide when he realized how high above the floor he was he quickly pushed the belltower hatch shut and latched it hell be okay said lena he got away gabe fenton backed down the christmas tree when he got to the lower branches he felt some hands at his waist steadying him down the last few steps when he hit the floor he turned around into valerie riordans arms he pushed away so as not to smudge her makeup she pulled him out of the branches of the tree gabe she said you know when i said you werent engaged in the real world yeah im sorry okay i just wanted you to know that in case our brains are eaten by zombies without me having a chance to say it that means a lot to me val can i kiss you no sweetheart i left my purse in the car and dont have any lipstick to touch up but we can knock out one last standup quickie in the basement before we die if youd like she smiled what about the kid at the thriftymart squirrel porn she raised a perfectly drawn eyebrow he took her by the hand yes i think id like that he said leading her to the back room and the stairs whats that smell theo crowe said remarkably glad to turn his attention away from gabe and val anybody smell that tell me thats not skinner was sniffing the air and whimpering what is that nacho nunez was following the smell to one of the barricaded windows its coming from over here gasoline said lena chapter winging it the angel had opened six envelopes of powdered hotchocolate mix and handpicked out all the minimarshmallows they trap them in these little prisons with the brown powder you must free them to put them in the cup the angel explained tearing open another packet pouring the contents into a bowl picking up the little marshmallows and dropping them into his mug kill him while hes counting the marshmallows said the narrator hes a mutant no angel could be that stupid kill him you crazy bitch hes the enemy nuhuh said raziel into his marshmallow foam molly looked at him over the rim of her mug by the candlelight in the kitchen he certainly was a striking fellow those sharp features the lineless face the hair and now the chocolatemarshmallow mustache not to mention the intermittent glowing in the dark which had been helpful when she was looking for some matches to light the candles you can hear the voice in my head she asked yes and in my head im not religious molly said under the table she held the tashi with her free hand its blade resting across her bare thighs oh me either said the angel i mean im not religious so why are you here lunatics were attracted to them it has something to do with the mechanics of faith i dont really understand it do you have any more he held up the empty cocoa envelope his mug was overflowing with melted marshmallow foam no thats the whole box so youre attracted to me because im loony and will believe anything yes i think so and because no one will believe you so theres no violation of faith right but you are attractive in other ways too added the angel quickly as if someone had suddenly smacked him in the head with a sock full of people skills i like your sword and those my breasts it wasnt the first time that someone had said that sort of thing to her but it was the first time it had come from a messenger of god yes zoe has those shes an archangel like me well not like me she has those uhhuh so there are female angels as well oh yes not always everyone was changed after you happened me man mankind women you before we were all one kind but then you happened and we were divided up and given parts some got those others got other things i dont know why so you have parts would you like to see wings molly asked she actually wouldnt mind seeing his wings if he had them no we all have those i mean my special parts would you like to see he stood and reached down the front of his pants it wasnt the first time shed had an offer like that but it was the first time it had come from a messenger of god no thats okay she grabbed his forearm and guided him back into his seat okay then i should go i have to check on the miracle and then go home the miracle a christmas miracle thats why im here oh look you have a scar on one of them he has the attention span of a hummingbird the narrator hissed put him out of his misery the angel was pointing to the jagged fiveinch scar above mollys left breast the one shed gotten when a stunt went wrong while filming mechanized death warrior babe vii the injury that had gotten her fired the scar that had ended her career as a bmovie action heroine does it hurt asked the angel not anymore molly said can i touch it wasnt the first time that someone had asked but well you know okay she said his fingers were long and fine his fingernails a little too long for a guy she thought but his touch was warm and radiated from her breast through her whole body when he pulled his hand away he said better she touched where he had touched it was smooth completely smooth the scar was gone the angel blurred in her vision as tears welled up in her eyes you complete shit bag of sentimental saccharine said the narrator thank you molly said with a hint of a sniffle i didnt know you could im good with weather said the angel idiot the narrator said i have to go now said raziel rising from his chair i have to go to the church to see if the miracle has worked molly led him through the living room to the front door she held the door for him even so the wind whipped his coat around him and she could see the white tips of his wings below she smiled laughing and crying at the same time bye the angel said he walked away into the woods as molly closed the door something dark flew through it the candles in the living room had blown out so all she could see was a shadow flying through the house disappearing into the kitchen she got the door shut and trod into the kitchen holding her sword at a low ready by the candlelight in the kitchen she could see the shadow over the kitchen window two eyes shining orange back there in the dark she picked up a candle from the table and moved toward the window until the shadow cast shadows of its own it was some kind of animal hanging from the shutter over the sink looking like a black towel with a little doggy face it didnt seem dangerous just well a little goofy well this is it i am getting back on my meds tomorrow if i have to borrow the money from lena not so fast said the narrator itll be so lonely in here when im gone and youll be back to wearing your normal clothes jeans and sweaters you cant want that ignoring the narrator molly approached the creature on the shutters until she was only two feet away and staring right into its eyes angels are one thing but i dont even know what in the hell you are little guy fruit bat said roberto he might be a spaniard said the narrator did you hear the accent im going out there theo crowe said finding a grip on the christmas tree he still has one bullet said tucker case they are going to torch the place ive got to get out there to do what you going to take their matches away lena took theo by the arm theo theyll never get a fire started in

the front doors nacho grab the hammer were going to have to pull the nails on the reinforcements whos driving an suv everyone but the children raised their hands it wont spark its wet said marty in the morning he was trying to coax fire out of a drenched disposable lighter the undead stood around him looking at the pile of gasolinesodden debris theyd piled against the side of the chapel i love barbecue said arthur tannbeau every sunday out at the ranch we used to only in california could one refer to a citrus farm as a ranch interrupted malcolm cowley as if you and the yahoos would all go out on horseback to round up the tangerines didnt anyone find a dry lighter or matches in any of the cars dale pearson said no one smokes anymore said bess leander disgusting filthy habit anyway said the woman who still has brain matter on her chin from that fellow in the sweater said malcolm bess smiled coyly most of her gums visible through her receded lips they were so tasty it was like hed never used them there was a chirp from the front of the chapel and all of them looked yellow lights flashed on one of the vehicles up there someones making a break for it screamed dale i thought i told you to keep an eye on the roof i did said the onearmed jimmy antalvo its dark i cant see shit as they rushed down the side of the chapel toward the front they saw a dark shadow slide off the side of the roof to the ground chapter avenging angel oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit theo thought he twisted his ankle when he hit the ground pain shot up his leg like liquid fire he fell and rolled onto his back in the mud hed pushed the remote button that unlocked the range rover too soon the vehicle had chirped and the lights had blinked alerting the undead hed made the jump blind and missed they were coming for him he pushed himself up and started hopping toward the range rover the car key ready in his right hand his flashlight lost behind him in the mud grab him you rotting fucks screamed dale pearson theo fell forward as his good foot slipped out from under him but he rolled back to his feet a bolt of pain shooting whitehot across his shin he caught himself on the back window of the black range rover snatching at the rear wiper for balance he risked a glance back toward his pursuers and heard a loud thump by his head followed by a deafening screech he turned just in time to see a skeletal woman sliding across the roof of the range rover leading with her teeth he ducked but not before he felt fingernails raking his neck teeth thumping into his scalp she rode him to the ground and he could feel a grating pain in his head as the zombie tried to bite through his skull his face was pushed into the mud his nostrils and mouth filled with water and amid a flashing whiteness of terror he thought im so sorry molly yuck thats hideous said bess leander spitting a couple of teeth on the back of theos head marty in the morning grabbed theo by the head and licked the teeth marks that bess had left thats horrible hes stoned im not eating stoned brains the undead moaned in disappointment get him up said dale theo inhaled a great spray of mud along with his first breath and he went into a coughing fit as the undead lifted him up and held him against the back window of the range rover someone wiped the mud out of his eyes and a stench that made him gag filled his nostrils he could see the dead but animated face of dale pearson only inches from his own the corpses foul breath overwhelmed him theo tried to twist away from the evil santa but decaying hands held his head fast hey hippie said dale he held theos flashlight down by his santa beard to illuminate his face from below there were two stripes of bloody drool running down either side of the beard youre not thinking that your potsmoking ways are going to save you are you dont he pulled a snubnose revolver out of the pocket of his red coat and shoved it under theos chin well have plenty to eat we can afford to waste you dale ripped open the velcro fasteners of theos jacket and started feeling around his waist no gun you suck as a lawman hippie he went to the pockets of theos cop shirt but this the one thing you can be depended on for dale held up theos lighter then reached in tore the whole pocket off the cop shirt and wrapped the dry fabric around the lighter marty try this keep it dry dale gave the lighter to a rotting guy with a wet ziggy stardust red mullet who slogged back to the pile of debris at the side of the chapel theo watched as marty in the morning bent over the pile of plywood pine branches twobyfours cardboard and the tornup body of ben miller the wind was still whipping the rain less intense now but even so the drops stung theos face when they hit dont light dont light dont light theo chanted in his head but then his hope drained away when he saw the orange flame catch on the debris and marty in the morning pull away with his sleeve on fire dale pearson stepped aside so theo could see the fire whipping up the side of the building then put the against theos temple take a good look at our little barbecue fire hippie its the last thing youre going to see were gonna eat your crazy wifes brains charbroiled theo smiled happy that molly wasnt inside wouldnt be part of the massacre i didnt hear shave and a haircut said ignacio nunez did you hear shave and a haircut tuck panned his flashlight across a dozen frightened faces then one whole side of the chapel went orange with the light from the fire outside the windows one woman screamed others stared in horror as smoke started to snake in around the window frames change of plan tuck said we go now guys in front of your groups give the car keys to the next person back theyll be waiting for us said val riordan fine you burn up tuck said guys knock over whatever gets in your way everyone behind just keep going for the cars all the barricades and braces had been removed from the chapel doors tuck put his shoulder against one door gabe fenton was on the other ready one two three they threw their shoulders against the doors and bounced back into the others the doors had only opened a couple of inches someone shone a flashlight through the gap to reveal a huge pinetree trunk braced against one of the doors new plan shouted tuck theo tried to look at the fire but he couldnt see beyond the undead eyes of dale pearson thought had fled there was just fear and anger and the pressure of the gun barrel against his temple he heard a whooshing sound and a thump by his ear and the gun barrel was gone dale pearson was stepping away from him holding a dark stump where his gun hand had just been dale opened his mouth to shout something but in that second a thin line appeared across his face at nostril level and half of his head slid to the ground he slumped in a pile at theos feet the hands that were holding theo let go brains screamed one of the undead crazywoman brains theo fell on top of dales rekilled body then spun around to see what was happening hi honey molly said she stood on the roof of the range rover grinning wearing a leather jacket sweatpants and her red converse all stars holding the ancient japanese sword in hasso no kamae before her the blade gleaming orange in the light from the burning church there was a dark swath across the blade where it had hewn the head of the zombie santa theo had never been a religious man but he thought in that instant that this must be what it was like to look on the face of an avenging angel the zombies who had been holding theo reached for mollys legs and in a single motion she stepped back and brought the sword around in a low arc that sent a rain of severed hands flying into the mud the undead wailed around her and tried to claw their way onto the suv with their stumps bess leander tried to replicate the move she had used on theo stepping up the hood behind molly and diving across the roof of the range rover molly spun and sidestepped making a low swing with her sword that would have not looked out of place on a golf course besss head rolled off the top of the land rover into theos lap he pushed it aside and got to his feet honey you might want to go let everyone out of the chapel before they burn up said molly im not sure you want to watch this kay said theo the undead had left their stations at the front and back doors of the chapel where they had been waiting to ambush the escaping partyers and charged molly three fell headless while molly stood on the land rover but as they surrounded her she ran and leaped over the heads of the mob landing behind them theo ran for the front doors of the chapel his vision blurred from the rain and the blood running into his eyes from the bite wound on his head he looked back for a second and saw molly sailing over the top of her attackers he nearly ran into two great pine logs that had been braced against the chapel doors he looked back a second and caught a glimpse of molly mowing down two more zombies one split down the middle from the crown of his head to his sternum then he turned and tried to get his back under one of the logs theo is that you gabe fenton had his face pressed in an inchwide gap between the doors yeah there are logs against the doors theo said im going to try to move them theo took three deep breaths and lifted for all he was worth feeling as if veins would explode in his temples the wound on his head throbbed with every heartbeat but the tree trunk moved a couple of inches he could do this is it working yelled gabe yeah yeah said theo give me a second its filling up with smoke in here theo right theo strained again and the log moved another two inches to the right another foot and theyd be able to get the door open hurry theo said jenny masterson its she went into a coughing fit and couldnt finish what she was saying theo could hear everyone coughing inside wails of rage and pain were coming from the side of the chapel where molly was fighting she must be okay they were still yelling about eating her brain another lift another two inches gray smoke was streaming out the crack between the doors theo fell to his knees with the effort and almost passed out he shook himself back into consciousness and as he prepared to put his back into another effort hoping it wouldnt be his last he noticed that the screaming had stopped at the side of the chapel rain wind the coughing of the trapped and the crackle of the fire that was all he heard oh my god molly he screamed a hand on his cheek a voice at his ear hey sailor need a little hand getting your church door open if you know what i mean sirens sounded in the distance someone had seen the burning chapel through the storm and had somehow gotten through to the volunteer fire department the lonesome christmas survivors were gathered in the middle of the parking lot illuminated by headlights the heat from the fire had driven them nearly seventyfive yards to the street even this far away theo could feel the heat on his cheek from the fire as lena marquez bandaged his head others sat in the open hatchbacks of suvs trying to catch their breath after being exposed to the smoke drinking bottled water or just lying there dazed around the burning chapel the wet pine forest steamed a great white cloud rising into the sky down the left side of the chapel carnage a rekilling ground of the undead where molly had hacked them into submission even chasing down the last few in the woods and decapitating them after she and theo had let the partyers out of the chapel molly sat beside theo under the open hatchback of someones expedition how did you know he asked how could you possibly have known the bat told me molly said you mean he showed up and you said whats wrong boy is timmy trapped down a well and he barked to tell you thats what was wrong like that no molly said it was like your husband and a bunch of other people have barricaded themselves in the chapel against a horde of braineating zombies and you need to go save them like that he has some kind of accent sounds spanish i for one am glad that you went off your meds said tucker case who was standing next to lena as she bandaged theos head a few hallucinations are a small price to pay if you ask me molly held up her hand for him to be quiet she stood and brushed the pilot aside looking back toward the burning church a tall dark figure in a long coat was coming toward them through the killing field oh no said theo everyone get in the cars and lock them no molly said dismissing theos instructions with a distracted backward wave were okay she met the angel in the middle of the parking lot merry christmas said the angel yeah you too said molly have you seen the child joshua asked raziel theres a kid over there with the others said molly thats probably him take me to him thats him theo said thats the robot guy shhhhhh molly shushed raziel walked to where emily barker was holding her son joshua sitting on the back of mollys honda mom wailed joshua he hid his face in his mothers chest but emily was still stunned by witnessing her mates death and she didnt react at all except to hold the boy tighter raziel put his hand on the boys head fear not he said for i bring you tidings of great joy behold your christmas wish has been granted the angel waved toward the fire and the carnage and the exhausted and terrified survivors as if he were a gameshow hostess presenting a washerdryer set not what i would have wished for the angel said but i am but a lowly messenger josh rolled in his mothers arms and faced the angel i didnt ask for this this isnt what i wished for sure it is said raziel you wished that the santa you saw killed be brought back to life no i didnt thats what you said you said you wanted him brought back to life thats not what i meant said joshua im a kid i dont always get stuff right ill vouch for that said tucker case stepping up behind the angel he is a kid and he is wrong most of the time we still should cut your head off said josh see said tuck always wrong well if you didnt mean you wanted him brought back to life what did you mean asked raziel i didnt mean i wanted santa to be a zombie and kill big dumb brian and everything i wanted everything to be okay like it never happened so it would be a good christmas thats not what you said said raziel thats what i wanted said joshua oh said the angel sorry so hes an angel theo said to molly like a real angel molly nodded smiling not a killer robot molly shook her head hes here to grant a christmas wish to one child like it never happened the angel asked joshua yeah said josh oops said the angel molly stepped over and put her hand on the angels shoulder raziel you fucked up fix it the angel looked at her and grinned perfect teeth if a little sharp so be it he said glory to god in the highest peace on earth goodwill toward men chapter a perfect lonesome christmas the archangel raziel hovered outside the santa rosa chapels big cathedral window looking through a small pane of pink glass that formed saint rosas cheek he smiled at his handiwork then beat his great wings and flew off to find some chocolate to sustain him on his trip home life is messy would that every puzzle piece fell into place every word was kind every accident happy but such is not the case life is messy people generally suck this year however the lonesome christmas party in pine cove was coming off with clarified joy an infectious goodwill and a general harmony of spirit that shone in the guests with a smooth high polish a nomess affair theo molly said can you grab the other lasagna pans out of the back she was carrying two of the long stainlesssteel pans herself and she was careful to bend at the knees as she set them down on the buffet table to keep the back of her short cocktail dress in the realm of decency it was a plunging neckline lbd little black dress shed borrowed from lena just for the party the first lowcut thing shed worn in years we could have barbecued after all theo said i told you fucksticks that the storm would turn south mavis sand growled as she sawed the end off a baguette like the moyl at a titanic bris some peoples goodwill shines differently than others molly set down her lasagna and turned around into the arms of her praying mantis of a husband whoa sailor warrior babes got work to do i just wanted to tell you theo said before everyone gets here that you look absolutely stunning molly brushed her hand across her neckline scars dont do that do they they dont just disappear overnight like that right doesnt matter to me theo said never mattered wait until you see what i got you for christmas molly kissed him on the chin i love you even if you have mutant tendencies now free me lena needs help with the salad no i dont said lena coming out of the back room carrying a huge salad bowl tucker case followed close behind with a stainless caddie of dressings oh theo lena said i hope you dont mind but dale is going to come by in his santa suit tonight i thought you guys were in combat theo said we were but he surprised me a couple of nights ago when i was stealing some of his christmas trees and was just losing his temper when tucker happened along and popped him in the nose tucker case grinned im a pilot were used to handling tense situations anyway lena continued dale was drunk he started crying getting maudlin talking about how he was having trouble with his new girlfriend saying how he hated that everyone saw him as the evil developer so i invited him here thought maybe if he could do something nice for the kids it would make him feel better no problem theo said im glad you two are getting along hey theo yelled joshua barker as he ran across the chapel floor toward them mom says santa will be at the party a quick appearance josh then he has to get on his route theo said he looked up to see emily barker and her boyfriendhusbandwhatever brian henderson coming across the room brian was wearing a red star fleet command shirt merry christmas theo emily said theo hugged emily and shook brians hand theo have you seen gabe fenton brian asked i wanted to show him the shirt i think hell get a kick out of it you know nerd solidarity he was here a little bit ago brian but then val riordan arrived and they were talking i havent seen them for a while maybe they went for a walk beautiful evening isnt it isnt it said molly coming to theos side he said he was good with weather

wenceslas said esther the schoolteacher i just love that song has anyone seen the biologists dreadful dog asked malcolm cowley the dead book dealer last year the beast urinated on my headstone three times he was sniffing around a minute ago said marty in the morning but he went inside when they started to bring the food out inside skinner was sitting under the christmas tree looking at the strangest creature hed ever seen it was hanging from the lower branches but it didnt look like a squirrel or smell like food in fact it had a face that looked like another dog skinner whimpered and sniffed the air if it was a dog where was its butt how could he say hello if he couldnt sniff its butt he took a tentative step back to study the thing what are you looking at said roberto authors
